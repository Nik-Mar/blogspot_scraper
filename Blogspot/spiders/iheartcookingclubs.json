I know many of you have been missing the presence of our wonderful co-host Kim of Stirring the Pot. As she posted on her blog back in July, (here) Kim's mom's cancer came back and the doctors said it was terminal. Kim has been focused on spending time with, and taking care of her mom these last several weeks and sadly this past Friday, her mom passed away. Kim got to be there with her and hold her hand, and she and her family are doing as OK as can be expected. As sad as they are, she is taking comfort that her mom is no longer in all the pain she was in. Kim will be back to blogging and back with us here when she's ready. Until then, we will be thinking of you Kim and sending you and your family much love and support.Since this is Potluck week, I'd like to suggest that we make it a Potluck in honor of Kim and her mom. Kim's mom was her biggest blogging fan and chief taster, so if you'd like to make a recipe or dish to show your support and love, I know she would appreciate it. When I lost my own mom two years ago, Kim did the same for me and it truly meant so much. If you'd like to take part, the usual Potluck guidelines apply--you can make any recipe from our current chef (Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall) or any recipe from one of our previous IHCC chefs listed below.

A sensual and lusty sauce with a pale lemon color it is delicious paired with eggs, veggies, and beef.Velouté- Veloute is a stock-based white sauce that can be made with the stock of chicken, fish or veal. The sauce is then thickened with a white roux. Very similar to a béchamel, except stock replaces the milk. It pairs well with with hearty chicken dishes, veggies, pastas, and some veal dishes.Tomato- A sauce made from tomatoes. Sometimes pureed tomatoes serve as a thickener and other times a roux is made to thicken the sauce.

(Themes for the first 5 weeks are on the sidebar!)Original photo from The Guardian His website sums up his cooking style so well, we had to share it:Author, columnist, diarist and broadcaster, he remains very much an amateur cook. Nigel is not a chef and has no restaurant or commercial connections. His food is understated, handcrafted home cooking that is easy to accomplish and without a trace of what he affectionately calls 'celebrity cheffery'. He is not fond of fussy food and prefers simple suppers made with care and thought. He believes that making something good to eat for your self or for others can lift the spirits in the way little else can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \"There is something quietly civilizing about sharing a meal with other people.

The resulting cheese has a delicious, delicate, citrusy/yoghurty tang, and the dried mint is the perfect complement to it.  Although there are a couple of days involved in making this, most of that time it's just taking care of itself in the fridge.  The actual effort you have to put in is about 5 to 10 minutes max, and results in a great store cupboard ingredient to have on hand.\"At Kahakai Kitchen, I used my yogurt cheese in Ottolenghi's Labneh with Olives, Pistachios & Oregano which was so darn delicious I think I am going to have to make it again this week. Topped with a mix of briny olives and toasted nuts and spread on crusty bread, it made for an easy and tasty appetizer.

{"title": "Harissa Round-up & August Optional Monthly Community Recipe", "date": "Thursday, August 1, 2013", "text": "July's Optional Monthly Community Recipe was Harrisa, the fiery chilli sauce that defines North African cooking.  In Tunisia, harissa takes the place of other seasonings, such as salt and pepper.  Used to season everything from grilled meats, fish, and roasted vegetables, to soups and stews, harissa is spicy and complex in flavour, but can be adjusted anywhere along the heat spectrum to suit your personal tastes.Just as every Middle Eastern housewife will have her own recipe for harissa, so our participants had a multitude of variations and uses for their harissa.  Let's see what they came up with.My co-host, Kim at Stirring the Pot, made Braised Eggs with Lamb, Tahini & Sumac.  Kim says, \"This is a very satisfying and eye-pleasing meal that can be served family-style for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\"  She goes on to say \"The harissa adds a really flavorful dose of heat to this recipe that is distinctive and so delicious. After tasting the harissa in this recipe I have grown to absolutely love it.  My jar of harissa is front and center in my refrigerator.  I've added the harissa to my standard meatloaf.  I've added it to eggs.  I added it to my spaghetti sauce.  Just this morning I added it to my breakfast burritos.  It's my new favorite condiment!  If you enjoy a very flavorful way to heat up your food then I encourage you to make a batch!\"  I could not agree more. Renia from The Development of Taste made her own hybrid version of harissa adapted from a couple of different recipes, and used it in Ottolenghi's Garlic Soup with Harissa.  She says \"it was sunny and delightful - just enough to start a meal the right way\", and suggests that a more substantial meal could be made of this soup with the addition of some vegetables or garbanzo beans.  Mmmm, yes please!My other co-host, Deb at Kahakai Kitchen, was on the same page and made Garlic Soup with Chickpeas and Harissa to give herself an immune-system boost after a bad cold and dose of laryngitis.  Deb says, \"This is a good one! The soup itself is full of flavor--sweet, herby and garlicky and tasty on its own. Stir in the tangy yogurt and add the heat of the harissa paste and it becomes even better. The yogurt is optional--but adds extra flavor and texture.\"  She also suggests that the addition of chickpeas, or other beans, are a must to make this a particularly satisfying dish.Zosia at Are You Cooking? used her harissa in Shakshuka - the wonderful dish of eggs poached in a vibrant, spicy sauce of tomatoes, peppers, harissa and other spices.  Zosia says of her harissa, \"It's garlicky and spicy and very versatile; I've used it as a marinade for chicken and shrimp, spiced up some pasta sauce with it and used it in place of ketchup on burgers. Delicious!\"  She goes on to say that her Shakshuka \"was spicy, tomatoe-y and a little sweet with richness provided by the egg yolks. It was a quick and delicious any-time-of-day meal that will be repeated often.\"  A sentiment shared by all of us who made this dish when it was our Optional Monthly Community Recipe back in April.Joyce at Kitchen Flavours made Scrambled Eggs with Potatoes, Preserved Lemons and Harissa.  Although Joyce was a little disappointed with her dish as she wasn't able to get the spicy Merguez sausages called for in the original recipe, she found \"There's a hint of spiciness from the Harissa paste, and a mild spice fragrance from the caraway seeds. The preserved lemons adds a nice interesting bite.\"  Although I'm not normally a scrambled egg lover, the thought of all these flavours spicing up those eggs really excites me.Just like last month, Kim and I were once again on the same page.  Over at Couscous & Consciousness, I too made the Braised Eggs with Lamb, Tahini & Sumac, using both a red and a green harissa in my dish.  This dish was an absolute explosion of wonderful flavours and textures - soft, sweet lamb;  crunchy nuts;  sweet/salty hits of preserved lemon; a bit of heat from the harissa;  sweet, juicy tomatoes;  tangy, tahini-spiked yoghurt;  and oozy, gooey eggs.  I think this is my favourite Ottolenghi dish so far.August's Optional Monthly Community Recipe is LabnehPhoto courtesy of Zosia at Are You Cooking?Labneh is a strained yoghurt cheese, made by simply doing just that - straining yoghurt through a muslin cloth, fine strainer, or even paper filter - to remove the whey.  The resulting \"cheese\" is often served in the Middle East as part of a selection of mezze.  The strained cheese can be used as a spread on toast or in sandwiches, or rolled into balls and rolled in a variety of herbs, and crumbled into salads.If you would like to participate in this month's Optional Monthly Community Recipe then go ahead and make Ottolenghi's version of labneh (there is a recipe in his book, Jersualem).  If you don't have the book, then feel free to leave a comment below (including your email address) and we will send you the recipe/instructions. Make and post your labneh, with the added challenge of using it in a recipe, on or by August 31st.  Labneh would fit nicely into this week's theme, which is Mezze Madness, but you can also post your labneh in place of any weekly theme during the month.Please note, there will be no linky with this post - simply link to any current weekly theme post during the month."},

{"title": "Hummus Roundup and July's Optional Monthly Community Recipe!", "date": "Monday, July 1, 2013", "text": "June's Optional Monthly Community Recipe was hummus.  There were several hummus recipes to chose from.  Together we made quite a variety.  Let's take a peek!Joanne of Eats Well with Others made Hummus with Ful.  According to Joanne this recipe is, \"The hummus to end all hummus.\"  Joanne's hummus is heavy on tahini, a paste made from sesame seeds, and topped with a ful (a fava bean mixture with cumin, lemon, and garlic).  I love that Joanne's version of hummus has double the beans!  Makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Zosia of Are You Cooking? found a treasure trove of dried beans in her pantry so she tried her hand at Ottolenghi's  Basic Hummus.  Zosia says \" It was unbelievably smooth and the perfect consistency to use as a dip or spread. And the flavour.....so much better than anything I'd ever bought. I served it with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of sumac. Loved it!\"  I really love the touch of sumac on top of Zosia's hummus.  It adds such a pretty colorJoyce at Kitchen Flavours made Ottolenghi's Perfect Hummus.  Joyce, who has always wanted to make hummus, says \" Now I can understand what the fuss is all about in bloggerland about Hummus, this is darn right delicious! And so, easy peasy to make! I love it! I ate these delicious Hummus with some wholemeal tortilla wraps which I toasted till crispy, yummy! We are so glad you were able to participate, Joyce! My co-host Deb, of Kahakai Kitchen, made  Butter Bean Purée with Dukkah & Egg. Deb's version of hummus is unique in that it was made with butter beans.  Deb says, \"Butter also describes the texture of this hummus-like purée--it's smooth and silky in a way that most chickpea hummus isn't.\" Deb's butter bean puree is finished with a really unique topping called dukkah (a tasty blend of nuts and seeds).  Makes me hungry just looking at it! My co-host Sue, of Couscous and Consciousness, made Hummus Kawarma (Lamb) with Lemon Sauce.  Sue says, \"Of course the hummus on its own is heavenly - still warm and velvety with more tahini than I would have imagined - but top that with the spicy lamb, lemon sauce, and buttered pine nuts, and you have, as Ottolenghi says, \"one of the most sensational things you can put in your mouth\".  Nothing else needed but a few warm pita breads and a simple salad.  Eat with your hands!!\" Sue has me craving this fantastic dish all over again!My co-host Sue and I were on the same delicious page this month.  Over in the Stirring the Pot kitchen I also made Hummus Kawarma (Lamb) with Lemon Sauce.  It was a real taste sensation!  Velvety cloud-like hummus with flavorful crispy chunks of lamb topped with a bright and refreshing lemon sauce and glorious buttered and toasted pine nuts.  Easily one of the best things you'll ever put in your mouth!July's Optional Monthly Community Recipe is Harissa!!!Harissa is a fiery chile sauce that defines North African cooking.  In Tunisia, harissa takes the place of other seasonings, such as salt and pepper.  Harissa is used to season everything from grilled meats, fish, roasted veggies, to soups and stews.   Harissa is meant to be hot and spicy, but you can adjust the flavor by adding as little or as many red chiles as you'd like.   Harissa is very easy to make and keeps for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.  You will find many uses for it.  If you would like to participate in this month's Optional Monthly Community Recipe then go ahead and make one of Ottolenghi's versions of harissa (there is a recipe in both Plenty and Jersualem).  Make and post your harissa, with the added challenge of using it in a recipe, on or by July 31st.  Harissa would fit nicely into this week's theme, which is Paint The Town Red, but you can also post your harissa in place of any weekly theme during the month.Please leave a comment below if you need a recipe for harissa and we will send it to you.

Great job with the challenge, Joyce!My lovely co-host and friend, Deb of Kahakai Kitchen, made Fish and Caper Patties with Burnt Eggplant and Lemon Pickle.  Deb's fish patties were made with a local mahi and served with a perfectly golden brown crust alongside some rather seductive burnt eggplant (Note: I have got to try that burnt eggplant).  Deb thought the quick pickled lemons added a sweet, strong, fragrant punch to the dish.  I imagine the lemons would be a perfect accompaniment to the fish! They say great minds think alike and I have to agree.  My equally lovely co-host and friend, Sue of Couscous & Consciousness, was on the same page with Deb this week.  She also made Ottolenghi's Fish and Caper Kebobs with Burnt Aubuergine and Quick Lemon Pickle.  After two such wonderful reviews I am convinced I need to try this dish!  Sue is a fan of both preserved lemons and the quick pickled lemons and found the quick pickled lemons incredibly moreish.  Sue loves the quick pickled lemons so much she has decided to make them a \"refrigerator staple\" so she will have them on hand for all sorts of dishes.  Over at Stirring the Pot, I made Ottolenghi's Fava Bean Burger (my favorite veggie burger to date) and topped the burger with two slices of the most unique pickle I've ever had, pickled lemons.  I thought the spices in the quick pickled lemons really paired nicely with the burger.  The lemons added a spicy refreshing quality to the burger.  I'm eager to try the lemons in future recipes!

{"title": "Monthly Community Recipe: Shakshuka ", "date": "Friday, May 3, 2013", "text": "Here at I Heart Cooking Clubs we believe that cooking and sharing the same recipe is a very fun and exciting way to build our cooking community and share our kitchen adventures while learning a little bit more about each other. It is with this in mind that we created the Optional Monthly Community Recipe. This is our way of getting in the kitchen with you and sharing in the fun.  We encourage you to let your personality shine by adding your own personal touch to the dish.  Feel free to shake things up a bit!     Yotam Ottolenghi's vibrant and inviting Shakshuka is our very first Optional Monthly Community Recipe. In case you're wondering, Shakshuka is a beautifully presented breakfast or brunch dish that can be served family-style or individually.  It is essentially a sauce made from bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and spices. After the sauce has been cooked down and reaches the right consistency the eggs are nestled in and poached right in the sauce.  This makes for a very welcoming dish. It was very interesting to read about all the similarities and differences between each participant's dish.  One thing we all had in common was reducing the olive oil.  The recipe called for a hefty dose (3/4 cup) olive oil and we all felt that was an excessive amount. We all agree that the oil can be reduced by half.  Another common theme was to replace the spicy heat of the cayenne with other forms of heat (such as Mexican chile powder, harissa, and in some cases even doubling the spices).  So, if you like things nice and spicy, go ahead and spice this one up with your favorite form of heat!  And lastly, Sue's version of Shakshuka showcases the differences best of all.  Sue took the basic concept of the Shakshuka and turned it up a notch.  She used Ottolenghi's recipe as a base and added all her own flavors.  After reading about Sue's version I think the rest of us are filled with ideas for creating our own personal Shakshuka.Joyce from Kitchen Flavours shared her Shakshuka with her son and says they loved it so much they finished all of it! Joyce followed Ottolenghi's recipe rather closely but she did make a few adjustments of her own.  She substituted Mexican Chile Powder in place of cayenne, reduced the oil (a very common theme among our group), and omitted the water because she felt her tomatoes produced plenty of juice. If Joyce makes the dish again she would consider omitting the saffron, but only because she was unable to taste it's flavor in the final dish. We don't blame you, Joyce!  Saffron is like liquid gold.Sue, of Couscous & Consciousness, is no stranger to Ottolenghi's Shakshuka.  Sue discovered shakshuka awhile back when she first received her copy of Ottolenghi's Plenty. It was love at first bite and has been a regular staple in her home ever since. In fact, she's made the shakshuka so many times that her cookbook automatically opens up to the recipe.  I'd say that's definitely a sign of a well-loved recipe!  Sue added a lot of personal touches to her shakshuka.  She favors the look of a vibrant red base so she uses only red bell peppers (no yellow).  She also added chorizo (brilliant) and pomegranate molasses, omitted the onions, and substituted harissa for the cayenne pepper. I know our readers will enjoy the changes she made. Thanks for sharing your experience with this dish, Sue!Deb, my flavor-loving friend from Kahakai Kitchen, made a half batch of Ottolenghi's Shakshuka but accidentally added the full amount of spices.  This little kitchen mishap actually worked in Deb's favor because she is a fan of big, bold, intense flavors.  Deb enjoyed all the layers of flavor in her spiced up version and would definitely make shakshuka again. It's also worth noting that Deb decreased the oil by more than half.  The original recipe calls for quite a bit of oil (about 3/4 cup) so this is a huge improvement! Over at Stirring the Pot I shared my version of Ottolenghi's Shakshuka and was very impressed.  I think this would be a wonderful dish to entertain with since the dish presents so well. I made two small changes to the recipe. The first thing I did was reduce the oil.  Since it isn't exactly tomato season I went ahead and subbed canned tomatoes.  I would, however, make this dish again at the height of tomato season when tomatoes are at their best.  Also, next time around I would definitely add more spices like Deb (a great little mishap if you ask me). I'd also like to try this with some chorizo, like Sue.  OPTIONAL MONTHLY COMMUNITY RECIPE FOR MAYPRESERVED LEMONThat's right!  May's Optional Monthly Community Recipe is Preserved Lemons!  Feel free to chose from any of Ottolenghi's preserved lemon recipes.  Please note that preserved lemons take about 4 weeks before they are ready to be used.  However, there is also a quick pickle version for those of you who are interested in saving a little time. The quick pickle version takes only 24 hours and is described as being similar but not as perfumed. Make and post your preserved lemons anytime during the month of May in place of any theme or as a bonus recipe, if you wish.  As an added challenge we'd love it if you show off your preserved lemons in a final dish.  As you can see from the short clip above, Ottolenghi adores lemons so you will find all sorts of ways to enjoy your preserved lemons!If you are unable to find a recipe for preserved lemons, please leave a comment below and one of us will email you the recipe.  *There will be no linky on this post.  Please link your preserved lemons to our weekly themed posts."},

He also has a very strong online presence.  A quick online search will yield pictures, recipes, cooking videos, and interviews. In addition, he writes a weekly column for The Guardian, which is also available online.  Those of you who utilize your iPhone and iPad will be happy to know there is both an app and an e-book available (links to all of the above can be found on our sidebar to the right).It is with great excitement that we welcome in Yotam Ottolenghi!

Participants can chose to make, post, and link this recipe in place of any weekly theme or simply as a bonus recipe for the month.  At the very end of the month, or very beginning of the next month, there will be a recipe roundup including a picture and link to all the participant's posts.  We look forward to sharing the experience of the recipe with you.  We encourage everyone to feel free to add their own twist or variation to the dish and tell us all about it!  It is our hope that cooking and sharing the same recipe will help to create a better sense of community and sharing here at IHCC and we are really looking forward to it! This month's Optional Monthly Community Recipe is......Shakshuka!Shakshuka is a beautiful brunch dish where poached eggs set atop a colorful and lightly spiced sauce made from tomatoes, onions, and peppers.  Shakshuka can be served family style or individually.  There are many variations of shakshuka and we encourage you to experiment as you wish.  Some like to add preserved lemon, feta cheese, and/or different herbs and spices.  Shakshuka is best served with  chunky white bread on the side for dipping.Below is a video of Yotam Ottolenghi making his Shakshuka.  Here is a link to the recipe, which can be found on the The Guardian's website.  *We are experimenting with a new linky tool so please be patient with us.  If there are any issues we will get them worked out shortly.*                document.write('<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=http://www.inlinkz.com/cs.php?id=257865&' + new Date().getTime() + '\"><\\/script>');"},

There are a couple links to online recipes for Ottolenghi there too--in case you don't have any of his cookbooks yet. BTW--Sue found an Ottolenghi iPhone application in case anyone wants to purchase it. I checked and the cost at the Apps store in the U.S. is $6.99 for what looks to be about 44 recipes currently (I'm not sure of the cost in other countries but it looks to be available in several). Here is a link  http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/lp/ottolenghi-appPay special attention to next week's welcome post as we will be introducing you to a couple of fun new IHCC features. Are you getting excited?!?! We sure are!"},

If you missed out on Kebab Krazy, please head over for a sneak peek! Announcements: The Future of IHCCDear IHCC  Friends,We have two exciting announcements for you today!  You know how sometimes you make a decision and then you have  second (and third, fourth, and even fifth) thoughts about the choice you made?  Well, after thinking long and hard about giving up IHCC and hopefully finding it  a good home, we thought longer and harder, emailed back and forth and actually  talked, (how fun is it to actually get to speak to a long-time blogging friend?!)  and finally decided that we still want to cook together and we would like to  cook with all of you.  And... we want to cook Yotam Ottolenghi. Some of you may be saying \"Yotam OttoWhoee????\" If you  haven't come across this Israeli-born, London-based and super-hot right now chef  on various blogs, we are excited to introduce you to him. Yotam Ottolenghi has  successful restaurants in the U.K., two stunning cookbooks Plenty and Jerusalem out in the U.S., (a third, Ottolenghi, is out in the  U.K. and other countries and is coming to the U.S. in September). He has a U.K.  television show and writes a regular vegetarian column in The Guardian newspaper in the U.K.,--although he is a  meat-eater, and has recipes (including those with meat, poultry and fish) on his Ottolenghi website. We  think you will find many recipes to choose from if you decide to join in and  aren't ready to commit to buying cookbooks (although you will probably want them  once you see them--they are beautiful!).If we were going to change our  minds and take on at least another round of hosting IHCC, we wanted to cook with  someone who interested and intrigued us. With spring approaching, we were inspired to cook with all the fresh and vibrant veggies, and Ottolenghi fits that bill with a fresh Mediterranean flair. We will still have our  IHCC weekly themes to make it fun, but will try to keep them loose and easy. We  are switching to a picture linky tool--so you will be able to add a thumbnail  picture to your entries, and we will be featuring a recipe or two from each  round on the following week's post to better highlight the fabulous dishes that  you make the effort to cook as well as get to know each other even better.  There will also be a few more changes coming up, so stay tuned!We  really think you'll enjoy cooking with Ottonlenghi and hope you will cook along  with us either regularly, or drop in when you feel like it and enjoy the  flexibility and community of IHCC. Themes for Yotam Ottolenghi, who will start  just after Madhur Jaffrey ends and run April 1 through September 29, will be  posted soon and the the look of the site will start to change for our new chef  shortly. (We are thinking clean and green!) Let us know if you have any  questions.Now for the second announcement! We are very excited to announce a new IHCC host, the lovely Sue of Couscous and Consciousness. Sue lives in Nelson, New  Zealand and writes has a fantastic blog about living and eating mindfully. She  is a long-time IHCC participant as well as a big fan of Ottolenghi, and we look  forward to adding her ideas and positive energy to the hosting team. A big  welcome to Sue!!Here's to great cooking, eating and discovering new chefs and  recipes!Kim, Deb, & Sue   1. Deb in Hawaii--Eggs w/ Fresh Green Herbs2.

Through the years,  I Heart Cooking Clubs has been such a wonderful way to share our love of cooking with all of you and has bought us lots of joy.  During our time we've explored the recipes of Nigella Lawson, Mark Bittman, Giada De Laurentiis, Jamie Oliver, Tessa Kiros, Rick Bayless, and finally Madhur Jaffrey.  Together, with our participants, we've cooked and shared hundreds of recipes and explores many cuisines. We've shared endless success stories and we've also shared in our fair share of failures.  We've learned and we've definitely grown.  However, after much soul searching, we have recently decided that it is time for us to move on as hosts. We want to take this time to thank all of you who have participated along with us over the years.  We couldn't have done it without you! I Heart Cooking Clubs will be running as normal through the end of March.  Deb and I will continue to share the hosting duties until our last day, Sunday, March 31st.  If anyone is interested in picking up the hosting duties, please leave a comment below.  (BTW--We think teaming up is always fun and builds wonderful blogging friendships!) We would love to see IHCC continue with new hosts bringing fresh energy and ideas. If not, we will end the club at the end of March after our final week of Madhur Jaffrey.     1.

{"title": "Indian Tea Party!", "date": "Monday, October 29, 2012", "text": "Care for a cuppa?Time to Whip up a spiced tea and/or snacks for tea-time. Indian tea is called chai, and is often made with spices and milk. It is served with a variety of snacks, both savoury and sweet, and is a fun way to celebrate a get-together.  From Wiki:India produces and consumes more tea than any other country in the world, except for China, including the famous Assam tea and Darjeeling tea.The cultivation and brewing of tea in India has a long history of applications in traditional systems of medicine and for consumption. The consumption of tea in India was first clearly documented in the Ramayana (750-500 BC). For the next thousand years, documentation of tea in India was lost in history. Records re-emerge during the first century AD, with stories of the Buddhist monks Bodhidharma and Gan Lu, and their involvement with tea. Research shows that tea is indigenous to eastern and northern India, and was cultivated and consumed there for thousands of years. Commercial production of tea in India did not begin until the arrival of the British East India Company, at which point large tracts of land were converted for mass tea production.Today, India is one of the largest tea producers in the world, though over 70% of the tea is consumed within India itself. A number of renowned teas, such as Darjeeling, also grow exclusively in India. The Indian tea industry has grown to own many global tea brands, and has evolved to one of the most technologically equipped tea industries in the world. Tea production, certification, exportation, and all other facets of the tea trade in India is controlled by the Tea Board of India. So whip up a great tea party - spiced Indian tea and/or snacks to go with it - from one of Madhur Jaffrey's recipes. Post on or by Sunday, November 4th, and link up to Mr. Linky below.

She has presented several cookery series on television, including Madhur Jaffrey's Indian Cookery in 1982, Madhur Jaffrey's Far Eastern Cookery in 1989 and Madhur Jaffrey's Flavours of India in 1995.  She lives in Manhattan and has a home in upstate New York. As a result  of the success of her cookbooks and TV, Jaffrey also developed a line of  mass-marketed cooking sauces.Ironically, she did not cook at all as a child growing up in Delhi.  She had almost never been in the kitchen and almost failed cooking at  school.  It was only after she went to London at the age of 19 to study at RADA  that she learned how to cook, using recipes of familiar dishes that were  provided in correspondence from her mother. In the 1960s, after her award-winning performance in Shakespeare Wallah, she became known as the \"actress who could cook\" and was hired by the BBC to present a show on Indian cooking. After an article about her and her cooking appeared in the New York Times in 1966, she received a book contract that produced An Invitation to Indian Cooking, her first book. The recipes in that book came from her mother, although she adapted them for the American kitchen.  During the 1970s, she taught classes in Indian cooking, both at the  James A. Beard School of Cooking and in her Manhattan apartment. In  1986, the restaurant Dawat opened in Manhattan using recipes provided by  her.She has certainly earned her place as a celeb chef. Just ask Emeril! She has tons of booksAt Home with Madhur JaffreyWorld VegetarianMadhur Jaffrey Indian CookingFrom Curries to KebabsStep by Step Indian CookeryQuick and Easy Indian CookeryClimbing the Mango TreesWorld-of-the-East Vegetarian CookingAn Invitation to Indian CookingMadhur  Jaffrey’s Indian Spice Kitchen Seasons of SplendorRobi DobiFor a full list of all of Madhur’s US publications, visit her Amazon shopOf course Indian cuisine is all about the spices, and we are looking forward to exploring the broad range of seasonings the cuisine has to offer.

Whether you use a few or a bucket full, it's time to break out the chiles.Chili peppers are indigenous to the New World.  Native cuisine used them  to add heat and flavor to food.  European explorers (who called pretty  much every new spice \"pepper\") spread chiles to Europe and Asia, where  they were soon integrated into many ethnic cuisines. There are as many kinds of chili pepper as places they're grown, from  the mildest paprika pepper to the fiery hot habenero.  Heat levels are  ranked on the Scoville scale.  The crushed red chili flakes used as  pizza topping rank between 20,000 and 40,000; richly flavorful ancho  goes as low as 1000 Scoville units, and habenero burns out at 200,000.   -The Spice HouseSo turn up the heat, as hot as you can take it, and add some chile into your life.Thumb through your Rick Bayless recipes and find one that heats you up.  Make and post your hot dish on or by Sunday, August 12th link up with Mr. Linky, below, and tell us all about how hot you got!Leave a comment after, so we can all come and visit your fiery fare!If you're new to this site, please check out our Welcome page for more information.  And did you check out all the delicious Green dishes from last week?*Images from Google ImagesI Heart Cooking Clubs *Feel the Heat!* Participants1.

The scent of fresh bread baking is the first thing to cross your mind. You can picture yourself slicing into loaf of white bread and slathering it with butter, peanut butter, or jelly.Later on for dinner you'll enjoy a comforting dish blanketed in a lovely white cream sauce.  Or, maybe today is the day for a glorious side of buttery white mashed potatoes?  Pizzas and pastas laden with cheese. Or perhaps the stillness of the day challenges you to try that fancy fish recipe.  You know the one.  The one where the flaky white fish is bathed in a flavorful sauce.   But then your sweet tooth gets the best of you and you realize that you must have dessert.  You start daydreaming about vanilla cakes, meringues as fluffy as the clouds, and warm and spicy rice puddings and before you know it your decision is made.  Or is it?  Please make or post your White As Snow recipes by January 22nd.  Don't forget to link your post of the week with Mr. Linky below and leave a comment afterwards so we don't miss you gorgeous recipe.

You almost don't want to walk in it, to keep the pristine nature of the snow.For those of us in snowy winter climes - now is the time for some serious comfort food. Long braises, roasts, stews, casseroles, and lots of starch. Hot chile, hot chocolate, and anything else with the word hot in it is also appropriate.But not all of us intrepid I♥CCers live in snowy locales, in fact some of us live in downright warm places.For them I have two messages - a) please make up the guest bedroom for me, and b) feel free to make a dish that reminds you of ice and snow. Something ice cold like gelato or ice cream would be perfect. So grab your Tessa Kiros cookbooks, whip something up with Winter Wonderland in mind, and post on or by Sunday, January 1st.Link up a permalink to your I♥CC post with Mr. Linky, below.Need more information about linking or what the heck a permalink is?

And yet - they are the workhorses of your pantry.I know, you stocked up on dried beans for economical nutrition and the upcoming zombie-apocalypse and haven't been using them as often as you thought you would. That's okay. The beans forgive you. Beans are cool like that.They wait patiently for you to remember to soak some overnight to make a dish, some even hang out in cans in case you forget. I like refried beans. That's why I wanna try fried beans, because maybe they're just as good and we're just wasting time. You don't have to fry them again after all.Mitch HedbergBeans offer good nutrition and body to a dish, and work magically with rice, corn and other grains. And herbs love 'em.

Cupcakes, brownies, cookies, pies and cobblers are always sure to put a smile on anybody's face.    Farewell Food can be anything your heart desires.  Maybe there is that one looming Bittman recipe that you always wanted to make and just never got around to.

Sadly, this is our last Potluck with Mark Bittman, so pull out that Bittman recipe you have been saving to try, or maybe you want to remake a previous Bittman favorite. Either way...Get ready for our September Potluck!Anything goes for a Potluck dish, as long as it is a Bittman recipe of course!

Speaking of fab food, if you didn't get a chance to check out all the cheesy-goodness for last week's \"Say Cheese!\" theme, go back and take a look at what cheesy delights everyone selected to make. It is going to be hard to say goodbye to Mark Bittman next week, and I am sure everyone has already checked out the poll results for our newest cook, starting in October, but just in case...it is Giada De Laurentiis. It was a close race between Giada and Lidia Bastianich, with Giada taking an early lead, then Lidia coming from behind and dominating the votes until the eleventh hour when Giada jumped ahead and won the popular vote. Such drama! ;-) With four great cooks/chefs, it was really a no-lose situation, and of course we can put Lidia up for another vote later on. We will be posting October's themes soon, and also giving IHCC a bit of a facelift to welcome Giada, including adding some links to her website and sources for her recipes. So get ready!

Yes, we are cooking (or rather NOT cooking) Raw Foods with Mark Bittman!What are Raw Foods you ask? Well according to Wikipedia: \"Raw foodism (or rawism) is a lifestyle promoting the consumption of uncooked, unprocessed, and often organic foods as a large percentage of the diet. Raw foodists typically believe that the greater the percentage of raw food in the diet, the greater the health benefits. Depending on the type of lifestyle and results desired, raw food diets may include a selection of raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds (including sprouted whole grains), eggs, fish (such as sashimi), meat (such as carpaccio), and nonpasteurized/nonhomogenized dairy products (such as raw milk, raw milk cheese, and raw milk yogurt).\"Not to get too technical--we just thought this is a fun way to make good use of summer's bounty of fresh, natural foods and not have to \"cook\" this week! How will YOU get raw? Maybe you fancy a big plate of salad, or crudites and a flavorful dip? A cold veggie soup from the blender? Fresh fruit as a salad, dessert, or maybe a drink? Roll up some sushi or slice a little sashimi? Get elegant with some carpaccio or a little tartare?Perhaps you are feeling shy and just want to dip your toes in and go partially raw with a raw pasta sauce to go on some cooked noodles?Heck, you might just want to make your Mark Bittman recipe selection while completely \"in the raw\"--we are cool with that, just no pictures please! ;-)However you decide to get raw, just make sure to make and post your Bittman recipe by Sunday, August 1st.

{"title": "Herb Garden!", "date": "Monday, May 31, 2010", "text": "What's growing in your Herb Garden? Or along your windowsill? Or at your local farmers market or even the produce aisle of your favorite supermarket? Well, it is time to pick and chop some of those lovely herbs and make a Mark Bittman recipe that features them.That's right it is all about the Herb Garden this week at I Heart Cooking Clubs. Definition please? An herb is defined as \"a plant that is valued for flavor, scent, or other qualities.\" Culinary use of the term \"herb\" typically distinguishes between herbs, which are from the leafy green parts of a plant, and spices, which come from other parts of the plant, including seeds, berries, bark, root and fruit. Culinary herbs are distinguished from vegetables in that, like spices, they are used in small amounts and provide flavor rather than substance to food.Whether you are a lover of basil or chives, a fanatic for cilantro or mint, crazy for oregano or marjoram, or maybe like Simon & Garfunkel, it is parsley, sage rosemary and thyme that inspires you, trust us, there is a Bittman recipe for you. Find a recipe that features fresh herbs from one of his books or online, or if you can't find them fresh in your area, use dried herbs instead.Make and post your Bittman Herb Garden recipe by Sunday, June 6th. Don't forget to link your post of the week's permalink with Mr. Linky, below, so we can all enjoy your fabulous herbalicious creation!

What better time feel like goddesses, domestic or otherwise, to channel our inner Nigellas and enjoy some Goddess Goodies, our theme for this week.Nigella says \"Cooking is about balance and harmony\" and Goddess Goodies are those foods that make us feel good--the treats that delight and sustain us.

{"title": "October Potluck!", "date": "Monday, October 19, 2009", "text": "A potluck is a gathering of people where each person or group of people contributes a dish of food to be shared among the group. The original meaning was \"food given away to guests\", probably derived from \"whatever food one is lucky enough to find in the pot\" Wiki. I Heart Cooking Clubs will be hosting a potluck once a month and you decide what to bring!A gorgeous stew to keep us warm? Big pitcher of margaritas to keep us festive? Leg of lamb with lots of veggies? Potlucks are the ultimate wildcard - you decide what to make. So look through Nigella Lawson's recipes in her books or online, cook up something that looks great to you, post it by October 25th and link up to Mr. Linky so that the rest of us can share with you!In the meantime, make sure you have had a chance to check out all the delicious Midnight Sneaks from last week. Mmm, well worth sneaking a second helping!Link your I Heart Cooking Clubs post of the week's permalink with Mr. Linky, below, so we can all see your fabulous cooking club creation!

{"title": "Midnight Sneaks!", "date": "Monday, October 12, 2009", "text": "In tribute to Nigella's famous late night trips down to her fridge to steal a bite of something delicious she made, this week our theme is \"Midnight Sneaks\". So what qualifies as a Midnight Sneak? Well...pretty much anything! A Midnight Sneak is any Nigella recipe that you would get up in the middle of night for, just to have another bite (or bites!) of it. It might be savory, it might be sweet or even spicy. It could be a shared plate of pasta or a gooey creamy dessert--it's all up to you! Utensils are optional, in Nigella's world, fingers will do just fine! So take a look through your Nigella cookbooks or online and find a Nigella recipe that you think is worthy of a stealthy late night visit to your refrigerator and post it on or by Sunday, October 18th.Can't wait to see your late night crave-worthy selections! If you haven't yet, take a look at all the amazing \"One Dish Wonders\" from last week--some truly wonderful choices!Happy Cooking!Link your I Heart Cooking Clubs post of the week's permalink with Mr. Linky, below, so we can all see your fabulous cooking club creation!

One pot wonders are generally comfort foods, family friendly, and warming to the soul.Look through Nigella's books or recipes online, find the perfect one pot (or one pan) recipe for you and your family this week and post it on or by October 11th.Can't wait to see what everybody cooks up!

{"title": "Welcome!", "date": "Friday, September 4, 2009", "text": "Welcome to I Heart Cooking Clubs! A Little Bit About Us: Cooking together since 2009, IHCC is a spin-off of the popular TFF (Tyler Florence Fridays) cooking club and is presently featuring the recipes of Curtis Stone! (Through October 2, 2016.) This cooking club aims to grow and change with its members and explore other cooks and books in the future. A new chef/cook will be announced every six months. You can see a list of the previous IHCC chefs under the heading of this blog.)---You Choose the Recipes! In the interest of freedom of choice, we have organized this cooking club on themes--listed on the sidebar. How you interpret the theme is up to you. If you feel that you would like nothing better than a three pound bison burger, with all the fixin's, on a spa day.. nobody will challenge you on it! The only 'rule' to IHCC is that you must cook a recipe from the current featured chef except on specified Monthly Potluck weeks when you can cook the recipes of the current chef, or the recipes of any previous IHCC chef and our new in 2015: Monthly Featured Chef Event where we feature one of our previous IHCC chefs (listed under the heading of this blog.) Once the theme is announced, feel free to peruse the current chef's recipes from  cookbooks or online, to find one that you think suits the theme and your tastes. Have fun with the recipe, change what you like, and link into that week's post.---Sidebar BlogrollIf you would like to be added to the blogroll on the sidebar, please leave your name and a link to your blog in the comments section of this welcome post.
