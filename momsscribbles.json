{"title": "Blueberry Picking Time", "date": "Monday, December 18, 2023", "text": "Northern Minnesota has lots of wild blueberries.  Some grow in wet areas called blueberry bogs and some grow in the pine forests.Many years ago, when my kids and I lived in that part of the state, I spent hours in the middle of summer, out in the pine woods, picking blueberries.  I was lucky enough to find an area that held a wealth of berries and that nobody else knew about.  Blueberry picking areas were jealously guarded by those of us who wanted the berries.My family ate some of the berries fresh.  I canned blueberries in a simple syrup, made blueberry jam and froze the rest.My Dad's family picked blueberries, but used a different method than I did.  Keeping in mind I had only four kids and there were nine of them.When the berries were ripe, my Grandpa and his sons would load a cast iron, wood burning stove onto a hay wagon.  Added to that were crates of canning jars, large stock pots and a goodly amount of sugar and enough food for a couple of days.  They hooked up their team of horses, everybody piled onto the wagon and off they would go to a blueberry bog several miles from their farm.Everyone had their job to do.  A couple of the boys gathered dry wood to burn in the wood stove.  The rest would head out with pails to fill with berries.  Dad once showed me a homemade blueberry picker he used that made quick work of filling his pail.Grandma and a couple of the girls were in charge of canning the blueberries.  They cleaned the sticks and leaves out and washed the berries.  The jars were filled and the berries covered with a light sugar syrup and water bath canned.  They didn't go back home until all the jars were filled and canned.If you have never eaten wild blueberries, you are missing a treat.  Store bought blueberries are tasteless by comparison.  It was worth every minute of time and effort to pick blueberries."},
{"title": "Our Frugal Ancestors", "date": "Saturday, December 16, 2023", "text": "I am not a totally frugal person.  I like my conveniences, little luxuries and the occasional cheeseburger that someone else cooks.  But what if those things were no longer available and we had to live without, like my Dad's family back near the turn of the century.When you can't just run to the corner store or the supermarket for groceries, you figure out how to get what you need in other ways.  My ancestors did get some items they couldn't produce themselves, but those items were usually obtained through barter.  For instance, the family had a few milk cows.  After each milking, fresh milk was run through the cream separator that stood in the lean-to by the back door of the house.My uncle Kenneth did the milking.  He would carry pails of milk from the barn up to the house and pour milk into the large bowl on top.  Then he would work the crank.  I have no clue how it worked, but the cream flowed from one of the spouts and the milk - minus the cream, flowed from the other.  Grandma made butter from most of the cream and that was used to trade for flour, salt, etc.  The milk didn't last long with a family of nine kids.There was a bucket in the kitchen, set in an out of the way corner, that held food scraps.  If Grandma shelled peas for supper, the shells went into the bucket.  Scraps like onion skins or corn cobs went into the bucket.  Cooking scraps went into the bucket.  And when the bucket was nearly full, it was dumped into the pig trough.  The pigs acted like they had just been served a fine, restaurant meal!The family grew rutabagas.  Some were for human consumption, but most were stored in the root cellar and cut into smaller pieces for an addition to the regular animal feed.  My Dad was the youngest of the nine children.  From maybe 9 or 10 years old, he had a tendency to get himself into a bit of trouble.  Nothing serious.  Just enough to annoy his parents.  He told me about his mother's form of discipline when he acted up.  She handed him a kitchen knife and pointed toward the root cellar, where he spent a considerable amount of time cutting up rutabagas.  :)The family used every method at their disposal to save.  They were cash poor, but rich in their love of one another.  And in my opinion, that kind of rich is worth more than anything else."},
{"title": "Harvesting Ice", "date": "Monday, December 11, 2023", "text": "Everywhere I look I see dire warnings about the possible collapse of our country.  I'm never quite sure if there is truth in it or if it all is just fearmongering for clicks.  Whatever the reasons, perhaps it might be a good thing to know how those who came before us managed without all of the modern conveniences we have today.My paternal grandfather died before I was born.  But with the help of my grandmother's sons, she stayed on the northern Minnesota farm until her death in 1955.Grandma's house had electricity by the time I knew her.  But there was no plumbing or running water.  The bathroom was an outhouse several yards from the house and water was provided by a hand pump just outside the kitchen door. Her kitchen boasted a very large cast iron wood burning stove used for cooking, baking and sometimes, heat.  Grandma didn't have an electric refrigerator, but still used an icebox like this one.The icebox needed blocks of ice to keep food cool.  The method Grandma's sons used to get ice would not work in a warm climate but was perfect for northern Minnesota.About February, Grandma's sons would hook up their team of horses to a large hay wagon and off they would go to a nearby lake that was frozen over.  Armed with axes and saws, they would cut large blocks of ice from the lake, load them onto the hay wagon and take them home.There was a root cellar dug into the side of a small hill near the house.  A wooden door had been put into place to keep critters from helping themselves to the squash and pumpkins and rutabagas stored there.  One side of the cellar was for the ice.  The blocks were hauled down into the cellar and covered with straw.  This way, the ice was insulated and stayed frozen all spring, summer and fall until it was time to harvest more.The icebox had a compartment to hold food and another to hold a block of ice.  There was a container in the bottom to catch the water as the ice melted.I suppose the family could have invested in an electric refrigerator, but like most folks of that era, they were a frugal bunch.  Raising a family of nine children on a farm that had mostly sandy soil did not provide great wealth.  But they managed to raise all nine kids and they did a good job of it.  Life was not easy, but I don't remember anyone complaining.I sometimes think today's young ones consider it tragic if a Starbucks closes.  They could stand to learn from those who coped with hardship on a regular basis.  Not only coped but thrived."},
{"title": "Skating in Duluth Harbor", "date": "Thursday, December 7, 2023", "text": "Once in a while I will enjoy the sight of a huge ship entering the Duluth, Minnesota harbor from Lake Superior, via the Harbor Canal.  There are cameras on 24/7.  It is sort of relaxing to watch the long ships entering or leaving the harbor.  Here is the link for the canal camera.  Duluth Canal Cam - YouTubeSome folks enjoy the lonesome sound of distant train whistles.  I like the sound of the ship horns blowing a salute to the Lift Bridge at the entrance to the harbor.  The Lift Bridge raises the entire roadway high enough for the ships to pass underneath.  The bridge is equipped with a horn that blows an answering salute.Watching the ship enter the harbor today served to remind me of a story involving my Grandfather, ice skates and the Duluth Harbor.My Grandfather was born in Chenango County of New York in 1883.  His family moved to Minnesota before the turn of the century.  They stayed for a time with relatives in Duluth before moving to a farm.Minnesota winters can be cold.  Even a lake as large as Lake Superior can freeze, at least along the shoreline.  When I was reading some letters written between my Grandfather and his siblings, I found one where he talks about ice skating on the Duluth Harbor as a child.  What caught my attention was his description of skating around the sailing ships that were frozen in the ice along the docks.What a fascinating time that must have been.  Every few years, Duluth hosts a gathering of 'tall ships' that serve to give us a taste of what life was like back then. According to the accounts of life back then, written by some of my ancestors, life wasn't easy.  But neither was it terribly complicated.  Men were men.  Women were women.   They knew the difference."},
{"title": "Best Laid Plans", "date": "Sunday, December 3, 2023", "text": "You know how it is.  We make plans.  God laughs.  And sometimes I think He might send that Murphy character just to keep us humble.  :)Thursday of this week was my grocery delivery day.  It has become a normal thing that the weekly sale ads contain very little that I am willing to spend money on.  But this week I lucked out.I haven't seen any chicken at a reasonable price in ages.  Yet there it was.  Family packs of chicken drumsticks and thighs for 99 cents per pound.  Average weight per pack/ 6 - 7 lbs.  There was a limit of four each.  I got 8 packs of chicken.And here is where the plan comes in.  I planned to package the drumsticks in meal sized amounts for myself and toss them into the freezer.  I did.  I planned to stuff the thighs into wide mouth pint jars and can them.  That's when Old Murphy reared his ugly head.  Sale chicken pieces are often odd sizes and that was true with the thighs.  Wasn't working very well. So on to Plan B.  Tossed half the thighs into my largest stock pot, covered them with water and cooked them until tender.  Did it again with the other two trays.  Was planning to take the meat from the bones and can it that way.Murphy wasn't quite done with me.  I am old.  I am arthritic.  I have lots of good days and a few not so stellar days.  The next morning, I found out quickly that I would not be wrestling a large pressure canner.  Luckily, I still had some freezer space, so into the freezer went several pounds of cooked chicken thighs.The point to all of this is that things don't always work out the way we would like.  In my case, chicken is still chicken, and it was at a good price.  Doesn't matter if it is canned or frozen.  It is food.  And no matter how it is preserved, it is there when needed.There seems to be silver linings in the clouds if we look for them.  My silver lining in the chicken freezing debacle was that instead of taking the time to do some canning, I was able to use the time to add some information to my genealogy program.  I found that the website \"Find A Grave\" has a considerable amount of information on those ancestors I am looking up.  I not only find where they are buried, but often I find links to other family members.My family thinks I am obsessed with my family tree - all branches.  And I guess I am.  I know most of my family has little interest, but my hope is that maybe someday they will want to know about those who went before.Continuing to prepare is important.  Especially now when a good share of the world seems to be going bat guano crazy.  I also believe it is good to know where we come from.  Don't have to be as deep into genealogy as I am, but if we don't learn from history, we will just repeat it - mostly the bad.Hang in there.  Keep stacking.  And most importantly, keep praying."},
{"title": "Scam the Scammers", "date": "Friday, November 17, 2023", "text": "I have been really busy.  And when I am busy, those scam phone calls annoy me more than usual.  Especially since I am probably the only person on the planet who doesn't have a cell phone, so I have to stop what I am doing and go answer the phone.  About two weeks ago, being totally out of patience, I did something about them.Typically, I get three kinds of calls.  The first is the call that starts out with a cheerful voice passing the time of day but soon asks if I can hear them alright.  What they want is for us to answer \"Yes\" so they can then use that recorded affermative reply for whatever nefarious purposes they have in mind.  My solution was to remain silent.  Someimes it took two or three minutes for them to hang up on me.The second type of call was the one where they ask for me by name.  No amount of hanging up, swearing at them or any other response ended those calls.  So finally I used my sweet little old lady voice to tell them I was sorry, but I didn't know anyone by that name and they must have the wrong number.  Took about a week for those calls to stop.There have been an astonishing number of calls trying to sell me additional supplimental Medicare.  Nothing worked to stop those calls.  That is until I let them read their script up to the part where they ask if I am over 65 years of age, to which I replied, \"Well, no I'm not. I am 40 years old.\"  That's when those callers hung up on me.It has been about a week and a half since I have received a spam call.  It is lovely to be free of just another annoying thing.  I won't claim that I have completely ended those calls, but so far, it seems to be working."},

{"title": "Looking Back", "date": "Tuesday, January 3, 2023", "text": "Most people, at the beginning of a new year, look forward to whatever it brings.  I find myself looking back.Some time ago, someone close to me had a look at the room in my apartment where much of my food storage is located.  Their reaction to the shelves and boxes full of food was to ask why.  Clearly they were under the assumption that nothing will ever change, that the stores will always be completely stocked and nothing bad will ever happen - at least not in their back yard.Generations younger than mine do not seem to realize that for us, being prepared is not just some trendy thing to do.  It is a lifestyle.Looking back, I remember the huge garden my Dad planted every year.  And how summer and fall we canned and froze as much food as possible to get our family through the long, cold Minnesota winters.  Dad didn't farm, but he did rent out our 9 acre field to the neighbor to grow corn or soy beans in exchange for beef.  That same neighbor milked cows, so we got our milk from him, and our eggs from another neighbor who raised chickens.My grandparents raised milk cows and hogs and chickens for meat to feed their family of nine children.  Dad told me about loading a wood burning stove onto a hay wagon, along with boxes of canning jars.  The family would go to the blueberry bogs of northern Minnesota, where they would camp.  The kids would pick blueberries and Grandma would fire up the stove and can blueberries until all the jars were full. In addition to canning vegetables from their huge garden, Grandma made butter from the cream separated from the milk, and traded the butter in town for flour and sugar.  They dug a root cellar in the side of a hill near the house for keeping potatoes, carrots, cabbage and rutabagas over winter.  Families then did not depend on anyone to take care of them.  My Dad consdered it shameful to accept any kind of government help.  They did as much as was humanly possible to take care of their families.All of this was common to families older than my generation.  They were preppers but didn't know it.  Neither did I until I saw some websites about preparedness.  This is just what we did to feed or families.Even if we can no longer raise vegetables or meat animals, we can still be prepared.  If you think some government agency is going to bring you a ham sandwich and a bottle of water, you are sadly mistaken.  Nobody is coming to help.  We need to be as self sufficient as possible.  Look to the old ways.  Those people survived without all the gadgets.Most importantly, continue to pray."},

This past Wednesday a nurse arrived that I had never seen before.  When she finished her duties, she got up to leave.The store room door is close to the entry-exit door in my kitchen.  I keep the store room door shut so visitors, with the exception of family, can not see what I have in that room.  When I saw the nurse was reaching for the store room door, I told her she needed to use the other door.  But instead of stopping, she went ahead, opened the store room door, took a good look around and said, \"Oh my!  You sure do have a lot of food in here.  If things get bad, I'm just going to come here.\"  To which I replied, \"NO YOU ARE NOT!!\"I am completely amazed at how many people, at least in my area, are completely clueless as to what is happening around them.  And the mindset that others will be happy to take care of them when they are too lazy to prepare for themselves, is astonishing.There was a time when I thought that I would help people other than my family, but that time has past.  The question has to be, which one of my grandchildren should I let go hungry in order to feed someone who couldn't be bothered to do for themselves.

That's what you people are worried about?  I honestly didn't realizethere were that many people whose common sense had left the building.Ihave a couple of things to worry about that are a bit more important.Likemany of my vintage, I live on a fixed income that doesn't even beginto keep up with inflation.  And there are many others, through nofault of their own, who are either out of work or working severalpart time jobs to keep food on their table and a roof over theirheads.  Unlike those who stand in line looking for handouts.Myfather was one of those who worked hard to take care of an invalidwife and three kids.  He worked a full time day job, cleaned officebuildings at night and fed turkeys and cleaned huge turkey barns onweekends.  He considered any kind of handout to be shameful.Iam proud to be that man's daughter.Icould say that the price of gas doesn't affect me because I no longerown a car.  That would be wrong.  Fuel runs the ships that bringgoods to our shores.  Diesel runs the trucks and trains thattransport goods to store shelves.  It also runs the farm equipmentthat is used to grow our food.  Fuel prices affect us all.Thoseof us who rent are finding increases now or in the near future.  Myrent is going up in July.  I can afford the increase, but many whohave kids at home are really struggling.Afew months ago my two week grocery bill was on the average $120. That included buying items for my preparedness food pantry.  Lastweek the bill for a similar order was $240.  I live alone.  I preparefor my family, but doubt if I could feed my four children were theyyounger and still living at home.BecauseI live a very frugal lifestyle, I can still manage.  Many can not. And don't think for one little bitty minute that your governmentgives a rodent's behind that many are suffering.  They would rathersend billions of dollars to fight a war we are not involved in.  Theywould rather send pallets of baby formula to our southern border forthe illegals when our people find bare shelves in our stores.

But the storehere hasn't had canning jars on the shelves for several weeks.  I didscore 6 boxes of canning lids a couple of weeks ago, but those, too,are scarce as hen's teeth.  Since I am nearly out of jars, havingonly 4 cases of half pint jars left in my stash, I spent part of theweekend looking for alternative ways to store food.First,I claim none of what follows as my own ideas.  Many others who aresmarter than I am about these things have been my inspiration.  Ihave added links to three of the videos that showed me how to do whatI had in mind to do.Note: The third link is to a video from “The Purposeful Pantry.” Darcy is my favorite dehydrating guru and I highly recommend herchannel.Ihave canned many 'meals in a jar,' consisting of soups and stews. But now that canning jars are so scarce in my area, and because I have lots of dehydrated food on hand, I have decided tosee what I could do with putting together meals using dryingredients.  Instead of storing the mixes in jars, I am using ziplocfreezer bags.Iknow there are many prepackaged meals on the store shelves.  And I dohave some of those in my food storage.  But things have changed. Much of that kind of packaged food is beyond my pay grade these days. With inflation headed skyward, I find it more important than ever toclosely watch my expenditures.  Especially because I am experiencingwhat many are experiencing and that is increases in rent andutilities.SoI am going through my recipe collection to find recipes I know myfamily likes that I can put together and store for future use.  Idon't dehydrate meat like some do, but prefer to add a jar of cannedmeat if needed for a recipe.Hereare the links.  I hope they serve as an inspiration for just anotherway to be prepared.*6SOUP IN A JAR RECIPES- Gift Ideas - Emergency meals* - YouTube DrySoup Mix in Jars - YouTubeDehydrateCanned Beans and Make a Meal in a Jar (Taco Soup) | Perfect ChristmasGift - YouTube"},

{"title": "LIPIDLEGGIN’", "date": "Thursday, March 17, 2022", "text": "LIPIDLEGGIN’F. Paul Wilson[Editor's note: This story was first published in 1978 by F. Paul Wilson. Then it was probably considered rather \"out there\". Today it's a prescient look at what is close to becoming a reality as the Food Police continually try to foist their \"good-for-you\" policies on individuals. We're pleased to bring this story to our audience.]Butter.I can name a man's poison at fifty paces. I take one look at this guy as he walks in and say to myself, \"Butter.\"He steps carefully, like there's something sticky on the soles of his shoes. Maybe there is, but I figure he moves like that because he's on unfamiliar ground. Never seen his face before and I know just about everybody around.It's early yet. I just opened the store and Gabe's the only other guy on the buying side of the counter, only he ain't buying. He's waiting in the corner by the checkerboard and I'm just about to go join him when the new guy comes in. It's wet out---not raining, really, just wet like it only gets up here near the Water Gap-and he's wearing a slicker. Underneath that he seems to have a stocky build and is average height. He's got no beard and his eyes are blue with a watery look. Could be from anywhere until he takes off the hat and I see his hair: It's dark brown and he's got it cut in one of those soup-bowl styles that're big in the city.Gabe gives me an annoyed look as I step back behind the counter, but I ignore him. His last name is Varadi--sounds Italian but it's Hungarian--and he's got plenty of time on his hands. Used to be a Ph.D. in a philosophy department at some university in Upstate New York till they cut the department in half and gave him his walking papers, tenure and all. Now he does part-time labor at one of the mills when they need a little extra help, which ain't near as often as he'd like.About as poor as you can get, that Gabe. The government giraffes take a big chunk of what little he earns and leave him near nothing to live on. So he goes down to the welfare office where the local giraffes give him food stamps and rent vouchers so he can get by on what the first group of giraffes left him. If you can figure that one out...Anyway, Gabe's got a lot of time on his hands, like I said, and he hangs out here and plays checkers with me when things are slow. He'd rather play chess, I know, but I can't stand the game. Nothing happens for too long and I get impatient and try to break the game open with some wild gamble. And I always lose. So we play checkers or we don't play.The new guy puts his hat on the counter and glances around. He looks uneasy. I know what's coming but I'm not going to help him out. There's a little dance we've got to do first.\"I need to buy a few things,\" he says. His voice has a little tremor in it and close up like this I figure he's in his mid-twenties.\"Well, this is a general store,\" I reply, getting real busy wiping down the counter, \"and we've got all sorts of things. What're you interested in? Antiques? Hardware? Food?\"\"I'm not looking for the usual stock.\"(The music begins to play)I look at him with my best puzzled expression. \"Just what is it you're after, friend?\"\"Butter and eggs.\"\"Nothing unusual about that. Got a whole cabinet full of both behind you there.\"(We're on our way to the dance floor)\"I'm not looking for that. I didn't come all the way out here to buy the same shit I can get in the city. I want the real thing.\"\"You want the real thing, eh?\" I say, meeting his eyes square for the first time. \"You know damn well real butter and real eggs are illegal. I could go to jail for carrying that kind of stuff.\"(We dance)Next to taking his money, this is the part I like best about dealing with a new customer. Usually I can dance the two of us around the subject of what he really wants for upwards of twenty or thirty minutes if I've a mind to. But this guy was a lot more direct than most and didn't waste any time getting down to the nitty-gritty. Still, he wasn't going to rob me of a little dance. I've got a dozen years of dealing under my belt and no green kid's gonna rob me of that.A dozen years... doesn't seem that long. It was back then that the giraffes who were running the National Health Insurance program found out that they were spending way too much money taking care of people with diseases nobody was likely to cure for some time. The stroke and heart patients were the worst. With the presses at the Treasury working overtime and inflation getting wild, it got to the point where they either had to admit they'd made a mistake or do something drastic. Naturally, they got drastic.The president declared a health emergency and Congress passed something called the National Health Maintenance Act which said that since certain citizens were behaving irresponsibly by abusing their bodies and thereby giving rise to chronic diseases which resulted in consumption of more that their fair share of medical care at public expense, it was resolved that, in the public interest and for the public good, certain commodities would henceforth and hereafter be either prescribed or strictly rationed. Or something like that.Foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats headed the list. Next came tobacco and any alcoholic beverage over 30 proof.Ah, the howls that went up from the public. But those were nothing compared to the screams of fear and anguish that arose from the dairy and egg industry which was facing immediate economic ruin. The Washington giraffes stood firm, however--it wasn't an election year--and used phrases like \"bite the bullet\" and \"national interest\" and \"public good\" until we were all ready to barf.Nothing moved them.Things quieted down after a while, as they always do. It helped, of course, that somebody in one of the drug companies had been working on an additive to chicken feed that would take just about all the cholesterol out of the yolk. It worked, and the poultry industry was saved.The new eggs cost more--of course--and the removal of most of the cholesterol from the yolk also removed most of the taste, but at least the egg farmers had something to sell.Butter was out. Definitely. No compromise. Too much of an \"adverse effect on serum lipid levels,\" whatever that means. You use polyunsaturated margarine or you use nothing. Case closed.Well, almost closed. Most good citizen-type Americans hunkered down and learned to live with the Lipid Laws, as they came to be known. Why, I bet there's scads of fifteen-year-olds about who've never tasted real butter or a true, cholesterol-packed egg yolk. But we're not all good citizens. Especially me. Far as I'm concerned, there's nothing like two fried eggs--fried in butter--over easy, with bacon on the side, to start the day off. Every day. And I wasn't about to give that up.I was strictly in the antiques trade then, and I knew just about every farmer in Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania. So I found one who was making butter for himself and had him make a little extra for me. Then I found another who was keeping some hens aside and not giving them any of the special feed and had him hold a few eggs out for me.One day I had a couple of friends over for breakfast and served them real eggs and toast with real butter. They almost strangled me trying to find out where I got the stuff. That's when I decided to add a sideline to my antique business.I figured New York City to be the best place to start so I let word get around the antique dealers there that I could supply their customers with more than furniture. The response was wild and soon I was making more money running butter and eggs than I was running Victorian golden oak. I was a lipidlegger.Didn't last, though. I was informed by two very pushy fellows of Mediterranean stock that if I wanted to do any lipid business in Manhattan, I'd either have to buy all my merchandise from their wholesale concern, or give them a very healthy chunk of my profits.I decided it would be safer to stick close to home. Less volume, but less risky. I turned my antique shop up here by the Water Gap--that's the part of New Jersey you can get to without driving by all those refineries and reactors--into a general store.A dozen years now.\"I heard you had the real thing for sale,\" the guy says.I shake my head. \"Now where would you hear a thing like that?\"\"New York.\"\"New York? The only connection I have with New York is furnishing some antique dealers with a few pieces now and then. How'd you hear about me in New York?\"\"Sam Gelbstein.\"I nod. Sam's a good customer. Good friend, too. He helped spread the word for me when I was leggin' lipids into the city.\"How you know Sam?\"\"My uncle furnished most of his house with furniture he bought there.\"I still act suspicious--it's part of the dance--but I know if Sam sent him, he's all right. One little thing bothers me, though.\"How come you don't look for your butter and eggs in the city? I hear they're real easy to get there.\"\"Yeah,\" he says and twists his mouth. \"They're also spoiled now and again and there's no arguing with the types that supply it. No money-back guarantees with those guys.\"I see his point. \"And you figure this is closer to the source.\"He nods.\"One more question,\" I say. \"I don't deal in the stuff, of course\"--still dancing--\"but I'm curious how a young guy like you got a taste for contraband like eggs and butter.\"\"Europe,\" he says. \"I went to school in Brussels and it's all still legal over there. Just can't get used to these damned substitutes.\"It all fit, so I go into the back and lift up the floor door. I keep a cooler down there and from it pull a dozen eggs and a half-kilo slab of butter. His eyes widen as I put them on the counter in front of him.\"Is this the real thing?\" he asks. \"No games?\" I pull out an English muffin, split it with my thumbs, and drop the halves into a toaster I keep under the counter. I know that once he tastes this butter I'll have another steady customer. People will eat ersatz eggs and polyunsaturated margarine if they think it's good for them, but they want to know the real thing's available. Take that away from them and suddenly you've got them going to great lengths to get what they used to pass up without a second thought.\"The real thing,\" I tell him. \"There's even a little salt added to the butter for flavor.\"\"Great!\" He smiles, then puts both hands into his pockets and pulls out a gun with his right and a shield with his left. \"James Callahan, Public Health Service, Enforcement Division,\" he says. \"You're under arrest, Mr. Gurney.\" He's not smiling anymore.I don't change my expression or say anything. Just stand there and look bored. But inside I feel like someone's wrapped a length of heavy chain around my gut and hooked it up to a high speed winch.Looking at the gun-a snub-nosed .32--I start to grin.\"What's so funny?\" he asks, nervous and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's his first bust.\"A public health guy with a gunl\" I'm laughing now. \"Don't that seem funny to you?\"His face remains stern. \"Not in the least. Now step around the counter. After you're cuffed we're going to take a ride to the Federal Building.\"I don't budge. I glance over to the corner and see a deserted checkerboard. Gabe's gone--skittered out as soon as he saw the gun. Mr. Public Health follows my eyes.\"Where's the red-headed guy?\"\"Gone for help,\" I tell him.He glances quickly over his shoulder out the door, then back at me. \"Let's not do anything foolish here. I wasn't crazy enough to come out here alone.\"But I can tell by the way his eyes bounce all over the room and by the way he licks his lips that, yes, he was crazy enough to come out here alone.I don't say anything, so he fills in the empty space. \"You've got nothing to worry about, Mr. Gurney,\" he says. \"You'll get off with a first offender's suspended sentence and a short probation.\"I don't tell him that's exactly what worries me. I'm waiting for a sound: the click of the toaster as it spits out the English muffin. It comes and I grab the two halves and put them on the counter.\"What are you doing?\" he asks, watching me like I'm going to pull a gun on him any minute.\"You gotta taste it,\" I tell him. \"I mean, how're you gonna be sure it ain't oleo unless you taste it?\"\"Never mind that.\" He wiggles the .32 at me. \"You're just stalling. Get around here.\"But I ignore him. I open a corner of the slab of butter and dig out a hunk with my knife. Then I smear it on one half of the muffin and press the two halves together. All the time I'm talking.\"How come you're out here messin' with me? I'm smalltime. The biggies are in the city.\"\"Yeah.\" He nods slowly. He can't believe I'm buttering a muffin while he holds a gun on me. \"And they've also bought everyone who's for sale. Can't get a conviction there if you bring in the 'leggers smeared with butter and eggs in their mouths.\"\"So you pick on me.\"He nods again. \"Someone who buys from Gelbstein let slip that he used to connect with a guy from out here who used to do lipidlegging into the city. Wasn't hard to track you down.\" He shrugs, almost apologizing. \"I need some arrests to my credit and I have to take 'em where I can find 'em.\"I don't reply just yet. At least I know why he came alone: He didn't want anyone a little higher up to steal credit for the bust. And I also know that Sam Gelbstein didn't put the yell on me, which is a relief. But I've got more important concerns at the moment.I press my palm down on top of the muffin until the melted butter oozes out the sides and onto the counter, then I peel the halves apart and push them toward him.\"Here. Eat.\"He looks at the muffin all yellow and drippy, then at me, then back to the muffin. The aroma hangs over the counter in an invisible cloud and I'd be getting hungry myself if I didn't have so much riding on this little move.I'm not worried about going to jail for this. Never was. I know all about suspended sentences and that. What I am worried about is being marked as a 'legger. Because that means the giraffes will be watching me and snooping into my affairs all the time. I'm not the kind who takes well to being watched. I've devoted a lot of effort to keeping a low profile and living between the lines--\"living in the interstices,\" Gabe calls it. A bust could ruin my whole way of life.So I've got to be right about this guy's poison.He can't take his eyes off the muffins. I can tell by the way he stares that he's a good-citizen type whose mother obeyed all the Lipid Laws as soon as they were passed, and who never thought to break them once he became a big boy.I nudge him. \"Go ahead.\"He puts the shield on the counter and his left hand reaches out real careful, like he's afraid the muffins will bite him. Finally, he grabs the nearest one, holds it under his nose, sniffs it, then takes a bite. A little butter drips from the right corner of his mouth, but it's his eyes I'm watching. They're not seeing me or anything else in the store... they're sixteen years away and he's ten years old again and his mother just fixed him breakfast. His eyes are sort of shiny and wet around the rims as he swallows. Then he shakes himself and looks at me. But he doesn't say a word.I put the butter and eggs in a bag and push it toward him.\"Here. On the house. Gabe will be back any minute with the troops so if you leave now we can avoid any problems.\"He lowers the gun but still hesitates. \"Catch those bad guys in the city,\" I tell him. \"But when you need the real thing for yourself, and you need it fresh, ride out here and I'll see you're taken care of.\"He shoves the rest of the muffin half into his mouth and chews furiously as he pockets his shield and gun and slaps his hat back on his head.\"You gotta deal,\" he says around the mouthful, then lifts the bag with his left hand, grabs the other half muffin with his right, and hurries out into the wet.I follow him to the door where I see Gabe and a couple of the boys from the mill coming up the road with shotguns cradled in their arms. I wave them off and tell them thanks anyway. Then I watch the guy drive off.I guess I can't tell a Fed when I see one, but I can name anybody's poison. Anybody's.I glance down at the pile of newspapers I leave on the outside bench. Around the rock that holds it down I can see where some committee of giraffes has announced that it will recommend the banning of Bugs Bunny cartoons from theaters and the airwaves. The creature, they say, shows a complete disregard for authority and is not fit viewing for children.Well, I've been expecting that and dubbed up a few minidisks of some of Bugs' finest moments. Don't want the kids around here to grow up without the Wabbit.I also hear talk about a coming federal campaign against being overweight. Bad health risk, they say. Rumor has it they're going to outlaw clothes over a certain size. That's just rumor, of course... still, I'll bet there's an angle in there for me.Ah, the giraffes. For every one of me there's a hundred of them.But I'm worth a thousand giraffes.(c) 1978 F. Paul Wilson"},

{"title": "Bits and Pieces", "date": "Sunday, March 6, 2022", "text": "It has been a strange day here in Minnesota.  A normal March includes a blizzard.  Today we had heavy rain, complete with thunder.  The rain turned to ice after dark and then it snowed on top of the ice.  Warm, sunny beaches are looking good about now.But instead of heading to the tropics, I will be canning turkey.  My grocery order goes in Monday for Thursday delivery.  The sale ad featured whole turkeys at 99 cents per pound.  Turkey wasn't that cheap even at Thanksgiving or Christmas.  There is a limit of two and because my freezer is full to the brim, the turkey will go into jars.I am finally able to move about on the knee I popped last week.  Thank you all for your prayers.  But because I spent several days babying the injured knee, I have some catching up to do.  So between now and Thursday grocery delivery, things need to be scrubbed and dusted and all that kind of exciting stuff,  Sigh.But even with all of that, there is still some fun to be had.  I am probably the only person in western civilization who doesn't own a cell phone.  So my son gave me an iPad.  I can now send and recieve texts and I can FaceTime with my family.  Now nearly every day I get a photo from my son of his dog, Oreo, a black and white Aussiedoodle.  I now know that she lugs around a purple hippo toy and she sits on a bench in my sons home office and watches the world go by.  And I have a video of her at the dog park, sniffing squirrel tracks and doing zoomies.  She gives me a smile a day.  :)I have always enjoyed phone calls from my kids and grands, but it is even more fun to see their smiling faces.  I now know that grandson eats cheese crackers doused in hot sauce and granddaughter likes homemade malts.  And their sister gave me a tour of the neighborhood where she lives while attending college.  I really am having fun wth this!  On a more serious note, I am not sure what to make of the Russia - Ukraine thing.  The truth seems to be a scarce commodity.  Some are showing horrifying pictures and videos claiming to have been taken in the middle of battle, only to be proven to be from years ago.  Others tell us to get ready for nuclear war.  I can't change anything about the situation, so I think I will just wait and see what happens and continue on as I always do.One thing I do know for certain is that prices of goods and services are not going down any time soon.  And some of the reports I have heard about farmers having to pay huge prices for fertilizer this year if they can get it all, and that fuel prices are getting to the point of being totally out of reach for many, tell me that there is the possibility of grain shortages.  Whatever I buy today will cost less than it will tomorrow.  Last night I opened a jar of chicken breast that I had canned 5 years ago when I paid 99 cents a pound on sale.  The same chicken is now over $7 per pound.  Who knows what the cost will be in a year.  Even if we are paying more than we did before, it still is a good plan to stock up as much as possible.I can't change it.  But I can be as ready as is possible for whatever 'it' is."},

{"title": "And just like that...", "date": "Saturday, February 26, 2022", "text": "the pandemic is over.  Amazing!I check my local news sources now and then, mostly for amusement.  For the past two years the daily headlines have told us how many new virus cases were reported and how many deaths were attributed to the virus.  Today?  Crickets.I guess there is something new to distract us from the invasion at our southern border, the price at the gas pumps and the empty shelves and higher prices at the grocery store.I have no doubt that the Russian invasion of Ukraine will have an effect on us here in the States.  And in the meantime, I don't see anyone doing a single thing to deal with the problems that directly affect US citizens.So, as long as I cannot change what is happening in the world around me, I will continue to do what I can to make sure my family is taken care of.  This week I canned ham and added pork chops and chicken to my freezer.  My grocery order included paper products, over the counter meds and instant potatoes.  I will continue to stack it as high as possible.I refuse to be one of those people who, when the shelves are bare, will look around and wonder what happened and what are they going to do now.Pray and prepare."},

I thought I would just freeze them forfuture meals.  Turns out there were two roasts in each package andeach package weighed about 15 lbs.  So I canned them and got 13quarts of pork roast.Idehydrated 6 bags each of frozen green beans and frozen broccoli.  I have 10lbs. each of potatoes and onions to dry this week.

But it has morphed into much more than that.Itis now the “Freedom Convoy.”  There are 18-wheelers, some haulingtrailers and some bob tailing.  There are gravel trucks and cementtrucks and pickup trucks, many sporting the Canadian flag and protestsigns.  I even saw a video where farm tractors had joined in.These drivers are on their way to Ottawa to tell their government officialsprecisely what they think of their tyrannical mandates.  And fromwhat I have seen, it looks like these drivers are willing to staythere until things change.  Last I heard, there were 50,000 trucks involved.  I expect that number to grow between now and Saturday.Theyare done.  Done with the masks.  Done with the lockdowns.  Done withthe mandates.  Done with the tyranny.Andso are the Canadian citizens who are standing in the snow and cold –along the roads – on the overpasses – waving flags and carryingsigns and cheering the passing truckers.Andso are the folks who have donated millions to help the drivers payfor food and fuel.  And the ones who are delivering sandwiches andcoffee to the drivers. And the folks  who are opening their homes tothose drivers who would like a shower and a bed for the night.Americans– take a note.  This is what happens when we stop believing whatgovernment tells us.  When we refuse to accept their idea that we areall racist.  When we ignore the fear mongering and get on with livingour lives.Whenwe begin to act like Americans again, we can accomplish wonderfulthings."},

Canning suppliesin my area are nearly nonexistent.  A couple of weeks ago I was ableto score two cases of quart jars.  I haven't seen regular sizedcanning lids for nearly a year.  Thankfully, a dear friend sent me adozen boxes.  I will be filling jars with meat from my freezer andcanning it over the weekend.  Meat doesn't get freezer burned whilein jars.So far, the store where my grocery delivery service shops is reasonablywell stocked, although I have noticed more substitutions for what Iorder than were previously common.  And packaging sizes seem to beshrinking but the prices don't.Mycrystal ball is in the shop, so I have no idea where all of this isleading.

So it is only fair that I tell youwhen I mess up.Acouple of months ago I had extra onions that needed to be used up. So I peeled and chopped them and filled six dehydrator trays.  Whenthe onions were completely dry, I shut the dehydrator off to let themcool before removing them from the trays.Andthen I promptly forgot about them.Untilyesterday.WhenI took the lid off the dehydrator in order to fill trays with orangeslices, only to find myself staring at chopped onions!Theonions sat in the dehydrator for two whole months!Ichecked the onions.  They were still crisp.  There was no mold. There were no creepy crawlers.  I rehydrated some to see if theytasted OK.  They did.  So I packaged them up and put them away.Thereare many websites and videos about dehydrating and storing driedfoods.  Some say mylar bags with oxygen absorbers is the best storagemethod.  Others swear by vacuum sealing and still others use canningjars.Allof the above are good methods but are somewhat beyond my pricerange.  So for the past 10 years or so, I have been putting my driedfruit and veggies into Ziploc freezer bags and storing the bags incardboard banker's boxes.  And there have been no quality issues at all.IfI had a rodent problem in my apartment or if creepy crawlers were aproblem, I would have to use a more robust storage method.  But inthe 25 years I have lived in this building, I have seen no signs ofeither.  And if the dried onions had sat in the dehydrator during themore humid summer months, there may have been a problem.Iam in no way suggesting that others use my storage methods.  I amsaying that in my opinion, possibly some of the newer ways of doingthings aren't totally necessary.  After all, the Native Americans ofa century or more past, sun dried much of their food.  They stored itmostly in clay pots or tightly woven baskets.SoI don't think I will obsess about the method of storage.  I think Iam just very thankful that I have dehydrated food to store for futureuse."},

The teacher's stoolis fitted with wheels.Whileunsupervised in the classroom, this group of 13-year-olds set uptheir stools like bowling pins, sat a kid on the teacher's stool asthe bowling ball and were on their way to a high point bowling gamewhen caught at it.  The school principal had a visit from several 13-year-olds and the parents were informed of their children'sactivities by email.Justyesterday this selfsame 13-year-old somehow found himself inpossession of a snowball in the classroom.  Nobody knows for surejust how this happened, but another visit to the principal's officeand another parental email was the result.Asmy son was relating the snowball story to me today, he said therewere consequences at home for acting up in class.  But he also saidthat he found it disheartening that most teachers expected theirstudents to be carbon copies of one another.Granted,bowling in shop class and a snowball fight in another class probablyweren't the best choices.

I amfinding I have more seal failures when using the newest metal lids,which makes me wonder what has changed in their manufacture.  I knowthe part of the lids that adheres to the rim of the jars is thinnernow than it was on the older lids.  I find I am reluctant to cananything else just now.

Nearly one-third of ourworkforce was unemployed. We had 25 percent inflation and 25 percentbank loan interest rates.Farmersand business people were declaring bankruptcy daily. Young peoplewere going from house to house begging for food. Not that they didn’twant to work; there simply weren’t any jobs.“Mymother was a Christian woman and believed in helping people in need.Every day we cooked a big kettle of soup and baked bread to feedthose poor, hungry people – about 30 daily.’“Welooked to our neighbor on the north, Germany, where Hitler had beenin power since 1933.” she recalls. “We had been told that theydidn’t have unemployment or crime, and they had a high standard ofliving.“Nothingwas ever said about persecution of any group – Jewish or otherwise.We were led to believe that everyone in Germany was happy. We wantedthe same way of life in Austria. We were promised that a vote forHitler would mean the end of unemployment and help for the family.Hitler also said that businesses would be assisted, and farmers wouldget their farms back.“Ninety-eightpercent of the population voted to annex Austria to Germany and haveHitler for our ruler.“Wewere overjoyed,” remembers Kitty, “and for three days we dancedin the streets and had candlelight parades. The new government openedup big field kitchens andeveryonewas fed.“Afterthe election, German officials were appointed, and, like a miracle,we suddenly had law and order. Three or four weeks later, everyonewas employed. The government made sure that a lot of work was createdthrough the Public Work Service.“Hitlerdecided we should have equal rights for women. Before this, it was acustom that married Austrian women did not work outside the home. Anable-bodied husband would be looked down on if he couldn’t supporthis family. Many women in the teaching profession were elated thatthey could retain the jobs they previously had been required to giveup for marriage.“Thenwe lost religious education for kids“Oureducation was nationalized. I attended a very good public school..The population was predominantly Catholic, so we had religion in ourschools. The day we elected Hitler (March 13, 1938), I walked into myschoolroom to find the crucifix replaced by Hitler’s picturehanging next to a Nazi flag. Our teacher, a very devout woman, stoodup and told the class we wouldn’t pray or have religion anymore.Instead, we sang ‘Deutschland, Deutschland, Uber Alles,’ and hadphysical education.“Sundaybecame National Youth Day with compulsory attendance. Parents werenot pleased about the sudden change in curriculum. They were toldthat if they did not send us, they would receive a stiff letter ofwarning the first time. The second time they would be fined theequivalent of $300, and the third time they would be subject tojail.”Andthen things got worse.“Thefirst two hours consisted of political indoctrination. The rest ofthe day we had sports. As time went along, we loved it. Oh, we had somuch fun and got our sports equipment free.“Wewould go home and gleefully tell our parents about the wonderful timewe had.“Mymother was very unhappy,” remembers Kitty. “When the next termstarted, she took me out of public school and put me in a convent. Itold her she couldn’t do that and she told me that someday when Igrew up, I would be grateful. There was a very good curriculum, buthardly any fun – no sports, and no political indoctrination.“Ihated it at first but felt I could tolerate it. Every once in awhile, on holidays, I went home. I would go back to my old friendsand ask what was going on and what they were doing.“Theirloose lifestyle was very alarming to me. They lived without religion.By that time, unwed mothers were glorified for having a baby forHitler.“Itseemed strange to me that our society changed so suddenly. As timewent along, I realized what a great deed my mother did so that Iwasn’t exposed to that kind of humanistic philosophy.“In1939, the war started, and a food bank was established. All food wasrationed and could only be purchased using food stamps. At the sametime, a full-employment law was passed which meant if you didn’twork, you didn’t get a ration card, and, if you didn’t have acard, you starved to death.“Womenwho stayed home to raise their families didn’t have any marketableskills and often had to take jobs more suited for men.“Soonafter this, the draft was implemented.“Itwas compulsory for young people, male and female, to give one year tothe labor corps,” remembers Kitty. “During the day, the girlsworked on the farms, and at night they returned to their barracks formilitary training just like the boys.“Theywere trained to be anti-aircraft gunners and participated in thesignal corps. After the labor corps, they were not discharged butwere used in the front lines.“WhenI go back to Austria to visit my family and friends, most of thesewomen are emotional cripples because they just were not equipped tohandle the horrors of combat.“Threemonths before I turned 18, I was severely injured in an air raidattack. I nearly had a leg amputated, so I was spared having to gointo the labor corps and into military service.“Whenthe mothers had to go out into the work force, the governmentimmediately established child care centers.“Youcould take your children ages four weeks old to school age and leavethem there around-the-clock, seven days a week, under the total careof the government.“Thestate raised a whole generation of children. There were no motherlywomen to take care of the children, just people highly trained inchild psychology. By this time, no one talked about equal rights. Weknew we had been had.“BeforeHitler, we had very good medical care. Many American doctors trainedat the University of Vienna..“AfterHitler, health care was socialized, free for everyone. Doctors weresalaried by the government. The problem was, since it was free, thepeople were going to the doctors for everything.“Whenthe good doctor arrived at his office at 8 a.m., 40 people werealready waiting and, at the same time, the hospitals were full.“Ifyou needed elective surgery, you had to wait a year or two for yourturn. There was no money for research as it was poured intosocialized medicine. Research at the medical schools literallystopped, so the best doctors left Austria and emigrated to othercountries.“Asfor healthcare, our tax rates went up to 80 percent of our income.Newlyweds immediately received a $1,000 loan from the government toestablish a household. We had big programs for families.“Allday care and education were free. High schools were taken over by thegovernment and college tuition was subsidized. Everyone was entitledto free handouts, such as food stamps, clothing, and housing.“Wehad another agency designed to monitor business. My brother-in-lawowned a restaurant that had square tables.“Governmentofficials told him he had to replace them with round tables becausepeople might bump themselves on the corners. Then they said he had tohave additional bathroom facilities. It was just a small dairybusiness with a snack bar. He couldn’t meet all the demands.“Soon,he went out of business. If the government owned the large businessesand not many small ones existed, it could be in control.“Wehad consumer protection, too“Wewere told how to shop and what to buy. Free enterprise wasessentially abolished. We had a planning agency specially designedfor farmers. The agents would go to the farms, count the livestock,and then tell the farmers what to produce, and how to produce it.“In1944, I was a student teacher in a small village in the Alps. Thevillagers were surrounded by mountain passes which, in the winter,were closed off with snow, causing people to be isolated.“Sopeople intermarried and offspring were sometimes retarded. When Iarrived, I was told there were 15 mentally retarded adults, but theywere all useful and did good manual work.“Iknew one, named Vincent, very well. He was a janitor of the school.One day I looked out the window and saw Vincent and others gettinginto a van.“Iasked my superior where they were going. She said to an institutionwhere the State Health Department would teach them a trade, and toread and write. The families were required to sign papers with alittle clause that they could not visit for 6 months.“Theywere told visits would interfere with the program and might causehomesickness.“Astime passed, letters started to dribble back saying these people dieda natural, merciful death. The villagers were not fooled. Wesuspected what was happening. Those people left in excellent physicalhealth and all died within 6 months. We called this euthanasia.“Nextcame gun registration. People were getting injured by guns. Hitlersaid that the real way to catch criminals (we still had a few) was bymatching serial numbers on guns. Most citizens were law-abiding anddutifully marched to the police station to register their firearms.Not long afterwards, the police said that it was best for everyone toturn in their guns. The authorities already knew who had them, so itwas futile not to comply voluntarily.“Nomore freedom of speech. Anyone who said something against thegovernment was taken away. We knew many people who were arrested, notonly Jews, but also priests and ministers who spoke up.“Totalitarianismdidn’t come quickly, it took 5 years from 1938 until 1943, torealize full dictatorship in Austria. Had it happened overnight, mycountrymen would have fought to the last breath. Instead, we hadcreeping gradualism. Now, our only weapons were broom handles. Thewhole idea sounds almost unbelievable that the state, little bylittle eroded our freedom.”“Thisis my eyewitness account.“It’strue. Those of us who sailed past the Statue of Liberty came to acountry of unbelievable freedom and opportunity.“Americais truly is the greatest country in the world. “Don’t let freedomslip away.“AfterAmerica, there is no place to go.”KittyWerthmann*If you think it can't happen here, you aren't paying attention."},

As is my habit, I set the mug in themicrowave and pushed a button.  At which time the microwave gave asad, little 'poof' and died.Ichecked the electric outlet to make sure that was working.  Yep.  Itwas fine.  I was now the proud owner of a very dead appliance.  And Istill had a cold mug of coffee.  That would never do.  In my house,coffee is the elixir of life.Imay have inherited my love of coffee from my Mother.  Growing up, Ican't remember a time when she didn't have a cup of coffee withinreach.  And I remember that when her coffee went cold, she poured itinto a small saucepan and heated it on the stove.  Mother livedbefore microwaves were common.Sothat's what I did.Ialso had filled a small casserole dish with leftovers from supper thenight before, planning to microwave them to eat that evening. Plopped the lid on the dish and into the oven it went for 20 minutes. Supper was served.Gotto thinking about whether I really needed a new microwave.  I fedfour children for many years without one.  I used mine just to reheatsome foods and I have a perfectly good kitchen stove for thatpurpose.  And I really do not care for microwave popcorn.  Popcorntastes much better when popped in a cast iron skillet.Perhapsthe time has come to get back to the basics.  These days it seemslike the future is more uncertain than in recent years.  My parentsand grandparents managed just fine during hard times because theyknew how to do stuff.Myparents were preppers but they just didn't know it.  They had a hugegarden every summer and in the fall the canners were going nearlyevery day, preserving everything from corn and beans to pickles andfruit and jam.  Dad didn't farm, but he either bought or traded forbeef and pork and chickens for the freezer from our farmer neighbors.Theclosest grocery store was ten miles away.  There was no running tothe store for a loaf of bread, especially when the winter blizzardsclosed the roads for days on end.  It was a rare occasion that thebread on the table was not home made.Theynot only survived, my parents and grandparents.  They thrived.  Theyknew how to do what needed to be done without the modernconveniences.I really don't want to go so far as to wash clothes in a washtub using awashboard to scrub them clean, but I know how.  I have done that.Perhapsusing some of the knowledge of the basics might be a good thing.  Atthe very least, we will know if we can take care of ourselves and ourfamilies should hard times come again.  And if we find we can't,maybe it is time to learn."},

I had thoughtto order dry staples and I am, but as I watch my country slide intosomething unrecognizable at an ever increasing pace, I feel as thoughit is time – heat wave or not – to get busy preserving more food.Wholeturkey breast is on sale this week at 99 cents per pound.  There is alimit of 2.  I will roast both of them and freeze the meat in mealsized portions.Bonelesshalf hams are on sale so I am ordering four.  Two will go in thefreezer.  One will go in the fridge for meals and sandwiches.  Andone will be diced  and canned along with diced veggies – cabbage,onions, celery, potatoes and carrots – for a base to use as soup,stew or in casseroles.Fourbags of frozen boneless, skinless chicken breast will go in thefreezer until I decide how to use them.  By the way – I usually buythe store brand chicken breast because I don't care if they areuniform in size or look pretty.  I generally cut them up to fill jarsand can them.  But recently although the price has remained the same,the 3 lb. bags now contain 2.5 lbs.  I have found this practice to betrue in many of the products I buy.Iknow this order will be spendy, but who knows how long meat will beavailable at a price that doesn't require a bank loan.Washingtonmay try to put a spin on inflation, but those of us who actually buyour own goods and services know prices are heading skyward.

So I have to wonder, what's next.  My bestguess is the power grid.Mycrystal ball is broken, so I can not see into the future.  But commonsense tells me that should we lose power, I could lose all the meatthat is left in my freezer.  And there is a substantial amount and itwould cost me a fair amount of cash to replace what I bought at lastyear's prices.Sothe plan was to thaw out much of it tonight and start canning it inthe morning.  Until I took a look at our local weather forecast,which is for temps in the mid 90's for the next several days.  Whenyou live in a three room apartment in a building that was constructedin the late 1800's and has an air conditioning system that sometimesstruggles to keep up, perhaps heating the place up by running a pressure canner is not the smartest move.  A cool down is coming.  Iwill wait.Mostin the prepper community know about flexibility.  Things don't alwaysgo according to plan.  Which is why we usually have a plan B.Thissame three room apartment is sorely lacking in storage space and if Idon't come up with a solution as to where I am going to put theadditions to my preps, I am soon going to be tripping over cases ofcanned goods.Iasked my youngest son to bring me some of those banker's boxes withlids.  Unlike buckets or plastic tubs, the boxes can be folded up andstashed behind the couch when not in use.Threeof the boxes fit in front of my couch.  Three more fit on top of thefirst three.  I plan to spend the next few days filling them mostlywith canned food from the grocery store along with some of my homecanned food.  That will get some of the food off the floor and makewalking through the room where most of it is stored less of a hazard. Each box is labeled as to contents.  Toss a quilt over the boxes,add a couple of books and maybe a potted plant on top and – drumroll, please – a storage coffee table.Eventhough I have been taking time to do some of the things I enjoy –this past week it has been sewing – the need to continue to add tothe stores doesn't go away.  Learning to be flexible and findingpractical solutions to problems are just a part of preparedness.Idoubt things are going to get better any time soon.  The tyrannical politicians, both local and federal, aren't going to relinquish theirpower easily.  We have a better chance of surviving the insanity ifwe can roll with the punches and find solutions to problems.  Thatbeing said, it is my sincere belief that the most important thing ofall is heartfelt prayer."},

They representwhatever special interest group will add the most money to their bankaccounts.  They represent anyone who can give them the most power andcontrol over my life.

I have been called much worseby much better.  And have lived to tell the tale.Iam done with all the nonsense.  If I have learned nothing else overthe past few weeks, it is that life is way too short to allow someoneto suck the joy out of living.Inmy opinion, we need fewer rules and regulations and fear mongering.Wedo need more hugs.  And more time spent over coffee at the kitchentable with friends.  And more conversations on the porch of anevening.  And more family birthday parties.  And more gatherings withfriends at the local pub or restaurant.  And more family outings atthe ball park or the county fair.Weneed to stop listening to the idiots who think they know how to liveour lives better than we do.Iwill still check the headlines for it is a good thing to keep trackof what the enemy is trying to do to us next.  But I flatly refuse tolive in fear.  I refuse to live under the intimidation they are sofond of dishing out.Ina couple of weeks I will have lived 75 years.  I have more time in mypast than in my future.  So I plan to live the time I have left theway I choose to live it.  I will take time to enjoy what makes mehappy.  Conversations with my grown children.  Hugs from my Grands. Cuddling my Great-Grand.  Making quilts.  Crocheting afghans for myGrands.  Reading good murder mystery books.  Watching a beautifulsunrise.  Drinking the first cup of fresh brewed coffee of the day.Iknow that our country is on the verge of collapse should we continuedown the path of the current administration.

I find that living alone, Iwould rather just open a jar for a meal than spend time cooking.  Ifilled my pressure canner with 18 pints, fairly evenly dividedbetween chicken, turkey and beef.  One jar of chicken didn't seal andthat turned into a hot chicken sandwich with mashed potatoes andgravy for supper.Ifound that I still have an abundance of hamburger in the freezer, socanning most of that up is the next canning project.Ithas been at least a year since the old City Hall building across thestreet was torn down and a new 4-story building was put up on theproperty.  It appears to be nearly finished.  The upper three floors are apartments.  That means I need to get busy and get some curtainsup on my living room windows.  It isn't like anything very excitingis happening in my apartment, but the thought that someone could lookin my windows is kind of creepy.Awhile back I made some curtain panels in a scrappy patchwork pattern,but when I tacked one panel up to see how it would look, I found itwould make a better quilt than curtain.Theother day while browsing YouTube channels, I ran across one that hadpatchwork curtains in the background.  The channel is called “TheLast Homely House.\"  I liked the look, so I went through my fabricscraps, got the ones I will use ironed and was ready to start cuttingout little squares of fabric when I discovered my rotary cutter wasnot to be found.Preppers– two is one and one is none.Iwill get started on the curtains as soon as my daughter brings me twonew rotary cutters!Takecare, friends and keep on prepping!"},

We mayignore it for a time, but when we resurface, we find that thelunatics are still in charge, the price of groceries continue toclimb and the need to be prepared hasn't gone away.Ican't remember if I told you about my latest canning supply score. If I am repeating myself, just chalk it up to the ramblings of amemory deficient granny.Thesame guy has been doing my grocery service deliveries for severalyears now.  Being raised on a farm, he understands all about foodpreservation and he knows that I have been seeking canning suppliesfor a long time.Afew weeks ago I got a call.  My delivery guy was in the store,standing in front of a shelf that had been empty but now held allsorts of canning jars.  He wanted to know what size jars I wanted andhow many cases.  I said I would like pint jars and as many cases ashe wanted to lug up my stairs.  He brought me six cases.  The man isa hero!!Mychest freezer is full to the brim.  Between the beef I got last falland the chicken I have been buying when on sale, I would need a shoehorn to get anything else in.  Not complaining, mind you, but thereare things I would like to use now that are buried.  And I have astack of new jars.  Let the canning begin.Tonightthe plan is to set out enough frozen meat to thaw and fill one cannerload of 18 pints.  About 1 lb. of meat will fit in one pint jar.  Meat is the easiest food to can.  Just cut into pieces to fit in thejars and run it through the canner.  And when you are basically alazy cook like I am, being able to crack open a jar of meat to eitherheat and eat as is or to use in any number of recipes, is a pure joy.Ihaven't a clue where I will store the meat, but that doesn't matter. The meat I am canning was purchased at prices far lower than we areseeing in the stores now.  I don't expect to see prices go down anytime soon.  And meat in jars doesn't get freezer burned.  Win –win.Keepstacking it high, my friends.  The inmates are in charge of theasylum at present and as long as this goes on unchecked, I expect wewill eventually need every single crumb."},

So Ipeeled the carrots, cut them into about 1 inch pieces and ran themthrough my food processor.  The result was ground carrots that wereabout the same as coarse sand.  Using the mesh liners, I spread thecarrots out on 9 trays, keeping the thickness to about a quarter ofan inch.  At a temperature of 135 degrees, they dried in about 8hours.  I find they rehydrate quickly in boiling water and shouldwork well in baked goods.Iwish I were one of those people who could keep a kitchen clean whileworking on a project, but sadly, I am not.  Today will be spentfinding the top of my kitchen table and the counter space so that Ican dehydrate 10 lbs. of potato slices tomorrow.Apartmentdwellers seem to be always hunting for space for our food and supplystorage.

I ran dried celery, carrots, bell peppers and mixed veggiesthrough my little coffee grinder.  Since then I have found that I canadd flavor to other foods just by adding a teaspoon or two of thevegetable powders.  I still like the whole dried veggies for soupsand stews, but the powders are handy for flavor without the need torehydrate.  And the powders take up much less storage space.

{"title": " When you lead a quiet life...", "date": "Sunday, February 7, 2021", "text": "it is sometimes a bit difficult to find things to write about.  There is no food preservation activity in between grocery deliveries every two weeks, once I take care of whatever I get to add to my food storage.This past week, for example, I spent a lot of time working on two crocheted afghans I am making for my two youngest Grands.  For me that activity is enjoyable and relaxing.  To most everyone else it is about as exciting as watching grass grow or paint dry.But this morning inspiration hit in the form of something that has become a morning routine.  I always go over to Gorges' Grouse where he daily posts not only memes but also lots of pictures of bygone days.  I find these pictures particularly interesting because many of them depict the time when my Dad was a boy.  I can see what it was like when he worked on wheat thrashing crews as a young man or when he plowed the fields using a team of horses.  I have seen pictures of logging camps like the ones Dad worked in as a young man in northern Minnesota. Gorges includes pictures of people.  We don't always know who they are or the location, but the pictures show how they were dressed and what they did and what the towns and farms where they lived looked like, anywhere from the late 1800's through the 1950's.  Those pictures bring to life some of Dad's stories and I am most grateful for the time and effort Gorges puts into keeping us mindful of those who came before us.So with that in mind, here are a few of my own treasured photos that perhaps someone other than my kids and grands might enjoy.This is my maternal Great Grandmother, Adella Caroline Curtis Paul.  She was born in 1847 in Chenango County, New York.  By 1870 she, her husband Hollis Brayton Paul and their children were living near the town of Barnum, Minnesota.  In this photo she is standing in the doorway of their cabin on their farm.  Her son, my Grandfather, wrote that she loved to stand as she is seen here, watching the sunset of an evening.This is my maternal Grandmother, Gladys Adell Morehouse Paul.  She was born in Minnesota in 1896.  She is shown here relaxing at our \"lake house.\"  Dad had dragged home an old travel trailer, fixed it up and rented a lot on a local lake where we had the best summer ever for kids.  Grandma would often spend a day at what was, tongue in cheek, called our lake house. :)     This is my Grandmother Rachel Alzora Olmstead Matheny (known as 'Allie') shown here with my Dad, her son and with my Mother.  The year is 1946.  She was staying with my parents to help out following my birth.My Grandmother was born in 1870.  As a child she moved from Indiana to Minnesota by covered wagon.  She and my Grandfather moved to northern Minnesota where they farmed and raised their family of 9 children.  In the above photo taken in their front yard, my Great Grandfather is on the far left and my Dad is on the far right.  The photo was taken in the early 1920's.This is a picture of my Dad, held by his sister in front of the first house my Grandfather built on their farm.  Dad told me that when his father built the new house, it was built around the old one, tearing it down bit by bit as the new house went up.  The date is 1911/1912.My Dad is the small kid on the right and his brother is next to him.  Dad told me he had pitched a fit before this picture was taken because he didn't want to get his new overalls wet.  When you are the youngest of 9 kids, a new pair of overalls is a big deal!  This picture was taken about 1917 or 1918.  Many years later I swam in this same lake at this same spot.  This lake was also where in the winter my Grandfather would drive a hay wagon puled by a team of horses out on the ice and cut blocks of ice that they hauled home, packed in straw and kept  in their root cellar.  Those blocks of ice also kept Grandma's ice box cold year round.I hope my kids and grands will enjoy this little piece of family history and thanks to the rest of you for indulging me.At this time when so many are trying to erase or rewrite history, keeping track of our own family history is important.  It is who we are and we need to never forget where we come from."},

{"title": " Canning Stew Vegetables", "date": "Monday, December 21, 2020", "text": "Times past I have canned beef stew.  I am down to just a few quarts of stew, so it was time to can more.I did things a bit differently this time.  Instead of adding beef cubes to the jars, I canned just the vegetables.My grocery order last week included 6 lbs. of carrots, 4 lbs. of onions and 10 lbs. of potatoes.  The vegetables were peeled, sliced and diced.  I wish I had remembered to buy celery, but I have half pint jars of canned celery on the shelf that I can toss into the stew when I heat it.Each quart jar got 1 cup of diced potatoes, 1 cup of sliced carrots, 1/3 cup of diced onions, 2/3 cup of crushed tomatoes and 2 beef bouillon cubes.  Water was added to within 1 inch from the top of the jar and the quarts were processed for 40 minutes at the pressure for my altitude.  Unless it is something like taco meat or chili, I don't use seasonings until I am using the canned food as there are times when seasonings can become bitter or stronger during the canning process.The beauty of this mixture is that it can be used in several ways.  As is, it can be vegetable soup.  Add a pint of canned beef cubes and you have vegetable beef soup.  Thicken the liquid and you have beef stew to serve over biscuits or rice, or as the filling in a pot pie.  I often add a packet of beef gravy mix for extra flavor.  And having all the veggies in one jar makes it possible to make small batches of soup or stew instead of having to open several jars for the same results.I got 14 quarts of vegetable mix.  There were leftovers, and not being one to let anything go to waste, I canned them separately.  I got 9 pints of diced potatoes, 7 half pints of diced onions and 2 half pints of carrots.  They were processed for 40 minutes, which is the longest processing time for one of the vegetables.Now is not the time to slack off on preparing.  Our future right now is uncertain at best.  So after Christmas I think I will can something similar for chicken, omitting the tomatoes.  With power hungry bureaucrats losing their minds over a virus and promising more lockdowns, it is a good thing to have a variety of foods stored to get us through hard times.Keep on praying and prepping!"},

{"title": "Another Canning Marathon", "date": "Friday, November 13, 2020", "text": "My youngest son delivered a quarter beef to me on Wednesday.  For several years he has been getting beef from a farmer who lives just a couple of miles from his house.  The farmer doesn't sell directly to the public, but to a select group of customers.  David still had beef in his freezer so I was able to take that order.  There was a total of 165 lbs. of meat.  I sorted the meat out, setting some of it out to thaw and stacked the rest in the freezer.  David had done the math and with processing and packaging at a local butcher, it came out to less cost per pound than a pound of hamburger at our local big box grocery.  And I really like the idea of supporting a local farmer.So Thursday I spent the day canning meat.  I ended up with 33 pints of hamburger, 3 pints of stew meat and 12 pints of beef roast.  The stew meat and roasts were packed into jars raw.  The hamburger was browned and then packed into jars.  I didn't use any liquid in any of them.  They were all canned for 1 hour and 15 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure for my elevation.So with the meat in the freezer and the meat in jars, I have enough to last my oldest son and I for a long time.  Now is not the time to ease up on prepping.  No matter how the election turns out in the end, I think we are in for a rough time.  As a dear friend often says, \"Stack it to the rafters.  We're gonna need every crumb.\""},
{"title": "My Quiet Life - Not Today", "date": "Monday, November 9, 2020", "text": "Every now and then I have mentioned my quiet life.  Today was not one of those quiet days.My son Duane lives in the apartment next door.  On the other side of his apartment is another, occupied by a younger married couple.  I have not met them, but Duane tells me the wife is a pleasant person who works to support them both.  The husband apparently has some serious mental issues.  Duane has seen him outside in the parking lot back of our building, running around swinging a machete.This afternoon Duane came into my apartment to tell me about what was happening.  He said the guy next door to him had been crashing about in his apartment.  Then Duane saw him in the parking lot, wielding a baseball bat, taking swings at parked vehicles.  Someone called the police.I listened to the scanner for a while to see what was happening.  At one point the guy had a gas can and  lighter and was threatening to set the can on fire.  The police were trying to talk him out of the apartment.  Eventually he did start a fire in the apartment and that was when the talk ended and he was taken out, hopefully to a hospital for some help.The fire department was on stand-by and quickly put the fire out.  But there was a lot of smoke and the building was evacuated.  A firemen helped me down the stairs.  A business owner a couple of doors down the street offered to let Duane and me stay in his office.  It was cold.  It was raining.  We were grateful.When the smoke had cleared, two firemen helped me back up the stairs to my apartment.  My phone began ringing almost as soon as I was back home.  The kids were checking up on their brother and mother.  One of them had driven here but couldn't get close as the streets surrounding my building had been closed off.I am none the worse for wear, with the exception of a bit of embarrassment at walking down the street wearing my floor length robe and big, fuzzy socks over my leg wraps.   If I had known I was going out for the evening, I would have dressed for the occasion.  :)God bless all those, and there were a lot of them, who came to take care of a very bad situation.  And if you are so inclined, please offer a prayer for the fellow who caused all of this.  It must be terrifying to be living with the demons of the mind that would make someone do the things he did.And now, if you please, I will go back to my quiet life."},

{"title": "Are We Ready?", "date": "Sunday, November 1, 2020", "text": "Several people I know have made last minute shopping trips just in case the post election violence threatened by the left leaning crazies comes to pass.  My last grocery order filled in most of the gaps in my food storage.  My order for this week includes fresh fruit and vegetables and items that I would like to have but can live without should the delivery become impossible.  I have also decided to wait on ordering a couple of items online, for the same reason.  If the promised chaos happens, who knows what might happen to my order.And isn't it sad that we are not only held hostage by a pandemic that isn't, but also by those who wish to rip apart a perfectly good nation.  Never in my lifetime have I seen such complete insanity and such efforts to try to keep 'we the people' under the thumbs of those who think they know better than we do on how we need to live our lives.  A pox on them all.In the meantime, life goes on here in my little corner of the world.  Having put off cleaning out my chest freezer for about as long as I could, that is happening now.  I found several freezer bags full of homemade vegetable soup that I thawed and canned, giving me 7 quarts to add to the shelves.  The closer I get to the bottom, the more I am finding stuff that has lived there far too long.  Several bags of squash had to be tossed as well as a badly freezer burned pizza.  Being only a couple of inches over 5 feet tall, reaching the bottom of the freezer is a challenge, but thankfully there is one long, tall son living next door who says he will drag out the rest of what is left in the bottom.  While waiting to see what our future holds, I have been having a bit of fun.  A friend sent me some packets of micro greens seeds and I planted one of them in a shoebox size container of potting soil.  Looks to be about a gazillion tiny plants growing and when they are big enough I will snip them off and use them in a salad.I also dehydrated six bunches of celery last week, so I saved the root ends and set them in another shoebox size plastic container, adding about an inch and a half of water.  I now have celery growing from all six roots, the largest stalks being about 4 inches tall.  I think I will just leave them alone, adding water when needed, and see just how tall they will grow.It obviously takes very little to amuse me.  :)I pray the promised riots do not happen, but I am not counting on it.  Many are taking the threat seriously.  It is reported that Texas has the National Guard on standby in the largest cities.  I have seen reports of other states doing the same.  All across the country store owners are busy boarding up their windows.  Some governors and mayors have recommended that stores stay closed on election day.  If that many folks are taking the threat seriously, we will do the same.  Thankfully, we are stocked well enough to hunker down for a long time, if necessary.  I pray that things stay calm and peaceful, but judging by what this year has already given us, I am not counting on it.Stay as safe as possible, my friends.  Most of us have been prepping for whatever crisis happens.  It is my personal belief that we are on the threshold right now.  I really hope I am wrong."},
{"title": "No Drama Here", "date": "Saturday, October 24, 2020", "text": "This is my quiet time this year.  Everywhere I look around me, there is drama.  Some of it has to do with the upcoming elections.  Some of it has to do with the virus.  Our bonehead of a governor seems determined to keep all of us fearful at least until the election.  To listen to his reports, you would think the streets were littered with bodies.Here in my little apartment, I prefer to stay as drama free as possible.  I still check the news so I can keep track what the enemy is up to, but my life goes on no matter what the current insanity is.I was happily surprised to receive my grocery order this past Thursday in full with no substitutions.  That hasn't been the case for the past couple of months.  Since then I have dehydrated 6 lbs. of frozen corn and 6 bunches of celery.  The dry goods I ordered - sugar, flour, pancake mix, etc. - have been transferred to Ziploc bags and stashed away.  I have never had a problem with bugs or rodents here, but knowing that both like cardboard and paper packaging, I find that putting the food into Ziplocs and then into buckets or tubs insures it stays that way.The canning is on 'hold' until the middle of November when my beef is ready and when, with any kind of luck, Youngest Son will have some venison for me and his brother.  Whenever he has a successful hunt, he shares with us.  We enjoy some venison fresh and I can the rest.As many of you who come here often know, I have Home Healthcare Nurses who come in three times a week to treat my legs.  They are doing a bang-up job, for I have gone from having several open, draining wounds to having none at all for a long time now.  Anyway, my favorite nurse, Caroline, brought me a gift last week.  Her sister had a garage sale where she sold lots of fabric.  Knowing that I sew, Caroline brought me what was left from the sale and wouldn't let me pay a dime for any of it.  There are three pieces of nice, plaid flannel and two pieces of pretty cotton print, each being three yards in length.  I am not sure what to use the cotton print for yet, but I think the flannel will make some nice, cozy pajama pants, or as the more sophisticated than I call them - loungewear.  Bless her heart for thinking of me with such a nice and useful gift!Sometimes I am not completely pleased with being housebound, but this week I am grateful that I don't need to stick my nose outside.  We are having record breaking cold for this time of year in my part of Minnesota, accompanied by about 7 inches of snow earlier in the week.  The local news reported over 700 vehicles involved in fender benders or sliding off the roads into the ditches. Times like these make me especially glad to be a prepper.  I sipped a cup of coffee and watched the snow come down, knowing I already have everything I need right here to weather the storm.Keep on prepping!"},
{"title": "Bits and Pieces...", "date": "Friday, October 16, 2020", "text": "The pressure canner is put away until our quarter beef arrives mid-November.  Although my supply of canning lids has increased this week due to a good friend who surprised me and blessed me with a box containing enough lids for over 150 more jars of canned food, I am still putting off doing any more canning until I see how many lids and jars I need for the beef.  Oldest son has contributed half the price and yesterday we talked about what to can and what to keep in the freezer.  He says canning any kind of steak would be a sin and I tend to agree, but we both decided that we will set aside a few pounds of hamburger and a couple of roasts and can the rest of those.  My chest freezer isn't all that big so canning is the best way to have much of the meat preserved. In the meantime, the dehydrators are getting a workout.  I had dried cut green beans in the past, but decided to try dehydrating French cut green beans.  I had six 1 lb. bags of them, frozen, and they turned out fine.  I tried rehydrating a few in warm water and they actually rehydrated better than the cut green beans.  Even so, I expect I will use these, crumbled, in soups for flavor.My memory, being a bit frazzled around the edges these days, had failed me when I discovered about 10 lbs. of onions in a milk crate stashed in a corner.  Lucky for me, none had gone bad, so I peeled and quartered them and ran them through my food processor.  The idea was not to puree them but to turn them into onion flakes.  They are in the dehydrator and when dried, I will be making onion soup mix using the following recipe:ONION SOUP MIX RECIPE3/4 cup dehydrated minced onion4 teaspoons onion powder1/3 cup beef bouillon powder1/4 teaspoon celery seed1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes2 tablespoons sugarMix all ingredients together and store in an airtight container. Stir each time before using. To make a bowl of onion soup, mix 2 tablespoons in a cup of boiling water. Simmer on low heat for 10-15 minutes. For onion dip, mix 1 tablespoon (or to taste) in one cup sour cream. Let sit for a couple of hours in the refrigerator to allow onions to rehydrate.  Use this mix any way you would use the commercial onion soup mix.In case you hadn't noticed, although I'm pretty sure those of you who stop by here have, the world around us has lost its collective mind.  There are those well paid thugs who like to burn and loot and harass and destroy that are threatening widespread thuggery should their boy lose the election.  There are food shortages as well as shortages of other products on the horizon.  Some of those shortages are already being felt in the stores.  And we have mayors, governors and candidates threatening to shut us all down again due to a virus with an over 98% recovery rate.  Because of the fear-mongering main stream media, we have people too afraid to live their lives normally.I still keep up with the news because it is always good to know what the enemy is up to, but have found that in order to maintain a positive attitude, it has become necessary to limit my time absorbing the news of the day. Instead, most of my time is spent on 'stacking it to the rafters' when it comes to preparing.  And spending time doing what I love - sewing, crocheting, working on scrapbooks and genealogy, reading mystery books, etc.  If I weren't housebound, I expect I would be going for a walk in the park or down along the river, enjoying the beauty of Fall. Fear has turned us into a nation of sacredy cats.  We don't get together with friends or family.  We don't hug.  We mostly hide and wait for some government entity to tell us what to do.  That is just wrong.  It is not normal.  Humans need to be with other humans.  Living in fear shrivels the soul.  We need to just live."},

If that doesn't work, back it goes.Thing is, I could order another pressure canner from Amazon.  They want to charge me $100 over what I paid for the one I have now.  If I am going to spend that kind of money, it will be for an All-American pressure canner.  The manufacturer's website tells me that all the All-American  models are out of stock.So here I am.  I still have 40 lbs. of browned hamburger and no functioning pressure canner.  Good thing I stocked up on rolls of Food Saver bags.  Figured out the size bag needed to hold a pint of hamburger, made up the bags and vacuum sealed the whole works.Things don't always go according to the plan.  And I am beginning to think Murphy has taken up permanent residence in my apartment!  I would much prefer to have the meat in jars on the shelf, but rather than lose it, I went with Plan B - vacuum sealing and freezing.Isn't that what preparedness is all about?  Being as ready as we can be when things don't go according to plan.  Having alternative methods of doing what needs to be done.The solution to a problem might not be ideal, but if the solution works, then we have accomplished what we set out to do.Keep on prepping, even if alternative methods are necessary.  The way things seem to be going, we will need every crumb."},

{"title": " Always Have a Plan - B", "date": "Monday, August 24, 2020", "text": "So here's the deal.  I talked with Youngest Son last evening.  He has been scouting around for a new pressure canner for me since a part on the lid of mine broke.  He has found none.  He says there are no canning jars or lids to be had, either.I could go online and order all the supplies.  Thing is, when you are on a fixed income, choices have to be made.  I am not destitute.  I can pay my rent and my bills, pay for groceries and meds, do what I need to do to live relatively comfortable.  But I have just so much cash set aside for extras.  And at this point, I have decided that the extra cash needs to be spent on food.Things are getting dicey out there, folks.  Weather destroyed a good bit  of the corn crop in Iowa.  Many migrant farm workers are now being tested for the virus and when the tests come back positive as they all do, farms are being shut down.  China is in the middle of a food crisis which then has an effect on our food supply.  Ice Age Farmer has several good videos out about these things, but I have also seen other similar reports.Now maybe these reports are all just fearmongering hype.  But then again, maybe they aren't.  The question is, am I willing to listen to those who think I have taken a swan dive off the edge of sanity with my preparations, or do I pay attention to my gut instinct that tells me I had better kick it into high gear because time is running out.Bottom line.  I will not risk the welfare of my family by doing nothing.So onward with Plan-B.I like having home canned meat in jars because it is fully cooked and often it makes meal preparations easier for me due to my physical limitations.  But there is no reason I can not have the same product in my freezer.I have a FoodSaver.  Oldest Daughter is picking up several rolls of FoodSaver bags for me at Target this week.  The plan is to cook up the pork that is in my freezer along with what comes on my grocery order this week and what Youngest Son is picking up for me at Sam's Club next week.  All of that can be divided into meal sized portions, vacuum sealed and frozen.My grocery order this week includes lots of frozen vegetables that can be dehydrated.  There is a sale on fresh vegetables, so I am ordering cabbage, carrots, celery, bell peppers and onions.  I am not sure yet what I will do with those.  I am still able to water bath can, so I might can some relish or pickle some of the vegetables or some can be dehydrated.  It is all food to add to the stores.  It is all food that will sustain my family if things really do get bad.Flexibility is necessary in these uncertain times.  If Plan-A doesn't work, move on to Plan-B.  Or Plan-C or Plan-D.  Whatever it takes to do what we need to do.Maybe everything will work out.  Maybe the rioters will go back to their Mama's basements and play computer games again.  Maybe those governors and mayors who are drunk on power will back off from their virus mandates and defund the police initiatives and be sensible again.  Maybe life as we knew it will come back.Or maybe not.Pray and prepare, my friends.  Right now, that's all we've got."},
{"title": " Plans - Sigh", "date": "Thursday, August 20, 2020", "text": "So the plan was to take some time off from blogging to do a serious amount of canning.  That was a great plan right up to the time a part on my pressure canner lid broke.  After checking on the cost of sending the lid in for repairs, I found that buying a new pressure canner would cost less.  So Youngest Son went on a quest for a new canner.  And guess what - apparently pressure canners are becoming as scarce as hen's teeth.  He has a couple more places to check and if none can be found in the stores, he says he will order one for me.  As luck would have it, I had not yet thawed the pork in the freezer that I planned to jar up.Pressure canners aren't the only items that seem to be in short supply.  Every two weeks I add canning lids to my grocery order.  I order six boxes of each size.  I am lucky if I get three boxes total.  And I ordered two cases of pint jars and got none.  Thankfully, one of my dear readers sent me a link to order jars and I may need to do that soon.Canning supplies are not all that I am finding in short supply.  As some of you know, due to health issues, I rely on a grocery delivery service, so I am not in stores to see the condition of the store shelves as far as shortages go.  But I am noticing that substitutions within my orders are increasing.  The service I use does not substitute items unless the particular item is not on the shelf at all.  Last week apparently at the store where the service shops, there were no bags of frozen chicken breast, no Dawn dishwashing liquid, no DelMonte sliced peaches and no store brand bowl cleaner in addition to no canning lids or pint jars.  Others that I am in touch with tell me the shortages they see in their areas are different, but are shortages nonetheless.  Methinks the time to seriously stock up is coming slowly to a close.This time away has not been a total loss.  I have been working on an inventory of my food storage.  It is much easier to consult a notebook when doing my grocery order than it is to dig around in my store room to see what I need.  Plus, there is a flaw in my character.  Or in my memory.  At any rate, I have been known to put something away for safe-keeping, only to lose it for all time.  Yep.  I do that.  So now, at the very least, I know what is in the buckets and I know what is stashed under the bed.I have dehydrated home canned tomatoes for turning into powder.  If canning jars continue to be hard to get, I may do more, just for the empty jars.  I have been researching Do-It-Yourself projects to replace some of the items I may not be able to get, should the shortages get worse.  I have found instructions for several that I will tell you about as I give them a try.And I have been getting some sewing done, particularly a baby quilt for my soon to be born Great Grandbaby.  That job is just fun.  And Lord knows, we all could use a little fun in our lives to counter all the insanity around us.  I will post a picture when it is finished - probably next week.That's all I know today.  I pray all of you are well.  Take good care and continue to pray and prepare."},
{"title": "Taking Time Off", "date": "Sunday, August 2, 2020", "text": "I am taking a couple of weeks off from blogging to concentrate on food preservation.  There is pork from a good grocery sale to thaw and can.  There are hashbrowns and tomatoes to dehydrate.  There is close to 100 lbs. of flour to repackage and store.  And that is just for starters.  I have a quarter beef coming this fall from a local farmer, so the freezer needs to be cleaned out and anything that can be canned or dehydrated needs to be taken care of.  And my sons are planning another Sam's Club run.  And I have another grocery delivery in a week and a half.If you think for one little bitty minute that things are going to go back to what we considered normal, think again.  We are told we have to 'social distance' and wear masks, but the riots continue unabated.  No social distancing there.I read in the local news that shootings are a nightly occurrence in Minneapolis.  There was a time not all that long ago that as far as large cities go, Minneapolis was one of the more decent ones.  Now that the 'defund the police' movement has reared its ugly head and law enforcement is no longer allowed to do the job we pay them to do, anything goes and the criminals are deliriously happy with that.  Citizens - not so much.Between the riots and mayhem that Democratic leaders are allowing to happen and the fear being perpetuated by the left over a virus with a 99% recovery rate, the normal world we grew up in is fading fast.If you think the Dems will not use every dirty trick in the book and will make up a few more in order to gain power over us, you are delusional.  Time is short.  If we are not now doing all we can to take care of our families, then shame on us.  That is why I am taking time to can and dehydrate and stock up on other supplies necessary to see my family through what is ahead.  I will be back when I am caught up on what needs doing.Churches have been closed but so far as I know, there is not a ban on prayer - yet.  Pray and prepare like never before."},
{"title": "Experiment Fail - Sort Of", "date": "Monday, July 27, 2020", "text": "Whenever I experiment with my food storage and the experiment works, I am quick to pass the information on to you.So when an experiment doesn't work so well, the only fair thing to do is to let you know what happened.I had this grand idea.  I often have grand ideas.  Some work.  Others don't.  This one sort of worked but not really.  I will explain.I have one shelf full of mostly home canned tomatoes and some cans of commercially canned tomatoes.  I also have a box full of bags of dehydrated tomatoes.  Toss into the mix several recipes for using tomato powder.The grand idea was to use dehydrated tomato powder to make often used tomato products, thus saving shelf space.  If the experiment worked, a good deal of the canned tomatoes could be dehydrated and the shelf space used for those cases of food sitting on the floor for want of space to put them.So I spent an afternoon running dried tomatoes through my handy, dandy little electric coffee grinder, reducing them to powder. The next day I made up a batch of each recipe.  And each recipe worked just like advertised.  The down side was the taste.  I expected them to taste just like the tomato products from the store shelves.  They didn't.The reasons are numerous.  Perhaps I left the tomatoes in the dehydrator too long and that had an effect on the taste.  Or maybe my expectations were too high.  I was ready to scrap the whole thing.But after thinking about it for a day or so, it occurred to me that the ketchup made with tomato powder might not taste just like bottled ketchup, but what if bottled ketchup was no longer available.  Anything is possible in our troubled times and with the food shortages happening across the country.  Ketchup that isn't exactly like bottled is still useful should it be all I have.So I will continue with the experiment.  Most of my home canned tomatoes are going into the dehydrator.  Shelf space gained will be put to good use.  Below are the recipes.  You can decide for yourself if this alternative to tomato products is right for you.Tomato Paste6 Tablespoons tomato powder1/2 Cup waterEquals one 6 oz. can.Tomato Sauce2/3 Cup tomato powder2 Cups waterEquals a bit more than one 15 oz. can.Tomato Juice1 Cup tomato powder8 Cups waterEquals one 64 oz. bottle.Ketchup1/2 Cup water6 Tablespoons tomato powder1/4 Cup cider vinegar1/2 teaspoon each salt, oregano, cumin1/8 teaspoon pepper1 teaspoon dry mustardBBQ Sauce6 Tablespoons tomato powder3/4 Cup water1-1/2 Cups brown sugar1/2 Cup vinegar1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce2-1/2 teaspoons dry mustard2 teaspoons paprika1-1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt1 teaspoon pepper1/2 teaspoon oregano1/2 teaspoon cuminBring to a simmer.  Cool and refrigerate.Tomato Soup6 Tablespoons water + 4 Tablespoons flour1/4 Cup water + 3 Tablespoons powdered milk4-1/2 Cups water2/3 Cup tomato powder4 Tablespoons brown sugar2 teaspoons saltMix four and water until smooth.Mix water and dry milk until smooth.Heat 4-1/2 Cups water until almost boiling.Whisk in tomato powder and heat on medium low to a simmer.Whisk in flour/water mix.Add brown sugar and salt and mix well.Heat to almost boiling.Turn off heat and stir in milk/water mix.Spaghetti Sauce1/2 Cup tomato powder1 Tablespoon onion flakes1-1/2 teaspoon each dry parsley, basil, oregano and Italian seasoning1-1/2 teaspoon each salt and garlic powder1/4 Cup brown sugarSimmer 1 hour.So there you are.  If anyone gives this a try, please let me know how it works for you.  And as always, pray and prepare."},
{"title": "Let's Call it a Protest", "date": "Friday, July 24, 2020", "text": "On the heels of a mandatory, state wide mask order by the communist governor of Minnesota, a friend wrote the following piece.  He is a Viet Nam Vet, a retired policeman and someone who has my complete trust and respect.\"I was asked why I don’t take Covid and the mask situation seriously. I said that I do take the virus seriously. I believe the people who are disseminating the information to us have a long, long track record of lying to and showing dismissive contempt for American citizens as a whole.At one point, the disease was supposed to have a 5% death rate. The death rate has now been reduced to less than 1/3 of 1% worldwide. The truth is I’m not opposed to masks at all. Much like carrying a firearm, I won’t shame anyone for deciding to wear one or not. Sort of a “my body, my choice” situation I suppose.However, when considering the trustworthiness of information coming from our politicians, I’ve been unable to reconcile the fact that 200,000 people protesting in the streets is met with little to no concern, but a bar, restaurant or hair salon with 10 people in it could be disastrous. The idea that a Trump rally of 18,000 people is a significant risk but a group of 20,000 students tearing down statues isn’t, leaves me perplexed.Further, how could you possibly take anyone seriously who mandates that free citizens stay at home and wear masks in public but also calls for the acceptance of millions of immigrants entering our society illegally with no record of immunizations against more common and deadly diseases every day.The truth is that our political “leaders,” just like with guns, drugs, our national debt or sex trafficking, have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about and no plan outside of what’s handed to them 6 seconds before they reach the podium.So I choose to protect myself as I see fit. If anyone doesn’t like it, I’m ok with that. Just think of it as a “protest.” That seems to be ok with many people.\""},

{"title": "I've Been Busy", "date": "Tuesday, June 23, 2020", "text": "My groceries were delivered this past Thursday.  I am concentrating on food storage, so there were bags of sugar and flour and rice.  There were some odds and ends of canned tomatoes and fruit to fill in some gaps on the shelves.I ordered 4 lbs. of carrots thinking I would cube them and dehydrate.  I keep much of my dehydrated food in freezer Ziploc bags stored in cardboard banker's boxes.  When I checked the box of dry carrots, I found it was full to the brim, so I cut the carrots into chunks and canned 7 pints.Next were 4 bunches of celery.  I have never been able to successfully rehydrate celery.  It doesn't seem to matter if I blanch it or not, I always wind up with rock hard bits.  So now I just slice it and dehydrate.  When dry, I run it through my small coffee grinder, turning those hard pieces into powder.  I get the taste of celery without the unwanted rock hard crunch.Next was 4 lbs. of pinto beans.  I soaked them overnight, filled each pint jar about 2/3 full, added a teaspoon of onion flakes made from my home dried onions and a beef bouillon cube for flavor.  This was topped off with a scant 1/3 cup of shredded ham.  I added broth from cooking the ham and processed the jars for 75 minutes.  I had one jar that didn't seal, so I used that for a taste test.  I like it.The first canner load held 16 pints of ham and beans.  I had three pints leftover, so I sorted and washed 2 lbs. of Great Northern beans, put 1/2 cup of the dry beans in each pint jar along with the rest of the shredded ham and seasonings.  I used water for the liquid and processed them as for the first load.All totalled, I got 19 pints of pinto beans and ham and 14 pints of Great Northern beans and ham.  Not exactly gourmet fare, but it will certainly fill empty stomachs!I still have 10 lbs. of potatoes to dehydrate, but that will keep for another day.Many of us grow gardens that provide us with vegetables and fruit to preserve.  I love the pictures folks post and the articles they write about their gardening efforts.  Takes me back to a time when I could do the same.  But there are also many of us who are not in a place where we can garden.  That doesn't mean we can not build up a deep pantry.Some who were raised in the country like I was, tend to scoff at those who do not garden, home can and preserve.  I'm pretty sure we would all prefer home grown, organic.  But I'm here to tell you that in the end, it doesn't matter.  If the only means available to store food is to buy extra cans of food at the grocery - do it.  If your only source for meat is the grocery - buy it and freeze it. Take a good, hard look around.  See those meat processing plants shut down due to the virus?  See those truckers who refuse to go into those areas where they do not have police protection?  See those thugs who are burning and looting?  What makes you think you will not be affected?I don't care what the reason is for preparing.  But prepare we must.  For if this assault on our country continues to escalate, what you have on your shelves may be all there is.Pray and prepare."},

{"title": "Just For The Record", "date": "Wednesday, June 3, 2020", "text": "Minnesota has taken a hit in the media for over a week.  Here are a few facts about my home state.First and foremost, any Minnesotan with an ounce of human kindness in their soul finds the death of Mr. Floyd horrifying and completely unacceptable.  We agree that those responsible need to be held accountable.Yes, we have a governor who would rather sit on his hands and watch our cities burn than to take action to stop the rioting, looting, arson and general mayhem.  It was obvious that on the first night, those who were peacefully protesting were hijacked by thugs and criminals.  And yet it took days of dithering by our governor before any decisive action was taken.  And while he was deciding if calling up the National Guard was in his best interest poitically, those he should be protecting were forced to watch the businesses they worked hard to create and maintain, burn to the ground.  If he had even a shred of common decency, he would be too ashamed to show his face in public.As far as the Mayor of Minneapolis goes, I would be amazed if he could find his own backside with both hands and a flashlight.  Why a mayor would give a 'stand down' order to his police force while his city is on fire and stores are being looted, is beyond comprehension.  I believe the position of dog catcher is probably more suited to his capabilities, but even that is doubtful.There are bad people in every walk of life.  One bad cop does not a bad police force make.  Yes, there needs to be accountability for those who make their own rules and hurt those they are sworn to protect.  But most are honorable and do the right thing in any situation.The cities are filled with those of the liberal persuasion.  Many seek to tear down the lifestyle we know and love, only to replace it with nothing short of Communism.  But once you leave the shadow of the cities, you will find those who are God loving, hard working and independent thinking.  We don't believe the hogwash from main stream media.  We do believe in the Rule of Law.  We believe in the Constitution.  Even in the cities you will find those who are out sweeping glass from the sidewalks, scrubbing the vile graffiti from storefronts, checking on their neighbors, donating food to those who no longer have a grocery store nearby because some thug set it ablaze.  These are the true Minnesotans.  The ones who help clean up after the animals have destroyed everything in their paths.  The ones who make sure their elderly neighbor has food.  The ones who take their kids to Sunday School and Church.  The ones who teach their kids to be hard working, responsible, good human beings.  That's who the real Minnesotans are."},

In these uncertain times, it doesn't matter that there were other things I wanted to do this weekend.  What matters is that I need to do whatever is necessary to feed my family.  And if you think things will be just fine, you really need to take a look at the two videos posted over at \"Thoughts from Frank and Fern.\"  If they don't wake us up to what is in store for us, I doubt anything will.Pray and prep, my friends.  We need a whole lot of both."},

My boys are planning an excursion to Sam's Cub in the not too distant future.  They won't let me go.  When I was exposed to the virus, Duane was checking up on me often and David was calling every day wanting to know what my temperature was.  No way will they take me to a big box store full of people.  Just as well, I suppose.  But it grates on me to have to admit that I am in the 'elderly and vulnerable' catagory.  Sigh.However, I am going through Sam's website and making a list.  The plan is to break down the large containers of frozen food and vacuum seal individual portions. And I trust them both to make good choices as to what I would like to have.  Bless all four of my kids.  They always come through when I need something done.That's about all I know today.  I truly hope you all are able to be out and about enjoying some sort of normalcy.  We so badly need to just get on with our lives."},

Pray.  We might be in a long, dark tunnel, but I have to believe there is a light at the end of it.  And never, ever give up."},

{"title": "So Now What...", "date": "Monday, March 23, 2020", "text": "Now that we are officially a shelter in place, social distancing nation, what are we doing to cope.First off, my oldest son who lost both his jobs when restaurants were closed here in Minnesota, has been called back to work three days a week.  It seems the carry-out business at the bar & grill is booming.  He was pleased, as three days a week are far better than no days a week!I talked with my oldest daughter over the weekend.  She is working from home. Her son is home from college and will be taking his classes online.  I am relieved he is home rather than still at school.  They have a table set up with a huge jigsaw puzzle on it.  My family for the most part are avid readers, so books play an important part in passing the time.  Jill said if I need anything, she will get it for me and leave it outside my aprtment door.  She is taking this virus thing seriously.My youngest granddaughters, both teens, called me.  Both will be happy when they are no longer under \"house arrest.\"  Being teens, they miss spending time with their friends, but are able to stay in touch via phone and computer.  Apparently their Dad is keeping them busy with some household chores and they are seriously considering shredding his 'To Do' list.  :)My youngest daughter is in Montana where her boyfriend is doing some construction work.  They are just fine, but I hope they are able to get back home to Minnesota fairly soon.  I have heard rumors of travel bans between states.  I hope that is just rumor, but those two are well equiped to cope with whatever comes their way and for that, I am grateful.Me...aside from limiting access by others to my apartment, life continues as it has the past couple of years when I have been mostly housebound.  I have decided to put a hold on canning and dehydrating for a time.  I don't want to be one of those people who selfishly clears a store shelf, leaving nothing for others.  I had become lazy about baking bread but the baking will commence this week.  The bread on the store shelves can be used by those who don't know how or can't, for one reason or another, bake their own bread.  I am keeping my grocery order as close as possible to the items on sale, with only minimum amounts of staples like milk and eggs.  Luckily, I have enough food stored that if I am unable to get groceries, we will be just fine for a long time.I find that although I am a bit of a news junkie, I am in danger of being overwhelmed by the virus news everywhere, all the time.  So I read enough to keep myself informed, but then move on to other things. I do think there are some positive effects of this shelter in place thing.  Families are spending time with each other rather than everybody going off in oppposite directions.  Meals together as a family that had nearly become a thing of the past, are now happening.  I wonder if some will find the benefits of online classes outweigh the costs of physically attending a university.  Homeschooling of younger kids might see an upturn. In my travels through cyberspace, I have noticed that there are those who thought preparedness was something to laugh at, have now had a 'come to Jesus' moment when they were caught without enough food or water.  Granted, grocery stores are still open, but there are shortages on all levels and no guarsntees that supplies will reach their intended destinations.  And those who relied on restaurants for most of their meals are finding life has changed considerably for them.My street is still very quiet.  There are only two cars parked on a street that is usually full.  At the construction site across the street, I saw one construction worker walking about.  All the cranes and other equipment are parked in a row.  Even the kids on skateboards have vanished. That being said, we will get through this.  We are Americans and Americans are some of the most resiliant, determined and resourceful people on the planet.  We didn't forge this nation of ours by curling up in a corner and sucking our thumbs when things got bad.  We met each crisis head on and we will do so again.One thing that gives me hope is how some are reaching out to help those who are the most vulnerable.  My grocery service that is run by volunteers, will continue to see to it that their clients get what they need to stay healthy and survive.  I have heard of individuals who are quietly and without fanfare, preparing and delivering meals to neighbors who need help.  Others are volunteering their services to pick up much needed medicines at pharmacies and deliver them to those who need them. We can do this.  We are all in this together.  God bless."},

{"title": "Chicken Noodle Soup", "date": "Saturday, February 29, 2020", "text": "One of my parent's remedies for nearly anything that ailed us as kids, was chicken noodle soup.  It is still my 'go to' soup for times when I am feeling a bit under the weather.  Or for when I just want a bowl of soup.The price of a can of soup has increased considerably since I was young.  When a person is living on a fixed income, price often matters.  The ingredients matter as well, and I am getting more and more interested in the chemicals included in processed foods.  I would rather know for sure what I am consuming.So I made my own soup and canned it.Frozen boneless, skinless chicken breast was on sale so I got nine pounds.  The easiest way for me to cook that amount was to spread the meat out on parchment paper lined cookie sheets and bake until they were cooked through.  After the meat cooled, I cut it into about 1/2 inch dices.Each pint jar got 1/2 cup of chicken, 2 chicken bouillon cubes, a 1/2 teaspoon each of celery powder and onion powder (both made by grinding up my dehydrated celery and onions) and water enough to leave about 1 inch of headspace.  The soup was processed in my pressure canner for 65 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure for my elevation.  I got 36 pints of soup and have enough chicken left over to mix with the leftover BBQ sauce from canning BBQ pork and can that for BBQ chicken sandwich filling.Pasta doesn't can well, so when the jars of soup had cooled overnight and had been washed and labeled, I broke angel hair pasta into about 1 inch pieces, put a heaping 1/4 cup of pasta into snack sized ziploc bags and taped the pasta bags to the outside of each jar.I taste tested a jar of the soup, adding the pasta to cook while the soup heated.  I have to admit, it is some really good chicken noodle soup.  Unlike commercially canned chicken noodle soup, this soup has plenty of chicken pieces and even using the bouillon cubes, it doesn't have a salty taste.Comfort food in a jar.  Doesn't get much better than that."},

Onepound bags of rice were on sale, so I ordered 6.  I had seen a coupleof videos showing how to make instant rice.  According to theinstructions, the rice is rinsed, cooked and spread on mesh lineddehydrator trays and dried.  To use, it is said that when boilingwater is added, it rehydrates quickly.  I'll let you know how itworks.Another dehydrating experiment I havebeen wanting to try is dehydrated pasta.  Jennifer over at 'PrepSchool Daily' has instructions to do this.  Her article on thesubject tells us why we would want to have dehydrated pasta inour food storage.  She also has recipes for instant meals using thedehydrated pasta.

I also told her that if the virus spreads much further here in the States, there would be a list of protocols that I would expect to be precisely followed upon each nurse's visit.  She didn't look pleased, so I reminded her that at age 73, my lungs are wrecked and that I am on oxygen 24/7 and use a nebulizer 3 times daily, just to be able to breathe normally.  A virus like this one for which there is no cure is apt to kill me off.Folks, I am absolutely astounded that people working in the health care field are so completely oblivious to the known details of this virus.  I am not saying it will reach epidemic proportions.  But it could.And one of the reasons it could is that people are not paying attention."},

What prompted my conversation with the nurse was an email I received today from my best source of information.  The following was published by the American Trucking Association.  There could be any number of reasons for the trucks to stop running, but right now the threat of the virus spreading, quarantines being put into effect and trucks being kept out of the quarantined areas is what is on the minds of many.  Here is what I found in my friend's email.\"When Trucks Stop, America StopsA Timeline Showing the Deterioration of Major Industries Following a Truck StopageThe first 24 hours:*Delivery of medical supplies to the affected area will cease.*Hospitals will run out of basic supplies such as syringes and catheters within hours.*Radiopharmaceuticals will deteriorate and become unusable.*Service Stations will begin to run out of fuel.*Manufacturers using just-in-time manufacturing will develop component shortages.*U.S. mail and other package delivery will cease.Within one day:*Food shortages will begin to develop.*Automobile fuel availability and delivery will dwindle, leading to sky-rocketing prices and long lines at the gas pumps.*Without manufacturing components and trucks for product delivery, assembly lines will shut down putting thousands out of work.Within two to three days:*Food shortages will escalate, especially in the face of hoarding and consumer panic.*Supplies of essentials - such as bottled water, powdered milk, and canned meat - at major retailers will disappear.*ATM's will run out of cash and banks will be unable to process transactions.*Service stations will completely run out of fuel for autos and trucks.*Garbage will start piling up in urban and suburban areas.*Container ships will sit idle in ports and rail transport will be disrupted, eventually coming to a standstill.Within a week:*Automobile travel will cease due to the lack of fuel.  Without autos and busses, many people will not be able to get to work, shop for groceries, or access medical care.Within two weeks:*The nation's clean water supply will begin to run dry.Within four weeks:*The nation will exhaust its clean water supply and water will be safe for drinking only after boiling.  As a result gastrointestinal illness will increase, further taxing an already weakened health care system.This timeline presents only the primary effects of a freeze on truck travel.  Secondary effects must be considered as well, such as inability to maintain tellecommunications service, reduced law enforcement, increased crime, increased illness and injury, higher death rates, and likely, civil unrest.\"The full report can be viewed Here.I'm not saying this virus is going to turn into a pandemic.  But what if...."},

{"title": "On \"New Normals\"", "date": "Sunday, February 9, 2020", "text": "My Grandmother cooked all the family meals from scratch.  She kept an immaculate household.  She canned produce from her garden and fruit from local fruit trees and fruit that grew wild in the surrounding woods.  She baked her own bread.  She sewed dresses for her daughters and shirts for her son.  She did all this while raising seven children.  She passed this knowledge and way of life on to my mother who in turn, passed it on to me.Those of us who were raised in the old ways had a tendency to carry on as those before us had.  We worked from dawn to dusk.  And if our home was on a farm, the days were even longer and the work, harder.  But we didn't think about that, for we were young and would undoubtedly live forever.And now we are old.  Now we know better.I have a dear friend with whom I exchange frequent emails.  We both have chronic health issues.  Because neither of us feels sorry for ourselves or for the other, we occasionally discuss the 'new normals' of our lives.  It sometimes helps to talk with another person who understands.Last week I came to the realization that I have reached another 'new normal.'  Having been a home canner since the age of 12 when I helped my mother with that activity as she became the victim of dibilitating rheumatoid arthritis, it is hard for me to accept the fact that canning has become difficult at best.  Lifting the heavy canner, standing at the sink preparing some foods to can, lifting the jars of food from the canner, all are no easy tasks these days.  My 'new normal.'The point of this post, however, is not to whine about my limitations.  I know there must be others out there who are going through their 'new normals.'  And I am here to offer encouragement.We were raised to believe we could do it all.  And many of us did, for years.  But life happens.  We thought it shameful to use food from a can or a box rather than cook from scratch.  The shameful thing is if we use our limitations as an excuse not to prep.  Here are some of the things that can be found in my deep pantry:boxes of Mac & Cheesescalloped potato mixescans of fruitcans of vegetablesboxes of Bisquickcans of corned beef hashcans of Spampackets of rice and pasta mixespackets of muffin mixesboxes of pancake mixTrue, I did can up a ton of food while I still could, but these days my canning is limited mostly to canning meat.  And that is due to the cost of commercially canned meats.  And meat is easy to can.  And often my son is willing to give up his day off to help.Here's the deal.  We may have limitations.  We have to adjust to our own 'new normals.'  But that doesn't mean that we have to give up on preparing.  With everything that is going on in the world around us, failing to prepare could mean the difference between surviving or dying.Me...I'm going to do whatever it takes to live long enough to be a problem to my children.  It has been said by a somewhat cheeky daughter that I have acheived that goal, but I don't think so.  Not yet!"},
{"title": "A Quiet Day", "date": "Wednesday, February 5, 2020", "text": "Now and then we of a certain age and with a few body parts that seem to be failing us, need a quiet day to recoup and revive.  Today is such a day.Not that I am sitting, staring out the window.  Nope.  There are still things I can do on a quiet day.Oldest Son was here yesterday and we went through my canning shelves and deep pantry, making decisions on what was needed and what we have plenty of.  I've got lots of home canned meats and vegetables and soups/stews along with some fruit.  I have more canning to do before spring.  The shelves are more than full, with several cases of bacon, baked beans and ham and bean soup sitting on the floor in front of the shelves.  Duane has already taken several cases of home canned food over to his apartment, but he said he would swamp out another area where he can store more.  That will really help. So we decided to concentrate on the staples like sugar, flour. powdered milk, etc.  And we really need to ramp up the first aid supplies, for we don't have nearly enough.So I spent part of the day making lists of what is needed so I will have a handy reference for my grocery orders and a future Sam's Club adventure.  I am no longer foolish enough to rely on memory alone.  After all, I can go from one room to another and forget why in the process.  :)I also spent time transferring recipes from my computer to index cards.  It occurred to me that should we lose power, the recipes - especially the ones for canning or for dry mixes - would be lost.  I do have a printer but am out of printer paper.  Index cards take up less space than do binders filled with paper.  I also have an external hard drive, but without electricity, that becomes a doorstop.I also checked out some web sites dealing with the Coronavirus.  There are a number of 'hair on fire - we're all gonna die' sites, but there are some that are taking a common sense approach to the problem.  While the virus doesn't seem to be spreading here as quickly as in China, officially we have doubled in the past two days the number of known cases here in the States, to 12.  One of those is in Wisconsin, which is too close to me for comfort.  I am still of the opinion that the truth is not being told to the public, world wide.All in all, it was a fairly productive quiet day and with any luck at all, I will be back to my normal turtle racing speed in the morning.  :)Take precautions to stay healthy and keep on prepping."},
{"title": "I Don't Want To Adult Today", "date": "Monday, February 3, 2020", "text": "As I sit here at my desk this morning, looking at my checkbook and a stack of bills, it occurs to me that I just don't want to adult today.  I would much rather go back to when I was about 8 years old.If it were summertime, the 8 year old me would be playing a game of Jacks with my best friend.  Or maybe Hopscotch on the sidewalk.  Or I might be found hiding among the branches of the crab apple tree reading a Nancy Drew Mystery or a Bobsey Twins book, with the added pleasure of having some of the best tasting crab apples on the planet within easy reach.Or I might be found knee deep in the creek, sailing pieces of wood and pretending they were boats sailing off to distant exotic lands.  Or maybe at the lake practicing my swimming strokes.If it were wintertime, there were snowmen to be built, complete with coal for eyes and a carrot nose.  Or the building snow forts where epic snowball battles raged.If I were at my Grandma's house, there would be sledding with my cousins down the hill in the cow pasture, made all the more exciting by having to dodge the large rocks and tree stumps.But the best part of winter was ice skating.  There was the outdoor ice rink down by the elementary school where an 8 year old girl could practice to be an Olympic champion.  Those hopes were dashed with the realization that I probably would never skate backwards without falling down.Then there was the small ice covered lake near Grandma's house where Dad had skated as a young boy.  He told me of skating on a very windy day.  He opened the front of his coat and held the fronts out like airplane wings.  The wind caught his 'wings' and propelled him across the lake.  Having tried that myself, I learned he was right when he said the ride across was fun, but skating back against the wind was a bugger.So here I am.  Bills and checkbook in front of me.  I am not 8 years old any more.  If I want a roof over my head I suppose I had better write that rent check and if I want my life to continue without bill collectors bothering me, I expect I had better be the adult and take care of business.But oh, the memories.  They are sweet."},
{"title": "The Time is Now", "date": "Friday, January 31, 2020", "text": "There is no good time to slow down on the preps.  With all that's going on in the world now, we need to be as prepared as possible.  The cold, hard fact is, when disaster strikes, we are on our own.  Take a look at China.  Millions of people are locked in their homes under quarantine from the virus that has spread all across China, with no way to get food when theirs runs out.  If you think that can't possibly happen here, I envy your ability to happily live in a land of fairy dust and unicorns.  But most of us here live in the real world.  We take precautions.  We prepare.  And because we do, our chances of survival are better than most.  But if you think you can start preparing tomorrow, you will find that once the crisis hits, supplies will be gone from the store shelves within a couple of days.Earlier this week I canned 12 quarts of Great Northern beans.  The reasoning behind doing this is that in a situation where I would need to cook on my camp stove, it takes much less fuel to heat beans than it does to cook them from scratch.  And cooking dry beans from scratch takes more water which also might be at a premium.  I used the easy method which is putting 1 cup of dry beans in each quart jar and then filling the jar with water.  I also dropped one chicken bouillon cube in each jar to add a little bit of flavor, and processed the beans for 90 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure for my altitude.  When I can dry beans in pint jars, a half cup of dry beans go in each jar and the time is 75 minutes.  They came out perfect.My grocery order arrived yesterday.  Included were 8 lbs. of fresh carrots.  I have lots of sliced or diced carrots on the shelf, but I like larger chunks of carrots for making candied carrots or stew.  So I peeled the carrots to get rid of any chemicals that commercially grown carrots were probably sprayed with to prevent them from sprouting.  Garden fresh carrots would only need to be well scrubbed.  The carrots were cut into about 1 1/2 inch pieces and they filled 14 pint jars, which are happily bubbling away in my pressure canner.  If I were canning quarts they would need 30 minutes in the pressure canner.I have a couple of items on the canning 'to do' list to work on over the weekend before deciding what to include in the next grocery order for my food storage.  I'm thinking it might be a good idea to can up some kidney beans.  It is cheaper to can them myself than to buy them already canned and I know what's in them.  I could use more dehydrated potato slices so I will order potatoes as well.  It's all good."},

{"title": "Ode to a Bus Driver", "date": "Wednesday, January 22, 2020", "text": "I saw this photo among the memes Gorges over at Gorges' Grouse that he posts daily and which I thoroughly enjoy.  So I stole it.  Gorges says it is OK with him.The bus reminded me of a couple of stories told me by my Dad.  He had, in the late 1930's or early 1940's, driven a school bus in the wilds of northern Minnesota.  Dad had his own methods of  dealing with problems that can arise among students on a bus ride.Dad said there were two teenage boys on his bus route who couldn't seem to get through the ride home without fighting with one another.  When \"Don't make me come back there\" no longer worked, Dad pulled the bus off to the side of the road, hauled both boys out of the bus and onto the grass along side.  Then he told them to fight.  When they just stood there looking dumbfounded, Dad proceeded to show them how to stand and how to position their arms in order to sock one another in the nose and repeated his order to fight.  All the while, the rest of the kids on the bus were at the windows, laughing at the two would be fighters.  Dad said the two boys, thoroughly humiliated, both climbed back on the bus, quietly sat down and never after gave him another minute's worth of trouble.There was one bus rider who seemed to enjoy being a bully.  He would do things like pick on the little girls until they cried or pinch the younger boys until they yelled.  He would knock books from the hands of older students or taunt them with nasty remarks.  And one afternoon, my Dad had just about enough of this kid.After another bullying incident, Dad stopped the bus and set the kid off on the side of the road, telling him that because he wouldn't behave on the bus, he could walk the three quarters of a mile to his house.Dad knew this kid's father and as he got to their farm, Dad stopped and had a word with the him, explaining why his son was walking and suggesting that he might want to wait for his son at the end of the driveway.Now in those days, a trip to the woodshed was the usual punishment for an errant son, but Dad said he later heard that in addition to the woodshed, that kid spent all of his free time doing the nastiest chores on the farm.  He mucked out the chicken house and the pig barn.  He pulled weeds in their large garden.  He hauled and stacked firewood.  And when he next rode the bus and thereafter, he was the best behaved kid there.Dad had a way of working out problems.  I know.  I spent many hours as a young girl, scrubbing and cleaning and weeding and pushing a lawnmower to pay for my transgressions.  As an adult, I am grateful to have had a Father who cared enough to see to it that I understood right from wrong, even though at the time I wasn't exactly happy about the lessons.I think if we had more parents willing to find solutions to their children's bad behavior, we wouldn't be adrift in a sea of precious little snowflakes today."},
{"title": "Canning and Cookies", "date": "Tuesday, January 21, 2020", "text": "On this past Friday I got out my big electric roaster and dumped in the 6 lbs of Great Northern dry beans that had soaked in water overnight, 2 lbs. of diced carrots, 2 lbs. of diced onions, 5 lbs. of diced boneless ham and the left over ham from a nice ham bone that I had simmered the day before.  The broth from the ham bone plus enough water to generously cover all the ingredients went in next along with a small jar of ham soup base plus a couple tablespoons each of garlic granules and celery powder.  The soup slow cooked all day until the beans were nearly tender.Saturday morning I started canning the soup and when all was said and done, there were 14 quarts and 9 pints of seriously good ham and bean soup. In the same canner load of pints of soup went 4 pints of chicken breast that I found while cleaning out the freezer in my fridge.  I really need to pay better attention to what I have in the freezer.  Occasionally I will find a surprise that I forgot was in there.  :)Sunday was devoted to putting my kitchen to rights as it sort of looked like someone had set off a bean bomb in the middle of it.  I had several bags of beef scraps left over from the last time I canned beef.  I thawed the beef and it went into a stock pot with the peels from the carrots and onions I put into the bean soup along with plenty of water.  That simmered all day and then I strained off the broth.  The broth is in the fridge keeping cool so I can skim off the fat.  I will go through the meat scraps and salvage any pieces of meat big enough to can with the broth.But today I need a bit of a break from canning.  The aroma of chocolate chip cookies is wafting through my apartment.  Soon that will be replaced with the smell of peanut butter cookies and possibly a batch of sugar cookies.  Sometimes cookies are just necessary to a person's well being.  At least, that's what floats my boat today!Now that I have half pint jars I will can bbq pork tomorrow.  The meat is thawing and the bbq sauce is ready. But for today, it's all about the cookies.  :)"},
{"title": "The Kitchen Table", "date": "Saturday, January 18, 2020", "text": "A friend with whom I share frequent emails remarked that our email chats feel like coffee and conversation at the kitchen table.  Which, of course, got me to thinking about life at the kitchen table.Growing up, everyone in my family was expected to be seated at the kitchen table at 6 P.M., hands and faces washed, ready for supper.  We actually talked to one another.  Of course, there were no cell phones then.  We talked about Dad's day at work, about our days at school, about what Mother had done that day.  We talked about Mother's phone conversation with her sister, about the letter from Grandma and about what we would like to do on the weekend.  There was never a time when there was nothing to talk about...until Dad brought home a set of TV trays and then supper at the kitchen table faded off into memory.Before my family had a TV set, the evening entertainment was often held around the kitchen table.  A radio often played in the background while rousing card games of Rook, Old Maid and Go Fish were played.  Sometimes board games were brought out and we would challenge each other to Sorry or Parcheesi or Yahtzee.  The older ones often played Scrabble and many years later my Dad could be found playing the game in Mothers' room at the nursing home.  Mother nearly always won and Dad nearly always, with a twinkle in his eye, accused her of cheating.  :)In rural Minnesota, neighbors often dropped in for a visit, which always took place with coffee at the kitchen table.  And in rural Minnesota, it is almost a sin not to have cookies or brownies or cake to go with the coffee.  I would save the plastic buckets that ice cream came in and fill them with cookies and freeze them, just so I would have something sweet to go with coffee.The kitchen table at my Grandmother's house was the scene of several two-day Monopoly games between my cousin and me.  And when it was time to leave after a weekend visit with Grandma, both of us would argue that we could have won, given another day.Homework these days is mostly done on a computer, but way back then, workbooks, three-ring binders, lined paper and pencils were the tools used and nobody had a desk.  The kitchen table worked just fine for solving math problems and writing book reports.  And Mother was conveniently close at hand to help if needed.Once in a while, usually on those long, cold winter nights in Minnesota, someone would commandeer the kitchen table with a 1,000 piece jigsaw puzzle, leaving the family to its own devices for meals and homework.  Every now and then, someone would sit at the table and fit more puzzle pieces together and after a few days, it would be complete.  We would have to admire the completed puzzle for a day and then the kitchen table was back for business as usual.Even now when my family gets together, the conversation is best around the kitchen table.  When my kids or grands stop in, we sit at my kitchen table and talk.  Sometimes I think this silly little blog is kind of like sitting with friends at the kitchen table, preferably with a cup of coffee.  I write about something and you all chime in with comments.  That has the feel of kitchen table conversation to me.I sort of feel sorry for those who don't take the time to join others around a kitchen table.  Our busy, hectic, crazy world could use more kitchen table time."},
{"title": "Nothing Much", "date": "Tuesday, January 14, 2020", "text": "It is the middle of January and here in the wilds of Minnesota suburbia, that means there isn't much going on.We had a couple inches of snow with more predicted for the remainder of the week.  Some years January finds us somewhat frozen with sub-zero temps, but so far it has been relatively mild.  And some years we have been up to our hips in snow by now, but this year - not so much.  No complaints here.  :)The store where my grocery delivery service shops has fresh coleslaw mix on sale for 10 packages for $10.  I have ordered 15 packages to dehydrate.  Drying this mix is easy.  Just spread the mix out on mesh lined dehydrator trays and it is good to go.  It doesn't take long to dry and this stuff makes a good filler for soups, plus it adds flavor.  Win - win.Youngest Son brought me 2 tubs full of canning jars.  There were 35 quart jars and 53 pints.  Score!  I have two cases of half-pint jars ordered so I am back in business for canning.  Up to now, the stacks of jars were getting pretty small.  Thank you, Son!I have the ingredients all prepped for canning ham and beans.  Thursday is grocery delivery day, so canning will take place over the weekend.  Because I move at the pace of a herd of turtles, putting groceries away and canning are not compatible on the same day.  My days of multi-tasking have come and gone these days.However, just so I won't be accused of lounging on the sofa, remote in hand, I spent time last evening going through boxes of quilting fabric and supplies.  I found several Ziploc bags of already cut out quilt pieces - some already pinned together ready for sewing, that my aging brain had forgotten about.That's one really nice thing about getting old.  We put things away for safekeeping and when we find them again, it is like getting surprise gifts.  Who says aging can't be fun!So I think I will spend the rest of today and tomorrow playing with fabric, which is one of my favorite things to do.  Plus, when the lights go out, we in the Minnesota tundra will need all the quilts we can lay our hands on, just to keep from freezing.  Food is important, but there are many other things to consider.  So keep on prepping!"},

Wadena with its population of under 5000 souls, could little afford a court battle.What happened next was quite remarkable.It seems the law indicates that religious scenes may not be displayed on public property.  However, they are perfectly acceptable on private property.The City sold the offending Manger Scene to the local Catholic Church for mere pennies on the dollar who then displayed it on their property.The shop owners displayed Nativity Scenes in their shop windows.  Some did decorative painted Nativity Scenes on their store windows.The good citizens of Wadena set out Manger Scenes on their front lawns.Word got out and other good folks drove hundreds of miles to this little town to donate Nativity Scenes to be displayed.By the time all was said and done, there were at least 1,000 Nativity Scenes displayed throughout the town.Take that, atheists!!May the Spirit of one small town in Minnesota be an example to the rest of us to stand up and be counted for our beliefs.This is me...Wishing each and every one of you a very Merry and most importantly, a Blessed Christmas."},
{"title": "Surprises", "date": "Saturday, December 21, 2019", "text": "Anyone who visits here regularly knows that I use a grocery delivery service due to physical limitations.  Here is how it works:The company issues a catalog once a year, listing all the groceries I can order.Every other Monday a volunteer calls me and takes my order that is delivered, for a small fee, to my kitchen table on the following Thursday.Most times the groceries I order on Monday are the same as the ones I receive on Thursday.  This time, however, I ordered 4 bags of frozen cut green beans - and received 4 bags of frozen collard greens.  Surprise!What does a woman born and raised in the tundra of Minnesota know about collard greens.  I have never even tasted collard greens.  Spinach - yes.  Collard greens - no.I suppose I could have called the delivery guy and he would have come back and picked up the bags of collard greens and given me credit on my bill, but I thought, \"What the hey.  Live dangerously.\"So I put them on dehydrator trays along with 2 bags of frozen spinach and 4 bags of frozen hash browns.  All of the veggies are now dry, packaged, labeled and added to the shelf of dehydrated food. I had also ordered 2 bags of frozen sweet potatoes to dehydrate.  I thought they were sweet potatoes cut into chunks or slices.  What I got was 2 bags of sweet potato fries.  Surprise!  Because the fries are cut fairly thin, I am not sure how well they would rehydrate, so into the freezer they went and I will have an occasional meal that includes sweet potato fries.A week or so ago I experimented with dehydrating raisins.  The reasoning behind this was that raisins we buy at the store still have moisture in them and likely would not be a good item for long term storage.  But dehydrated, they could last a very long time without going bad.  Dried, they resembled small wrinkly pebbles.  I put some of the raisins in water and let them sit on the counter overnight.  In the morning I had nice, plump raisins that can be used however I wish.  I will dehydrate more raisins.  Variety is good.I had another experiment that was a dismal failure.  I have several quart bags of shredded zucchini in the freezer.  I thawed out two of them, drained off the water and dried them.  When I soaked them in water, they rehydrated alright, but somewhere in the process, two quarts became about a pint total of shredded zucchini.  I don't know if that was because they were frozen before dehydrating.  Freshly shredded zucchini might work better, but for now, I will keep the remaining bags in the freezer, and if I get my hands on more zucchini, I will slice and dry rather than shred.Life seems to be full of little surprises. I wasn't happy about the collard greens, but if nothing else, they can always be used as a filler in soup.  They won't go to waste.  Now when we can afford an occasional failure is the time to experiment, rather than further down the road when every ounce of food will be needed.  Learning to roll with the surprises and learning to make do with what we have will make the hard times just a bit easier.Keep on prepping."},

I have left over from the last order.  So Friday I will cut the potatoes into 1/2-inch cubes and dehydrate them as well. I am ordering a canister of raisins.  I saw where raisins can be dehydrated so they can be stored for long term, so I am going to give that a try to see how well that works.  If the experiment is successful, I may dry more.Each order includes sugar and flour.  I read somewhere that one of the first food items rationed during wartime was sugar.  I haven't the space in my small apartment to store wheat, but have had success in repackaging flour in heavy duty Ziploc bags, filling buckets with the bags and keeping them in the coolest room.  It takes a considerable amount of flour just to keep me supplied with bread.  If I am feeding several family members, I don't want to run out of flour should I be unable to get more.I also have another can of coffee coming.  One just can not have too much coffee stored.  :)I haven't just been sitting on the couch eating bon bons and watching soaps while I have been on time off.  As tempting as that might have been, I did manage to finish one window quilt top.  Here it is.  Not a very good photo, but I think you can get the general idea.The others are nearly done, and then it is just to add the flannel batting and the backing, and they can go up on curtain rods. I know these are not your standard window treatments.  But I like them.  They are bright and cheerful and they make me happy.  I can just tie them back during the day to let the sunshine in.That's pretty much all I know today.  Evil has not been on vacation so it is time to press on with the prepping.   We may need it sooner than we think."},

{"title": "How Did They Cope", "date": "Monday, November 11, 2019", "text": "While on R & R, I watched two British TV series found on YouTube - 'Wartime Farm' and 'Wartime Kitchen and Garden.'  Both series dealt with the way the people of England coped with the trials and tribulations of WWII, focusing on how farmers had to increase food production and how the average family dealt with restrictions and rationing.A couple of things caught my attention.  One was how the people were able to find ways of doing things when the normal solutions to problems were unavailable to them.  They went to the farm scrap heap for materials to make the tools they needed.  The gardeners found ways to use every available square inch of space to grow the much needed food.  Homemakers came up with ways to stretch the meager rations to feed their families and other ways to do what needed to be done in the home under difficult circumstances.Another thing that caught my attention was that one and all were not only willing but happy to \"do their bit\" in the war effort.  They dealt with most circumstances, many of them difficult even in the best of times, without complaint.  They were more concerned about their 'boys on the front line' than they were for their own comforts.  They were patriotic.I'm not sure we here in the States, at this time in history, could manage so well.  We did cope similarly during that wartime, but we have become spoiled and way too dependent on gadgets for every purpose.  We have mostly lost the knowledge our ancestors had that enabled them to make do in dire situations.  And I don't think we have come together as  nation, leaving our political viewpoints and prejudices behind, since 9/11.  We can do better.So I am off to run bits of fabric through my sewing machine.  We had an inch or two of snow last week and a dusting of the white stuff yesterday.  Today is clear and cold with temps close to single digits.  Quilts need to be finished.  And I think a pot of soup is in my future.Stay warm and keep on prepping."},

{"title": "Drowning in Fabric...", "date": "Thursday, October 31, 2019", "text": "It is amazing to me just how many yards of fabric scraps one person can accumulate.  I discovered I not only had plenty of scrap fabric for the window quilts, there is more than enough for at least one full sized quilt.  As long as I was making a mess with little snippets of cloth, I decided to cut out enough pieces for the quilt along with the window quilt pieces.Years past it would have been a quick and easy job of cutting quilt pieces for patchwork, using a heavy plastic ruler and a rotary cutter.  However, as with many of my vintage, arthritis in the hands is causing problems.  I have tried every trick in the book, but I am unable to keep the cutter straight and the ruler as firmly in place to be able to cut precise pieces.  So I have reverted to the method I used many years ago before the newer cutting methods were available.  I made a template of plastic and draw around it for each patchwork piece, cutting them out with a scissors, giving each piece about a quarter inch seam allowance, using the pencil line as my sewing guide.  Time consuming - yes.  But I was wasting too much fabric when the ruler would slip or when my fingers couldn't control the direction of the rotary cutter.  Using a template is an old time method, but it works. I am spending today cutting fabric.  A friend mentioned the British TV series, 'Wartime Kitchen and Garden.  I found it on YouTube and am watching that today as I work.  It is about how cooks and gardeners coped with the food rationing in England during WWII.  So far I am finding lots of useful information that may be needed right here at home, if things continue to slide downhill.I hope to start sewing by the weekend.  Until then, back at it.  Only about 500 more pieces to go.  Sigh."},

I decided to make three window quilts to fit the windows.I am making scrap quilts, using the fabric scraps I have leftover from other projects.  I also have a number of cream colored sheets that can be used for the backs of the quilts.  I can use tie backs to let in light during the day.  There are enough sheets to also make curtain panels to use in the warmer months.I suppose I could have just purchased thermal drapes, but I really like the idea of using what I have on hand.  My bank account likes it, too.  The only thing I need buy is the batting for the window quilts.  This is good practice for a time when we may have to learn to make do with what we have.I will post pictures when the quilts are finished, but don't hold your breath.  Making quilts take time.  I do hope to finish them by the time the temperatures head downward.

{"title": "Common Sense Prepping", "date": "Thursday, October 17, 2019", "text": "When I first realized the need to be prepared for bad times, I did some online research.  I watched videos.  I read blogs.  I looked up statistics.I found there was a vast amount of information out there.  There were sites that told me about the gear that every prepper had to have.  There were lists of foods that were absolutely necessary to store.  Other sites showed me how to survive out in the woods.I dutifully made lists of the recommended items.  I searched online for the best prices on various items.  I worked out scenarios of what would constitute a SHTF moment and what would be needed in those situations.And then my common sense side said, \"Hold on.  How much of this stuff really applies to you.\"First off, I am not going to be building any shelters in the middle of the forest.  I am an old woman with health issues.  I am connected 24/7 to an oxygen machine, fondly referred to as R2D2, due to it's size and shape.  I would be hard pressed to make it to the end of the block, to say nothing of heading to the hills.  Having knowledge of bushcraft skills might be fine for someone young and healthy, but for me...not so much.These facts eliminated the need for specialized gear.  My gear consists of a variety of flashlights, oil lamps and candles.  It includes a propane camp stove and a propane space heater.  It also includes two pressure canners and two dehydrators.  The dehydrators will be useless if the lights go out, but in the meantime they have made it possible to stock up on dried food.  The rest of my gear is the normal household tools and utensils.Most of those of my vintage are on a fixed income.  We can't justify spending large amounts of money on the recommended freeze dried foods or the pre-packaged ready to eat meals.  My solution to this problem is home canning of a variety of meats and vegetables and fruits along with lots of soups and stews that only need to be heated or, in a pinch, can be eaten right out of the jar.Not everyone has the skills or equipment for home canning.  But by adding a few extra cans of food every time one shops for groceries, a deep pantry can be a reality over time.  Some of you are aware of the fact that due to health issues, I use a grocery delivery service.  Each delivery includes a couple of items I can not make at home, like sugar, flour, powdered milk, rice, etc.  These are stored away for future use. I use what I store, so food is rotated out and replaced regularly.I once watched a video of a woman who had a full sized chest of drawers completely filled with health and medical supplies.  She had everything from leg splints to neck braces to several kinds of over the counter pain killers to vitamins of every kind. There were medications for every possible situation.  I was impressed.But I can not afford to do the same.  What I have done is to stock up on the basics - aspirin, burn cream, peroxide, alcohol, band-aids, cough drops, etc.  I add to the stash from time to time - items like diarrhea medication, multi vitamins, antibiotic salves.  And I found a good First-Aid book that covers the common medical and injury needs.If a person has the wherewithal and the storage space for a full compliment of prepping items, good for them.  But most of us tend to pinch a penny or two in our daily lives, so we do the best we can with what we have to work with.The main point is that we do something.  Sitting idly by, waiting for the government to rescue us in times of disaster isn't going to cut it.  The way things are going, I doubt that rescue will be on the minds of 'our betters.'  Seems more likely they will be the ones we have to watch out for.  The better prepared we are, the better our chances.Keep on prepping."},

And the four legged kinds of animals are better behaved than those sorry excuses for human beings.They carried signs filled with vulgarity.  They screamed obscenities.  They harassed the police.  They threw rocks and bottles at the police.  They threw rocks and bottles at the horses of the horse patrol.  They started fires in the streets.  They harassed and bullied innocent people leaving the venue who were just trying to get to their vehicles to go home.  They threw rocks and bottles at the cars leaving.  They threw jars of urine on supporters of our President. It saddened me to see the behavior of these thugs here in my home state.  We are supposed to be a state where nice, friendly people live.  And for the most part, we are.  But when people act like this over just a political rally, what do you suppose they will do when the sh** really does hit the fan?This was a wake-up call for me.  It not only showed me that my efforts to get ready for whatever happens are spot on, it was a lesson on how low humans can sink when they don't get their way.  The attempt to shut down the rally ahead of time failed and this was their answer.  The mayor of Minneapolis didn't help the situation.  He declared it \"Love to Hate Trump Day.\"I don't care what the political leanings are as long as we can treat each other with respect.  They can protest all they want.  It is their right.  But when they become a mob of thugs trying to physically hurt those on the other side, that is where I draw the line.This mob showed me what to expect in the future - maybe sooner than we think.  I believe that 'keep on prepping' and 'keep your powder dry' both fall under the category of Good Advice."},
{"title": "Minnesota Cops Fight Back", "date": "Tuesday, October 8, 2019", "text": "I love my home state of Minnesota.  It is a beautiful state, from the rolling farmlands in the southern and central parts of the state to the pine forests of the north, to its '10,000 lakes.'  It is true that winters are interesting with occasional blizzards and massive snowfalls, but if you have ever walked through woods so quiet you can hear the snowflakes touch the ground, you will understand true beauty.  I have sat on the deck of my brother's home and watched a small black bear up a tree on the other side of his driveway.  I have watched yearling fawns running and jumping and playing in the first snowfall of the year.  I have heard the haunting songs of the loons calling to one another across the waters of some of the most beautiful lakes anywhere.  I have spent hours, rod and reel in hand, catching the best tasting fresh water fish.You may have heard the term 'Minnesota Nice.'  If you get away from the hustle and bustle of the cities, you will find it in abundance.  The people are for the most part, friendly.  Neighbors help neighbors.  They get together for summer barbecues and winter snowmobile rides.  People you don't know will wave in passing.  They will go out of their way to help someone in need.There are good folks living in the cities, but sadly, the political climate is decidedly left leaning, complete with the current Trump Derangement Syndrome.  President Trump is holding a rally in Minneapolis this week.  The mayor of Minneapolis has decreed that police officers appearing at the rally are not allowed to wear their uniforms even though officers have traditionally been at events in uniform.  He has also decided to charge the Trump campaign way more for security than has ever been charged for an event before.  The hope was that Trump would cancel the rally.  The mayor obviously doesn't understand the concept of 'fighting back.'He also doesn't understand what it does to morale when officers are told they can not wear a uniform they are proud to wear.  So the officers in the Minneapolis Police Department fought back and they designed this:The officers will be wearing this shirt to the rally.  They have offered it for sale on their website.  (Note:  When I tried to post a link to the MPD Federation website, I found a notice that the website has been suspended.  I don't know if that is just temporary or permanent.  Odd, that.).    All proceeds go to charity.  A spokesman for the Department said in an interview that they would like to flood the audience with red shirts.My goal here is not to sell t-shirts.  I have no connection to this effort.  But I do love the fact that these police officers, who put their lives on the line for us every single day, have decided to fight back against tyrannical politicians.  God bless them for having the courage of their convictions.  If more of us did what we could to fight back against those who would try to take our freedoms from us, we might not be so close to losing them to those who think they know better than we do how we should live our lives."},

{"title": "Lessons From the Great Depression", "date": "Wednesday, August 14, 2019", "text": "While on self imposed R & R, I spent some time reading articles and watching videos about the Great Depression of the 1930's.  I have very little understanding of the Stock Market nor do I care much about the politics of the time.  My focus is on how the average citizen managed to keep body and soul together through those hard times.One reoccurring theme was having cash on hand.  Banks closed their doors and folks could not access the money in their accounts.  People lost their entire life savings, not to mention their homes.  Renters were evicted because they had no money to pay their rent.  Those who had stashed cash in their mattresses probably didn't have enough cash to last for years but chances were pretty good they had enough to at least give them time to make rational decisions on what to do before the cash ran out.Those who lived in the country fared better than the city dwellers.  They planted gardens, kept chickens for meat and eggs, had a cow for milk and butter and raised hogs for meat.  Many of those interviewed who lived through the Depression said they didn't know there was a Depression because they had plenty to eat.  And they had products to barter for what they couldn't buy.  They would trade eggs and butter for sugar and coffee.  They sometimes paid the doctor bills with vegetables from their gardens.  They were cash poor but they had the means to work around that.Those in the cities felt the effects of the Depression sooner and to a greater degree than the country folks.  Jobs disappeared.  Food became scarce.  In February of 1931, desperate to feed their families, citizens of Minneapolis rioted, smashing the windows of closed grocery stores and running off with whatever food they could carry.  This was repeated over time in many areas of the country.In the cities, soup kitchens run by churches and private charities were opened to feed the masses of hungry people.  Bread lines formed as people stood in lines for hours in hopes of being given a loaf of bread or other food to feed starving families.Those who had a variety of skills were better off than those who knew only the skills required to do the jobs that no longer existed.  A man who knew how to shingle a roof, clean a chimney, do maintenance work on a vehicle could earn cash or barter his services for food.  Women provided laundry services, baked bread and cakes to be sold, did sewing for those who didn't know how.  The more skills a person had, the better their chances of survival.People learned to 'make do.'  Lacking money for new clothes, holes were patched, seams were taken in or let out as needed to make a piece of clothing fit, holes in stockings were darned.  Mothers used whatever they had on hand to fashion clothing for their children - old sheets, flour sacks, etc.  Old cloth coats were taken apart and turned inside out to sew new coats or jackets for the children.  Scrap fabric was saved and turned into quilts.  Nothing was wasted.Broken tools, appliances, furniture were not thrown out but were repaired until they could no longer be fixed.  People glued soles back onto worn boots.  Others lined the insides of their shoes with cardboard to cover the places where holes were worn through the soles.  Children wore shoes only in the winter, for there was no money to buy new shoes and they weren't to be worn out in the warmer months when kids could go barefoot.Today we live in a disposable society.  We break the Mr. Coffee, we buy a new one.  We have more shoes than any one person can ever wear out.  We have clothing hanging in the closets that aren't worn because the fashion of the day dictates these items to be 'out of style.'  We firmly believe that the supermarkets will always be open, filled with every imaginable product to eat.  We rarely carry cash, choosing rather to whip out our credit cards to pay for nearly everything.  And we no longer know how to can tomatoes or sew a seam or bake a loaf of bread.If we ever have another set of circumstances resulting in another Depression, I fear most of America will be in a world of hurt due to a total lack of knowledge needed to survive."},

{"title": "Food Shortages?", "date": "Saturday, July 27, 2019", "text": "I have been hearing rumors of food shortages caused by the rains and floods this past spring.  Several folks have told me about Walmart stores posting signs about shortages in their canned vegetable aisles.  So I decided to do my own research.I have seen several pictures posted of the Walmart signs.  I have read many articles about the flood damage to farms, fields, livestock and grains that were stored in grain bins that are now ruined. I have watched opinion videos and read blogs on the subject.  Opinions range from \"We're all gonna die!\" to \"Move along.  Nothing to see here.\"Me...I go by facts. The fact is that millions of acres were flooded in the middle of planting season.  Some farmers were able to finally get into their fields to plant and others could not.  Whether we have a decent harvest is going to depend on the weather come fall.The fact is that many, many cattle, sheep, hogs and poultry were killed by the flood waters and much of the reserved livestock feed was lost.  Whether the livestock industry can recover remains to be seen.  But I do expect meat prices to go up.  It takes longer to build up a herd of cattle than it does to raise a field of corn.  I would guess that eggs and dairy prices may also be affected.As far as the shortages in the vegetable aisles of Walmart, it could be that the company is actually unable to keep their shelves full.Or there could be a clever person in the corporate office marketing department who knew that if the stores posted signs alluding to shortages, people would rush to stock up 'while they still could.'  I was reminded of the 'Great Toilet Paper Scare of 1973' when Johnny Carson, host of the then popular Tonight Show, made a joke about a toilet paper shortage.  Within a week the store shelves were empty of TP.So how will I handle these rumors?  Well, I do not believe we are headed into famine territory.  I do believe that we may see real shortages and more likely, corporations taking advantage of the rumors to raise prices.  I will not dash out, hair on fire, to grab what I can from store shelves.  I have, however, asked my youngest son to do some shopping at Sam's Club for me, picking up fairly large quantities of chicken, hamburger and beef roast to be canned in various ways.  I may add to the list some link breakfast sausage and brats, as I want to can those as well.  With what I already have on my shelves, that will give me plenty of meat to use in making all sorts of meals.Many of you who visit here often know that due to physical limitations, I use a grocery delivery service every two weeks for my normal grocery shopping.  My order that will be  delivered this coming Thursday includes twelve 1 lb. bags of dry Great Northern beans, half of which will be used to make and can another batch of baked beans.  The rest will be saved for ham and bean soup to can later.  I also am ordering 6 bags each of frozen whole kernel corn and cut green beans, both to dehydrate.  And 10 lbs. of potatoes to slice and dehydrate.My crystal ball is broken, so I have no real way to know what the future holds.  So on the chance that the predictions come true, it makes sense to me to go ahead and get food now while prices aren't through the roof.  And if nothing happens, I am still ahead with more food added to my food storage.For the life of me, I just can not understand why so few refuse to plan ahead when it comes to food.  We saw pictures and video on the news showing the devastation the floods caused.  Even the main stream media carried interviews with farmers who lost everything.  And long before that, there were the pictures of people digging in dumpsters looking for food after a hurricane.  When will it occur to some that after a disaster, someone from the government is not going to show up with a sandwich and a bottle of water.  The government is in charge of politics.  We are in charge of feeding our families.Keep on prepping."},
{"title": "Bits and Pieces", "date": "Tuesday, July 23, 2019", "text": "I moan and groan when it is hot and humid and I complain when it is too cold, so it is only right I mention the two perfectly fine days in a row here in the hinterlands of Minnesota.  Sunshine for those who are out and about and for those of us indoors, windows open with a lovely summer breeze flowing through my apartment.  Glorious!As you know, my life is filled with drama and excitement.  OK. I lied.  There is very little going on here at present.  I am deciding what I need to can or dehydrate next and think I really need to do another batch of baked beans.  They are really good and the half pint jars are perfect for one person.  Duane hinted that more beans might be a good idea.  I sent a case of them home with him and I have a sneaking suspicion they won't last too long.Has anyone noticed that grocery shelves, particularly the canned vegetable aisles, have been not nearly as full as they normally are?  I have a high school friend who is a Vietnam vet and retired cop, and who keeps me informed about news that I might miss.  I joke that he is plugged into the 'good old boy cop network,' but that may not be so much of a joke.  He knew about the Somali riot at the local amusement park last summer before I did.  He lives 100 miles away.  I live just a couple miles from the park.  Recently he emailed me about several people reporting signs hung on the canned veggie aisles of Walmart stores in various parts of the country, stating that due to the bad spring weather, Walmart was experiencing shortages of vegetables.  I don't get out to check on that myself and I have not heard of that happening in my area, but it is curious.  I know that some food shortages have been predicted due to the wet spring and the flooding that happened.  I do know that most grocery stores would, in an emergency situation, have their shelves emptied within three days.  I don't think I am willing to take a chance.  Personally, I will continue to add as much as possible to my food storage - just in case.After taking stock, I find I am all out of home canned chili, so that is definitely on the list.  I think more half pint jars of meat for making sandwiches would be good as well.  I think it might be a good idea to dehydrate more potato slices before the price of potatoes goes up.This morning I heard an awful racket in the street outside my building.  Turns out the city was removing half a dozen of the small trees that were planted along the boulevard.  They had died over the winter and are now mulch.  I hope the city replaces them.  They attracted the small birds that I like to listen to in the spring and summer.Later in the afternoon I heard a strange sound outside my living room windows.  When I looked I saw a man at the window.  This was something new.  I live on the second floor of the building.  Seeing someone at my window is not an every day occurrence.  On closer inspection, I found he was on a ladder, painting the trim on the outside of my window.  I haven't been anywhere to buy curtains, but decided then and there to just make some.  I have several bed sheets of a cream color that I am sure contain enough fabric to cover all three windows.  The frugal (read 'cheap') part of me likes the notion of curtains without spending any money.  I come by the frugality honestly.  My parents, children of the Great Depression era, were the king and queen of 'making do.' That's enough blathering for now.  Hope your day was as nice as mine was, in spite of the racket and pseudo 'peeping tom.\"  :)Keep on prepping!"},
{"title": "Canning Beef Stew", "date": "Friday, July 19, 2019", "text": "Last week I made beef stew for supper one evening.  I opened jars of potatoes, carrots, beef and tomatoes to make it.  Duane came over to help me eat it, took some home with him and I ate off the leftovers for a couple of days.  I had several canning jars that needed to be washed.  If I had a dishwasher, I wouldn't mind so much, but my dishwasher consists of my two hands located at the ends of my arms.  I am not fond of washing jars.About that time I got to wondering if it would work to can all the stew ingredients together in one jar.  I already can all sorts of soups, so why not stew.  With that in mind I ordered 8 lbs. of chuck roast, 10 lbs. of potatoes, 4 lbs of carrots, 4 lbs of onions and 2 bunches of celery.  So then I got to thinking that if I was going to can beef stew, why not can chicken stew, too.  So I added 6 lbs. of frozen chicken breast and 2 lbs. of frozen corn to the order.My groceries were delivered early afternoon Thursday.  I peeled the potatoes and onions and washed the carrots and celery.  Then I sat at my kitchen table and cut everything into bite sized pieces.  The potatoes went into a bucket of water to keep them from turning black overnight and the rest went into the fridge in zip lock bags.  The beef and chicken were cut into bite sized pieces and the meat went into the fridge in zip lock bags as well.This morning I got my jars and pressure canner ready and proceeded to layer the ingredients into quart jars.  Each jar got a cup each of potatoes and carrots, and half a cup each of celery and onions.  I topped off each jar with beef cubes, adding 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic powder and thyme and 3 tablespoons of crushed tomatoes along with two beef bouillon cubes per jar, then filled them with water..  I processed the quart jars of stew for 90 minutes.  To use the stew it just needs to be heated and thickened.  It might need a bit more liquid, depending on how you like it.While the first seven jars were processing and when I had filled the next seven jars was when I realized I had screwed up.  I had not ordered nearly enough carrots.  Stew just doesn't taste right without carrots. I thought about either freezing or dehydrating the rest of the vegetables, but both require blanching.  Did I mention that today was the hottest day of the year so far with the temperature this afternoon at 96 degrees and a heat index of 110 degrees?  There was no way I was going to heat water on the stove for blanching.  The pressure canner was generating enough heat, but my apartment was staying tolerable.  I wanted to keep it that way.So I started filling jars.  In addition to the 14 quarts of beef stew, I got 10 pints of cubed potatoes, 2 pints of carrots and 9 half pints each of celery and onions.  Tomorrow promises to be cooler - back in the mid 70's - so I will fill half pint jars of the rest of the beef and the 6 lbs. of chicken.  I have lots of beef and chicken canned in pint jars, so I thought perhaps the half pints would be nice to have on hand for sandwiches.Things don't always go according to plan.  In my case, they often go awry.  Being flexible and refusing to panic are a big plus, no matter what the situation.  None of the food was wasted and I will can more beef stew and chicken stew another (cooler) day, keeping better track of the amounts of ingredients I will need.Keep on prepping, even if you have to change course in the middle.  :)"},

{"title": "Today We Are Canning Baked Beans", "date": "Wednesday, July 10, 2019", "text": "Many of you know that because of physical limitations, I use a grocery delivery service for my grocery shopping.  The service is geared toward Senior clients and I am very satisfied with it.  The service puts out a yearly catalog of grocery items that I use to put together my twice monthly orders and the catalog is extensive.  The only down side is that prices are not listed, which is understandable since the catalog is published yearly and prices change.  So when I looked over my receipt a few weeks ago and discovered that I had paid $1.38 for an 8 ounce can of baked beans, I decided it was time to can my own.I have canned pork and beans before, using a method where you measure the dry beans into jars, add the sauce and pressure can.  That method worked, but the beans didn't turn out quite as tender as I would have liked.  So this time I am using Jackie Clay's (Backwoods Home Magazine) recipe.  There is more work involved than the first method, but I think the results will be more to my liking.Here is the recipe I am using:2 quarts. dried navy or other smaller beans1 lb. thickly sliced bacon or salt pork (or ham)6 large onions, diced1 1/2 cups brown sugar4 tsp. salt4 tsp. dry mustard1 1/3 cups molassesSort beans, rinse, then cover with 6 quarts fresh water; let stand overnight in a cool place. Drain. Cover beans with 6 quarts water in large stockpot. Bring to boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer until skins begin to crack. Drain, reserving liquid. Pour beans into turkey roaster or other very large baking dish. Add bacon, ham, and remaining ingredients and 8 cups reserved liquid. Ladle sauce over beans and bake, covered, at 350 degrees for about 3 hours. Add water or cooking liquid to keep wet enough; you don’t want them dry but watery. Pack hot beans and sauce into hot jars, leaving 1 inch of headspace. Process pints for 80 minutes and quarts for 95 minutes at 10 pounds pressure.I don't have any bacon or ham on hand so I will not be adding meat and I am adding fewer onions.   My roaster pan is too small (I am making 1 1/2 times the recipe) so I am using my electric roaster instead of the oven.I am using some pint jars and some half pint jars.  The half pints are just right for a single serving.  I am using 4 - 16 oz. bags of dry beans.  I haven't done the math on all of the ingredients, but one bag of beans cost less than one 8 oz. can of prepared beans, so I don't think I can go wrong on the price.The beans are now in the first stage of cooking.  I will do a follow up tomorrow to let you know how it all turns out.There is nothing wrong with buying prepared pork and beans, but when living on a fixed income, it seems well worth the time and trouble to can my own.  That money will be better spent on items I can't preserve myself.Keep on prepping."},
{"title": "Let's Can Hamburger and Sausage Patties", "date": "Friday, July 5, 2019", "text": "I have lots of hamburger and sausage canned up - all of it in the crumbled form.  But let's say that whatever is going to happen has happened, the stores are empty and my freezer is now just a place to store blankets.  Beans and rice have been consumed for the past three weeks and more than anything in the world I really, really want a cheeseburger.  What do I do?I go to my shelves and grab a jar of hamburger patties that I canned.  And if I want a sausage patty with my eggs for breakfast, I have those in jars, too.I got 4 lbs. of bulk sausage and 6 lbs. of hamburger with my grocery order this time.  I shaped all of it into patties, using a wide mouth jar ring to get them the right size and thickness.  To do this, turn the ring upside down on parchment paper, fill the ring with ground meat and press it down to fill the ring, skimming off any excess so the meat is level with the edge of the ring.  Turn the ring right side up and the patty will pop right out.I put the patties, both hamburger and sausage, onto parchment lined cookie sheets and put them into a 375 degree oven, baking them just until they were somewhat browned on the outside and firm enough to handle.  They don't need to be completely cooked as they will cook in the pressure canner.  They can be fried in a frying pan or on a griddle, too.I drained the patties on paper towels, blotting the tops of each with paper towels to sop up any excess grease.  Then they were packed into wide mouth pint jars.  The sausage didn't shrink much so only three patties fit into each jar - the hamburger was packed four per jar.  They could be packed into quart jars if desired.  I made up some beef bouillon and added that to each jar up to one inch from the top.  The jar rims were wiped clean, lids and rings added and into the pressure canner they went.  I still had room in the canner and I had made more broth than I needed, so I jarred up four pints of the broth and canned that, too.  I will have beef broth for the next time I can meat patties or it is good in soup.The pints were processed for 75 minutes.  Quarts are processed for 90 minutes.I had one jar that didn't seal.  I haven't eaten those hamburger patties yet, but I did check them to see how well they held together, and they were just fine.  When I go to use them, I think I will just put them in a frying pan with just a bit of fat and heat them through.  I don't season the hamburger but will add seasonings when I heat them up.I will can up more of these meat patties.  In an SHTF situation, or even on a day when I really don't want to cook, I think these sausage and hamburger patties will come in really handy.I love caramel.  It is good on ice cream.  It is good for dipping with apple slices.  It is good spread on cake.  It is good for lots of things.Making caramel from scratch involves ingredients like heavy cream that I never have on hand.  So when I saw several videos of making caramel by boiling a can of sweetened condensed milk for three hours, I had to try it.  It worked.  The result was delicious.Yesterday I opened 4 cans of sweetened condensed milk and filled 6 half pint jars.  I wiped the jar rims really well, added lids and rings and set them into a stock pot.  I poured in enough water to cover the jars by at least two inches, turned on the burner and brought the pot to a boil.  I turned the heat down a bit and let the jars cook at a slow boil for 3 hours, adding more water about half way through to keep the water level over the jars.When the caramel was done and after it had cooled a little bit, I called Duane and said, \"There be caramel.\" to which he replied. \"I'll be right over.\"  We opened one jar for a taste test.  That jar is in the fridge and I hear it calling my name.  Duane made off with two jars.  Another jar went home with my nurse and two more are on the shelf.I will be making more of this.  :)"},

{"title": "Let's Can Crackers", "date": "Wednesday, July 3, 2019", "text": "So I decided to do another experiment.  I saw several videos on dry canning crackers.  That appealed to me because let's say I open a box of those little cheesy crackers.  By the time I work my way through the entire box, they taste old and stale.  So it seemed worth a try to keep them fresh.In all of the videos I saw, quart canning jars were used.  Because there is only one person living here, pint jars seemed like a better choice.  I filled 6 wide mouth pint jars with crackers - 2 with cheesy crackers - 2 with oyster crackers - 2 with Ritz crackers.  I wiped the rims to remove any crumbs and added lids and rings.The majority of the directions said to put the jars in a cold oven, using a cookie sheet to hold them.  Then turn on the oven and set it for 250 degrees.  When the oven gets up to the correct heat, set the timer for 30 minutes.  When the time is up, turn off the oven and leave the jars in it until cool.So I did.  Five jars sealed and one did not.  Only time will tell if the seals will hold.  I'm going to set the sealed jars aside and check the seals now and then.  If they hold, this is an excellent way to store crackers.  I can't say yea or nay on this one yet.  If any of you have used this method to store crackers, please let me know. My grocery order today included several items for a few more food preservation experiments.  I will let you know how the next one turns out."},
{"title": "Food Memories", "date": "Tuesday, July 2, 2019", "text": "The night before last two storms roared through my town, one right after the other.  They brought wind and rain and lightning strikes that caused a fire in  a garage and another in a house.  Thankfully nobody was injured.  And thankfully, the storms brought our heat wave temperatures down to a tolerable level.So what does one do when it is cool enough to run the oven?  In this house, one bakes cookies.I dug out two of my cookie mixes, stirred them up and after I put the second batch into the oven I called my son who is also my next door neighbor and said, \"There be cookies.\"  He replied, \"I'll be right over.\"We sat and talked of many things and I was reminded of when my kids were young children.  They delighted in sneaking cookie dough from the bowl whenever I was baking cookies.  I would fuss at them as Mom's are prone to do and they would think they were getting away with putting one over on Mom.  In reality, I had a hard time keeping a straight face and I always stirred up extra dough, knowing what would happen.Later that evening I heard the sound of my son's key in the lock of my apartment door.  He soon stuck his head through the doorway of the living room and followed with a big strawberry malt made with fresh strawberries.  He knows how I dearly love ice cream in any form and it was a real treat as well as a nice surprise.I was reminded of a time when the kids were small.  If we would visit my parents of a morning, my Dad would fix my kids chocolate malts for breakfast.  Mother would always fuss at Dad, telling him that chocolate malts were not a proper breakfast.  Dad would always counter by telling her the malts were healthy because he used Carnation Instant Breakfast Mix for the flavoring and ice cream was, after all, a dairy product that was good for kids.  And the kids would listen to them and grin, knowing that the next time they visited in a morning, they would again be treated to chocolate malts for breakfast.The other day my son surprised me with a bag of fresh cherries.  I love cherries.   I have been nibbling on them, using every bit of my will power to keep from eating them all at once.I was reminded of a time when Dad needed to travel for his job from our home in west central Minnesota to the capitol city of St. Paul, a journey of 100 plus miles.  Sometimes he would look at me and ask, \"Do you want to go for a ride, Sis?\"  (He often called me 'Sis.')  When those trips occurred in the summertime, Dad would stop at a roadside fruit stand on the way and buy a paper sack full of cherries.  The trip would then proceed while we ate cherries from the sack, spitting the pits out the open car windows.  I was never allowed to spit cherry pits out the window when Mother was in the car, for it wasn't lady like and she had high hopes of making a lady out of me.  But with Dad, I could get away with most anything that wasn't really bad or illegal.It is funny how certain foods can trigger memories.  Potato salad reminds me of family picnics at the lake.  Gingersnap cookies remind me of visiting relatives on hot summer days, eating Mom's freshly baked gingersnaps and drinking ice cold lemonade on the wide front porch of our house.  Pancakes remind me of a time of eating little else for a week because that was all we had.Lot of things trigger memories, but different foods seem to do it more for me.  There are good memories and some that are not so good.  The good memories mostly of times past when life was much more simple.  And the less than good memories remind me to keep adding to my food stash because I never want to go through another time like that."},

{"title": "I got to thinking...", "date": "Wednesday, June 19, 2019", "text": "the other day.  What if we were in a situation where we were living off just our food storage.  And what if the electricity had gone away so the freezer wasn't freezing any more.  That would mean there was no frozen meat left.  All of my hamburger in jars is browned and canned - not in patty form.  Just what would I give after a while for a hamburger patty or a cheeseburger on a bun.  I have seen videos about canning hamburger and sausage patties.  I think I need to give that a try.  I will order some hamburger in two weeks and see what happens.I have four family sized packages of chicken legs ordered for delivery tomorrow.  Usually when I can chicken legs or thighs, I raw pack them in wide mouth jars and can them without liquid.  That works well except when the meat doesn't make enough of its own juices and the parts that are not covered in liquid turn really dark in color.  They aren't bad or spoiled - just ugly.  This time I think I will lightly brown the legs first and then pack them in jars, adding a chicken bouillon cube to each jar and then hot water.  I think that will solve the problem of ugly chicken legs and add flavor at the same time.Sometimes we need to think a little bit outside the box.  For instance, among preppers we always hear about storing rice and dry beans.  That is a good thing to do, but what happens when we want beans for a meal and water is at a premium and so is cooking fuel.  Even with soaking beans overnight, it takes considerable time to cook them.  I have been running a load of various kinds of beans through my pressure canner now and then, or if I don't have a full canner load of meat, I will add jars of beans to make a full load, as the canning times are similar.  Then when I want beans for a meal, there they are on the shelf, fully cooked and just need to be added to soup or heated for a meal.   So far I have navy beans, great northern beans, kidney beans and some of those 15 bean soup mixes canned and on the shelf.   I need to can up other varieties. If I could figure out a way to successfully can rice, I would do it.  But so far it hasn't worked for me.  Rice added to chicken soup all but disappeared during the canning process. I have done some experimenting with canning various kinds of meat.  Ground beef for Sloppy Joe's didn't turn out well.  The taste changed in the process and the change wasn't good.  It had sort of a scorched flavor. The taste convinced me not to do that again.  Taco meat, however, was a success as was barbecued pork for sandwiches.  Although I usually can ingredients rather than the finished dish, once in a while it is nice to be able to open a jar, heat it up and have a meal. I think that in an SHTF situation, variety in food will be welcome.  I know that if all I had to eat was beans and rice, I would soon be much more grumpy than I am now.  :)"},
{"title": "Dad", "date": "Sunday, June 16, 2019", "text": "Dad was a small man, being only 5 feet 5 inches tall, but within him was one of the biggest hearts I have ever known.He was born on a sandy, rocky farm in northern Minnesota in 1911, the youngest of nine children.Dad and his sister, Clarice.The family was poor, but I'm not sure they knew it, for I never once heard him complain about being deprived as a child.Dad at the top of the ladder and his brother Bruce.He would rather tell the stories of growing up in a loving family, of the shenanigans he and his brothers would pull, of what it was like to plow a field behind a team of horses. Dad in his twenties.Dad was 33 years old when he married Mother.  When asked why he married later in life than most, he remarked that he had to wait for Mother, who was 13 years his junior, to grow up.Mom and Dad the day after their wedding in 1945.Many years later when Mother's rheumatoid arthritis had crippled her so badly that she could no longer do anything for herself, he spent his time with her, feeding her, brushing her hair, cleaning the trach tube she breathed through and taking care of every one of her needs.  I once asked him how he could do all of this, day in and day out.  He said simply, \"I love your Mother.\"Mother and Dad - early 1990's.Dad was not a highly educated man.  At that time it was common practice for farm boys to attend rural schools through the eighth grade and then to work on the farm, and this is what he did.Dad is the little boy on the end, looking at his hands.  The picture includes some of his siblings and neighbor children at the little White Pine School.His lack of formal education didn't mean he wasn't smart.  He loved to read and I would often find him sitting at the kitchen table, completely absorbed in the contents of a book.  He loved Zane Grey stories and would read the Reader's Digest, cover to cover, but more often than not, I would find him with the Bible open in front of him.This man had a work ethic second to none.  As Mother's disease required more visits to the doctor and then several hospitalizations, he worked two and sometimes three jobs to pay the bills.  Never once did I hear him complain, nor did our family ever go hungry, thanks to his ambition and determination.Dad was of the opinion that just because his firstborn was a girl didn't mean that she had to grow up expecting someone else to take care of her.  He didn't just tell me how to do things, but showed me.  I got my love of gardening from him, working with him to plant, weed and harvest our garden every year.   With him I learned to paint a house, to change a tire, to use tools.My sister and me with Dad in the garden.He taught me how to drive by taking me out on a local frozen lake in wintertime, where I couldn't run into anything, and turned me loose to get the feel of driving.  Our family car had an automatic transmission, but he insisted we sometimes take his old work car that had a stick shift.  He said I might not always have access to an automatic and I had better learn to drive both.With my shiny, new driver's license in my pocket, Dad and I set off for the big city - Minneapolis.   Right through the busy, traffic clogged and sometimes confusing downtown area we went.  Other than giving me directions of what street to take and where to turn, Dad never said a word.  When I asked him later why he had been so quiet, he replied, \"I knew you could handle it.\"I come from a long line of people with working senses of humor.  When Dad's family would gather together, the air was filled with laughter.  The siblings would tell stories on each other about the silly things they did as children.  They would delight in playing harmless pranks on one another, like swiping a forkful of someone else's pie when they weren't looking.  Dad once told me that his cutting up as a child earned him many hours sitting in the root cellar at the farm, cutting up rutabagas for horse and cattle feed.Dad being silly while swimming at the lake, bringing Mother some flowers.In later years when we lived a couple of hundred miles apart, I would call him every few days, to check up on him but mostly to hear his voice.  He would tell me that he had been fishing or that a cousin had been to visit with him or that it had snowed the night before.  Sometimes he would tell me that he had a beautiful apple pie cooling on the counter, so that I could ask him to mail me a slice, so he could tell me he tried to get a slice in the envelope, but it just wouldn't fit.  My phone calls always ended with these words, using his nickname for me, \"I sure love you, Sis.\"Dad wasn't perfect by any means.  None of us are.  But I could not have asked for a better Dad.Dad and me - winter of 1947-48.He passed on in December of 2004 at the ripe old age of 93.  I was so very blessed to have had him in my life for so many years and I still really, badly miss him."},
{"title": "Sam's Club Trip", "date": "Thursday, June 13, 2019", "text": "So late Tuesday morning my youngest son, David, showed up to take me and his brother to Sam's Club.  But before we left, he and Duane hauled in four of those square plastic milk crates full of canning jars.  Bonus!!  He didn't want the crates back, so I found space where I can stack them two high with the open tops facing outward and use them as shelf cubbies to hold more food storage, which is good because I have little space left on my regular shelves.  Thank you, son!There were conditions connected to this outing.  If my boys were going to take me out in public, I had to behave myself.  There would be no popping wheelies with the electric cart I used to get around in the store, nor was I allowed to organize drag races with the same carts.  I reluctantly agreed and we were off to shop.I needed hamburger to can, so I got two 10 lb. chubs along with a whole pork loin.  The hamburger will be canned in pint jars and the pork loin will be cut into a couple of small roasts to fit into my small crock pot with the rest sliced into boneless chops and frozen.  That's a whole lot of meals and I am sharing some of the chops with Duane.I only have a couple pints of dill pickles left and these days, getting my hands on cucumbers for canning is difficult.  So I bought a gallon jar of dill spears, 2 half gallon jars of baby dills and 2 quarts of small, stuffed olives.  Sometimes it is necessary to find a way around a problem and this works for me.  The pickles will be re-canned into pint jars and the olives into half pint jars.  And when that is done, I will have several large jars to store other things.I use a lot of butter.  I not only use it on bread and toast, but use it for frying some foods and in baking.  The price of butter in the grocery store has gone up considerably, so I was able to find butter in 4 lb. packs for considerably less per pound.  I got 20 lbs. of butter.  I put it all into the freezer.  I can always can up some of it later, but I figured I had enough food to process right now.Days before this shopping trip I had gone through Sam's website and made a list of what I wanted along with the prices.  I got things like large containers of lemonade and iced tea mix along with huge containers of Nestle's Quick chocolate milk mix.  Because of the medication I take daily, staying hydrated is imperative and the flavored mixes make it more appetizing than drinking plain water.  The chocolate milk mix is just because.  :)I picked up 8-packs of Rice-a-Roni, Spam and 4 jars of Miracle Whip along with 3 huge boxes of instant mashed potatoes.  An 18-pack of Mac & Cheese and 2 large boxes of Velveeta went into the cart.  Yes, I know.  The dreaded processed food.  But in times of crisis, especially when food is scarce, I doubt anyone would turn their nose up at food, processed or not.  And when you are an old lady with mobility issues, making up a box of Mac & Cheese is much easier than making the same dish from scratch.I found trash bags and freezer bags at a good price, so I stocked up on those. And I saw a 24-pack of washcloths and a 12-pack of flour sack dishtowels.  They came home with me as well, to be set aside for future use.David had another surprise for me.  He told me that because he and his family had not bought me anything for Mother's Day or my birthday, he was going to pay part of my Sam's bill.  I said that this shopping trip was my gift, but being slightly more stubborn than his mother, he won the argument.  So with a considerable amount of wiggle room above and beyond my budget, we added more to the cart.David talked me into getting a rotisserie chicken.  He said he buys one every time he shops at Sam's and they are really good.  He was right.  I ate off it yesterday and there is still plenty left for a couple more days.There were 2 quart containers of the best tasting strawberries I have had in years.  Three quarts went into the freezer and I have been slowly snacking on the rest.I believe that in times of stress and crisis, a sweet treat now and then helps keep depression at bay.  With that in mind, I have been wanting to stock up on assorted candies to have on hand.  Plus, I have this sweet tooth that needs to be dealt with now and then.  So we headed to the candy aisles.  The boys were delighted to toss a tub o' peppermints, a tub o' M & M's and a huge bag of assorted mini Reecse's Peanut Butter Cups into my cart.  David added a box of single serve Pringles and Duane found a box of 30 microwave bags of popcorn.  Most of that went into storage.  I make no promises about the Reese's.  :)My boys became pack mules when we arrived home, huffing all my purchases up the stairs.  There were several other items I haven't mentioned that I got to try out like a biscuit mix, big jars of chicken bouillon, etc., and by the time they were finished my kitchen table was covered as well as a considerable amount of floor space.  I spent the rest of the day and part of yesterday putting it all away.The best part of all was spending time with my sons.  I so enjoy their company.  Duane came by later to bring me a different kind of kiwi he had bought (it was wonderful) and David called me yesterday to ask if I had found my kitchen table top yet.  He said he had fun taking us to Sam's and suggested we make it a semi-annual event with possibly another trip when the weather cools down in the fall.  I readily agreed.I didn't write about this to brag about how much I bought.  It took me months of saving to be able to do this.  And hopefully, it will give others an idea of what is available for adding to their food storage.  Sam's charges a yearly fee for the privilege of shopping at their stores.  For David, it is worth it because his family shops there often.  For someone like me who goes only once or twice  year, the fee would likely eat up the savings.So now that this post is written and I have had my second cup of coffee, it is time to head to the kitchen and start browning  hamburger to can.  I will be back when it is all in jars, processed and on the shelves.  And after that, of course, there will be nap.  :)"},
{"title": "Canning Weekend", "date": "Sunday, June 9, 2019", "text": "Thursday my grocery order was delivered.  Thanks to the lady taking my order having added several notes for the shoppers concerning the amounts ordered, I received everything.  So here are the results of my canning weekend.Five lbs. of grapes gave me 8 pints of the fruit.  I just filled the jars and added a light syrup of 2 cups of sugar to 10 cups of water and water bath canned them for 15 minutes.  I opened a jar this morning, and found the grapes are fairly soft like the ones in a can of fruit cocktail, but the flavor is still good.  I put some in the fridge to chill and I like them even better cold.  I won't can lots of them, but they make for variety in my canned fruit.  Variety is important.  If I just had canned peaches, I would get tired of them in short order.Next on the list was slaw/relish.  The recipe is in the comments section of the previous post.  This recipe is forgiving, so I used everything I had ordered - 10 lbs. of cabbage, 2 lbs. carrots, 1 lb. onions and 6 large green bell peppers.  I made 6 times the amount of syrup in the recipe.I used my food processor to shred the vegetables and next time, I think I will use the shredding blade rather than the regular blade that fits in the bottom.  The vegetables turned out a little more finely chopped than I usually do them, but the taste isn't affected.  I sprinkled the vegetables with canning salt and mixed the salt in, draining them after a couple of hours. I heated the syrup until the sugar was dissolved, let it cool and stirred it into the shredded vegetables.  I filled 16 pint jars with slaw/relish and processed them for 15 minutes in a water bath canner.There was some left over, so I filled 6 pint sized freezer bags  and put them in the freezer.  I will use them first, as the canned slaw stays good much longer than does the frozen.I had 12 lbs. of boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I spread out on cookie sheets and baked until they were cooked through.  Then I cut them into about 1/2 inch cubes and filled 13 pint jars.  Other chicken breast I have canned is rather bland tasting, so this time I added 1/2 teaspoon of chicken bouillon to each jar and then filled the jars with water.  I canned these at 10 lbs. pressure for my elevation, for 65 minutes.Last on the list were 4 lbs. of bacon.  This I cut into 1 inch pieces, lightly browned and drained them, and filled 9 half pint jars that I processed the same as the chicken.So that was a good start on replenishing my home canned food shelves.  I still have more I need to do, but right now, I believe I will just take a nap.  :)"},
{"title": "Getting ready...", "date": "Wednesday, June 5, 2019", "text": "for a busy weekend. I have been watching the reports of storms and flooding across the country.  Here in Minnesota a couple of thunder storms rolled through last night with high winds and rain, knocking out power in some areas.  Thankfully my town was on the edge of the worst of it and power remained on. Farmers here and in many other areas are behind in planting due to the wet weather.  Many of those who did get their crops in the fields have had them drowned out.  And many along the rivers have their entire farms under water and have lost everything - their homes, their crops, their livestock.  Our hearts go out to those farmers who are struggling against the forces of nature.  And I am sure this will have an adverse effect on prices at the grocery stores.As for me, I feel like now is the time to kick my prepping into high gear.  My grocery order to be delivered Thursday includes bacon and chicken breast to can.  I have also ordered 5 lbs. of green grapes to can.  I saw a video on how to can grapes and thought that might be something that would give me more of a variety of fruit for my food storage.  The person who did the video said the grapes turn out like those included in a can of fruit cocktail, and I like those, so it is worth a try.I guess most of the elderly who use the same grocery delivery service as I do, order in small amounts.  I don't, and that sometimes befuddles those who do the actual shopping.  I don't always receive food in the amounts ordered.  I suppose that is because the shoppers don't think a gray-haired granny type would actually order 10 lbs. of cabbage, as I have this time in order to make my relish/slaw recipe to can.  The lady who takes my order gets it, so she has added notes to the order saying that yes, the amounts are correct.  We shall see...Yesterday I opened a jar of butter that I had canned 6 years ago.  I wanted to make sure it was still good after all that time on the shelf.  It tasted as fresh as the day I canned it.  So when I go to Sam's Club in a week or so, butter is at the top of my list.  I am also considering canning lard.  Mother made the best pie crusts using lard and she used it for other dishes as well.  I think in this time of dieting and calorie counting, we forget that fats are an important part of our diets.  Oils will go rancid after a while, but canned butter and lard will last a good long time.And now I'm off to wash canning jars and assemble the ingredients needed to can up the food I have ordered.  Each grocery order from now on will include items for food storage, for I just can't see that prices will go down, but likely will hit new highs. Whatever I buy today will cost less than if I wait until tomorrow.Keep prepping!"},
{"title": "Cookies", "date": "Saturday, June 1, 2019", "text": "I love cookies.  However, I am not fond of baking cookies.  I usually make a mess of my clean kitchen, wind up with flour on my clothes and the oven heats up my apartment while baking a regular recipe of cookies.  So yesterday I tested some recipes I had found for cookie mixes.I just measured the ingredients into quart sized Ziploc bags and wrote the instructions on the outside of each bag.Last evening I tried the chocolate chip cookie mix and this morning I made the oatmeal cookies. Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix1 Cup flour1/4 Cup white sugar1/2 Cup brown sugar1/2 teaspoon soda1/2 teaspoon salt3/4 Cup chocolate chipsMix together and store in a quart size Ziploc bag.  Write instructions on the bag to add:  1/2 Cup softened butter, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Mix and bake at 350 degrees.Sugar Cookie Mix1 1/2 Cups flour3/4 Cup white sugar1/2 teaspoon baking powder1/2 teaspoon soda1/2 teaspoon saltMix together and store in a quart size Ziploc bag.  Write instructions on the bag to add:  1/2 Cup softened butter, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Mix and bake at 350 degrees.Oatmeal Cookie Mix1 Cup flour1/2 Cup white sugar1/2 Cup brown sugar1 1/2 Cup rolled oats1/2 teaspoon soda1/2 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon cinnamonOptional: 1/2 Cup raisins or nutsMix together and store in a quart size Ziploc bag.  Write instructions on the bag to add:  1/2 Cup melted butter, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Mix and bake at 350 degrees.Gingerbread Cookie Mix1 3/4 Cup flour3/4 Cup brown sugar3/4 teaspoon soda1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 Tablespoon ginger1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon1/4 teaspoon nutmeg1/4 teaspoon clovesMix together and store in a quart size Ziploc bag.  Write instructions on the bag to add:  1/4 cup softened butter, 1 egg, 1/8 cup molasses. Mix and bake at 350 degrees.I just emptied a bag into a bowl, added the butter, egg and vanilla and mixed it all together.  I suppose a person could use a spoon to mix, but I have always mixed up cookie dough with my hands.  I dropped dough by spoonfuls onto parchment paper lined cookie sheets and baked them.  Each recipe gave me about two dozen cookies and they taste really good.I haven't tried the sugar cookies or the gingerbread cookies yet, but I expect they will be as good as the others.I will make more of these mixes and stash them away in my pantry.  The amount of cookies is just right for one or two people, the kitchen stays clean and from start to finish it only took about a half hour.Success!"},
{"title": "Parallels", "date": "Tuesday, May 28, 2019", "text": "Last evening I was looking for something to watch while I worked on my grandson's afghan.  I clicked on a video of a Holocaust survivor's story.  I have no idea why I chose that one as I usually look for videos or movies that are somewhat lighter in subject, but I became interested and watched several others as well.What caught my interest weren't the horrors these people suffered, but were the things that happened leading up to the deportations to concentration camps.Most had older relatives who couldn't believe that anything bad would happen to them.  Most had Gentile friends who turned against them and some of those friends were the cause of arrests.  Whether the reasons for turning against their Jewish friends were previously hidden prejudices or fear of the German soldiers, the outcome was usually the same.  After a while nobody trusted anybody.Another factor was food.  As time went on, shops closed one by one and obtaining enough food to feed a family became difficult.  When food rationing began, the ability to find food became close to impossible.  And after the Jews  were forced to move into ghettos, food became nearly non-existent.  Many starved to death long before the deportations began.Another reoccurring theme was the lies.  Some Jews were told that if they presented themselves at a certain time at a certain location, they would be given extra rations.  When they appeared they were either loaded into boxcars or were killed outright.Other times they were told that if they volunteered to work for the German military they would earn enough to buy their food.  Those that volunteered were usually worked to death without pay or food.In the end, the Jews were lied to about everything.  It was all about promising them a better life in order to get them where the government wanted them without any fuss or bother or resistance.Food became the most important thing in the lives of many Jews.  The food they had managed to put away was confiscated.  There were no places to buy food and that didn't matter because their money and valuables had also been taken from them.  Starvation became a way of life.See any parallels?  I noticed that so many didn't believe anything bad would happen.  That seems to be the prevailing attitude today.  Even though we are watching our freedoms being eroded little by little, many don't seem to care.  As long as they have their big screen TVs and a couple of cars in the garage and can afford to go out on Saturday night, they pay little attention to what is happening around them.Many believe there will always be grocery stores full of food.  They shop once a week and believe they will do so forever.  The thought of stocking up on food and supplies seems like a waste of time and effort to them.  And they consider those of us who are into food storage to be tin foil hat wearing crazies.Most everyone is aware of the fact that politicians lie.  They tell us what they think we want to hear in order to promote whatever their agenda is.  But mostly they lie to gain or keep power.  They lie to keep us complacent.  They want us smart enough to do the work that needs to be done but dumb enough so we don't question their motives.  And all the while they are chipping away at your freedoms and mine. I don't know how all of this is going to play out, but I can guarantee it won't be to the advantage of the people. I am beginning to understand why so many are trying to rewrite history, for if we don't remember what happened in the past, we are doomed to see similar horrors in the future.It is way past time to wake up."},

{"title": "And So It Goes...", "date": "Thursday, May 16, 2019", "text": "Mothers Day was a quiet, relaxing day.  Both of my daughters called.  One sounded awful.  She was nursing a nasty cold and said she was getting off the couch just long enough for her two adult kids to take her out for lunch and then she was headed right back to the couch.  Poor thing.The other called from the road.  She was headed to North Dakota to help my grandson in college move into a different dorm room.  He was able to get a single room and was happy to have a room to himself.  And she was stocking up his supply of snacks.I was happy both of my girls could spend time with their offspring on Mother's Day.  We have plans for shopping trips later this summer.David called in the afternoon.  He said the plans to come see me had to be set aside because he had to take Maddie Mae to Urgent Care.  Poor kid has strep throat.  It just wouldn't have been right to leave her home while the other kids visited Grandma, so I talked with each of them on the phone instead.  David stopped by this afternoon with a card signed by all of them, each writing a nice greeting, and a lovely bouquet of spring flowers.  He said he didn't bring me a plant because he knew I would just kill it.  He knows his mother well.  :)  He also had a DQ Blizzard for me, which made my day.Duane had to work Sunday, but he showed up in the afternoon with a carry-out box full of ham, turkey and mashed potatoes with gravy, and another with chocolate cake.  With chocolate frosting.  He knows how to put a smile on Mom's face.Last Friday the contractor came in to do the touch-up painting on the window trim.  He promised he would be back Monday to finish the job.  This afternoon I called my landlord and told him what was going to happen if the contractor didn't show back up by Friday.  I was going to pack up his paint and tools and set them out in the hall.  I was going to have my boys move my furniture back where it belonged and I would not, under any circumstances, allow that man back into my home.  This may be just a little apartment downtown, but it is my home and I will not take any more abuse.One hour later the painting was done, the tools were packed up and my furniture was back in place.  And I didn't have to call my boys.I did call the landlord to thank him for getting the guy over here so quickly.  I figured if I call to complain, I can call to say thank you.  My landlord told me to deduct more than half my rent for June to compensate for all the trouble and because my mother raised no fools, I accepted. I had about 8 lbs. of potatoes and 4 lbs. of carrots that needed to be taken care of, so this morning I peeled and diced and blanched an got them into the dehydrator.  They will go into the bags of dried vegetables I use for soups and stews.  I need to get my grocery order ready and am trying to decide what to get for storage this time.  I think I may go for some of the packaged rice and pasta mixes, as they are always good for a quick meal.  I'm holding off on the meat for canning until David takes me to Sam's Club where I can get it cheaper.I managed to get the dust from the construction cleaned out of my sewing machine and have been working on finishing some quilt tops.  With any kind of luck I will have pictures in a week or so.I know Spring is here for sure.  I watched three or four little boys practicing with their skateboards in the alley across the street.  They are fun to watch when they are working hard at mastering a trick, and when mastered, moving on to another.Takes very little to amuse me.  :)"},
{"title": "So the day after I grumble about cooking...", "date": "Tuesday, May 14, 2019", "text": "I cooked.A couple of weeks ago, when I was digging in my freezer, I found a forgotten bag full of venison that youngest son David had given me.  The meat was vacuum sealed so it was all good. It didn't start out well.  I had promised Duane a venison roast dinner, but when I opened the package of meat I found I had thawed out chops instead.  Undeterred, I soldiered on, browning the chops and putting them into the crock pot with salt, pepper, onion, a little garlic and a sprinkling of sage.  They simmered all day until they were falling apart tender.Later in the  day I scrubbed half a dozen potatoes and cut them into wedges.  Then I peeled some carrots and cut them into about 3-inch chunks.  I tossed the whole works in a little olive oil, spread them out on a cookie sheet, sprinkled them with salt, pepper and some parsley flakes and baked them until they were nicely browned and tender.Deciding to go all out, I dug into my pantry and came up with a yellow cake mix and a can of crushed pineapple.  I stirred up the cake, drained the pineapple and mixed it into the batter and baked it.  I used the pineapple juice to flavor the buttercream frosting.Duane says I done good.  He says when you make your living as a cook, it is a treat to eat someone else's cooking.  And I had fun fixing a meal for someone besides myself.Guess I will have to retract my previous post.  :)"},
{"title": "I Hate to Cook", "date": "Monday, May 13, 2019", "text": "Well, maybe that's a little bit harsh.  I hate to cook for just one.I enjoyed making big meat and potato type meals or big bowls of spaghetti or pans of lasagna when there were lots of kids at the dinner table.  I miss that.  I even miss the inevitable \"But, Mom...Do I really hafta eat the green beans?  You know I hate green beans.\"  And I miss the nearly nightly arguments about whose turn it was to wash the supper dishes. These days if I really want a full meal, my crock pot is my friend.  Toss the food in and let it simmer all day.  And there are no arguments about whose turn it is to wash dishes.  Sadly, it is always my turn.I read blogs where the writers are serving up fantastic meals for their families and I am jealous.  They spend hours slicing and dicing and sauteing and allowing the flavors to blend.  My idea of a gourmet meal is frying the Spam before making a sandwich. Perhaps I have just become lazy.  It's not that I dislike working with food.  My shelves packed full of home canned goodies and my other shelf full of home dehydrated foods are testimony to that.  I just can't seem to muster the ambition to cook very many real meals for just myself. Might be  form of 'empty nest syndrome,' for I am looking forward to tomorrow when I will cook a venison roast with roasted potatoes and carrots to share with Duane.  There might even be a dessert involved. So I am wondering if anyone besides me considers crackers and cheese and a handful of grapes a sufficient lunch.  Sigh."},

{"title": "So I had another chat...", "date": "Wednesday, May 8, 2019", "text": "with my landlord on Monday.  I expressed my desire to have the window work finished.  Actually, what I said was that I was just plain done.  We talked about the pictures I had taken of the condition of my living room with furniture now taking up most of the floor space and the shelving unit moved in front of my sewing table and left there for two weeks with my sewing machine open to the dust and the fact that I couldn't get at it to clean it.  Or use it.  We discussed the notion that an attorney perhaps might consider that obstacle course a bit dangerous for an elderly lady who is tethered to an oxygen machine and who has mobility issues. He called me back ten minutes later, telling me the window guys would arrive this morning to finish the job.My landlord stopped by about 10:30 this morning to see how the work was progressing.  It wasn't.  They were nowhere to be seen.  I swear, I could see steam coming out his ears when he left. Half an hour later there was some serious sawing of boards and nailing of trim around the windows going on.  They will be back here in the morning to do some touch-up painting and to restore my living room to its original condition.  They know about the pictures.I don't like confrontation or yelling or unpleasantness.  Peace and serenity make me much happier.  But sometimes a person just has to stand up for themselves.  It has been nearly four months since this project began. My patience is gone.My landlord surprised me by volunteering to deduct a goodly amount of money from my next month's rent for every month I have been inconvenienced.  I didn't ask for that nor did I expect it.  But I'll take it.And now I need to order curtains to cover my lovely, new, finished windows.  :)"},
{"title": "Prepping Lesson Learned", "date": "Sunday, May 5, 2019", "text": "I had half a head of lettuce in my fridge that needed to be used up, so I made myself a salad to go with supper.  There was no Ranch Dressing in the fridge so I raided my pantry closet, knowing there were three bottles of it on the shelf.When I opened the dressing bottle, the contents smelled odd.  When I looked closely, I saw the color was darker than it should be.  The second bottle was the same as was the third.  They went in the trash.The expiration date on all three bottles was Feb 2017.  Ordinarily I don't pay much attention to expiration dates or 'Best if used by' dates.  Many commercially canned foods are good long after those dates.  Apparently Ranch Dressing isn't one of them.I don't know if the room where they were stored was too warm or if it was because so many foods like that are now packaged in plastic rather than glass.  I have had the same problem with ketchup in plastic bottles.  I also had one jar of mayo that tasted off, but I think that was because I bought the cheaper store brand.I know there are dry mixes for ranch dressing.  I may try that.  I don't use much dressing, so it makes more sense to use a mix rather than try to keep bottles of it on hand.I also found this recipe that looks good, so I may try it before buying the commercial mix.RANCH DRESSING MIX1/2 cup nonfat dry powdered milk2 tablespoons dry parsley flakes1 teaspoon dill weed1 teaspoon onion powder1 teaspoon onion flakes1 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon garlic powder1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper1/4 teaspoon celery seed1 teaspoon brown sugarMix all ingredients. Store in an airtight container. To make dressing, mix 1 heaping tablespoon into 1 cup buttermilk that's been mixed with 1 cup mayonnaise. Stir until well blended. Store covered in refrigerator until ready to use. Wait at least 30 minutes for flavors to combine.RANCH DIP1 cup mayonnaise1 cup sour cream1 heaping tablespoon Ranch Dressing MixStir all ingredients together and refrigerate for 2 or more hours before serving to allow flavors to blend.Buttermilk is not something  have on hand, but  found powdered buttermilk in the grocery store next to the non-fat instant powdered milk and I bought one.  I may get a couple more. I'll let you know how it all works out."},
{"title": "An Experiment...", "date": "Friday, May 3, 2019", "text": "Some time back I saw a few videos on homesteading and prepping channels about using Crisco to make candles.  As it happens, I have three or four large cans of Crisco that I bought at Sam's Club several years ago.  I find that I rarely use it for baking or frying like my mother did.  So the cans were taking up space that could be used for other things.I filled a pint jar with Crisco, leaving about an inch of space at the top.  I have some utility- type candles that are about half an inch thick and 6 inches long.  I shoved one of these down into the center of the jar and lit the wick.  I let it burn for 8 hours and found it had burned down less than half an inch.   I don't yet know how far down it will burn before it goes out. There was no noticeable odor or smoke.The Crisco burns sort of like the wax in any other container candle.  It melts as it burns so there is very little unmelted Crisco clinging to the inside of the jar.  I used a regular pint jar.  I'm not sure if the Crisco would have melted from the sides of a wide mouth jar as well as it does in the small mouth jar.I have 6 more of the utility candles, so I will make more of the Crisco candles to use as emergency lighting.  I also have a couple of cases of the very small canning jars that hold 1/2 cup each.  I am wondering if I could also fill them with Crisco and use thick birthday cake candles for the wicks.  Those would be like over sized tea lights.Sometimes ideas work and sometimes, not so much.  I was kind of surprised that the Crisco candle actually worked.  Candles don't give off a lot of light, but in a pinch, they are better than no light at all."},

{"title": "The Light in the Tunnel Was a Freight Train...", "date": "Friday, April 26, 2019", "text": "headed my way.The window guys did manage to install the two remaining windows in my living room on Tuesday.  Wednesday morning they did some work on the outside of the building.  I haven't seen them since. I wouldn't mind so much except for the fact that they moved furniture again - a couple of pieces into my bedroom and the rest taking up most of the floor space in my living room.  I can't get to the new windows to open them to let in the lovely spring air.  I can't get to my sewing table because one of my shelving units now sits in front of it.  They did cover my sewing table that holds several quilt tops I am working on, but they neglected to cover my sewing machine.  I wonder if I can get the dust out of it so it isn't ruined.  Sigh.I called my landlord but he had no better luck in getting them back here to put up the trim around the windows and straighten things up.  I thought about going all mad-as-a-hornet old lady on them, but realized that if they didn't care enough to move things so a woman with mobility issues could easily walk in her living room, I doubted they would get the point.  I have come to the conclusion that good manners and common sense are basically a thing of the past.So now that I have griped enough, the rest of the week has been productive.  I have 10 lbs. of sliced potatoes in the dehydrators.  Tomorrow I will dry 5 lbs. of onions. Earlier I had dehydrated the cranberry pulp left over from making cranberry juice, so I dug that out and turned it into powder.  I now have nearly two pints of cranberry powder.  I know it can be used for flavoring like in cranberry/banana bread, but I wonder if it could be mixed with something like lemonade and honey as a tea and used in place of the cranberry juice that I keep on hand for urinary infections.  I remember that years ago I bought cranberry powder at a pet store, on the advice of my vet, to treat a cat with a urinary infection.  I may have to experiment with it.My kids always get me something nice for Mother's Day and my birthday in June.  This year I have something specific in mind.  I can no longer drive or even go out without help.  So I talked with my youngest daughter Jeri, and she is going to take me to a huge thrift store nearby.  I love rummaging about in thrift stores and particularly want to add to my collection of reading material along with browsing among the kitchen stuff.  David called today and I talked with him about a trip to Sam's Club to stock up on some of the things I can't order with my grocery delivery service or are cheaper at Sam's.  He thought that was a great idea.  Jill doesn't know it yet, but she will be taking me to the fabric store.  I need fabric for the backs of quilts, quilt batting and a few miscellaneous sewing notions.  Duane can't drive yet because of the effects of his stroke, so we won't be going anywhere, but once in a while he brings me food from the restaurant where he is working, so I will let him off the hook!  Today he showed up with a half a pizza, so I didn't have to cook supper.  Last Sunday he brought me some sliced turkey, ham and roast beef along with a big bowl of mixed fresh fruit.  I'd say that was more than enough of a gift.  :)So that's what is going on in my little corner of the world.  Even with a couple of irritations, life is still pretty darned good!Keep smiling and keep prepping.  :)"},

{"title": "Just a Bit of a Ramble", "date": "Friday, April 19, 2019", "text": "It has been one of those weeks when nothing of any great value gets done, but lots of little chores are accomplished.First off, Bella the Rat Terrier stayed with me for three extra days, not that I'm complaining, mind you!  Apparently the restaurant where Duane is working was so happy to have him back at work that they scheduled him for more days than he thought they would.  So Vicki's Doggie Day Care Service was called upon to help out.  And when there is a pup to pet and belly rub and spoil, not much else gets done, especially when said dog is afraid of the thunder when a storm rolled through on Wednesday morning.  If I sat at my desk, she was under it with her chin on my foot.  If I sat in my recliner, she was on my lap, snuggling and trembling.  I don't think she got more than two feet away from me all morning.  But once the storm passed, she laid claim to my green fuzzy blanket and snoozed until Duane picked her up later in the day.  She went home Wednesday evening in order to be there when her owner arrived on Thursday.  I miss her.I have four large jars of bread and butter pickles in my pantry.  I can not eat an entire jar of pickles and chances are pretty good that if I put a large opened jar of pickles in the fridge, I will either lose it or forget about it.  So I re-can them into half pint jars.  This was the plan until I discovered I am low on canning lids.  Canning lids are not in the catalog I use for ordering groceries, but I have found a couple of places where I can order them in bulk, so that is on my 'to do' list for next month. I re-can several food items that I buy in bulk - usually in #10 cans - that are cheaper to buy than individual cans.  There was a time when I would get 25 lb. boxes of tomatoes from the Farmer's Market and make my own pasta sauce, tomato sauce and ketchup, but these days, age and arthritis have slowed down that process.  Re-canning makes it possible to get some foods at a good price and put them up in smaller batches that work better for a single person living alone.  I have done the same thing with cheese sauce and nacho cheese sauce, both of which turn out just fine.  Pickles turn out just a wee bit softer than the original, but that doesn't bother me at all. Most grocery stores have a shelf of bulk foods.  Mine includes instant mashed potatoes in a 3.5 lb. carton.  I will buy two or three cartons and divide the contents into single servings, stored in zip lock bags.  If I want flavored mashed potatoes, I just add a little garlic powder or onion powder or parsley flakes when I make it.There was a time when I thought it was a sin to serve anything that wasn't totally made from scratch.  But that was when I had a huge garden and when I milked my own cow and raised my own chickens.  And when I was decades younger.  I have since changed my mind.I know how to make chocolate or butterscotch pudding from scratch, but I prefer to add milk to a mix and whisk it for a couple of minutes instead of standing at my stove and cooking the pudding.  Sometimes I would rather use a Hamburger Helper mix for a quick meal rather than making a casserole from scratch.  Same with stuffing or the mashed potatoes.  Those of us with mobility issues often look for methods of doing things that don't hurt.  But it seems we need permission to use convenience foods because our mothers and grandmother cooked everything from scratch.  Sometimes I use store bought mixes and sometimes I make my own.  But if they will make life a little bit more bearable, it is OK.And that is enough rambling for one day.This is me...wishing all of you a blessed Easter."},
{"title": "Survive and Thrive", "date": "Monday, April 15, 2019", "text": "In my travels through the Internet, I found that FEMA had once recommended that citizens keep a three day supply of food and water in their homes.  Then their recommendation was six weeks worth of supplies.  The latest FEMA warning I read says that six months worth of food and water is recommended and they talk about power outages lasting that long.  Do they know something we don't?We have become a nation of selfish, lazy people.  I wish I had a dime for every time someone has remarked that they wouldn't go to all the work of preserving their own food because they can just buy what they want at the store.  And I might add, pay a whopping price for organic, non GMO food.People don't know how to do much of anything any more.  Why bother learning the old skills when you can just hire someone else to do the work.  Or push a button on the microwave.  Or Google to find out whatever you want to know.  This got me to thinking about how my grandparents were able to cope in their world without electricity and running water.At Grandma's farm in northern Minnesota, water was obtained by pumping it into buckets at the hand pump outside the back door and hauling it into the house.  A bucket of drinking water with a dipper in it was kept on a stool in the kitchen by the back door.  If hot water was needed, it was heated in big pots on a wood burning stove.Meals were cooked and bread was baked in that same wood burning stove in the kitchen.  That meant that Grandma and her daughters needed to know how much wood to use in order to cook food or bake bread but not burn it.  Someone also needed to know how to cut down trees, how to season the wood so it would burn properly and how to cut it up into pieces that would fit in the stove's burn compartment, as well as how to cut kindling to get the fire started.Grandma didn't have an electric refrigerator, even after the family finally got electricity in the house.  She had a wooden, tin lined ice box.  One door opened to shelves that held the food and another compartment held blocks of ice.  There was a tray below that held the water from the melting ice. In the country there were no ice delivery services as there were in the cities.  To get the blocks of ice, in the dead of winter, Grandpa and his sons hitched up a hay wagon to their team of horses and went to a nearby frozen  lake.  They used hand saws to cut through the thick ice and cut the ice into blocks.  They loaded the blocks onto the wagon and drove the team back home. A large hole had been dug in the side of the hill behind the house.  It was like a small cave with steps leading down into it and wooden beams shoring up the ceiling and walls.  There was a wooden door installed at ground level that when closed acted like a trap door.  This was their root cellar where potatoes, cabbages, carrots and rutabagas were kept.  It was in this root cellar the blocks of ice were hauled and packed in thick straw, where they remained frozen all summer for use in the ice box.In the summer, Grandpa and the boys would load a small wood stove onto a wagon.  Grandma would get together food for a few days, canning jars and canning supplies and off the family would go to the blueberry bogs north of their home.  There the kids would pick blueberries and Grandma would can them up in jars using the wood stove for heat.  They slept on quilts under the wagon at night and worked during the day until Grandma had filled all her jars with canned blueberries, usually enough to last a year.  Then they would pack up and go home.I remember walking to the barn with my Uncle Kenneth when he went to milk the cows by the light of a kerosene lantern.  The fresh milk was run through a hand cranked cream separator, the milk running out a spout into a bucket on one side and the cream on another side.  Grandma would churn much of the cream into butter.The family kept a huge garden and Grandma canned most of the vegetables, but she stored some of them in the root cellar to have fresh over the winter.  She washed clothes in a wash tub using a washboard and handmade lye soap.  Her clothes dryer was a rope strung between two trees and a bag full of clothespins.  She and her daughters sewed their own clothes as well as shirts for the boys.  They saved chicken feathers to stuff pillows with.  They stuffed mattresses with straw.  They sold eggs and butter to pay for what they couldn't make themselves.  During the Depression, some of the girls taught in rural schools and some of the boys rode freight trains west to earn money on wheat thrashing crews or picking potatoes in Idaho, all of them sending money home to help the family.Grandma, Grandpa and their nine children not only survived, but thrived because they knew how to do things.  The family had greater importance in their eyes than families seem to today.  I have a hard time envisioning kids today working as hard as my Dad and his siblings did, without complaint, to see that the family had what they needed.  Given the same living conditions, and that's pretty much what we will have if the lights go out for an extended period of time, I have to wonder just how many these days would be able to cope."},

{"title": "Getting Ready and More Mixes", "date": "Wednesday, April 10, 2019", "text": "We have a storm rolling in.  The clouds already look ugly and the temperature is dropping.  West of us are expecting blizzard conditions.  Here we are looking at rain, sleet and snow starting this evening and continuing until Friday.So this morning I made sure my dirty dishes were washed, dried and put away.  My washer and dryer are running and will continue until my clothes basket is empty.  Nothing worse than a sink full of dirty dishes and a basket full of dirty clothes if the power goes out.  Several 5 gallon buckets are ready to fill from the bathtub before the water pressure goes away.  Thankfully I have plenty of home canned food on the shelves that can be eaten right out of the jars if need be.So in between washer loads I have been working on making more mixes.  The following are ones that I use most often.  I expect that many of you are already familiar with them, but here they are anyway.Homemade Bisquick Mix9 Cups flour1 3/4 Cups instant dry milk1/3 /cup baking powder4 teaspoons salt1 3/4 Cups shorteningWhisk together the first four ingredients, blending well.  Add the shortening and cut it into the dry ingredients.  You don't want to see any lumps of shortening.  I use my hand held electric mixer for this step.Store in an air tight container.  Shortening is used because it doesn't need to be refrigerated.  I make up several recipes at a time, keeping one in the cupboard to use and freezing the rest.  If I am going to make a mess, I want to do it only once within several months.  :)To use:  Combine 1 Cup of mix with 1/4 cup water for biscuits and dumplings.  Bake at 400 degrees until lightly browned on top.Admittedly, biscuits from scratch are better, but these work well when I want biscuits quickly or when I am making them to pour stew or gravy over. Beef Gravy Mix1 1/3 Cups dry milk3/4 Cup flour3 Tablespoons beef bouillon powder1/8 teaspoon thyme or 1/8 teaspoon celery powder1/4 teaspoon onion powder1/8 teaspoon sage or 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder(Note:  When this recipe and the next one call for choices, I put it all in.)Mix well.  To use:  Whisk 1/2 cup of the mix into 1 Cup of cold water.  Stir constantly over medium heat until slightly thick.  2-3 minutes.Chicken Gravy Mix1 2/3 Cups dry milk3/4 Cup flour3 Tablespoons chicken bouillon powder1/4 teaspoon sage1/8 teaspoon pepper or 1/4 teaspoon onion powder or 1/8 teaspoon paprikaDirections are the same as for the Beef Gravy Mix.I dehydrate lots of different vegetables including potato slices.  I slice the potatoes thin using a mandolin slicer.  The slices are blanched in boiling water for 3 minutes, cooled down in very cold water, drained and then spread out in a single layer on the dehydrator trays.  I dry them at 135 degrees.  The time varies according to the kind of potato and the weather, mostly humidity.  I use the following recipe for using my dehydrated potatoes more than any other.Scalloped Potato Basic Sauce1/3 Cup plus 2 Tablespoons nonfat dry milk2 Tablespoons flour2 Tablespoons cornstarch1 teaspoon onion powder or 1 Tablespoon crushed dried onions1/8 teaspoon pepperMakes sauce for one recipe of scalloped potatoes.To use:  Place 3 Cups of the dehydrated potato slices in a medium sized casserole dish.  Sprinkle with sauce mix and dot with 3 Tablespoons of butter.  Stir in 3 Cups boiling water.  Bake at 400 degrees for 30-35 minutes or until potatoes are tender.  Cubed ham or bacon bits or cheese can be added for flavor.Note:  I wasn't completely satisfied with the results from baking the scalloped potatoes in the oven, but find that they turn out well when cooked in a crock pot.Stuffing in a Bag3 Cups bread crumbs or small cubes(Note:  I make my own by slicing bread into small cubes and drying it on cookie sheets in a 200 degree oven.).1/2 Tablespoon dried parsley1 Tablespoon onion powder2 Tablespoons dried celery slices or 1 Tablespoon celery powder(Note:  I found the celery pieces didn't rehydrate well.  I used my little coffee grinder to turn dehydrated celery into powder, so I get the taste of celery but not the hard pieces.)1 teaspoon thyme1/2 teaspoon pepper1/2 teaspoon sage (I like more so I double the amount.)1 1/2 teaspoons powdered chicken bouillonCombine all ingredients in a zip lock bag.To use:  Bring 1 1/2 Cups water to a boil with 1/4 Cup butter.  Stir in contents of the bag.  Remove from heat and cover for 5 minutes.  Fluff with a fork.I use many of my dehydrated vegetables for soup.  To avoid having to haul out several bags of vegetables every time I want to make soup, I put several pint jars of soup mix together at one time, and then it is just a matter of grabbing a jar, dumping into a crock pot, adding 2 quarts of water and letting it cook all day.  There are many recipes out there for soup.  I tend to follow a basic formula:2 Cups of vegetables2 Tablespoons of either beef or chicken bouillonSometimes I use dehydrated mixed vegetables.Sometimes I use just potato cubes, carrot cubes and celery pieces. (Celery rehydrates well in the crock pot.)Sometimes I put together vegetables that appeal to me at the time, including dried onions and cabbage.If I want a beefy vegetable soup, I add either dried tomatoes or a couple Tablespoons of tomato powder and a Tablespoon of beef bouillon.If I want chicken flavored soup I skip the tomatoes and use chicken bouillon.  A couple of bouillon cubes can be used instead of powdered bouillon.If I want meat in the soup, I just add a pint of my home canned beef or chicken or pork cubes.  Or maybe ham or turkey.  Or whatever meat is leftover from supper the night before.  The combinations are endless.  And the soup is really good.  Beats the heck out of soup that comes in a can.I saw it had started to snow about an hour ago.  That wasn't supposed to happen until tonight.  My green fuzzy blanket is folded over the arm of my recliner.  My Kindle is fully charged as is the battery in my laptop.  I'm ready for you, Mother Nature.  :)"},
{"title": "Homemade Mixes", "date": "Monday, April 8, 2019", "text": "I am working on cutting back the amount of money I spend on groceries.  Over the years I have tried making my own convenience mixes and I spent the better part of today replenishing part of my stock.This first recipe isn't a mix, but it is a substitute for one.  I love chocolate milk and have in the past bought Nestle's Quick or Ovaltine for that purpose.  Prices have gone up and I just can't justify paying that much for an indulgence.  So I made a batch of chocolate syrup, similar to Hershey's.Chocolate Syrup1/2 Cup dry cocoa1 1/2 Cups sugar1 Cup water1/4 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon vanillaSift cocoa.  Whisk into water over medium heat.  Add sugar and stir to dissolve.  Bring to a rolling boil and stir constantly for 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in salt and vanilla.  Cool.  Store in fridge.  Will keep for several months.I have stopped buying brown sugar.  I make my own, usually 4 cups at a time.  For every cup of granulated sugar I add 1 Tablespoon of molasses.  Using either a stand mixer or a hand held one, I stir the sugar and molasses together on a medium speed setting, scraping the sides of the bowl now and then, until they are completely combined.  I can't tell the difference between store bought brown sugar and my homemade.I am getting low on laundry soap, so I made another batch.Laundry Soap1 bar Fels Naptha soap (I use whatever bars of soap I have on hand - 1 bath size bar or 2 smaller bars.)1 Cup Washing Soda1 Cup Borax(Washing Soda and Borax can be found in the laundry soap section of the grocery store.)Finely grate the soap.   Stir in the Washing Soda and Borax and blend well.  Use 1 Tablespoon per washer load.I dearly love a cup of cocoa in the evenings or sometimes I will have cocoa and toast for breakfast.  This isn't the Swiss Miss type of cocoa, but more like what Mother made by heating milk and adding cocoa powder and sugar.Hot Cocoa Mix5 Cups dry milk3 Cups powdered sugar1 1/2 Cups cocoa powder1 Cup dry coffee creamer (like Creamora)Sift the ingredients together and mix until well blended.To use, stir 1/3 Cup of the mix into a mug of hot water.Toss in a few mini marshmallows for an extra treat.I know that the Jiffy cornbread mixes are fairly inexpensive, but I like the taste of my homemade mix better.Jiffy Cornbread Mix4 Cups flour4 cups yellow cornmeal2 Cups dry milk3/4 Cups sugar1/4 Cup baking powder1 teaspoon saltPut all the ingredients in a large bowl and blend well.To use:  Beat 1 egg and 1 Cup of water together with a fork.  Stir in 2 1/3 Cups of the mix and 1/4 Cup melted butter.  Bake at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes.  This makes an 8 x 8 pan of cornbread or 12 corn muffins.  Good just buttered but even better with a little honey drizzled on.That was enough for one day.  I have a few other mixes to make, but that will keep until next week, as I have other projects going that need to be finished.  I store all my mixes in canning jars, well labeled, so I don't accidentally try to wash a load of clothes with cornbread mix.  Don>t ask.  :)I like to have convenience foods like mixes on hand, but don't like paying the prices in the stores.  And by making my own mixes, I know what is in them.  Win - win!"},

{"title": "Cranberry Juice", "date": "Sunday, March 24, 2019", "text": "So a couple of weeks ago I awoke with the symptoms of a bladder infection.  I opened a quart of my home canned cranberry juice and sipped on it all day.  The next morning the symptoms had disappeared and have not returned.I have used cranberry juice on other occasions for the same purpose, but used store bought juice, which took several days to work.  I suspect what the makers of cranberry juice advertise as 100% juice, isn't.A couple of years ago Duane brought me 75 lbs. of fresh cranberries from the Farmer's Market.  There is a vendor there who has the most beautiful cranberries I have ever seen.  I have never found a bad berry and each and every one is a gorgeous dark red color.  They make the cranberries from the store look like poor seconds.The berries come in 25 lb. boxes.  I had used most of one box but circumstances prevented me from preserving the rest, so I bagged them up and froze them.  Last year I needed the freezer space, so I thawed out the berries, filled canning jars with them, adding water to cover and canned them, thinking I could use them up at a later date.  The later date has arrived.After drinking one quart of cranberry juice, I saw I had only three quarts left.  It was time to make more, so yesterday I hauled all 29 quart jars of canned cranberries to the kitchen.  I dumped 5 quarts at a time into the stock pot, added an equal amount of water and brought it to a simmer.  I let it simmer for 10 minutes and then ran it through a colander, letting the juice drip into another pot and saving the cooked berries.Once that was done, I mashed up the cooked berries, added water to maybe an inch over the berry pulp and brought that to a simmer.  Then I drained all of that, extracting more juice.  Again I saved the pulp and will dehydrate it tomorrow.  Have no idea what to use powdered cranberries for, but I can't stand wasting them.This morning I dumped 7 quarts of juice at a time into a stock pot, added 2 1/2 cups of sugar and heated the juice until the sugar was dissolved and the juice was fairly hot.  Then it went into quart jars and was canned in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes.  I now have 35 quarts of lovely, ruby red cranberry juice, plus a couple of quarts in the fridge just to drink.This whole thing was an experiment.  I had only before made juice using fresh cranberries, but it turned out well.And now, you guessed it.  Time for a little nap.  :)"},
{"title": "I Can Be Such a Dunderhead...", "date": "Friday, March 22, 2019", "text": "So I am at the sewing machine, happily stitching zig-zags around more 4x4 bandage pads.  I had just switched an empty spool of thread for a full one, when the stitches went all wonky.  I fiddled with the dials, trying to adjust the tension to straighten out the stitches.  Didn't work.So then I went in search of the instruction manual, tearing apart the book case where I thought it was.  Finally found it, buried under a stack of quilting books.  By that time there were books and magazines scattered all over the floor.Read the instructions.  Tried all the fixes for stitches.  The zig-zags were still wonky.Frustration is building.  I dug out my other sewing machine, only to find that the spindle that holds the thread was broken off.  Why do they make these things out of breakable plastic?  Better buy some super glue soon.Gave up and fixed a sandwich for lunch.  Back at the machine, I took a long hard look and discovered I had threaded it with quilting thread by mistake.  Quilting thread is stiffer and thicker than regular sewing thread.  No wonder the stitches had gone all wonky. Threaded the machine with regular sewing thread.  Worked like a charm. By the time I figured out what was wrong and cleaned up the mess I made looking for the manual and packed up the second machine and put it away, my morning was shot. Those who don't sew will likely not understand how frustrating these machines can be sometimes.  And those who do sew will get how something as simple as using the wrong thread can really mess things up. Yep.  Dunderhead. So then I took a nap, which seemed like the most reasonable thing to do at the time.  :)"},
{"title": "Mysteries", "date": "Wednesday, March 20, 2019", "text": "Most evenings after supper dishes are done, will find me at my desk working on one handiwork project or another.  My computer is my source of entertainment.  I don't own a TV.  I got rid of mine when I realized I hadn't found anything I cared to watch for over 6 months.  Sometimes I will find a movie on YouTube.  Sometimes I listen to music on Pandora.  Then I discovered YouTube had audio books.  Many of the offerings were newer publications.  And that's when I realized how much our society has changed.Most of the books on my Kindle were gleaned from the Project Gutenberg website, where books can be downloaded in several formats, all for free.  They are mostly books that are out of copyright, so their publication dates range from the mid 1800's to around the 1930's or so.   My taste runs mostly to mysteries, but I have others like Dickens, Mark Twain and other authors of the era.Upon browsing the audio books on YouTube, I found some of the older books, but also found many newer mysteries.   So I decided to try them out.  What I found was that while the older mysteries had great stories to tell, the newer ones seem to be written more for shock value than for the stories.  Nearly every mystery contains a murder, and then the hero goes about finding clues to identify and ultimately capture the murderer.  The older mysteries follow a story line with a colorful cast of characters and various clues that lead to a conclusion in the last chapter and the mystery is solved often on the last couple of pages.The newer books seem to lean toward graphically describing every torture, often prolonged, that the victim endures before having their life viciously ended by the murderer.  And often the bad guy is a serial killer so we can relive these tortures through several victims before he is caught by hard hitting, hard drinking detectives who aren't much better than the bad guy.I realize that bad things happened during the times the older novels were written.  And sometimes those things are the subject of books.  But most of those authors didn't feel the need to rub our noses in every bloody, gory detail like they do now.I read for pleasure.  I read to escape the horrors of the day.  If I want nightmares, all I need do is watch the news.Me...I'll take Agatha Christie's novels any day."},

{"title": "Flannel Update", "date": "Friday, March 15, 2019", "text": "I am pleased with most of the results.I cut out 40 bandage pads, 20 of the 4x7 family cloths and 20 of the 6x10  paper towel substitutes  and ran a zig-zag stitch around each one.  I wanted to test them before going crazy cutting flannel.I am using the bandage pads now.  The nurse was here and applied them to the areas on my legs that needed them.  I use an antibiotic salve on each one.  Without that, they could stick to an open wound, but any kind of salve including just Vaseline would work.  My personal preference is Bag Balm (for cows) to use on scrapes or minor cuts.  My legs are wrapped from toes to knees in Ace bandages and they hold the pads in place.  For use in other areas I have found the first aid tape they sell in stores to be pretty much useless.  It doesn't stick well at all.  I would use duct tape before I would use the first aid tape to hold a pad in place.  I have used the ribbed part of a sock to hold a bandage pad on a cut on my arm, but I need to find a better way to keep them in place where I wouldn't use the Ace bandages.   I think two or three layers of flannel could be sewn together with a zig-zag stitch to provide different sizes or thicker pads, but I will make mine single layered and just use several together if I need more absorption.I got another dozen or so family cloths cut and then decided to quit being so persnickety about size.  My ruler that I use with my rotary cutter is 6.5 inches wide.  The cloths are now 6.5 x 6.5 inches square.  Went much faster cutting.I have been using the family cloths for a couple of days and find no problem with them.  They are softer than toilet paper and are very absorbent.  I washed them in my little apartment sized washer on the low water setting in hot water with a little bit of bleach and laundry detergent, and they came out clean with no odor.  In a grid down situation, they can be washed by hand.  Sometimes I think we have become more squeamish and less practical.  Grandma washed diapers for 9 children using a wash tub and washboard.I need to buy a small trash can with a lid to hold the used ones until laundry day each week.  I folded each cloth and stacked them in a basket that sits on top of the toilet tank.I don't like the flannel paper towels.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe they are too small and too thin, but when I made a couple larger sizes and double thickness, I still didn't like them.  The ones I have seen in how-to videos online and in Etsy shops are much more elaborate, often using terry cloth on one side and another fabric on top, with enclosed edges and top stitching around each one.  This isn't rocket science.  This is paper towels and I just can't justify the time and expense for making them like that.  So I may just buy some cheap washcloths at the dollar store or maybe use some of my older terrycloth dishtowels  instead and use the ones I already made for handkerchiefs.  I have a big bag that holds more sturdy rags that are from old clothes I cut up and recycled for scrub rags, mostly t-shirts and sweatshirts and pants.  With those and a few washcloths, I likely can get along just fine without paper towels of any sort.I will definitely be making more of the bandages and the family cloths.  I can dry them in my little clothes dryer, but I think I will look for one of those fold-up wooden clothes drying racks.  I should have one anyway in case we lose our electricity for any length of time making the dryer useless.  If stored in zip lock bags, they will stay neat and clean and can be tucked anywhere for storage.  Because they can be stored flat rather than on a roll, they take up much less space.  Any fabric will eventually wear out so having extras stashed seems like a good idea to me.  Lord knows - I surely do have enough flannel for it!!"},

{"title": "Sometimes things go according to plan...", "date": "Saturday, March 2, 2019", "text": "sometimes not so much.The original plan was to combine all the ingredients for the soup and divide it between the two largest pots I own to simmer it for awhile before canning.  It soon became obvious that there were way more vegetables than would fit in the pots.  As I didn't want to spend the better part of the day cooking and not canning, I devised a Plan B.I filled each jar 2/3 full of raw vegetables and topped them off with diced tomatoes.   I made beef broth with bouillon cubes and used that for the liquid in each jar.   Because beef bouillon contains protein, I canned the soup at the same times I use for canning meat.One pint jar didn't seal, so I heated that soup for lunch.  It turned out really good.  There are still two canner loads waiting to be processed, but when all is said and done, I will have 48 pints and 25 quarts to go on my shelves.  It was definitely worth the time and effort.And now I think I could use a nap.  :)"},

The whole shebang will be heated to a boil and then simmered for an hour or so.  Then into jars it all goes and will be run through my pressure canner.I use this mixture as vegetable soup.  Or I add home canned beef cubes for vegetable beef soup.  Or I thicken it for beef stew.  It is basically the same recipe, minus the tomatoes, that I use for chicken vegetable soup.  Both are my go-to home canned foods for a quick yet nourishing meal.Be back when I have worked my way out from under this pile of vegetables.  :)"},

They hate Republicans, they hate Trump.\"\"So the suggestion that there’s ever going to be civil discourse in this country for the foreseeable future is over,\" said the former federal prosecutor. \"It’s not going to be.\"\"It’s going to be total war,\" he said. \"And as I say to my friends, I do two things – I vote and I buy guns.”I see every day how the left is working overtime to bring down our duly elected president.  They put way more time and effort trying to achieve that goal than they do in caring for those they are supposed to represent.And now they want to kill babies.I think Mr. diGenova is spot on.  I no longer think it is a matter of 'if.'  It is a matter of 'when.'"},

{"title": "Interesting Week", "date": "Tuesday, February 19, 2019", "text": "Today started out at -2 degrees F.  Tomorrow will be warmer with 4 - 8 inches of snow, depending on which weather report you listen to.  Thursday is to be sunny, Friday cloudy and then it gets interesting.  Rain and snow is predicted for Saturday with more snow on Sunday. If things go true to form, the grocery stores will be jam-packed with panicked shoppers stocking up on bread, milk and whatever else they think they need to survive the weekend.  I just don't understand why folks would rather fight the crowds in stores than get ready ahead of time.For example - I will run out of milk today.  I usually have two gallons delivered every other week.  It is my own fault I ordered only one gallon this time.  My bad.  But I have lots of instant powdered milk on hand.  So this evening I will make up three quarts of milk and put it in the fridge to chill.  I am not fond of drinking powdered milk, but chilled with a few drops of vanilla added to each quart, it is palatable.  And I will have milk to cook with or bake with.By tomorrow evening I will be out of bread.  So tomorrow morning I will bake a couple of loaves, some hamburger buns and a pan of cinnamon rolls.  (And yes, Duane, you can fill up a plate of rolls to take home with you!) I have all the ingredients stocked.  I will cheat and use my bread machine, but should the ice storm headed our way knock out the electricity, I have the knowledge to bake bread the old fashioned way, stirring and kneading by hand.  I wonder how many of the younger generation have bothered to learn this skill.  Or of my generation, for that matter.Suppose for one storm related reason or another, I can not use my kitchen stove or oven.  I have a propane camp stove that will work to heat all sorts of food.  And most importantly, heat water for coffee!!  My shelves are filled with jars of home canned meats, potatoes, vegetables, fruits and soups.  And some pickles and relishes and jam for variety.  Even if I can't cook, the food is fully cooked from the canning process and can be eaten straight from the jar, if necessary.This is NOT a post to say that I am better than you because I prep and you don't.  Not at all.  It is merely a reminder that life can be easier and more safe if a person plans ahead.  I learned from my parents who learned from their parents.  My grandparents had no weather forecasts other than the signs of nature.  They couldn't just run to the corner store because the corner store was miles away and required first hitching a team of horses to a wagon and later, travelling in a Model T type of car over roads that were bumpy and rutted in the best of weather and impassable in the worst.  So they stored supplies.  They canned vegetables from their garden.  They butchered their meat and salted it down or cured it or canned it.  And they saw to it that their family of nine children was fed no matter the weather.Grandma and Grandpa weren't preppers, especially those with all the gear and bug-out bags and the like.  They were ordinary people who knew how to survive.  We could do well to learn from them."},

How does one get to places across the oceans.  Even ships need fuel.  And I won't even get into the discussion about farting cows.  What is really scary is that most of the Dems who are in the running for President are buying into it. The lunatics are running the asylum.  I'm just too old to go protest anything.  Phone calls, emails, letters and petitions are a waste of time.  Unless it involves power or more money in their bank accounts, they just don't care.  The only thing I can do is try to vote them out of office.  And gripe.  Here.  To you all.  Which is 'preaching to the choir!'And keep prepping."},

I watch him fight to regain what he lost.  He can walk without tipping over now.  But his right hand is still completely numb.  He can't tell if the dishwater is hot unless he tests it with his left hand.  His hand still has the strength it did before, but he can't hold onto anything with it because he can't feel anything with it.  He worries about being able to work again.  I learned up close and personal that life can change in a heartbeat.The second wake-up call was learning that it is now legal to kill a full term baby as long as it has not yet been born.  I knew that evil had gained ground in our country, but I did not realize to what extent until now.   And to see the smiling women cheering as this horrific piece of legislation was signed into law was sickening.  If one state can legislate the killing of babies, what is next?I have always preached preparedness.  But I have become lazy.  I have used my medical issues as an excuse to put off doing the things I know I should be doing in order to be as prepared as possible for whatever comes next.  And if you think everything is just dandy, read the headlines.  As I write, our new governor is working to promote more gun control laws in my state.  We have our very own Sanctuary County that includes the City of Minneapolis.  Old friends tell me that the small town where I grew up is totally unrecognizable due to the influx of 'refugees' who find it entertaining to harass the locals in what was once a lovely downtown shopping area.  The list goes on and on.So it is time to stop making excuses and get busy.There are 18 cases of empty canning jars that need to filled.  This morning I dug through the freezers and found several pounds of bacon that need to be canned.  I have put off doing this because I have difficulty standing for more than a few minutes at a time.  Not good enough.  I am changing the way I can bacon.   I used to dice the bacon and brown it before jarring it.  But if I sit at my kitchen table and pack the raw bacon into jars and can it that way, all I need to do is lightly brown it when I go to use it, requiring less standing time.I found several small bags of sliced bell peppers.  Those are now in the dehydrator.  I have found that when dried, the skins are really tough when rehydrated, so I am running them through my little coffee grinder and turning them into powder that can be added to dishes for flavor.   Same with dehydrated celery that wants to stay rock hard.  I can use the powder for flavor.  I have canned celery that works well in soup or casseroles and will can some more as I am nearly out of it.I don't know what the future holds.  I just know I am not as ready for it as I can be.  Right now I am at a place where I don't need to run to the grocery store to stock up before a major storm.  But that's not good enough.  Should something really bad happen and my grandbabies come knocking at my door saying, \"Grandma, we're hungry,\" and I couldn't take care of them, I would be hard pressed to forgive myself.Yep.  Time to stop fussing about my limitations and concentrate on doing what I can."},
{"title": "I Want to Know", "date": "Sunday, January 27, 2019", "text": "I want to know why in New York it is alright to murder a baby up to one day away from its birth.  In many states, if a pregnant woman is murdered, the killer is charged with two counts of murder - one for the mother and one for the unborn child.  But yet it is now legal to end the life of the unborn for any reason or no reason at all.  And for the love of God, why are women in particular, cheering the right to kill their offspring.I want to know why a red cap with the words 'Make America Great Again' on it is considered in many circles to be the equivalent of a white hood.  Why is this cap such a threat to the left.  I thought every American wished for our beloved country to be great.  Now it seems to be a reason for the media to work itself into a frenzy over a school boy whose only sin was attending a religious school, having light skin, standing his ground and wearing a red cap. I want to know why my sons should apologize for being men.  As far as I know, neither are 'toxic.'  Both have a work ethic second to none.  They take care of themselves without the help of our nanny government.  They protect and defend family, whether it is their own wife and children or whether it is their mother and siblings.  They both have strong religious convictions and believe in the power of prayer.  Their sin is being male and white.  How having faith, showing respect for elders and peers and protecting their own equals 'toxic masculinity' is beyond me.I want to know why protecting our borders is 'immoral.'  I want someone to explain to me why 'our betters' feel it is quite alright for them to live behind the protection of gated communities and walls, but it is wrong for my home to have the same protection on our borders.  And while we are at it, why is it a good idea to protect illegal alien criminals in sanctuary cities and states.  Might as well hang a big sign over your front door - \"Come on in.  Steal everything I worked hard to obtain.  Rape my daughter.  Shoot my son.  You will be set free to do it all again.\"I'm done.  Thoughts?"},

M., to the hour of seven (7) P. M., from the removal of the ice in the spring until such time as autumn or winter ice renders crossing dangerous.  Provided, always, that such ferrying shall not be demanded of the public as a right when by reason of high winds, floating ice, or other impediments of nature, crossing would be dangerous to the ferry or public safety.SEC. 3.  The said William Matheny, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, shall have the right to land their boats on the land of any person or persons in the county of Le Sueur, or in the county of Nicollet within the three mile range hereby granted in this act, provided the permission of the owner be first obtained.SEC. 4.  The said William Matheny, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns shall, within three months after the passage of this act, file or cause to be filed with the auditor of said Le Sueur county a bond of satisfactory to such auditor with two or more sureties, in the penal sum of five hundred dollars (500.00) conditioned for the faithful performance of all the conditions of this act, and which said bond shall be for the benefit of any and all persons sustaining any damage by the neglect of the said William Matheny, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns to perform duties enjoined by this act, and in case of failure so to do, the rights, benefits, and privileges granted by this act shall at once determine.SEC. 5.  That for each and every neglect to keep good and sufficient boats, or failure to give due and prompt attendance to all persons wishing to cross said ferry, the aforesaid parties shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten dollars ($10) to be recovered by and for the use of the county of Le Sueur, in a civil action before any justice of the peace, or court having competent jurisdiction, and shall further be liable for all damages that may be sustained by any person by reason of neglect of any of the parties acting under the privileges of this act.SEC. 6.  The rates to be collected at said ferry shall not exceed the following:  Each foot passenger five (5) cents;  each horse or mule and rider fifteen (15) cents;  each team of two (2) horses, whether loaded or not, twenty (20) cents;  each single carriage, drawn by one (1) horse or other animal, fifteen (15) cents;  each head of cattle, horses or mules five (5) cents;  each swine or sheep two (2) cents.  Provided, That the parties desiring to cross said ferry at unusual hours shall pay double prices.SEC. 7  If any person or persons, other than the said William Matheny, attempt to cross for passengers, teams, stock or freight within the three mile limit granted by this act, he or they shall forfeit and pay to him, the said William Matheny, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns the sum of twenty dollars ($20), to be recovered in any action before a justice of the peace or court of competent jurisdiction.SEC. 8  All acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this act are hereby repealed.SEC. 9  This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.Approved March 11, 1878.\"I thought this was awfully wordy for permission to run a ferry, but I guess that's how the government does things - even at the state level.  It amazes me what information is floating around on the Internet.Note to my kids - Now you know how your Great-great-great Grandfather spent his time in 1878."},

The wind is predicted to blow tonight and tomorrow up to 45 mph.I would really like to know where Mr. Official was last week when the guys were replacing the windows in the apartment next door. Your Government at it's finest.I don't know why I am surprised!"},

Eddy.Another pioneer of Kandiyohi County has entered into his reward.At the farm home in the Town of Whitefield, on Wednesday, September 20th, occurred the death of P. P. Eddy, at the age of eighty-three years and ten months.Death come as a welcome relief to the worn-out body. The past year Mr. Eddy had been confined to his room most of the time and much The late P. P. Eddy of the time to his bed. The long, lonely hours were passed with his Bible, his books and papers. His interest in the news of the day was as keen as ever. But his greatest comfort was his Bible.Funeral services were conducted by Rev. D. B. Spencer at the farm on Saturday at 10:30 o'clock and at the home of Thos. Scotton at 1:30 p. m. The Presbyterian choir touchingly sang \"Lead Kindly Light\" and \"No Sorrow There.\" The five sons of Mr. Eddy and Mr. Scotton bore the remains to their last resting place beside his wife who passed away four years ago.Pascal P. Eddy was born in Dudley, Massachusetts, on November 22, 1830. He was one of a family of nine children. His boyhood days were spent on a farm. In early youth he went into a woolen mill and learned the trade. On August 18,1852, he married Caroline M. Jewett.Soon after they moved to Norwich, Connecticut, and later to Ypsilanti, Michigan. In 1867 he came to Minneapolis to take charge of the woolen mill there, and they resided in Minneapolis until 1880 when they moved to the farm in Whitefield. The story of the thirty-one years spent on this farm is similar to that of many of the early pioneers tale of hardships, privations, loneliness and of toil unceasing. These labors have not been without material returns, for with his sons he has built up a splendid business. The Eddy farm is a synonym in these parts for a progressive dairy farm. Eight children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Eddy, six of whom are now living — W. Frank of Duluth, George H. of Minneapolis, H. B., C. T. and L. J. on the farm, and Mrs. Thomas Scotton of Willmar. There are eleven grandchildren, and one brother, William P. Eddy, of Brooklyn, New York, is still living.—\"This last picture is of your Great-Great Grandmother, Caroline Matilda Jewett Eddy.  She is the source of the family tradition of using the middle name, Jewett, that was passed on to your Great-Grandfather, Grandfather, Father and brother.Here is her obituary.\"Willmar Tribune., November 20, 1907, Page 1MRS.

Eddy in the town of Whitefield on Friday, Nov. 15, and took away the wife and mother, Mrs. Caroline M. Eddy, a well known and highly respected resident of Kandiyohi county. Her death took place at five o'clock in the afternoon and was undoubtedly caused by general debility resulting from old age.MRS. CAROLINE M. EDDY.Mrs. Caroline M. (Jewett) Eddy was born at Dudley, Mass., March 27, 1833. She grew to womanhood in that place and on Aug. 18, 1852, she was married to Pascal P. Eddy.The following year they left Dudley for Norwich, Conn., where they lived for two years. In 1856 they moved to Ypsilanti, Mich., where they staid two years and in 1858moved to Minneapolis, this state.They were residents of the flour city during the pioneer days and in 1880 they came to Kandiyohi county, settling in the western part of Whitefield, which was at that timevery sparsely settled. Here they have lived ever since, honored members of the community.Mrs. Eddy leaves, besides her sorrowing husband, six children - W. Frank, the oldest, of Duluth Henry B. and Charles T.. at home George H., at Minneapolis Mrs. Thomas Scotton, of Willmar and Louis J., the youngest, at home.She also leaves nine grandchildren. Two sisters are living in Massachusetts. Mr. Eddy, the bereaved husband, is an uncle of Ex. Congressman F. M. Eddy.Deceased was a very lovable woman and of that sturdy uprightcharacter which distinguished the pioneers of our country. It is needless to say that she is mourned by a large circle of friends, in her community, in Willmar, Minneapolis and elsewhere.The funeral took place last Monday, Rev. Buell officiating. Short services were held at the home in Whitefield. The Presbyterian choir from this city rendered songs. The remains were brought to Willmar, where services again were held at the home of Thomas Scotton at 721 Sixth St., Rev. Buell making a very impressive sermon on the occasion. The floral gifts of friends were many and beautiful. Mrs. Eddy's earthly remains were laid to rest in Fairview cemetery and were carried by her five sons and her son-in-law. Long will her memory live in the hearts of those who knew her.\"Son, I probably could of gotten by just letting you know who was in the photo you sent me, but I got a little bit carried away.  You come from ancestors who were strong and brave in settling the land, who had excellent work ethics and who were good, God-fearing people.  You and your siblings have a rich heritage to be proud of.  See to it that your children know where they came from.  It is important.Love, Mom"},
{"title": "Back Home For Janet and Jeanine", "date": "Saturday, December 29, 2018", "text": "Two of Duane's aunts from his Dad's side of the family are coming to visit him on Sunday and will stop in here as well.  Duane's Dad's family lived on the same Minnesota farm since 1880, and in the middle of the 1950's, my Dad bought a small piece of it.  We had a big, old farmhouse on 20 acres.  We always referred to that place as 'The Farm,' even though it was only 9 acres of yard, garden and woods and 11 acres of field, which my Dad rented out to Duane's Grandpa every year in exchange for beef from the cattle he raised.Duane's aunts visited him in the hospital and they got to talking about the old house my family lived in.  I found a few pictures on my computer that reference that place, so I decided to do a quick blog post.  It is easier to blog the photos than it is to email them.This is the house Dad bought from a member of my kid's aunt's family.  It is the only picture I have of the house.The house was huge.  In the front were the living room and dining room.  To the back of the house were the kitchen and a bedroom.  The bathroom and four bedrooms were upstairs.  I loved that old house even in the winter when it was drafty.  I often would sleep on the big screened porch in the summer.These are my parents standing in front of the house.I don't know the name of the bushes behind them, but they are the kind that are filled with tiny white flowers in the spring, typical of those planted in front of many farmhouses of that era.Along the eastern edge of the yard was a long row of peonies.I wish I had a color photo of them, for they were beautiful in full bloom with colors ranging from white to deep red.  Beyond them was a narrow farm road going through the woods and dividing the property, coming out on the field to the north.  Janet and Jeanine, if this picture extended further to the right, you would see your Mother's garden.  I remember seeing her out there, planting, weeding, harvesting.Our garden was in front of the house, between the front yard and the road.  I think this is where I learned to love gardening, working there with my Dad.  There was a huge pine tree where the driveway split, going left to my house and right to your house.   This picture in front of it was the first day of school for my sister and me at the two room rural school called Sunnyside.  Had to be about 1955.  I was in the fifth grade and my sister, first grade.  If you look close you can see a white building in the background.  That was your Dad's garage. When my family moved into the house, the kitchen left a lot to be desired.  This was the kitchen sink area.  My uncle Ronnie and his Dad, Lawrence, came in and remodeled the kitchen.  This next picture is of me at age 15, feeding my baby brother, but if you look closely, you can see that same corner of the kitchen after the remodel.This last picture is of my parents in front of the big bay windows on the east side of the house.  I have no idea why they are so sober looking, for as I am sure you remember, they smiled more than they frowned.There was a shelf built in below the windows that you can't see because the couch sits in front of it.  Mother always had that shelf full of African Violets in pots. Janet and Jeanine - I hope you have enjoyed this little stroll down memory lane as much as I have."},

{"title": "What Else...", "date": "Monday, October 22, 2018", "text": "do I store besides food and water.  That question was asked of me by one of my commenters.  I have been thinking about it over the weekend and have come up with a list.Before I get into that, I want to mention that there are countless websites full of opinions on what to store for an SHTF situation.  I have seen videos where people have entire rooms dedicated to preps and have everything under the sun stored 'just in case.'  Some store extras to use for barter.  Others order ready-to-eat meals or #10 cans of freeze dried food.Me...I live in a three room apartment and use all three rooms.  My storage space is minimal at best, so I have to pare the lists down to the absolute necessities.  That being said...I have a propane camp stove and a propane space heater should the gas to my building be shut off.  I have no place to store larger propane tanks, so I buy the small ones, pack them into boxes and keep them in the closet farthest from my exit door, which is also the coolest room.Those with a medical condition need supplies.  I stock 4x4 sterile pads to cover wounds, antibiotic cream and ace bandages.  That is the minimum to properly care for my legs.I don't buy first aid kits.  I have found that often when a kit is advertised as being say, 100 pieces, 80 of those are bandaids.  So instead I buy a variety of bandaids, a cream for burns, peroxide and alcohol wipes for cleansing an area needing treatment in addition to the above mentioned supplies..  I also have rolls of gauze.  I don't buy the tape sold with the medical supplies, for I have found it useless.  Masking tape or even duct tape works better.I keep Vicks, Vaseline, lip balm, hand lotion, cough drops and vitamins on hand.  Also a diarrhea treatment and Pepto Bismol.  My Dad always swore by 7-Up or Ginger Ale for upset stomach, so I use those as well.I keep extra dish soap and sponges along with Borax, washing soda and Fells Naphtha soap for making my own laundry soap.  Also bleach and bar soap.I have been negligent in taking care of lighting needs should the power be out for an extended time, but my list of 'need to buy' includes at least three oil lamps and fuel (kerosene is too flammable to risk storing in my apartment - thus the oil) candles, flashlights and batteries.  I am also wondering if those solar lights that people use in their yards might work.  Wooden kitchen matches are a must for lighting stoves, lamps and candles.I have a wicker picnic basket full of sewing supplies.  If a person has a hobby, now would be the time to collect materials.  I have lots of yarn and fabric.  And books.  I have a Kindle, but it would be pretty difficult to charge it without electricity unless I had a solar charger.  A selection of board games, playing cards, paper, colored pencils and markers are going into a box for a worst case scenario time if the grid goes down.  If I didn't have anything to occupy my time and mind, I would be a raving lunatic in no time at all.And a selection of hard candies.  I know that sounds silly, but if things get bad for a long time, a Tootsie Roll Pop or a butterscotch disc might be the very thing to make us feel better.  A little treat never hurt anyone and it might just keep the kids from doing damage to one another.I'm sure there are many more items one could stock up on, but that is about all I can cram into my small living space and still be able to get from one room to another without having to crawl over stuff.  :)What items do you consider necessary to store?"},

{"title": "The Case For Storing Water", "date": "Saturday, October 6, 2018", "text": "It doesn't need to be a catastrophic event to find we need to have water included in our food storage plans.Duane stopped in about midnight Friday night.  He said the lady living in the apartment beneath his had knocked on his door to find out if he was having problems with water overflowing in his apartment.  It seems she was having water pouring into hers through her ceiling.  Finding no source of the water problem, they concluded that a pipe may have burst between the two floors.  Duane went down to the basement and shut off the main water valve.  (That's one of the advantages of living in the same building for a number of years.  You know where the shut-off valve is.)  They called our landlord and left a message about the water problem.  Duane then let me know what was going on.For some in my building, having the water shut off will be a major problem.  I asked Duane if he needed water for the morning before he went to work.  He said he was good.  He keeps cases of drinking water in his apartment.Storing water in my small apartment is a challenge.  I have no place to store those big water barrels that many use.  What I do have is space behind my sofa that contains several dozen 2 liter soda bottles and gallon juice bottles filled with water.  I have 6 cases (24 per case) of bottled drinking water on a shelf in one of my shelving units.  Used sparingly, that amount of water will last both Duane and me at least a week or more.  Including the absolute necessity of morning coffee.  :)In looking around my apartment I found that with a little bit of rearranging, I have room for 4 more cases of bottled water.  If I spend the money to buy several of those square, stackable water jugs I have seen advertised, I could store still more water under my bed or in an out of the way corner of my apartment.Water is more important to have on hand than is food.  They say we can go a couple of weeks without food but only about 3 days without water.  I'm sure there are others like me to whom water intake is vital.  I take a pill each day to help get rid of the fluid build-up in my body.  Which means I need to drink plenty of water to avoid becoming dehydrated.    Which is a really silly Catch-22 situation, but there it is.We are not in an emergency situation by any means, but it has caused me to rethink my water storage and think of ways to improve it."},

So yesterday, Wednesday, I called my daughter to find out how the surgery went.  Daughter said I must have lost a day somewhere, for the surgery was the next day.  I thanked her for giving me back my lost day and hung up the phone with the sound of her laughter ringing in my ear.About suppertime yesterday Duane showed up with a club sandwich and fries from the little restaurant in our neighborhood.  He knew I had been feeling a bit off all day so he brought my evening meal so I didn't need to cook.  Bless him!Anyway, while he was here I asked him if he had noticed any changes in my memory capabilities lately.  I told him about calling his sister a day early for surgery results.  And I said there was one other thing that made me wonder, but I couldn't remember what it was.  He just laughed and said as far as he could tell, I still had all my marbles.Later in the evening I messaged him on FB...\"The other thing was yesterday I couldn't remember how to work my apple peeler.  Peeled all those apples by hand.  Remembered how it worked this morning.  Plink - plink - plink-  the sound of marbles hitting the floor.\"His response was a cartoon picture of some sort of little animal, rolling on the ground, laughing hysterically.Deep, exaggerated Sigh along with a grin.  :)"},
{"title": "Silly Phone Call Day", "date": "Tuesday, September 18, 2018", "text": "So the first phone call today was from my caseworker for the county government nursing and housecleaning services I use.  He thought it would be a nifty idea if his office collected the fee I pay to have my groceries delivered, and they would then add that to my monthly bill.  It took some time and lots of patience to convince him that my grocery delivery service was a volunteer service for Seniors and has nothing to do with his government department.The second call later in the day was from the very same caseworker.  He was concerned that I was paying for the supplies used in the care and treatment of my legs, out of pocket.  He offered to call Medicare for me and find out if they covered those supplies.  I understand he might just be trying to be helpful, but it still took some time and lots of patience to make him understand that I had already done that when I first found out that I was responsible for the supplies and found they weren't covered.He then suggested that I get prescriptions for the supplies so that my prescription insurance would pay for them.  It took some time and lots of patience to convince him that I had already checked into that possibility and found it was just as cheap and less of a hassle for me to order supplies from Amazon than it was to go through a prescription.   I can order in bulk and Amazon delivers to my door.Sometimes I think that some government workers have the mistaken notion that their clients do not have more than a couple of functioning brain cells.  I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on them as they are likely used to folks who work harder at getting free stuff than they would at a regular job.  To run across someone who takes care of her own stuff is a shock to the system.The last call was from Kevin at Windows who was terribly concerned about the state of my computer.  Being out of time and patience, I informed Kevin that he was a fool if he thought I was going to fall for that old scam.I wonder just how many fellows named Kevin there are in India."},

{"title": "Full Speed Ahead", "date": "Thursday, September 13, 2018", "text": "Which is sort of a joke as speed isn't exactly working too well for me these days.  However, I am in full food prep mode and moving along, even if it is at the rate of a turtle's progress.  :)After putting away my groceries I shredded two heads of cabbage.  They are in zip lock bags in the fridge and tomorrow morning they will go in the dehydrator.  The rest of the veggies will be shredded in the morning and will go in the other dehydrator.  I am drying them separately because some dry faster than others.  When everything is dry they will be mixed together and packaged for storage.It rarely happens, but this time there was a mix-up in my order.  I ordered frozen hashbrowns and got Simply Potatoes.  Frozen hashbrowns have already been blanched and can go directly into the dehydrator.  I'm not so sure about the Simply Potatoes, so I sent them back.  I will just re-order in two weeks.The 4 lbs. of frozen green beans are resting comfortably in the freezer until I am finished with the fresh veggies.Over the weekend, 15 lbs. of hamburger will be browned, packed into pint jars and canned.  I decided to can the hamburger plain.  As much as I like having taco meat canned and ready to use straight from the jar, upon reflection it makes more sense to me to can the burger without seasonings so it can be used in a variety of ways. This past week I learned a lesson that falls into the category of 'what not to do.'  Do not leave bags of apple slices in the freezer for 5 years and expect them to be good.  After slow cooking them all day I wound up with much of them being the consistency of soft leather.  The apples were just in the freezer way too long and this was the result of freezer burn.  I expect they would have been fine being frozen for a year, but 5 years was just too long.  There were 3 bags of peach slices that were frozen about the same time, with pretty much the same results as the apples. I took time to make a pan of Rice Krispy bars.  Makes me think of my childhood where they were considered a special treat.  Still are.  I messaged Oldest Son telling him there was a possibility that there would be Rice Krispy bars at my house.  He messaged back that I would see him as soon as he got home from work.Bribe them with food.  Works every time.  :)"},

There have been some over the years who, in my opinion, had less than stellar performances.  There hasn't been even one with whom I was in complete agreement.But the office of the leader of the free world deserves our respect, as does our Anthem and our Flag.  And if we fail to do so or if we, by our silence, condone this slap in the face to our President and the symbols of patriotism and love of our country by those who are citizens of the same and who enjoy more freedoms than any other nation on earth,  then we are as good as finished."},
{"title": "I Have Plans", "date": "Saturday, September 8, 2018", "text": "Today was a good day.  I canned 29 half pint jars of peas and with what is already on the shelf, I should have enough to last at least one year.  I seem to use peas a lot.  I put them in tuna-macaroni salads and eat them as a vegetable with a meal.  My favorite is creamed peas on toast for a  quick meal.  My mother would make creamed peas or asparagus on toast every once in a while and I still like it.  Reminds me of home.I didn't have as much butter in the freezer as I thought, so I decided to build up my supply before canning.  I only have 6 lbs., so will wait until I have 15 or 20.  Butter here is spendy, so I only order 4 lbs. at a time in my grocery order.  I can wait.Now that the weather has cooled down some I am back in 'fill the shelves'  mode.  I looked to see what I needed before filling out my grocery order for Monday.  Here's the plan:4 bags of hashbrowns to dehydrate4 lbs. of frozen green beans to dehydrate12 lbs. of hamburger - with the three lbs. in the freezer I will have 15 lbs.fresh vegetables:  cabbage, carrots, celery, green peppers and onions.It takes about one lb. of hamburger to fill a pint jar.  I also ordered taco seasoning.  I think I will make taco filling and can it.  I tried that once before and it was a success.  I just this past week used my last jar of taco meat and I love tacos, so that seems like a good use for the hamburger.  I will can at least two more cases of plain hamburger later. The fresh vegetables will be shredded, mixed together and dehydrated.  A couple handfuls of the dried vegetable mix adds flavor to soups or casseroles.My groceries aren't delivered until Thursday.  In the meantime there are several bags of apple slices in the freezer.  I am not a tall person.  I can not reach the bottom of my chest freezer without practically standing on my head.  Oldest Son has taken pity on me and said he will come over after work on Sunday and drag the apples out of the bottom of the freezer for me.  They will go into my big roaster to cook down for applesauce.So that's the plan.  Now, I realize that often when we plan, God laughs.  And I believe that when God finished creating this wonderful world we live in, he said, \"OK, Murphy.  You're in charge.\" So we shall see how the plan works out.  :)"},

Paul is seeing in Alaska, we would be complaining about that, too.  :)I did manage last week to get some ham and bean soup canned.  I did a cannerful of quarts, being seven of them.  One jar didn't seal so I had lunches of bean soup for a couple of days.  Two jars broke in the canner.  I'm not sure why.  Sometimes jars just break.  Sometimes a scratch in the glass can turn into a break under pressure.  And sometimes jars will break if the canner is heated too quickly.  I'm thinking the latter operator error might have been the cause.  At any rate, I put four more quarts of ready-to-eat food on the shelf, so it wasn't a total loss.Today is not a high energy day.  Even when I am indoors the humidity seems to bother my breathing some.  The nebulizer helps more than I ever thought it would.  My youngest son gave it to me so I didn't have to go buy one.  He had it for one of his kids when they were younger.  It is shaped like a penguin.  It makes me smile.  Takes about 20 minutes to use up the medicine that helps open my airway.  I keep my Kindle alongside my penguin and indulge in a bit of reading while I wait for the process to complete.  Right now I am in the middle of a mystery that has not one, but two murders to solve.  I just love a good who-done-it.  :)So today I am just puttering around, doing little chores that require little energy output.  Fall is nearly upon us, so it is time to make a batch of hot chocolate mix.  I dearly love a cup of cocoa in the cool of an evening.  Usually I use that universal recipe calling for Nestle's Quick, but this time I am using the following recipe that tastes like the cocoa Mother used to make with milk, cocoa powder and sugar, heated on the stove. HOT COCOA MIX5 cups nonfat dry powdered milk3 cups powdered sugar (more or less according to your taste)1 1/2 cups dry cocoa1 cup nondairy coffee creamerpinch of saltMix powdered milk, creamer, and salt into a large mixing bowl.

Stir until cool enough to drink.You might want to try some of these variations. The recipe is very flexible.* crushed peppermint sticks* cinnamon* malted milk powderI found this recipe at 'katz kradle' YouTube channel.  It has been several months since she posted anything, but she has a wealth of information on preparedness, recipes, etc.Looks like there may be a thunderstorm or two headed my way.   The weather reporters always make it sound like the storm of the century is headed directly for us.  I will be happy if we get a little rain.  We need it."},
{"title": "Answer to a Comment", "date": "Wednesday, August 22, 2018", "text": "Someone asked me a question in the comment section of my last post.  For a couple of reasons I declined giving an answer.  Later I found this person has commented before, very nicely, as a matter of fact.  So upon reflection, I decided to answer here.I was asked my opinion on the growing Muslim population in my state.First let me say that I am all for legal immigration.  I understandwhy people from all over the world want to come here.  I have ancestors who came from France, Germany, England, Scotland. Some came as far back as 1635.  Others before and during World War I, fleeing war torn Europe.  All of them followed the laws of the day and became citizens and earned their keep.I have zero tolerance or patience for those who think it is OK to jump the border and immediately collect benefits, paid for with my taxes and the taxes of my family.  Every one of my children and the older of my grands hold down jobs, pay their own rent, buy their own food and pay for their medical care, whether it be insurance or out of pocket.  It would not cross their minds to expect a handout.I am also totally against open borders.  The reasons should be clear after the news stories of crimes committed by illegals including the Iowa college student who has been missing for a month and whose body was found yesterday, murdered by a man who has lived in the area for several years - illegally.  One has to wonder just how many terrorists have entered our borders illegally.As far as the Muslim population goes, I understand that there are some who are peaceful and just want to live out their lives.  Sadly, we only hear of the ones who would like to eliminate all who do not believe as they do.  We hear of the ones who want nothing better than to turn America into a Muslim nation.  They make no secret of wanting the nation to be governed by Shariah Law.  And many have no intention of assimilating into our culture.Here in Minnesota, the Somali Muslims have been welcomed with open arms by Left leaning groups.  Some have been convicted for having ties to terrorist groups.  Others have amused themselves by chasing locals from parks and lakeside beaches and by going into affluent neighborhoods to harass residents.  Many have stayed in the Minneapolis area, settling in a neighborhood now known as 'Little Mogadishu.'  The effect on the area depends on who you talk to.  Those on the Left will tout the diversity of the area, waxing rapturously about the community.  Those on the Right will point out that non-Muslims take a great risk in entering there.  I find it interesting that many crimes in that area of Minneapolis that I hear about listening to the police scanner never make the local news.Other immigrants have been dispersed throughout the state, many to smaller farming towns and communities.  As I no longer travel, I can not speak from experience.  But I can relate what has been told me from friends who live in those communities.  Some say that places like the public swimming pools or recreational facilities are no longer safe for local kids.  Other female friends tell me that they cannot walk in the downtown areas of their hometown without being harassed or threatened.Considering that some of the most horrific terrorist acts here and overseas have been carried out in the name of Allah, it seems to me that political correctness needs to go into the trash bin where it belongs and truth should be told.  We are so afraid of offending anyone that we ignore the obvious.The thing is, those in power here in Minnesota don't give a rodent's behind if I am offended.  And I am offended by people who demonstrate by shouting 'Death to America.'  I am offended by those who wish to change the culture in my state.  I am offended by those who don't want to obey our laws but want their own form of law to be the law of the land.  And I am offended by those who insist their religious laws concerning food and prayer be adhered to, here in the land of Lutherans and Catholics, who practice their religions without fanfare and without insisting others do as they do.  And I am particularly offended by those who consider a woman without a head scarf to be fair game.To the person who posed the question, I am sorry I didn't recognize you.  I hope this post adequately answers it."},

{"title": "Sibling Love", "date": "Thursday, August 9, 2018", "text": "Recently I connected with a cousin of mine.  She has lived for many years on the other side of the country from me, and I don't think we have ever met in person.  That doesn't matter.  We are family.My father and her grandmother were brother and sister.  I have a story or two about them I want to share with my cousin.  Messaging isn't adequate - hence this post for her and for anyone else who might find it interesting.My Dad and his sister Clarice had a love for one another that one doesn't often see these days.  I have no doubt that each would have moved Heaven and Earth for the other.Clarice was born in 1908, the seventh child in a family of nine children.  Dad was born in 1911, being number nine.  Dad often told his siblings that their parents saved the best for last.  :)The earliest photo of my Dad was taken in front of the first log cabin my Grandfather built in northern Minnesota.  He is in the arms of his sister, Clarice.Clarice was in charge of watching over her baby brother.And yes, Dad is wearing a dress.  At that time it was common practice for little boys to wear dresses until they were old enough to manage the fly buttons on their long pants.I was lucky enough to be born into a loving family.  I knew that I would be welcomed with open arms, hugs and kisses no matter which aunt or uncle I went to visit.  But a visit with Aunt Clarice was just special.  She had a sweetness about her that was beyond compare.  That being said, she could give as good as she got.  Those two liked to tease one another.  It was never mean.  Dad might remark that Clarice was getting a bit broad in the beam and she would tell him he wouldn't be so chunky if only he wasn't so darned short.When both were in their 90's they were in the same nursing home in the small town near where they grew up.  The two of them would be side by side in their wheelchairs, doing their upper body exercises led by one of the staff.  After a while Dad's arm would reach over and lightly cuff his sister on the back of her head.  More exercise - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4.  And Clarice would double up her fist and punch Dad on his arm.  After a couple more swats between them, the aide would say, \"Now you two Matheny kids behave yourselves.\"   And they would - for maybe 5 minutes.Sadly, Clarice had a form of memory loss that didn't allow her to retain the spoken word for more than a minute or so.  I witnessed the following conversation between them.Clarice:  \"How is Mom doing\"Dad:  \"Mom died in 1955.\"Clarice:  \"Who is living on the home place\"Dad:  'Nobody.  The house burned down.\"That conversation was repeated again and again.  Dad showed no sign of impatience with her.  I later asked Dad if it drove him a bit crazy to answer those same questions over and over.  His reply was, \"Why should it?  She is still my sister and I still love her.\"Dad died in 2004.  At his funeral I was holding it together pretty well right up to the time Clarice was wheeled up to Dad's coffin to say her last goodbye.  In a moment of complete clarity she said, \"Oh, Ralph.\"   Her hand reached out and gently caressed his face.Clarice followed her brother to Heaven shortly thereafter.  I like to think they are together, laughing and teasing and hugging as they did all of their lives."},

{"title": "The Great Biscuit Caper", "date": "Friday, July 27, 2018", "text": "So I am doing this biscuit experiment - freezing already baked biscuits to be reheated and freezing biscuits that have not yet been baked.  Yesterday I heated and baked to see which method I liked best.I heated two previously baked biscuits in the microwave.  I set it on 'defrost' for  a couple of minutes and then on 'high' for 30 seconds.  They came out tasting like they had been microwaved and were  a bit tough.  It was my least favorite method.The next two biscuits I popped into a 350 degree toaster oven for about three minutes.  They were heated through and tasted like a biscuit should.I cranked up the toaster oven to 400 degrees and pre-heated the regular oven to the same temp.  Two of the raw biscuits, still frozen, went into each.  They baked for about 15 minutes.  Times will vary with different ovens.  All four biscuits didn't raise as much as biscuits baked fresh, but they all tasted good. I like the idea of having ready to bake biscuits in the freezer, but I think I will go with freezing baked biscuits.  For me, living alone, one batch of biscuits is good for about three meals.  If I just freeze the leftovers whenever I make biscuits, it won't take too long until I have I nice stash of them frozen, ready to heat in my toaster oven or regular oven whenever I want biscuits but don't want to mess around stirring them up from scratch.And thus endeth the great biscuit caper.  :)"},

{"title": "Canning Bacon Success", "date": "Monday, July 23, 2018", "text": "Patrice over at \"Rural Revolution\" has a post about canning bacon that shows the process way better than I am able.  You can see it HERE.  Go take a look.  I will wait.There are a couple of small differences in what she did and the way I did it.  I had parchment paper on hand so I used that to wrap the bacon.  I  cut the bacon slices in half and used pint jars instead of quarts.  I used the regular thin sliced bacon and it looks like she used thick slices. The thinner slices of bacon got a wee bit mushy in the pressure canner, but by using a spatula it was possible to remove the meat from the paper.  I like to cook bacon on a cookie sheet in a 400 degree oven, and the canned bacon browned up nicely that way.  Still, I will use the thicker slices next time.I will still can more in pint jars for smaller servings for one or two, but I think I would also like to have quart jars of bacon on the shelves, just because.  I can always freeze leftover strips of cooked bacon.My youngest son stopped by while I was canning, and he wanted to know why I didn't just freeze the bacon instead of going to the trouble of canning it.  I told him that I do keep a pound or two in the freezer.  But a couple of years ago a tornado went through a part of Minneapolis.  Some of those people, the ones whose homes weren't damaged, were without electricity for nearly two weeks.  If that kind of thing happened to us he would be cooking meat from his freezer like mad, trying to save as much as possible after it thawed.  Me...I don't need to worry.  Most of mine is in jars.Even with the thinner slices of bacon, I am really pleased with the results.  I know that I can buy canned bacon and many who aren't into home canning do, but the cost is way above my pay grade.  So I will can more myself because, after all, one can never have too much bacon.  :)"},
{"title": "Worrisome Update and Food Experiments", "date": "Thursday, July 19, 2018", "text": "My cleaning lady didn't show up this morning, so I had to call to report that she missed two weeks.  I am paying for the cleaning service and the home health care through a county program.  Even though the rates I pay are heavily discounted, I still don't want to pay for no service.  I have no idea what happened with her and I really hate to see her go.  She did a wonderful job.  Wherever she is, I wish her well.  Those in charge of the program will find me a new cleaning person.  If the new cleaner is half as thorough as the other, I will be happy.On another note, I saw some videos about canning bacon.  I already can bacon bits, but the videos were about canning bacon slices.  So in the interest of adding to my home canned goods stash, I ordered four pounds of bacon which should give me 8 pints.  I will give this a try over the weekend and let you know how it works. I have another food experiment going.  I made up two batches of baking powder biscuits.  One batch I cut and baked the normal way, put them in a freezer bag when cool and popped them into the freezer.  The idea was that when I want a biscuit or two I can grab a couple and heat them up for a meal.  The second batch I rolled out, cut the dough into biscuits, put them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and froze them for about an hour.  Then I took the frozen raw biscuits and put them in a freezer bag and back into the freezer they went.  The theory is that I can take out as many as I want and bake them.    I will test both methods to see which one I like best.  It is sort of fun to test new ideas to see if they really work."},

{"title": "Low Energy Week", "date": "Thursday, July 12, 2018", "text": "It is hot again and promises to continue the rest of the week.  Therefore, I am doing things that expend the least amount of energy possible.  It is too hot and humid to work with yarn.  Can't even scrape up enough energy to sew.  I have been neglecting my genealogy research, so this seems like a good time to put in some serious computer time where my only exercise is fingers on keyboard.I love reading other folks blogs about their searches for ancestors.  Most times they give me new ideas about where to look online.  Sometimes their family stories are inspiring or courageous or amusing.  I am surprised at how many will go to great lengths to try to prove royalty or celebrity in their family lines.Me...I like the black sheep.  The ones that other researchers in my family have glorified, ignoring  their sins.  Like one of my great grandfathers.  He served in the Civil War and was wounded in battle.  I will give him credit for that.  But nobody else mentioned the fact that he was court-martialed for being drunk on guard duty. He remained in the army as it was wartime and every man was needed to fight, but he forfeited most of his pay for three months. I once asked my Dad about him and Dad's reply was that his grandpa 'sure did love his booze.'  He was the reason my grandmother, his daughter, made my grandfather sign a paper stating that Grandpa would stay away from liquor.  Grandma wouldn't marry Grandpa until he signed on the dotted line.Another ancestor has been praised by other researchers as the hero who was the first of that family line to reach the shores of America - the New World.  And that much is true.  However, while combing through old court records I found that this ancestor was a real bugger.  He harassed his neighbors to the point of being involved in several lawsuits.  He was put into stocks in the village square for leaving his wife alone long enough for her to become pregnant with another man's child.  Eventually the local citizenry had had enough of him and he and his wife were banished from the town.Now here's the rub.  This boy child born to the wife is the ancestor from whom my family line descends.  If all of this is true and even though he carries the family surname, he may not be blood related.  So I am off to see what I can find out concerning this dilemma.I love a good mystery, especially when it is within my own family.  :)"},

But I suppose by today's standards I should be condemned for exposing my young children to the evils of racism.Finding this attitude of burning history on the alter of political correctness, I dove a little deeper into the subject.I was not at all surprised to find the political correct among us throwing hissy fits over the Uncle Remus stories, published in 1881.   Had they done their research, they would have found that the author held in high regard those black story tellers from whom he gathered the stories.  The dialect he used when writing them had nothing to do with mocking that kind of speech and had everything to do with preserving the integrity of the stories.Some of my fondest childhood memories are of my Dad reading to me from the big book of Uncle Remus Stories.  The antics of Br'er Fox, Br'er Rabbit and Br'er Bear were a delight to a little girl and the lessons taught remain with me.  But all that should be erased from our history, according to those who can find racism in a jelly sandwich.Moving on to 'Little Black Sambo,' the PC people lose their minds.  How dare any author write about a character named Little Black Sambo.  Those who know best about these things, scream 'racism' at the top of their lungs.  So much so that some publishers have changed the setting of the story to other countries where dark skinned people are not prevalent.The PC police may have done better to leave this children's book alone, for in it, Little Black Sambo is the hero, outsmarting the bad tigers who stole the fine clothes Sambo's mother had made for him.  He not only got his beautiful clothes back, he got the tigers to chase each other around and around so fast they turned into butter, which his mother used to make pancakes. This was another children's book read to me long ago.  Kids love the story, and through the telling learn that bullies are bad, even if they are tigers, the boy in the story is smarter than the bad guys and there are consequences for bad behavior. The PC police can't stand to leave these stories alone because, as we all have been told ad nauseam, most everything today is racist, racist, racist.Sigh."},

{"title": "Freezer Meals Experiment and a Surprise", "date": "Thursday, May 10, 2018", "text": "Sometimes we need to find new ways of doing day to day chores.  Cooking is one of those things that has become a challenge.  You have heard me whine about not being able to stand for more than a few minutes at a time, and you have also heard me whine about being tethered to an oxygen machine (hereafter referred to as R2D2 of Star Wars fame).  So I need to find a way to prepare my meals that doesn't involve standing by the stove while constantly stirring and doesn't involve oxygen near an open flame.One of the ideas I have decided to try is putting together simple meals that can be frozen and later thawed and cooked in a crock pot.  Most of the prep work can be done while sitting at my kitchen table and cooking the meals should be easy with the crock pot.I ordered some of the ingredients that came with my grocery delivery today and much of the rest I already have in my pantry.  By the first part of next week I will do a post to let you know what I did and how it worked.On another note, I had a really nice surprise today.  I have been thinking about buying one of these.Lo and behold, that very one arrived at my door.  Duane said he hoped it would arrive closer to the day, but Happy early Mother's Day!I have several large stainless steel stock pots.  They work really well for some things, but many times if the contents aren't stirred constantly or at least often, they will burn on the bottom of the pot.  Food in the roaster still needs stirring, but that can be done while sitting if the roaster is on my kitchen table and I won't need to worry about the oxygen going 'poof'.  I'm going to give it a test run later next week, making a pot of ham and beans.  I think I can get lots of ham and beans in a 22 quart roaster.  Thank you, son.I'm off to get my recipes together and my spices out for the freezer meal experiment starting in the morning.  See you all next week."},

{"title": "She's Back", "date": "Thursday, May 3, 2018", "text": "After spending way too much time wallowing about in a puddle of self pity, it is time to get back to the land of the living.  True, this round of medical stuff kind of reached out and slapped me upside the head.  And I still am struggling to get it all together, but that is no reason to just check out.  It is what it is.  It isn't going away.  I still don't like it, but I need to learn to live with it.  So onward and upward.There have been changes.  Some time back Duane and I had talked about moving one of my shelving units and my freezer to his apartment, replacing the freezer space with another shelving unit to hold the canning overflow and most of my smaller kitchen appliances.  After thinking about it we decided to leave things the way they were and he ordered shelving from Amazon, to be delivered, since the box the unit came in would not fit in his car.  Since my chest freezer is still in my kitchen, I decided to make up some freezer meals that can either be microwaved or cooked in my crock pot.  Last evening I went through my recipes, writing those I wish to use in a notebook.  This way I can cook for a day or two and have suppers for a month.  Between the freezer meals and my home canned food, meal preparation should be easier for me.Yesterday was  a beautiful spring day.  The sun was shining and the air was at about 70 degrees.  Barb, my cleaning lady, showed up yesterday at her usual mid-afternoon time.  Within a few minutes she came to me to tell me we didn't have any running water.  Sure enough.   Just air coming from the taps.  Now I have water stored in bottles, but I didn't think it was right to expect her to heat water for cleaning.  So I told her to go enjoy the day.  Like most janitorial services, she is paid for x number of hours per job.  If she finishes after the time limit, the extra time is on her dime.  But if she finishes before, she is paid for the number of hours.  She must have thanked me half a dozen times before going back out into the sunshine.  Made me smile.Last week, knowing that I was less than happy, Duane showed up one evening with surprises.  Included were two bags of deli pastrami, which I love, two large boxes of popsicles and two bags of Hershey's Kisses - one with (be still my heart) a caramel filling.  I have been known to call him and ask if he has anything chocolate in his apartment.  He said now I won't have to call because I have my very own chocolate.  :)Youngest son, David, showed up last week.  He had an app on his iPad he wanted to show me.  It isn't like a video, but more like an overview line drawing of a baseball field.  It shows, by name, where each player is on the field.  It shows every move each player makes.  It shows whether each pitch is a ball or strike or hit.  And it shows the actions of each player.  David is scorekeeper for his son Jacob's baseball games so this app is easier for him to use as opposed to keeping track watching the actual field.  And I can use it to see how my grandson does at each game.  He is a pitcher.  How cool is that.So that's what has been going on in my little corner of the world.  I just finished washing up a couple days worth of dirty dishes and am ready to start a load of laundry.  After that it will be recliner time with my Kindle.  Hope you are all well and enjoying a wonderful spring day."},

{"title": "Time Marches On", "date": "Tuesday, February 27, 2018", "text": "So I ran out of a couple colors of yarn for Zach's graduation afghan.  His mother, my daughter Jill, came to my rescue and picked up the needed yarn for me.  I should have messaged her the proper names of the colors, for one of them, while being very close to the color used, was just far enough off in hue that it would be noticeable.  She will bring me the proper yarn this week.  In the meantime, I have finished another 10 granny squares with the yarn she brought and only have another dozen or so waiting for the proper colors.  Then it will be ready to sew the squares together and add a border.  Jill assures me that Zach will like it.  I hope so.I have plenty of yarn for my own afghan and only need to crochet the last two rows on about 15 squares.  Then it will be ready to be sewn together and the border added to it.  It is so pretty.  I will post pictures of both afghans when they are finished.While Jill was here I talked with her about yarn for the graduation afghans for my three youngest grands.  She said she would be happy to pick out the colors and bring me the needed yarn.  She said that my granddaughters seem to like her taste in colors so I am just leaving that selection up to her.  As long as I am on a roll here with crochet hook and yarn, I think I would like to get the rest finished.  After all, I am not getting any younger and I want to be sure that all the grands get their granny made afghans.I don't keep regular hours like I did when in the working world.  I sleep when I am tired and am up doing things when I am not.  I slept for about three hours after supper last evening and as a result was awake all night.  Probably a good thing it worked out that way, for the City crews were removing snow from the last snowfall a couple of days ago and the noise from the equipment they use likely would have kept me awake.  The streets had been plowed, but there were rows of snow piled up along the curbs and in the alleys.I watched the activity in the street in front of my building for a while.  It was sort of like watching a precision drill team.  The huge front end loader with a plow blade on it scraped the snow from the sidewalk and curb out into the street.  A smaller loader cleaned the snow from the alley.  A small bobcat came behind the other two and cleaned up what they had missed.  All of the snow was piled in a row in the middle of the street.  After that came the dump trucks which were loaded with snow and off they went to dump it wherever they dump snow - usually on a vacant lot.  Other places I have lived in warmer climates have had the theory that God put the snow there, let Him worry about it.  But here in Minnesota, we have precision drill teams of loaders and trucks to take care of the vast amount of snow we usually get in the winter.  It was kind of fun to watch.Duane brought me breakfast of some orange rolls the other morning.  That was a treat.  He was here yesterday, helping me put some jars of baking soda on a top shelf in my kitchen, when he found a container of raisins I had forgotten I had.  So perhaps a batch of oatmeal raisin cookies is in my near future.  That was Duane's suggestion anyway.  He knows I share.  :)Not much else going on here in my little corner of the world.  Hope all is well in yours."},
{"title": "Work Ethic", "date": "Thursday, February 22, 2018", "text": "Dad had a work ethic second to none.  He learned this from his parents who were both hard workers whose priority was the family.He grew up on a farm in northern Minnesota.  It is not easy to make a living on a farm in northern Minnesota.  He was the youngest of nine children.  Everyone worked.  Some worked on the farm and some got outside jobs to help the family.  Dad told me about plowing the fields behind a team of horses and about pitchforking hay into the loft of the barn to feed the few cows they kept for milk and cream and butter.In the winter his Dad and brothers would take a wagon hitched to the horse team out on a nearby lake.  There they would cut large blocks of ice, load them on the wagon and take them home where they were put into the root cellar, packed in straw.  If done right, the ice would last until the next winter.  They didn't have a refrigerator, but used an ice box to keep food cool in their kitchen.  The blocks of ice were put in the lower compartment of the ice box for this purpose.During the Depression, Dad went to work for the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps), a government work program for young men.  Most of their wages were sent to their families.  Dad liked to show us a park on a local lake that had been one of the jobs he worked on then.After Dad married and when I was about 4 years old, Dad lost his job at a local gas station.  He and Mother decided to go to St. Paul and stay with her mother for a time, thinking that job opportunities might be better.  He found a job working at a manufacturing plant that made refrigerators.  Shortly after, he saw an ad in the newspaper for an opening for a 'grain sampler' in Willmar, Minnesota.  He had no clue what a grain sampler did, but he applied for and got the job.  He spent the rest of his working life climbing in and out of boxcars at the railroad yard at Willmar, carrying a six foot brass probe, taking samples of the corn, wheat and oats in the boxcars.As Mother's disease progressed, the Dr. and hospital bills increased.  His solution was to find more jobs.  Welfare was never an option with Dad.  I remember times when he cleaned the church where we went for services.  He cleaned office buildings at night after working all day.  He found a weekend job feeding turkeys in huge turkey barns.  He likely had other jobs I didn't know about.  He never talked about the extra work, nor did he ever complain.When Dad retired at age 65, he moved with Mother and my brother back to his hometown of Blackduck, Minnesota, finding a small house nearby.  Not content to just sit and do nothing, and I am sure needing money for medical bills, he landed a job with the local bank.  This was before computers, and the bank needed someone to take paperwork and/or cash to Bemidji, 25 miles away, and bring back whatever the Bemidji bank had for the Blackduck bank.  He made two runs every weekday - one in the morning and another in the afternoon.  He also took a disabled boy to school in Bemidji each morning and brought him home in the afternoon.  He spent most of his free time with Mother at the nursing home. Dad instilled in me the importance of working hard.  There was a time when I lived on a farm.  Dad came to see me and found me whining about being dirty and sweaty from mucking out a small shed.  He told me there was no shame in being dirty from working.  The shame came when a person was dirty from laziness.  He just couldn't abide lazy.He also told me once that if you were going to do a job, do the best job you could do.  If that job was digging a ditch, then make it the best ditch you could dig.  And do it not for your employer, but for the satisfaction of knowing you did your best.Seems to me we could use more with that kind of work ethic and fewer with their hand out expecting it to be filled with free stuff."},
{"title": "The Seamstress", "date": "Tuesday, February 20, 2018", "text": "Mother was a seamstress of exceptional talent.  There was nothing she couldn't sew.She sewed my clothes until my last year of high school.  I'm pretty sure that after I left home, she made most of my sister's clothes as well.I'm not sure where she learned this art, for I don't remember her Mother doing any sewing.  Grandmother may have sewn in earlier years, for most housewives did at that time.  Sewing was just part of what homemakers did then.  But when I first knew Grandma, her husband had died and she was working at a publishing house in St. Paul to support herself and those of her children still living at home.  She may not have had time to sew.I would have been happy to spend my life dressed pretty much like this.My little sister and me.But Mother would have none of it.  She wanted pretty, dainty, feminine looking and acting girls.  I am afraid I was something of a disappointment to her, with my preference for blue jeans and flannel shirts.Mother saw to it that my sister and I usually had new dresses to wear to Easter church services and to the annual Sunday School Christmas program.  I liked dressing up at Easter, but would have cheerfully skipped the Christmas program, for I had a fear of speaking in front of a crowd.  Still do.  The only thing that made me go through with it was knowing when it was all over, each child received a small brown paper bag full of my favorite Christmas candies.Easter dresses.Christmas dresses.Mother sewed our school dresses.  At that time there was a dress code in Junior High and High School whereby girls had to wear skirts/dresses.  Jeans and slacks were not allowed.  These were the dresses Mother made for my sister and me when I started 4th grade.When Mother's youngest sister married, Mother sewed her wedding dress.  Emily was married in the front room of her Mother's home.  I remember how Mother fussed over making that dress, getting it just right.  Emily was a beautiful bride the day she married my favorite uncle. Mother had way more patience than I ever had.  She exhibited that patience when teaching me to sew.  My 4-H project was sewing and it required us to make a dress or a skirt and blouse all by ourselves, with no help from parents.  Mother had me practice by making several blouses and skirts that were play clothes before beginning the 4-H project, which was a light brown blouse and a full, flowered skirt to match.  Each year there was a county wide 'Dress Review\" that was a judging of the quality of work and a modeling of the clothes we had made.  Mine won me a trip to the State Fair and I have to give the credit to my Mother, who had the patience to keep at it.  It could not have been an easy job for her.Money was sometimes tight and Mother had to get creative when the price of fabric exceeded the cash on hand.  When I was very young, Mother took apart an old coat of hers to make a winter coat and bonnet for me.  Another year she found that one of the stores was selling flour in the old timey printed flour sacks.  She made sure that when Dad bought flour he got enough of the same printed sacks to make my matching skirts and blouses.  They were so pretty that nobody knew where the fabric had come from.I think that home sewing is another one of those skills that are going the way of the dinosaur.  I no longer sew clothing, mostly because the cost of patterns and fabric has become prohibitive.  I can buy ready made for less.  But at least I have the skills to be able to make my own clothing should the need arise.  And that is a good thing."},
{"title": "I was going to stay out of this.", "date": "Monday, February 19, 2018", "text": "I really was.  I was going to let the gun control people - the ones who begin their rhetoric before the bodies have cooled - and the defenders of our right to bear arms, duke it out. But then I had a conversation with a lady who, in all other respects, is a nice, sensible, caring lady, but who is in favor of getting rid of all firearms.  She really believes that if we all turned in our guns the problem of mass shootings would be solved.I suppose I could have given her the standard arguments.  Could have cited statistics favoring firearm ownership.  Could have pointed out that the gun is nothing more than a tool and is not responsible for killing people.  The person holding the gun is the one at fault.  Could have said that gun confiscation leaves the honest citizen vulnerable to attack, while the criminal to whom the law has no meaning, will still obtain his firearms.  Could have mentioned that while I believe that the mentally disturbed should not possess guns, there are way too many who fall through the cracks.  They do not visit mental health facilities.  They may avoid the people who might 'see something, say something.'  Same goes for the millions of illegal aliens living here who stay under the radar - particularly the criminals and gang members.  None of those will appear on a database.  Could have said all that.But I didn't.  This lovely lady is not politically minded.  As long as she can continue her life in relative peace, she is happy.  All of the above would not mean very much to her.  So here is what I said...She is a single Mom, living in an apartment, working hard to make a living and raise a teen-aged son and daughter.  We talked about as parents, how our first responsibility is to keep our children as safe as possible.  We talked about how things have changed what with the influx of 'refugees' who hate light skinned people and consider it their duty to rid of our civilization of its laws and traditions to be replaced by theirs.I asked her what she would do if some of those people kicked down the door to her apartment and entered with mayhem on their minds.  How would she protect her beautiful daughter from being beaten to a pulp and gang rapped.  What would she do if they decided it would be fun to rape her son before slitting his throat.  She is smart enough to know that these things happen - here - everywhere - more often than any of us would care to admit.She came to the conclusion that the only way she could prevent those things happening to her children was to shoot the bastards as they came in the door.I have the utmost respect for law enforcement, but they have no way of getting there in time to help in a situation like that.  We are pretty much on our own.  It would take maybe three good, heavy kicks to my door to break in.  And once in, how am I going to stop them from hurting me or killing me.  Throw a jar of tomatoes at them?  Spray them with my choice of defense sprays?  That would maybe slow them down a little and is sure to mostly piss them off, which gets me beaten or killed.Which is why, should our betters - the ones who live in gated communities - the ones who are protected by men with guns - those betters - decide to try to rid us of our protection, I will never, ever comply.We will get back to our regularly scheduled program in a day or so.  But right now I am way too angry with those who think they know best how to keep me and my family safe."},
{"title": "Putting Up the Harvest", "date": "Saturday, February 17, 2018", "text": "When I was about 10 or 11 years old, my family moved from town to a 20 acre plot of land with a big, old farmhouse on it.  The selling point was not so much the house, which needed some work, but that it had a large yard and more importantly, a huge garden space.  As my Mother's arthritis continued to wreck her body, the medical bills continued to grow accordingly, and it became more important to garden as a way to feed our family without the outlay of so much cash.  In Minnesota, getting through the cold winters is a priority.As Mother became more ill, she could no longer do the canning as she had in the past, so as the oldest child it fell to me to help her.  About the time we moved to what we called 'the farm,' I learned how to can vegetables and fruit and how to properly freeze some of the garden's bounty.  At the time I complained bitterly about having to spend so much time working when I would rather have been playing, but in later years I was grateful to have learned those skills for they were used to keep my own family fed.We canned the standard vegetables along with dill and sweet pickles and several kinds of relish.  We froze the garden fruits of strawberries, raspberries and rhubarb.  In addition, Dad brought home cases of peaches, pears, apricots and cherries.  Some of these we canned in a sugar syrup to be used as a dessert sauce.  Some we froze to use in various recipes like peach cobbler, or to use over ice cream as a treat.  And some of the fruit from the store as well as from the garden went to make jams.The cellar had a large bin for potatoes, and another where we kept squash.  We canned half the carrots and stored the rest in a third bin, to be eaten raw.There was a small apple orchard just southwest of the house.  It was an old orchard and some of the trees no longer produced fruit, but there were enough apples in the fall to make lots of jars of applesauce.  And there was one crab apple tree that had the best tasting crab apples I have ever tasted.  We ate many of those fresh from the tree and we used many of the smaller ones to make crab apple pickles.When we had as many jars of canned fruit on the basement shelves as we needed, we started making pies, using peaches and apples.  We kept a stack of those foil pie tins and used them for the freezer pies.  We made the pies the same as we would if we were going to bake them, wrapped them in tin foil and stacked them in the freezer.  I don't know how many pies we made each fall, but I do know there were at least two stacks of each kind in the freezer when we were finished, just waiting to be baked for a dessert treat or for when company came for supper.We didn't can meat back then.  I don't know why, but I never heard of anyone doing so.  We bought chickens from a farm neighbor.  Dad had a small field on the property and the neighbor rented it to plant corn or soybeans and paid with beef he raised on his farm.  I think we got the better of that deal.Food preservation wasn't just a trendy thing to do as it seems to be now.  It was a way of life.  It was the means by which you fed your family.  I fear that these skills will be lost.  I do hope that enough people will learn them for a time when we may need them to survive."},
{"title": "Mother", "date": "Wednesday, February 14, 2018", "text": "My Mother was born in 1924 and died in 1996.  She was one of six sisters and one brother, who were raised in a small town in northern Minnesota.  Her father was a railroad depot agent and lay minister and her mother was a homemaker.Mother at age 16.Mother believed in honoring her parent's wishes, so when her Dad told her he did not wish her to marry until she was 21 years of age, she obliged and married my Dad one week following her 21st birthday.Mother at age 21Shortly after my birth in 1946, Mother was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.  The next 50 years were defined by pain.  Mother, Dad and me.Although arthritis was a huge part of her life, she was much more than the disease. Mother about age 21 in Blackduck, MN.Mother was musically talented.  She played piano, guitar, ukulele, violin and cello, lettering in high school for her orchestra performances.  She also had a beautiful alto singing voice and could harmonize with nearly any song.  My sister and I have decided that our singing abilities came from our Dad, who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket.Most of Mother's siblings had musical abilities and often accompanied their father to his church services, providing the music.My brother, being 15 years younger than me, tells me he never heard Mother play any of her instruments, for by the time he was born, her hands were becoming deformed and she could no longer make music.  My sister remembers hearing Mother play all, but I only remember hearing her on the piano, violin and cello.  The last time I heard her play the violin was at a 4-H meeting, where the parents took over the meeting and provided the entertainment.  Dad found a very small child's toy violin.  He stood in front of the room, telling jokes and clowning, playing the toy, while Mother stood out of sight, playing her violin.  I think the tune was \"Red Wing,\" one of Dad's cowboy favorites.  I consider myself lucky to have heard her play.Mother was an accomplished seamstress.  She sewed her own dresses as well as those for my sister and me.  We nearly always had new Easter and Christmas dresses and she sewed our school clothes until I was well into high school.Mother enjoyed needlework and often would embroider on those white flour sack dishtowels that were popular then.  She taught me to embroider on the dishtowels as well.  She also crocheted beautiful lace doilies using a very small crochet hook and thin crochet thread.  I never could get the hang of that, but enjoy using regular yarn instead.Mother loved decorating for the holidays.  I can remember when she took a branch from a bush and painted it white.  She had us blow the insides out of eggs, leaving just the hollow shells, which we painted in bright colors and Easter designs.  She then hung the eggs by threads from the branches, making an Easter Tree centerpiece for the dining room table.  She did the same for Valentines Day, using red and pink paper hearts.Mother was in her element at Christmas time.  She had evergreen boughs, Christmas ornaments and silver bells everywhere.  The Christmas tree, always a real tree, was a sight to behold.  And when she could no longer walk, she could be found sitting in her wheelchair in the middle of the living room, directing Dad as to where each decoration went.Mother and Dad at our house in the country about 1957.As her body deteriorated, I never heard her complain.  I saw her cry only once, when I had to leave her in the nursing home section of the local hospital.  The insurance required transfer from the hospital to the home in order to pay.  Dad didn't have the heart to do the deed, so as the oldest child, it fell to me.  She begged me to take her home, knowing full well that Dad could no longer care for her. Once Mother settled into a routine at the nursing home, she became calm and seemed to thrive.  The home is small and in her hometown, so she knew nearly everyone and the staff took very good care of her.  Dad spent much of his day with her and evenings would usually find them in a rousing game of Scrabble, which Mom usually won, with Dad saying she won because she cheated.  That became something of a family joke.Dad and Mother outside the nursing home in Blackduck where she lived out her remaining years.Through the years of pain and surgeries and hospital stays and nursing home living, Mother never once lost her faith.  One of the last things she did was to request her pastor to read the 23rd Psalm to her.  She died peacefully on a spring day at age 72.There are those who tend to refer to Mother as a Saint, and that seems to irritate me somehow.  She was a good woman, but not a Saint.  She had her faults just like the rest of us.  She just was able to handle what life threw at her better than most.  Whenever I find myself slipping into a pool of self-pity, I think of her and realize that my difficulties are minor compared with what she lived with most of her life.I still miss her."},
{"title": "Dad's Garden", "date": "Monday, February 12, 2018", "text": "My Dad loved a garden.  He once told me that he acquired his love of all things growing, from his Mother.  When his older siblings were busy with the daily chores of running a farm, the youngest children spent time in the garden with his Mother, where he learned about planting and growing and harvesting.  I think part of it was that he just enjoyed spending time with his Mother.When I was growing up, my family lived in a series of small, rental houses.  If a landlord permitted, Dad would dig up a small corner of the back lawn and plant tomatoes and potatoes, along with a few other vegetables.  In the mid 1950's when he was finally able to purchase a 20 acre hobby farm that had space for a large garden, Dad was in gardeners heaven.Dad, my little sister and me in Dad's garden.Dad poured over the seed catalogs, making lists of the vegetables he wanted to plant.  He planted all the standard vegetables - sweet corn, green and yellow beans, peas, carrots, beets, etc.  But then the fun began.  He would try something new every year.  Once he planted peanuts that were a dismal failure.  The plants came up, but the Minnesota growing season just wasn't long enough to produce the peanuts.  Another time he ordered blue seed potatoes.  These grew well and yielded a good crop of potatoes that really were blue in color.  Sadly, when cooked, they turned a disgusting gray color that nobody was interested in eating.The 'giant pumpkins' gave us some large jack-o-lanterns, but none grew as big as advertised.  His rousing success was popcorn.  The ears were small, and when the plants turned brown in the fall, Dad picked all the ears, spread them out on old window screens, held up by two sawhorses, on the front porch, and left them there to dry.  We shelled the cobs and excitedly tested the popcorn by popping a batch.  We were not disappointed.Dad added a small strawberry bed and a long row of raspberries.  Both did well, although we rarely had enough to use for jam or to freeze.  He didn't seem to mind, however, when he would catch us picking and eating the berries as fast as they would ripen.One of my fondest memories is of grabbing a salt shaker and heading to the tomato patch with Dad.  We would sit on the ground, surrounded by tomatoes and eat until we couldn't any more.During that time I joined the local 4-H club.  Each member had 'projects' for the year, usually ending with county fair exhibits.  Many of the kids raised cows or pigs or sheep to show at the fair, but because we weren't a regular farm and had not the means to care for animals, my main projects were sewing and gardening.  Those with a gardening project exhibited their best vegetables at the fair, and there was also a 'garden tour' held by the club to look at the various gardens in the neighborhood.  That meant that the garden had to be really spiffy with no weeds in sight.  After a year or two, I finally caught on and asked Dad if he encouraged me to garden for the love of raising food or if he just wanted free labor to keep the garden free of weeds.He just smiled!"},
{"title": "Sunday Memories", "date": "Friday, February 9, 2018", "text": "I have found that since retiring, it is easy to lose track of which day of the week it is.  There are no alarm clocks to set, no time cards to be punched.  The days just flow, one after another.  Early on I decided to designate Sundays as a day of rest, leaving the normal chores for the weekdays.I think I get this idea from Mother, who was rigidly religious.  She would have been happy if our family attended Sunday School, morning and evening church services.  She would have been even happier if we had spent the rest of the day reading our Bibles.  While these were good pursuits all, things just didn't work out for Mother.Dad was a good, Christian man.  His beliefs aligned themselves with Mothers, but with a healthy dose of fun thrown in for good measure.  We were spared the forced Bible study.  Often he planned a family activity for Sunday afternoons.  In the winter he would take us ice skating or sledding.  If the weather was too cold and blustery for outdoor activities, we might spend an afternoon reading one of  the many books he kept for us, or we might play board games like Monopoly.  Playing cards were forbidden - Mother thought them to be of the devil - so we played Old Maid or Authors or Uno. Summertime Sunday afternoons were for picnics, swimming at the lake or maybe a lazy afternoon of fishing.  We had a badminton set and a croquet set and sometimes he would set up one or the other of those games and we would have tournaments on the front lawn.  Sometimes we just piled into the family car and went for a drive.  We admired the crops in the fields, went for walks along the river or stopped to explore an abandoned rural schoolhouse.  Often these excursions ended with a treat of an ice cream cone.Mother's beliefs did not allow us to go to the movies.  I never did get her to explain why she felt this way.  I don't know how Dad managed it, but he took me to see 'Bambi' and 'Snow White' when I was very young.  Even though it was well over 65 years ago, I still remember watching Snow White running through the forest and finding the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs.  And I still can't watch 'Bambi' without crying when his mother is killed. I suppose Mother's beliefs may have come from her father, whom my Dad once described as \"stern but fair in his dealings.\"  I wish she had been able to enjoy life a bit more as did those on Dad's side of the family.  I'm sure that the fact that she spent many years in pain from rheumatoid arthritis did not help any.  I think Dad's sense of humor matched with Mother's rigid religious beliefs probably tempered both and made for a successful marriage.  I once asked my Dad how he could take care of Mother, day in and day out, in those later days when she could do nearly nothing for herself.  His answer was simple.  \"I love your Mother.\"And that's what it really is all about, isn't it."},

{"title": "Christmas Memories", "date": "Thursday, December 21, 2017", "text": "This time of year my mind tends to wander back through the years to visit Christmas Past.There was the time in about 1950 when my Dad lost his job in northern Minnesota.  The decision was made to stay with my maternal grandmother in St. Paul, where Dad would likely have a better chance for employment.  Money was tight, but Dad found a way to make Christmas special.We walked a couple of blocks to Snelling Avenue where we caught a streetcar.  You young ones don't even know what a streetcar is, do you.  It is like a passenger car on a train only smaller.  It ran on tracks built into the city streets.We rode the streetcar to downtown St. Paul where all the big department stores were located.  This was before shopping malls.  Each store had big display windows and each store tried to have a better display than their competitors.  There were Santas and elves and reindeer and toys and most everything was animated so it moved.  There were Christmas lights everywhere and to a little girl it was a magical fairyland.Grandma's Christmas tree was a marvel, filled with lights and old glass ornaments she had collected over the years.  She even had some bubble lights.  Remember them?The best part were the little mesh bags that hung from the branches, filled with chocolate coins wrapped in gold foil.I take that back.  The best part was Grandma, who laughed and wouldn't let Mother scold me when I got caught playing in her flour bin.  Grandma, who had an ample lap just right for snuggling a small granddaughter.  Grandma, who lived until my 30th year and who I still miss, especially this time of year.As a young girl, my family always had a real tree for Christmas.  Except for the one year when Dad came home with what was the newest modern tree.  It was made of silver foil.  Looked like several rolls of tin foil had exploded.  Mother decorated it with pink glass ornaments.  We were hip.That tree gave a whole new meaning to the word 'ugly.'  I believe it went on the garage sale in the spring.When my own children were young, I had a real tree, cut down from the woods surrounding our home.  There were few real ornaments, but we made up for that with tinsel.I set out big bowls of popcorn and a bowl of cranberries, gave the kids darning needles and strong thread and set them to making garlands that we wound around the tree.  After Christmas we hung the garlands on the bushes outside for the birds.We filled in the tree decorations with candy canes and homemade gingerbread men.  I used those small, round, red cinnamon candies for the features and buttons down the fronts of the cookies.  I don't think my kids ever found out where I hid the candies until it was time to bake.  By the time Christmas Eve rolled around, the lower branches of the tree were naked, having been stripped of candy canes and gingerbread men.It is good to remember those times.  But it isn't about trees or decorations or presents.  It is about the birth of our Lord and about time spent with those we love.  I will be with my children and grands on Saturday evening.  Christmas Day Duane and I will share a ham dinner while the others celebrate with their own families or in-laws.  I am glad that my children have so many in their extended families with whom to share the joy of the season.I am taking a bit of a vacation from blogging until after the New Year.  I wish for all of you, my friends, that you are blessed not only now but throughout the year.Merry Christmas!!"},

{"title": "I Have Been Evaluated...", "date": "Wednesday, October 11, 2017", "text": "and it appears I qualify for the services I need. A cheerful little woman sat at my kitchen table, went over my paperwork, asked me some questions, put my information into her computer and announced that I could get the home health care for my legs and I could get someone in to do the heavy cleaning chores.  Works for me.This service is through my County.  They required one family member to be present.  I suppose they deal  with elderly folks whose memories are shaky at best or some who are sadly living with some form of dementia.  My youngest son, David, acted as the designated relative.  Basically he just listened.  Except when the questions concerned my memory.  I allowed that it was still functioning, but occasionally I will go from the living room to the kitchen and forget why.  He piped up and said that he could ask me about an event fifty years ago and I could remember the details.  I guess that means I passed the memory test.  :)Anyway, it takes about three weeks to get everything set up.  I will be assigned a case worker who will schedule a nurse to check out my legs and who will train nurse's aids to take care of my legs.  The case worker will also arrange for the house cleaner. The lady who interviewed me said what I already knew, that Medicare does not pay for home health care unless it is needed following a hospital stay.  So there will be a fee for the two services that is figured according to income.  She told me the amount per month and it is a small amount that will not in any way wreck my budget.  That was a relief, as I feared I would not be able to afford this.  I can.I am of two minds about this whole new situation.  I hate that I need to ask for help.  And I am not thrilled about having strangers come into my home for any reason.  I am a private person who likes her solitude.  You, my readers, probably know more about me by now than do some of my family unless they read this blog.But on the other hand, I know that I absolutely have to keep my lower legs from becoming infected.  Cellulitis includes in some like me, open, draining wounds that may heal and may not.  There is no cure and if infection sets in, it means time in the hospital, which I want to avoid.  It also, if it gets too bad, can be life threatening.  My oldest son, Duane, has done a phenomenal job of helping me stay as healthy as possible by doing the application of gauze pads where needed and the Ace bandage wrapping of my legs two and sometimes three times a week for nearly two years.  He says he would continue, but I think he has already gone above and beyond.  All of my kids are helpful, but if I can get done what needs to be done without having to call on them, then I will not feel like I am a burden.  That is important to me.I am not overjoyed about becoming involved in a government program, even if it is at the County level.  But so far nobody has asked any questions that I would refuse to answer.  And I found out that there are many other services available to me should I want to use them.  Meals on Wheels was mentioned, but I thought it would be rather silly to request that one considering my deep prepper pantry!So I will give this program a go.  I will admit to being relieved at having some help with those things I can't seem to manage any more.  I am grateful to my kids for all their help and for setting up this solution to a problem.  Sometimes a person just has to swallow a little bit of pride and do the sensible thing.  Not something I am very good at doing.  :)"},

I would rather deal with the stairs than become so poor I look longingly at a can of dog food.  :)Otherwise, all is well.  It has been cool for this time of year.  I turned the heat on a couple of nights ago when I saw it was 51 degrees outside and 62 degrees inside.  I like cool weather, but that was a bit much for this granny.  I am not ready to dig out the long johns just yet!!"},
{"title": "Minnesota Students Get It", "date": "Wednesday, September 6, 2017", "text": "The following was posted on Facebook and on the Internet news page for the local television station.\"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Some students at ROCORI High School are taking issue with the school’s policy that would prevent them from displaying flags in the parking lot.The policy was revealed to students this week as they returned to class for the new school year.According to the text of the parking permit application, “students are not allowed to display flags or banners from their vehicles while parked in the ROCORI school parking lot.”Furthermore, the school says that “any violations of these procedures can and may be given a ticket or towed away at the expense of the owner.”On Wednesday, a number of pickup trucks at the school arrived with American flags prominently displayed.Community organizers have also set up a 2:30 p.m. “Support Our Students And Our Country” rally at ROCORI in support of the students displaying those flags. As of noon, about 30 people had responded to the Facebook event page.\"We have allowed any mention of God to be taken out of schools.  School administrators have been known to send kids home for wearing a t-shirt with the American Flag on it, saying the picture of our flag might offend immigrant students.  A couple of years ago a kid here in Minnesota had been hunting the day before and forgot to take his shotgun out of his vehicle when he parked it in the school parking lot, which was against the rules.  He did the right thing by telling those in charge what had happened and asked permission to drive back home to remove the weapon.  School administrators called the police instead.Political correctness is at an all time level of stupidity.  Under no circumstances should our flag be banned  From anywhere.  Period.What really got to me were the comments on FB from adults condemning the kids for breaking the rules.  I suppose I should have expected it since I live in the middle of dimmocrat land.But I will say this.  If my kid chose to break such an idiotic rule and fly the American Flag on his truck, I would stand behind him 100%.  Those students have more courage than the rest of the population who just follow along like lambs to the slaughter.Good on you, Ricori students.  You make me proud."},
{"title": "Of Sharing Memories", "date": "Tuesday, September 5, 2017", "text": "Since my sister was here and since we talked of family memories, I have shifted gears and am spending more time on organizing the mountain of family history I have accumulated over the years.  I had let it go by the wayside while working on my food storage and on my sewing endeavors.  But I need to get back to preparing our family history to share with others in my family.  None of my offspring or their offspring are showing signs of taking up where I leave off, but I need to remember that I was well into my 60's before 'genealogy bug' bit me.When I got to the point where I needed a genealogy computer program to keep track of my findings, I tried out several.  Some were too complicated.  Others seemed like there was more interest in cool graphics than in entering information.  Still others required the family information be sent on to their websites to be used for whatever purposes they wished.  And still others stole information that I later found listed elsewhere.I finally found a program that is free and easy to use and has no restrictions.  It is 'Personal Ancestral File' from the Mormon website, 'FamilySearch.org.'  In checking the Mormon website before writing this post I found, sadly, that they have discontinued that program and now offer online solutions.  Lucky for me, I have saved my original download and when I have entered all I wish to enter, I can put the program and the information on a DVD and send it to any relatives who wish to view what I have entered.When I first started this journey into researching my family, I found many websites where folks had uploaded their family tree information.  I thought I had hit the motherlode of genealogical information until I discovered errors in the family relationships.  Not only that, but specific errors were found in many different family trees.  People were just copying someone else's work and claiming it as their own.  I knew the work was wrong because I had personally known some of the people who were listed in error as to parental relationship or spousal relationships.  Birth and death dates were often wrong.  As were the names of places where the families had lived.So I started doing my own research.  Many state historical societies have websites that can be searched for birth, marriage and death information.  Other websites have searchable Social Security information of the deceased.  Another called 'Find A Grave' is searchable to find the burial locations of ancestors.  I have found it reliable and useful. Now I just enter into my program those that I know or knew personally and those for whom I have found to have proof of their existence.  This way I know that the information I leave behind is true and accurate.This research thing may seem as dry as dust to those who have no interest in family history, but I find it fascinating.  I found details of one ancestor who, upon his arrival to North America spent a couple of years living in a cave.  When he finally obtained a small farm, he was such a disagreeable neighbor that he was literally run out of town.  Another has documented statements of his bravery during the Revolutionary War.  And another was fined 6 months pay for being drunk on guard duty during the Civil War.  It would seem that I have more rogues than heroes.Not everyone needs to go to the lengths I have in finding my roots, but I think my grands need to know something of their history.  They need to know that their great-grandfather on one side of the family carried on his family tradition of farming the land that had been in the family for generations, both milking cows and raising beef cattle.  And another great-grandfather (my Dad) spent most of his adult life caring for his invalid wife, sometimes working three jobs in order to do it.  Both of those men had a work ethic second to none.  This is part my grand's heritage.  They need to know."},

The wheels are turning.  Oldest daughter is checking out home care options to deal with my physical limitations.  And looking into light housekeeping services.  Youngest son is in charge of finding a suitable place for me to live.  He has suggested that perhaps I might enjoy living close to his family (45 miles away from my present location) so that I could spent time with my three youngest grands.  That would be delightful.I am doing my part.  The canning and dehydrating, aside from the food still in my freezer, has been put on hold.  I am beginning to sort and toss - some for charity shop donations, some that my kids might find useful and some for the dumpster. All of this will take time, but there is no great rush.I write about many things here on this silly little blog.  Sometimes I debate with myself whether or not I should post about my difficulties or less than upbeat topics.  But what it boils down to is that this is life.  And life is not always unicorns and sunshine.  There are storm clouds now and then.  So I write about them, too.What really amazes me is that there are folks out there who stop by and visit and leave comments who are caring enough to offer suggestions when I find myself in a place that is less than ideal.  Many times those suggestions have helped me deal with one thing or another.  I want you all to know just how much I value the friendship of each and every one of you, for even though we have never met, I still consider you as friends.  Thank you for continuing to stop by, even when the unicorns are not here.  I am truly humbled."},

The next projects are a stack of quart freezer bags full of pumpkin puree to be dehydrated and a layer of quart bags full of sliced apples to be turned into applesauce.  Those are going to wait a few days until the latest arthritis flareup subsides.  Until then, it is quiet time for this chubby granny.I can hardly wait to see what treasures lay underneath the apples.  :)"},

{"title": "Responsibility", "date": "Monday, July 17, 2017", "text": "There are several YouTube channels I like to watch on a regular basis.  Some are about artsy craftsy stuff.  Others are about quilting.  And some fall into the category of homesteading.  They include everything from gardening to raising small livestock to food preservation to frugal living and a self-sustaining lifestyle.One of my favorites is called 'Deep South Homestead'  and is done by a couple living in southern Mississippi.  I have learned much from watching their videos.  At present they are doing a series about financial freedom.  Unlike many videos with similar topics, they do not give tips on money management, but rather show how experiences from childhood and beyond can influence the way an adult manages their finances to be debt free.As I watched their video this morning, it got me to thinking about how the way I was raised was similar in many ways to the things they spoke of and how different things were then from the way they are today.As a child, the rule was that nobody played until the work was done.  That meant that at suppertime, the table was properly set and the family sat down together for the meal.  After supper the dishes were cleared, washed, dried and put away.  Only then were we free to relax and pursue whatever was of interest to us.I was 15 years old before our family had a television.  Before that, we listened to the serial programs on the radio like Dragnet or Abbot and Costello or Amos 'n Andy.  Sometimes we could get musical shows, mostly country or western, my Dad's favorites.  Whether it was radio or television, mother believed it was a sin to just sit and watch or listen, so I always was doing something at those times.  Maybe it was knitting a scarf or hemming a skirt or embroidering a dish towel, but my hands were never idle.  I have continued along those lines to this day.If a person kept animals of any kind, their needs came first.  No matter if it was raining or if there was a blizzard raging, the animals had to be fed, watered and their living areas had to be kept clean.  Only when these tasks were accomplished could a person even think about their own needs.Gardens were more than just a hobby.  The produce grown was essential to keeping the family fed over the winter months and until the garden of the following year began producing.  Early mornings would find us weeding.  That was also the time of day when vegetables were picked, cleaned and made ready for either freezing or canning.  When the vegetables were in the freezer or in jars cooling on the counter, then and only then were we free to do what we wanted to do.Saturday mornings were not for watching cartoons, but were for cleaning the house 'just in case we get company.'  Wooden and tile floors were scrubbed, rugs were vacuumed, bed linens were changed, furniture was dusted and bathrooms were made to sparkle.  After that there were cakes or cookies to bake to make sure there were treats to go with coffee should any neighbor or relative drop by.Another thing we were taught that I find sadly lacking today were manners.  It didn't matter whether or not we liked an adult, they were treated with respect.  'Yes, Ma'am' and 'No, Sir' was the correct way to respond.  We never, ever called an adult by their first names.  It was always Miss, Mrs. or Mr.  I suppose it might have been easier then because we were clear about gender rolls.  The only time first names were acceptable were when addressing Aunt Emily or Uncle Oscar.I think the whole thing boils down to being taught responsibility.  Making sure the garden was well kept insured that we would eat over the winter.  Working before playing instilled in us a work ethic that would last a lifetime.  And good manners combined with respect for others is what separated us from the savages.  All of these things, even those learned as children, went a long way to attaining responsibility in all areas, including financial."},

I can't do anything about any of the above.  People are going to be mean and hateful no matter what I say.  And so far, I have found no way to fix Stupid.  I can't just stop checking the news reports because I think it is important to keep an eye on what is going on in the world.  That is part of the preparedness thing.But I can spend far less time on the headlines and much more time doing what makes me and mine happy.  Sounds like a plan to me.Kicking that well used soapbox back into the corner now."},

{"title": "Never Too Old To Learn", "date": "Monday, July 10, 2017", "text": "So two or three months ago I bought half a dozen one pound bags of Great Northern beans.  Thought about taking them out of the original packaging, but got busy and just tossed them into an empty box in my pantry closet.  Well, that's not quite true.  There may have been some laziness involved. My grocery order this week included five bags of the dry beans.  I brought the box of beans from my pantry out to the kitchen table with the intent of repackaging part of them and using some of the older ones to can up as pork and beans.To my horror I found the original six bags crawling with little black bugs.  And so was the box they were in.  I double wrapped the whole shebang in trash bags, sealing the tops with tape.  Now they can live in the dumpster and not in my pantry.So I learned that dry beans should be removed from the original plastic bags to be repackaged, the same as I do with anything I want to store that comes in cardboard packaging.  I know that bugs like to hide in cardboard.  I didn't know they also like plastic bags full of dry beans.I opened the five bags I just bought, sorted them to remove any bad beans, put them into freezer bags and stacked them in the freezer where they will stay for a few days, just to make sure nothing is crawling around in them.We are never too old to learn.  I am glad all that lesson cost me was a few bags of beans."},

Adapting to current limitations has been a challenge.  I know that I can not stand or walk for more than 10 minutes at a time before the arthritic pain becomes overwhelming.  So I have learned to do the chores either in ten minute increments or do what I can while seated at my kitchen table.  Youngest Son and his family gave me a walker for Mother's Day so I can now leave my apartment and enjoy the outdoors.  Admitting to myself that I needed a walker was tough.  I have learned that if I do too much one day, I will spend the next day quietly recovering.  Sometimes it is worth it - sometimes not.I believe the most important thing about dealing with limitations is attitude.  I suppose I could sit around in a puddle of self pity, but I won't.  I haven't the time nor do I have the patience for it.  I think that concentrating on what I can do rather than what I can't makes all the difference. The point of this post is not to dwell on my physical problems, but to encourage anyone out there who is facing life-changing obstacles.  If just one person who reads this is able to realize that life, even with limitations, can be good, then this was worth posting.  Just do the best you can with what you have to work with.Oh yeah...keep your sense of humor.  Laughter is the very best medicine.  Really - it is."},

{"title": "Stretching a Meal", "date": "Saturday, June 24, 2017", "text": "When I was a kid, it was not unusual for friends or relatives to show up at our house on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  TV was a rare commodity then.  My family didn't have one until I was 15 years old.  Personal computers and cell phones were somewhere in the future.  People went visiting.  They sat on front porches and talked about the weather and the condition of the crops and wasn't that daughter of Aunt Ruby's acting just disgraceful with that boyfriend of hers.  And when the sun was getting low in the western sky and the visitors showed no signs of leaving, they were invited to stay for supper.  And most times, they accepted.My mother was one of those women who planned.  She knew that on Monday she would wash clothes and on Tuesday I would iron them.  She planned nothing for Saturday morning except setting her daughters to cleaning the house.  If you have ever experienced scrubbing out the corners of a set of stairs with a toothbrush, then you know the extent of my mother's planning.  And she knew exactly what each meal would be for a week.Mother didn't take it well when her plans were disrupted.  So it was always a wonder to me how she coped with guests for the supper she had planned for four people.  She took it in stride and never batted an eye.  Thinking back, I realized how she did it.If she had a roast beef or a chicken in the oven, she sent one of us kids down to the basement, which doubled as our cold storage area, to bring up more potatoes to be boiled and a handful of fresh carrots to be cleaned and cut into carrot sticks.  She had us get a quart jar of dill pickles and a pint jar of relish.  And added to that were a couple of jars of home canned peaches for dessert.  A plate of homemade baking powder biscuits rounded out the meal, now with enough food for company.I remember once having supper guests when Mother had made a pot of chili that was enough to feed just our family.  Mother calmly cooked up a pot of rice and made a double batch of cornbread.  She added a plate of sliced cheese and another of raw carrots, radishes and sliced cucumbers from the garden.  She filled bowls half full of rice and topped that off with chili.  Dessert was sliced strawberries from the garden, with cream and sugar .The point is.....Mother was prepared.  She was a girl growing up during the Great Depression.  After that came the WWII food rationing.  Her mother taught her how to stretch a meal.  Although my Grandfather was one of the fortunate ones to be employed during the Depression, he still had seven children to feed.  That was not always an easy task.  My grandparents grew a garden.  They canned as much food as they could.  My father grew up in a similar environment with the added benefit of living on a farm where they could have meat and milk animals to feed his family of nine children.  Both my parents carried on the tradition of preserving as much food as they could in the summer and fall.  They passed on that lifestyle to me.  One of the best things they taught me was how to stretch a meal.I don't always have fresh food on hand.  I can't raise a garden.  But I can go to my shelves and pantry and get the fixings for any number of meals.  And like Mother, I keep on hand ingredients to be able to stretch a meal when needed.  Just makes sense."},

I hadn't planned to do any canning over the weekend, but when the opportunity presents itself, it seems like a person should take advantage of it.  After all, that gives me another couple of weeks worth of suppers and the way things are going in the world around us, I think I will be glad to have it.  Things are just getting way too crazy to ignore.  We need to be prepared for anything."},

So that was the extent of my excitement here in my little corner of the world.  Quiet.  Peaceful.  No stress.  Just the way I like it."},

Now that the weather is warmer, I want to get out to the fabric store.  I need fabric for the backs of several quilts and batting.  So I was digging through the tubs that hold the quilt tops - both finished and partially finished - to see what I needed to finish them all.  And in the process I found two bags containing partially crocheted afghans.  I had started them to use up yarn left over from other projects, knowing I would need more yarn to finish them.  So I took some pictures to remind myself of the colors I need.  The fabric store carries yarn as well, so I will get some when I go to buy fabric.I love crocheted afghans.  My grandmother had a couple of them in this same 'granny square' pattern that I remember from my childhood as being soft and warm and comfy.  The pattern is easy to do and is something I can work on in the evenings while watching a movie.So as long as there is no canning going on today, I think I will finish my afternoon doing those piddly household chores that never seem to go away - mop the kitchen floor, vacuum, straighten up my pantry, etc.  And I may have to find a cage for that pesky squirrel that keeps diverting my attention.  :)"},

Duane and Lori were here this morning.  Duane wanted to borrow my large roaster pan for a beef roast he is cooking for supper.  He raided my shelves for a couple pints of baby carrots to go with the beef.  I am glad when my kids raid the shelves.  That's what all those jars of food are for.  And he will bring me a plate of food for my supper.  Pretty good trade, I'd say.  :)I was reading the website for one of our local news sources when I saw this headline:'An Undocumented Future:  Fear in The Immigrant Community.'Basically the article tells of those illegals who are worried about deportation now that we have a president who seems to believe that laws should be enforced.  I can't really blame many of these people, especially those who have families here.  They were told for eight years that there would be no consequences for breaking our immigration laws.  I suspect they counted on the coronation of Hillary to continue that practice.  Well, surprise, surprise.  Now many are heading for Canada to avoid deportation here.  What a mess Obama created by refusing to enforce those laws.  And how terribly wrong he was to mess with the lives of those who believed him.So I have goofed off long enough.  I am off to the kitchen to rid the freezer of a few more gallon bags of cranberries that, with any kind of luck, will be cranberry sauce and cranberry juice.  I am almost afraid to see what is lurking underneath all those berries.  :)"},

{"title": "A Lovely Weekend", "date": "Monday, May 15, 2017", "text": "As any Mom will tell you, any Mother's Day where you hear from all of your kids is a good day.My youngest daughter phoned to wish me a Happy Mother's Day.  She is home recovering from knee replacement surgery.  My stairs are not on her list of doable things at present, but I am glad that she is healing and the surgery seems to have been successful.  Her adult kids will spend time with her, as it should be.Oldest daughter Jill stopped in with a gift.  A little background information here.  I have cellulitis which causes my lower legs and feet to swell.  As a result, it is necessary for me to wear Ace bandages from knees to toes on both legs, 24 - 7 to try to keep the swelling down.  I can not wear regular shoes because of this.  I have a pair of those less than fashionable, Velcro adjustable boot-like things with hard soles to wear outside.  Inside I have been wearing those socks with the gripper soles over the bandages to keep them clean.  So when Jill showed up with a cute pair of house shoes that are made of a knitted, stretchy fabric with a gripper sole and will fit over the bandages, I was thrilled.  When you have probably the ugliest legs and feet in the State of Minnesota, being able to wear something on your feet that looks normal is a great boost to your morale.The ever practical Duane made a Farmer's Market run and brought me four bundles of asparagus.  I love asparagus.  I cut it into one inch lengths and this morning filled 16 half pint jars that are happily cooking away in my pressure canner.  There is enough left over for at least two meals.  Fresh asparagus is spendy, which is why I don't include it in my grocery order.  Now I will have enough canned so I can treat myself now and then.  I woke from an afternoon nap to find a Mother's Day card next to me from Duane and Lori.  Lori had called me earlier from Colorado where she is visiting relatives.  Made me feel good that she did that.David, Staci and my three youngest grands came over here on Saturday.  They brought lunch.  And they brought the dog, who puked three times on the way here due to the motion sickness she still has.  I asked David why they didn't wait until she could ride without getting sick and he said that they all wanted me to meet my new Grandpuppy.  Oreo is adorable and so well behaved for a pup.  She obviously adores the kids and they, her.  So I got to pet and love on a puppy again.  It was great!  If she ever grows into those long legs of hers, she will be a good-sized dog.David's family had another surprise for me.  Knowing I would have to buy a walker soon, I had been researching them to find which one would work best for me.  I don't need to research any longer, for they brought me a walker that fits all of my needs.  It has wheels and brakes.  It has a seat so I can rest when I need to.  It folds up making it easy to carry up and down stairs.  David said he was sorry there was no cup holder.  I had been joking that when I got my walker it had to have a cup holder, an Ooga horn (remember those?), and those handlebar streamers that kids used to attach to their bikes.  Sometimes when faced with the fact that your life has changed and you need help with something as simple as walking, making jokes helps to deal with it.  We  have stormy weather moving in today, but maybe by the end of the week I can be outdoors, terrorizing the neighborhood.  :)It was a lovely weekend.  It wasn't all about the gifts, though I am pleased by and appreciative of each one.  It was about my kids and grands who are my heart.  I do so love each and every one.  Thank you, God, for blessing me so richly."},

We have become a lawless nation.  People are welcomed into our country who have broken the law just by coming in through the back door.  We may be accepting some on humanitarian grounds, but the majority of the illegal aliens are here to do more harm than good.  Our taxes pay for their food, housing and medical care and our Vets go without proper care.  Some of those crossing our borders have vowed to kill all who do not convert to Islam.  Many expect US citizens to accommodate their way of life and their beliefs, but have no intention of  accepting ours.  And yet many in Congress fight against securing our borders.Gangs of thugs block our freeways shouting slogans about killing cops, but few arrests are made.  A friend who is a retired cop tells me the police have their hands tied by the politicians.  I can pretty much guarantee that if I were standing in the middle of a road blocking traffic, I would find myself explaining to a judge why I would do something that stupid.  People are being harassed and even assaulted simply because of who they voted for in the last election.  Some are being abused just to see how many 'likes' the perpetrators can get on their social media live stream.  And some are being hurt just because the thugs think it is funny.I wish I could change it.  I wish I could just wave a magic wand and turn the world, or at least my country, into Mayberry.  I know there are still good people here.  I know many of them.  I read their blogs and their comments.  I am proud to be related to some of them.  Problem is that the politically correct crowd is larger and stronger and louder and more vicious.  It is like Pandora's box has been opened and has released it's demons among us.I have no earthly idea where it will all end.  I am not well versed enough in the scriptures to quote any of God's promises or solutions.  And I am not arrogant enough to think I know the mind of God.  What I do know is that we as a nation desperately need to get back to the principals of our founding fathers.  We need to hold true to our core beliefs without worrying about offending those who have differing opinions.  And we need to stand firm against those who seek to destroy us.That is a pretty tall order.  I have no doubt that my parents and grandparents were equal to the task.  I wonder if we are."},

I am enjoying the spring breeze through my open windows in the afternoons when the outside temperature is warm enough.  I admit to having a slight case of Spring Fever which accounts for the need to tidy things up a bit after the long winter.  The few dust bunnies that have been found are now gone.  Cupboards have been straightened and shelves have been reorganized.  I'm waiting for my grocery order to be delivered today, after which I think I had better bake a couple batches of cookies.  To have a grandchild find an empty cookie jar is just, well, wrong.  :)My days are peaceful for the most part.  I still am working on being prepared for whatever comes - canning and dehydrating as much as possible - adding to the other supplies - spending some time in the evenings learning skills that may be useful.  YouTube is a great resource for tutorials on most any subject.  So many of the skills that were second nature to our grandparents seem to have been all but lost.  Sometimes I long for the days before electronic gadgets took over our lives.  The days when we read real books and wrote letters in cursive using pen and paper and actually held conversations rather than texting.  I do admit to loving my computer, for it gives me the opportunity to connect to the outside world at a time when it is difficult for me to leave my apartment.  But I think I would give it up to be able to sit on the porch and listen to Grandpa tell stories about his childhood.  I treasure the memories of those conversations with my Dad in his later years.  Reading from a screen or watching a video just isn't the same.  I guess the older I become, the more I wish the world hadn't changed so much.  Sigh."},

{"title": "A Couple of Days R&R and a Bit of Apartment House Excitement", "date": "Monday, April 17, 2017", "text": "So I thought I was Wonder Woman.I'm not.After all the canning I need a couple of days of rest and recuperation.  Dratted arthritis!  All I had left to can was hamburger and peas.  Those are now in the freezer waiting until my aching joints get with the program.  I had some onions, cabbage and bell peppers leftover, so those will go into the dehydrators this evening.There was a bit of excitement here in my building Saturday night.  My neighbor across the hall seems to have overindulged at the bar,  came home and put some food in his oven and neglected to take it out.  I heard his dog barking about 1 AM.  The dog never barks unless something is wrong in his world.  Then the neighbor's smoke alarm started blaring at 1:30 AM.  I had been dozing in my recliner and when I noticed it was still going off 20 minutes later and I started to get up to call 911 when it stopped.Duane asked me the next day if I had heard all the excitement.  I had not, for I must have gone to sleep right after the alarm stopped.  He said that he and Lori opened their apartment door to find out where the alarm was, and they found the hallway was filled with a smoky haze.  Lori called 911.  Police and firemen showed up in short order and found the source of the smoke.    They set up fans to clear the smoke from the building.  Duane came here to check on me and found me peacefully snoozing.  Duane and Lori said that later the neighbor, thinking the caretakers had made the call, had taken his drunken self down the hall and was pounding on the caretaker's door, shouting obscenities and calling them some very unflattering names.This is the third time this fool has done this.  We are hoping our landlord will invite him to take his sorry self elsewhere to live. Aside from that, all is quiet and peaceful in my little corner of the world.  :)"},
{"title": "Canning Corn Relish", "date": "Saturday, April 15, 2017", "text": "I like to have a variety of relishes on hand.  They give just a little bit of zing to a meal.  One of my favorites is corn relish.  Here is the recipe.Corn Relish6 cups cooked fresh or frozen whole kernel corn3 cups chopped cabbage1 cup chopped onion1 medium green bell pepper, chopped1 medium red bell pepper, chopped4 cups cider vinegar2 cups granulated sugar1 cup water1 Tbsp pickling salt1 Tbsp celery seed1 Tbsp mustard seed1 Tbsp turmericCombine all ingredients.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.Immediately fill hot pint or half-pint jars with mixture, leaving 1/2-inch head space. Process pints or half-pints in boiling water canner for 15 minutes.I doubled the recipe.  That gave me 12 pints of relish plus about a half pint to eat with supper tonite.I am taking tomorrow off.  Duane is baking a huge ham.  He is working his magic with a sauce that has pineapple in it.  He and Lori are doing most of the cooking.  All I have to do is make some candied carrots and set the table.  Spoil me, they do.  :)This is me, wishing all of my blog friends a happy and blessed Easter.So I decided to try another experiment.  I am canning grapes.Now, why on earth would anybody want to can grapes, you might ask.  First, I love grapes.  Nearly every grocery order includes grapes. Second, lets pretend that the reason we prepare has happened and the only food we have to eat is the food we have stored.  If I had canned no other meat than chicken, or if I only had canned peaches for fruit, it wouldn't take very long before I could not stand the sight of chicken or peaches.  That's why I can a variety of meats and fruits.  And grapes are just another variety to add to my shelves.I have not canned grapes before, but according to those who have, they can up well.  If you only like fresh grapes, this method is probably not for you.  But if you like the grapes that come in a can of fruit cocktail, you might like these.Canning grapes is easy, peasy.  Remove the grapes from their stems and wash them well.  Fill jars with grapes (I used pints) to within 1 inch from the top of the jar.  Make a simple syrup of sugar and water.  As grapes are naturally sweet, I used a very light syrup of 6 1/2 cups of water and 3/4 cup sugar, brought to a boil to dissolve the sugar.  This is enough for 8 - 9 pints.  Pour the syrup over the grapes and water bath can them for 15 minutes. I had ordered 2 lbs. of green grapes and 2 lbs. of red.  That gave me 6 pints of grapes, total (minus a handful or two or three that I ate).  When the jars had cooled, I opened one to see how I would like them, and I did.  I would think you could use them like fruit cocktail, just for snacking or maybe as a dessert.  I will probably can more of these.You gotta try new things.  :)"},
{"title": "Canning Ham and Bean and Vegetable Soup", "date": "Friday, April 14, 2017", "text": "When I can soups I keep the recipe as simple as possible.  If I keep the ingredients basic, I can add others when it is served, giving me more options.Last evening I did the prep work on the ingredients for this soup.  This recipe calls for the following per pint jar, layered in no particular order:1/3 cup of dry white beans that have been sorted and washed1/4 cup diced onion1/4 cup diced carrots1/4 cup diced celery1/4 cup diced ham2 teaspoon beef bouillon powderwater to fill jarThe jars are processed in a pressure canner for 75 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure for my altitude.  The beans will cook through and expand while processing.  The recipe can be doubled for quarts that are processed for 90 minutes.  I ran through a canner load of 16 pints.Some instructions for similar soups call for more beans.  I am reluctant to use more because the beans fully expand in the canner.  Too many beans in the jar will push the lids off when they expand, leaving a nasty mess in the canner and the loss of your jars of soup. Some serve the soup as is with just the addition of salt and pepper.  Others add a variety of spices and seasonings to taste.  Some like the addition of tomatoes or tomato powder for a different flavor.  There are all sorts of possibilities.This soup along with a chicken vegetable variety are my \"go to\" soups.  I make sure I have lots of both canned and on the shelves so that I can use both in a variety of ways.  They are nice to have when you want a quick lunch or supper.  Add a salad or cornbread or maybe a slice of homemade bread and you have a really quick and easy meal.  And as you know, I am all about quick, easy meals now that I am cooking for just one.More SoupI still had vegetables and ham left after canning the ham, bean and vegetable soup.  I also had some potatoes that needed to be used up.  So I peeled and diced the potatoes.  Each pint jar got 2/3 cup of potatoes and 1/3 cup each ham, carrots and celery.  I added 1 teaspoon of chicken bouillon powder for flavor and water to cover.  I ran this through the pressure canner at 10 lbs. pressure for 75 minutes.  I got 16 pints of ham, potato and vegetable soup.I sort of made this soup up as I went along so I'm not exactly sure what to do with it.  I expect it can be eaten as is or maybe thickened for a chowder type soup.  No matter how it is consumed, it is still 16 more meals on the shelf.  And that's the goal - fill the shelves."},
{"title": "Canning Kielbasa", "date": "Thursday, April 13, 2017", "text": "As it turned out this week, the only food items I needed to order were eggs and milk.  So I thought it might be a good opportunity to fill out my grocery order with things to can.  My groceries were delivered this afternoon.  In order to get a head start on the canning, I started with the easiest which is kielbasa.  This is sort of an experiment for me as I have not canned kielbasa before.I started out with 6 rings of kielbasa.  I cut them into about 1 inch thick pieces.  I didn't want the pieces any smaller than that because of the time they are in the pressure canner.  I was afraid they would become a bit crunchy if the slices were too thin.  I am not fond of most meats that are canned in liquid so I added none to the jars.  I just packed pint jars with the kielbasa chunks and pressure canned them for 75 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure for my area.  I got 7 pints from the 6 kielbasa rings.I am pleased with the results.  The kielbasa did not shrink hardly at all in the canning process, and the taste and texture are really good.  I will can more of this.Tomorrow I am canning ham, bean and vegetable soup and will post the recipe when the soup comes out of the canner."},

{"title": "Canning Ham", "date": "Monday, April 10, 2017", "text": "So yesterday I saw that ham was on sale at my local grocery.  Ham is one of my favorite meats to can and my supply was getting low.  Lori said she would be happy to do a grocery run for me (Bless her heart.).  She came back with a lovely spiral cut ham for our Easter dinner and 4 regular hams for me to can.  The hams to can weighed in at about 40 pounds, total. I spent the afternoon cutting the meat from the bones.  Roughly a third of the meat was cut into 2 to 3 inch chunks to be used for regular ham dinners.  The rest was cut into smaller cubes.  These will be used in scalloped potatoes and ham or casseroles or for sandwiches.Early this morning I packed the ham into pint and half pint jars.  I don't add any liquid.  The ham generates its own juices.  Both are processed in the pressure canner for 75 minutes.  The four hams gave me 13 pints of the larger chunks and 45 half pints of the smaller cubes.There is a generous amount of meat left on the bones, so maybe tomorrow I will boil up the bones and can the resulting ham broth.  The meat will be packaged and frozen for use in ham and beans or in soup. It is good to have a variety of meats on the shelf and canning ham is one way to accomplish that.  It is a bonus that the home canned ham tastes really good."},

{"title": "When Do You Have Enough Home Canned Food", "date": "Wednesday, April 5, 2017", "text": "That is a question I have been pondering this week.  Because I enjoy the process and results of canning food in jars and because I seem to be constantly rearranging to make room on the shelves for more, I began to wonder when I would have enough.If I were canning for just myself I would probably concede that I have enough now to last me a couple of years, even with using it regularly as I do.  But there is more to consider.  For a number of years I have taken into consideration that because my oldest son is the one who does grocery and Farmer's Market runs for me and because he has hauled countless cases of jars up the stairs to my apartment, often refusing to let me pay, that my canning efforts would feed him as well as myself.  And now that his girlfriend has joined our family and they live in my building, the food in jars is, of course, split three ways.  That gives me maybe a years worth of canned food.None of us knows what the future holds.  The only thing I know for sure is that I now live in a more volatile world than I have ever before in my lifetime seen.  There are riots in the streets over any number of causes, political and racial being the two most prominent.   We have those who are supposed to be representing we the people, fighting amongst themselves worse than the Hatfields and McCoys.  We have the occasional terrorist who tries to kill as many of us as possible for the glory of Allah.  We have countries in the Middle East whose theme song seems to be \"Death to America.\"   And lest we forget, there is that crazy North Korean dictator who threatens on almost a weekly basis to nuke us to smithereens or at the very least, nuke our electric grid out of existence.  And we haven't even talked about the natural disasters that could occur.So all of that being said, when do I have enough food in jars to stop canning.  Do I stop when there is enough to feed three people for a year?  Or do I think ahead to the possibility of other family members knocking on my door when their food supply is gone.  I am not saying this will happen, but what if it did. Someone once looked at my well stocked shelves and asked me, in all seriousness, what in the world I was going to do with all that food, should nothing bad ever happen.  I said I didn't know.  Maybe I would just..........eat it.To answer my own question about when do you have enough food stored, I think that \"never\" is likely correct.  Especially for those of us who live where we can not raise our own fruit and vegetables and livestock.  Eventually, no matter what our best efforts are, the food will run out.  But having a couple of years of food stocked, we have given ourselves time to plan and carry out the next move should it be necessary.  It is good to have options."},
{"title": "Quiet Weekend", "date": "Monday, April 3, 2017", "text": "It was a very quiet weekend here in my little Home Sweet Apartment.  I did a whole lot of nuthin'. Oh, there were the usual domestic chores that keep one's living space from turning into pig sty.  There were dishes to be washed and  floors to be swept and dust to be removed from furniture surfaces.  But between bouts of domesticity there were mystery novels to be read and movies to be watched and most importantly, naps to be taken. Youngest Son called and wanted to know what I was doing.  I replied that I was pretty much just being a turnip.  He said he wished he could just be a turnip for a day.  He was busy doing those chores that most folks with jobs do on weekends.  And he was driving his offspring to dance competitions and hockey games.  Makes me appreciate retirement even more.So I am off to do a couple loads of laundry.  And maybe bake a pan of brownies.  In a world that has gone completely mad, sometimes a pan of brownies is all that stands between us and total insanity."},
{"title": "If I Brag About Successes...", "date": "Thursday, March 30, 2017", "text": "then I also need to report my fails.Out of the 14 quarts of chili I canned, one jar didn't seal right out of the canner.  That is not unusual.  While I was washing the jars prior to shelving them, another six jars popped their seals.  That is unusual.I am not sure why this happened.  There are a number of reason why lids don't seal, but this is the first time I can remember having jars that seal, only to come loose the next day. I put the offending jars in the fridge.  Tomorrow I will transfer the chili from the jars to freezer bags and freeze them.  I am debating whether or not I should just open the rest of the jars and freeze the contents of them as well.  With a failure rate of 50%, it seems likely that others could lose their seals and I could have chili on my shelf, slowly rotting away if I don't catch the popped seals right away.  Better to err on the side of caution.On the bright side, I didn't lose any chili due to spoilage.  Good thing I cleaned out the freezer.  :)"},
{"title": "Lots of Chili", "date": "Tuesday, March 28, 2017", "text": "So yesterday I cleaned out the freezer compartment of the refrigerator.  I did that mostly because in my typical unorganized fashion, stuff was just crammed in there willy nilly.  And when a rock solid package of food slid out when the door was opened, I was in danger of winding up with a busted toe.  I can't jump out of the way of falling objects quite as fast as I used to.  Anyway, in the process of cleaning and sorting, I found about 15 lbs. of hamburger.  Decided it was time to can some chili.  I had been out of my home canned chili for a while and I really like having it on hand for a quick meal.This morning I browned the meat, drained it and tossed it into my big stock pot.  I added 9 pints of tomatoes with green peppers and onions that I had canned a couple of years ago.  That wasn't enough, so I added 5 quarts of diced tomatoes.  Threw in a big handful of dehydrated onions just because.  I had a couple of cases of kidney beans in the pantry, so I added 6 cans of them to the mix.  I seasoned the chili with salt and pepper and chili powder to taste.When I can chili, I don't need to cook it first.  I just heat it up enough to warm it before filling the jars.  Because the chili contains meat, the quart jars are processed in the pressure canner for 90 minutes which is plenty of time to fully cook it.  I wound up with 14 quarts of chili.When I was growing up, my Mom always served chili over rice.  I always thought she did that because she liked it that way.  It wasn't until I was grown and feeding my own family that I realized she used the rice to stretch the chili to feed our family.  By that time I liked the combination of chili and rice, so while the chili was in the canner I cooked up a big pot of rice, let it cool down and portioned it out into small freezer bags and froze it.  So now when I want chili for supper, I just need to microwave the rice enough to thaw it out and heat it up while the chili heats on the stove.  Add a pan of cornbread and I have a quick, easy supper.  And goodness knows, I am all about quick and easy meals.  :)"},

Riding in the back of a pickup truck on a warm day was always a special treat.Our baby cribs were covered with bright colored lead-based paint. We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors, or cabinets.When we rode our bikes, we had no helmets. (Not to mention hitchhiking to town as a young kid!)We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle. Horrors.We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then rode down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times we learned to solve the problem.We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on. No one was able to reach us all day. Our parents knew that all the neighbors would watch out for all the kids. No cell phones. Unthinkable.We played dodge ball and sometimes the ball would really hurt.We got cut and broke bones and broke teeth, and there were no lawsuits from these accidents. They were accidents. No one was to blame, but us. Remember accidents?We had fights and punched each other and got black and blue and learned to get over it.We ate cupcakes, bread and butter, and drank sugar soda, but we were never overweight... we were always outside playing. We shared one grape soda with four friends, from one bottle and no one died from this.We did not have Playstations, Nintendo 64, X-Boxes, video games at all, 99 channels on cable, video tape movies, surround sound, personal cell phones, Personal Computers, Internet chat rooms ... we had friends. We went outside and found them.We rode bikes or walked to a friend's home and knocked on the door, or rung the bell or just walked in and talked to them. Imagine such a thing. Without asking a parent! By ourselves! Out there in the cold cruel world! Without a guardian.How did we do it?We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and ate worms and although we were told it would happen, we did not put out very many eyes, nor did the worms live inside us forever.Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't, had to learn to deal with disappointment.... The teams actually kept score and the winning team was allowed to be excited and the losing team learned to be good sports about it and learned that, in life - sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.Some students weren't as smart as others so they failed a grade and were held back to repeat the same grade..... Horrors. Tests were not adjusted for any reason.Almost no one went to \"pre-school\" and when we graduated high school we all knew how to read, use proper grammar and do basic math. We all learned how to count out change without a calculator to tell us the amount.The worst problems in school were tardiness and chewing gum in class. Our actions were our own. Consequences were expected. No one to hide behind. The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law ... imagine that!If you misbehaved - your parents spanked you and no one arrested them for doing that! We also learned that when a parent said \"No\" - they actually meant that and our lives would not be ruined forever by being denied every little thing we wanted at any given moment.New toys were received on birthdays and holidays..... not on every trip to the store. Parents gave us gifts out of love.... not out of guilt.This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever. The past 50 years has been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all.And you're one of them.Congratulations!"},
{"title": "More Canning and Dehydrating", "date": "Saturday, March 18, 2017", "text": "Lately I have been concentrating on using my grocery delivery service to bring me items to add to my food storage.  This week, in addition to the normal groceries I use like fresh fruits and vegetables, I ordered 6 lbs. of butter.  Those, along with the 6 lbs. I had in my freezer, are waiting to be canned in half pint jars.  The half pints are just right for everyday use for one person or maybe two, but I need to can some more in pint jars for when I need butter for baking.  Thing is, I am low on pint jars.  I may have to buy a few more cases of jars or wait until I empty more from my shelves.  If you are a canner, you know that one can never have too many jars.  :)I had 2 bags of hash browns in my freezer, so I ordered 4 more.  Those went on the dehydrator trays that were lined with the plastic mesh inserts to keep the little bits from falling through the trays.  I like having the dehydrated hash browns on hand.  They just need to be soaked in water for maybe 15 minutes, then drained and they are ready to fry or to use in casseroles.Next were the frozen vegetables.  This time I got 6 bags of broccoli and 6 bags of whole kernel corn.  Dehydrating frozen vegetables is a snap.  Just spread them out on the mesh lined trays and set the dehydrator temperature at 135 degrees.  I did chop the broccoli into smaller pieces to use in soups or casseroles and so they would dry a little more quickly.I ordered 10 lbs of russet potatoes.  These I will be slicing thin using a mandolin, blanching the slices for 3 minutes and spreading them in a single layer on the trays.  They are dried at the same temperature as the other vegetables.  I use these mostly for scalloped potatoes.  I find that cooking them in a crock pot works better for me than using the oven.  My instructions for crockpot scalloped potatoes using dehydrated potatoes are here.Sometimes I will re-can food, when it is less expensive to do so than it is to make it from scratch.  This is true of sweet pickles.  Because I can not raise my own cucumbers and have to buy them at the Farmer's Market, canning sweet pickles become somewhat pricey to make.  I had 3 jars of sweet bread and butter pickles on the shelf from when I bought them on sale.  The jars each contain 24 ounces of pickles, which is way more than I consume within several months.  I ordered 3 more jars.  I will be dumping the pickles and juice into a stock pot and heating them to near boiling.  Then I will be packing the pickle slices and juice into half-pint jars and water bath canning them for 10 minutes.  If you have to have a really crisp pickle this probably won't work for you as they soften up just a little bit in the process.  I don't mind, so it works just fine for me and gives me jars of sweet pickles that get eaten soon after opening and don't live in my fridge for months on end.We like the baby dill pickles too, and those cukes aren't so expensive, so we get them at the Farmer's Market.  I use Mrs. Wage's dill pickle mix when canning those and they turn out absolutely delicious.I need to spread the work over several day's time.  If I don't, I am finding it takes this old body a couple of days to recover.  I am not happy about that turn of events at this stage of my life, but there it is.  So today I will deal with the butter and pickles and Monday will find me up to my elbows in potato slices. Mama Pea over at \" A Home Grown Journal\" had a giveaway - and I was one of the winners!!  She gave away two sets of potholders she made.⁮I appropriated the photo from her blog.  I hope she doesn't mind.  My camera battery gave out and I really wanted to show how pretty these potholders are.  Mine are the top set.  I admire anyone who does handmade.  She makes some of the prettiest quilts and she knits socks and I don't know what all else.  And there are posts about her homesteading experiences.  I just love her blog.And now I am off to work on the canning of butter and pickles.  Hope your weekend is snow free and shows signs of spring.  :)"},

{"title": "Canning Sweet & Sour Chicken", "date": "Friday, March 3, 2017", "text": "I like to keep some heat and serve meals on hand for days I am busy and don't want to spend time cooking.  I have had this recipe in my files for a long time - so long I don't recall where I found it.  I had all the ingredients on hand so I decided to give it a try. This is the original recipe.Sweet and Sour Chicken5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut in bite sized pieces3 large green peppers chopped2 large onions chopped3 (20 oz) cans pineapple chunks drained, reserve juice3/4 cup brown sugar1 1/4 cups white vinegar6 tablespoons soy sauce4 tablespoons ketchup1 tsp gingerLayer the chicken, onions, peppers and pineapple in quart jars.Heat the brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, ketchup, ginger, and 3 cups of pineapple juice (add water if there is not enough) and bring to a light boil until the sugar is dissolved.Pour liquid over the solids in the jar to the fill line.Pressure can for 90 minutes at 10 lbs pressure or according to your elevation.I did a couple of things differently.  I used frozen chicken breast, so I thawed it, cut it up and stir-fried the pieces in a little bit of oil until they were just cooked through.  You can use raw chicken, but when I have canned raw chicken before, the juices sort of become glued to the inside of the jar during the canning process.  I didn't want that to happen.I used pint jars rather than quarts.  I had to double the sauce in order to have enough.  I had ordered a few cans of pineapple juice in case I needed more sauce and that worked out well.  By using the canned juice, I didn't need to open more cans of pineapple just for the juice. Because I used pint jars instead of quarts, the processing time was 75 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure.If you expect this recipe to look like the take-out sweet & sour chicken from the Chinese deli, you will be disappointed.  The chicken and pineapple chunks take on a brownish color during canning.  The onions and peppers are softer than regular stir-fry.  I used a little cornstarch in water to thicken the sauce while heating it up and served it over rice.  If you can get past the color changes, the taste is excellent.It is good to have jars of quick and easy meals on hand.  This is a  nice change from the usual soups I can.  I got 15 pints from this recipe, doubling the amount of sauce.  If by chance there is sauce left over, it can be water bath canned for 15 minutes.  I will be canning at least one more batch."},
{"title": "Rollerskates and Hayrides", "date": "Thursday, March 2, 2017", "text": "When I was between the ages of 5 and 9, my family lived in town.  One of the things that kept kids in my neighborhood busy in the summer was roller skating.  Now, we aren't talking fancy rollerblades.  This is what we had.That key at the bottom of the picture was used to tighten the toe clamps on the skates.  Every kid I knew had a skate key on a string around their neck whether they were skating that day or not.  It was sort of a 1950's fashion statement among the kiddie crowd. You put your feet on the skates, buckled the leather straps around your ankles and tightened the clamps.  You learned quickly to wear hard soled leather shoes for skating.  Skates clamped to sneakers soon raised some impressive blisters.It took a while to get the hang of sidewalk rollerskating.  I think my knees had scabs on them all that first summer I skated.  When four or five kids got together to skate, you could hear us coming a block away.  The metal wheels were noisy on the sidewalk and each time you skated over a crack, a clickety clackity sound was heard.There were two ways to negotiate the curb at the end of a block.  There were no wheelchair ramps then, so you either jumped off the curb or fell off.  You knew which method was used by the size of the scabs on the knees.When I was about 10 years of age, my parents bought a big, old farmhouse on 20 acres of land.  One of the first things I did upon moving to the country was to join the local 4-H club.  To my delight I discovered that once in a while the club had a \"Fun Night\" and sometimes the fun included a 20 mile drive to the nearest roller rink.None of the kids could afford shoe skates of their own, so skates like these were rented at the rink.The roller rink where we skated had a floor about the size of a basketball court.  There were colored lights in the ceiling and one of those mirrored disco balls in the center.  Round and round and round we skated, trying not to run over the smaller kids and staying away from the better skaters.  I always wished I could skate backwards or do the dance steps, but I did pretty well as long as I kept moving forward.  To try to do anything fancy usually ended in disaster.The 4-H club held a hayride on Halloween night.  We didn't go trick or treating.  The houses were just too far apart.  Everyone gathered at the two-room schoolhouse where the club meetings were held.  One of the local farmers arrived on his tractor, pulling a hayrack behind.  Hay had been spread over the bed of the hayrack and we all piled on.  A couple of the dads, armed with flashlights, came along to keep the older boys from becoming too rowdy, to keep the younger kids from falling off and to keep the older boys and girls from becoming too amorous in the dark. We rode for about an hour - up and down gravel roads and across fields and pastures.  Arriving back at the schoolhouse, there were games like bobbing for apples and pin the tail on the donkey.  The moms provided treats - hot apple cider - sandwiches - pumpkin cookies - brownies with orange colored frosting.  Each child took home a small bag of Halloween candy.I suppose all that was pretty tame compared to the elaborate Halloween doings for kids today, but for a kid in the late 1950's and early 1960's, it was absolutely wonderful!"},

{"title": "Sunday Memories", "date": "Sunday, February 26, 2017", "text": "Growing up, Sundays were always a day of worship and a day of rest.  Sunday school and church services were mandatory.  There were Bible verses to be memorized during the week and then recited in class and sermons to be listened to afterward.  The preachers then didn't give a hoot about your \"feeeelings.\"  They weren't even close to being politically correct.  They preached Hellfire and Brimstone.  They didn't worry about offending anyone. If you didn't repent and give up your wicked ways, you were going directly to Hell.  There were no gray areas.  I think I liked that.  At least you left the church service knowing exactly where you stood.Arriving home from church, we were greeted by wonderful aromas coming from the kitchen.  Before church, Mother would put a pot roast or a chicken or a pork roast in a pan, surround it with potatoes, carrots and onions and let it slow bake in the oven while we were gone.  I noticed that if the preacher was particularly long-winded and his sermon went past the noon hour, Mother would get fidgety, worried that her Sunday dinner would dry out in the oven before she got home.  I don't ever remember that happening.  Sunday dinners were always the highlight of the week as far as meals went.Sunday afternoons were a time for family.  We didn't always do things together, but we were still together as a family.  On rainy Sundays I could be found in my bedroom, reading Bobsey Twins books or the latest Nancy Drew mystery.  Or sometimes I would just sit listening to the radio and knitting or crocheting.   Or maybe embroidering a pretty picture on one of those flour sack dishtowels.  My little sister was more interested in dolls so she would be in the playhouse my Dad built for her, having a tea party with the neighbor girls.  Or we might spend the afternoon putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  There was always a card table set up with a half finished puzzle on it.I never understood Mother's reasoning, but she believed that regular playing cards were evil.  So in the evenings we might play some Mother approved card games like Rook or Uno or Old Maid.  Sometimes Dad would get out one of the board games and we would play Scrabble or Yahtzee or Sorry or Clue (The professor in the library with a candlestick.)  :)Sunny summer Sunday afternoons were a good time to go for a ride.  We didn't usually have a destination in mind.  We might stop at one of the one room schoolhouses in the area and play on the swings and teeter-totters.  Or we might go for a swim at the lake.  Sometimes Dad would just drive a meandering path until we came to one of the small towns in the area where he would find a place that sold ice cream cones.Sometimes on a Sunday afternoon we would have company come.  Could be friends from town or my aunt and uncle and cousins.  Dad might set up the badminton net for the kids or maybe get out the croquet set.  Most often he would fill the ice cream maker with the ingredients and ice, and set the kids out on the back steps to work the crank until we had real, homemade ice cream.  The best was when he added sliced peaches or strawberries to the mixture.  We would enjoy the ice cream with a pitcher of ice cold lemonade and either gingersnaps or sugar cookies out on the front porch.Now you might say that I grew up in a Mayberry kind of world, and you might be close to right.  It was a time, 60 years ago, when we enjoyed the more simple things in life.  It wasn't perfect by any means, but we were raised by parents who taught us right from wrong and who took the time to be with us, whether it was going for a Sunday ride or to church or playing a game of Scrabble.  I look at my grands and see that even though their world is much different than mine was, they are still being raised with some of the Mayberry values.  Gives me hope for their futures."},

I washed the jars of potatoes and carrots, wrote the contents and date on the lids and stocked them on the shelf.  I had filled 34 pint jars with half potato dices and half carrot dices.  My reasoning was that this would work well for smaller batches of soup or stew at times when I want a quick meal - just add broth, meat and seasonings.  There were more potatoes than carrots, so I canned 10 pints of potato dices to be used mostly for fried breakfast potatoes.  They are fully cooked after processing, so all I need to do is brown them in a frying pan and maybe toss in some onion or garlic.The onions and cabbage went into the dehydrators late this afternoon.  They should be fully dried by morning.  I seem to go through a lot of onions, so that is something I order in quantity at least once every couple of months to dehydrate.  I keep a few fresh onions but drying them seems to be the best way for me to keep them on hand.And that, I think, is enough for one day.  Time to fix a bit of supper, fire up the Kindle and read awhile.  It has been a good day."},
{"title": "Canning Season", "date": "Saturday, February 4, 2017", "text": "Most folks who have a garden find themselves up to their hips in vegetables to can in the fall when it is time to harvest.  Because I don't have a garden, my canning season is whenever I find a good sale at the grocery store.This week I ordered two of those boneless half hams.  They were 2 1/2 lbs. each.  I also got 20 lbs. of russet potatoes and 8 lbs. of carrots.  And I have about 15 lbs. of onions and one head of cabbage.I spent the better part of Friday prepping the ham and potatoes and carrots.  The ham was cut into 1 inch cubes.  The potatoes and carrots were run through my food chopper and turned into 1/2 inch cubes.  Saturday morning I will run them through my pressure canner.While the canner is doing its thing, I will chop the onions and shred the cabbage for the dehydrator.I know that I have already put back enough canned and dried food for at least a year.  Oldest Son has been working with me on this prepping thing for the last few years, so I figure the amounts I need for his household and mine.I had planned on sewing Friday and Saturday, but it is a matter of priorities.  Some say I am foolish to can and dehydrate so much, but the meat I canned two years ago that I ate for supper cost considerably less when I bought it than it does now.  And the ham I bought this week will likely cost more next year.  And even though things seem to be looking a bit brighter now, we still live in an uncertain world with more unrest here in the States than I can remember.  So, I keep on adding to the pantry whenever I can.  Just in case..."},
{"title": "It Is a Combination of Things", "date": "Thursday, February 2, 2017", "text": "It seems that my muse opened the door to my apartment, took a hard right, galloped down the stairs and flung itself out into the street.  There must be a reason for that.  I have decided that there are several reasons why I can't seem to find anything to write about.The most obvious is that it is February in Minnesota.  The sun has stayed hidden for days at a time.  It is cold.  Today the temp is holding at 13 degrees, falling close to zero at night.  Last week we enjoyed a heat wave in the mid-forty degree range.  St. Paul holds their Winter Carnival the last week of January and the first week of February.  They build a huge ice palace and have ice and snow sculpture contests.  Last week the sculptures were melting.  This week folks are dressed in snowmobile suits and felt lined boots.I am just plain tired.  Not so much sleepy tired but more worn down.  I was tired of politics long before the election.  And now that the inauguration has come and gone, I am even more tired of the childish behavior of those on the left who are acting like spoiled toddlers throwing the mother of all temper tantrums.  You lost.  Deal with it.And to top it all off, there was the March of the Pink Pussy Hats.  Really?  You think those stupid hats are going to make me take your causes seriously?  Especially when you add to the mix a gaggle of foul mouthed celebrities?  I don't think so.Well, now that I have turned this post into a bit of a rant, I believe I shall go take a nap.  After which I will likely be back to my normal posts.Sometimes it helps to just blow off some steam."},

{"title": "Slightly Sidetracked", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2017", "text": "Sometimes I am easily sidetracked.  I start out with a goal in mind and before I know it, I am off in another direction.My intention was to get out the fabric pieces that are ready to sew together for a quilt.  While rummaging around in the tub where they have been living since I cut them out last fall, I found two bags of partially crocheted afghans.  They are partially done because I was using yarn left over from another project, and I ran out.  And I haven't been to the store to get enough yarn to finish them.  So I sat down and figured out what colors and how many skeins of each color I need.Back to the tub.  A little further down I found a length of fabric that will work well for sashing strips between the blocks of another quilt top waiting to be finished.  Ironed the fabric and cut out the pieces I will need.Back to the tub.  Next I found another quilt top that was finished.  I think I remember that when I sewed this one together I made a mistake that has to be fixed.  I looked it over but couldn't find the error, so I set it aside and will press it later, when I get ready to add the batting and backing.Back to the tub.  I finally I found the quilt pieces I was looking for to begin with.  I sat down and started sewing.  This quilt is an old pattern that has just two colors.  I'll take a picture when it is finished. There are quilters who make fancy quilts that are the kind seen in quilt shows.  I am not one of those quilters.  Mine are of simple patterns and are made to be used as opposed to being hung on a wall and admired.  Guess that comes from my frugal ancestors.  Those other quilters have studio sewing rooms and shelf after shelf of designer fabrics that cost a lot of money.  I wait until my local Joann Fabrics store runs a sale on quilt cottons and then I stock up on enough fabric for several quilts.  My \"studio\" consists of my kitchen table for cutting fabric and a table in my living room for sewing.  I love the looks of all those beautiful quilts at quilt shows, but the thing is, I really love what I do and more importantly, I love making something that is useful.  And for that I don't need a studio.  My setup works just fine.And with that, it is back to my sewing machine.  There are lots more little pieces that need to be attached to other little pieces.  Funny...I have very little patience for some things, but all the patience in the world for making useful stuff."},

{"title": "Busy Week", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2017", "text": "Last week was a busy one.  Lori picked up my new shelving unit and Duane set it up for me.  I spent a couple of days getting boxes and tubs of fabric and quilting supplies and yarn off the floor and onto the shelves, along with several cases of home canned food.  Didn't take long to fill up the shelves.Friday morning the cleaners came in and scrubbed out my apartment.  Thanks to my kids for such a good Christmas gift. The cleaners did a great job.  It is so nice to have the dust bunnies gone and the corners that have been tough for me to get into, shiny clean again.  It will make it easier to maintain when I'm not trying to get caught up but am starting out fresh.I had about 20 lbs. each of potatoes, carrots and onions to dehydrate, so after taking Saturday off to just rest, I got the vegetables cleaned, sliced and diced.  The potatoes are in the dehydrators.  The carrots and onions are in the fridge waiting their turn.I watched parts of Inauguration Day and I have to admit to feeling a real sense of relief when Mr. Trump was finally sworn in as our President.  There has been so much protesting, negative rhetoric and outright threats connected to this event that I wondered if someone would actually do something to try to stop the Inauguration from happening.  Aside from the expected sign carrying, foul mouthed protesters and the few window breaking, car burning thugs, the whole thing went off without a hitch. ⁬I have to admit that the best part was watching that helicopter carrying Obama flying away and knowing that finally there is a President now who actually wants to work for the people rather than work to destroy my beloved America.I do fear that we who prep may become complacent just because of the changes in Washington.  Our government is far from being fixed.  And although the major threat to our well being is gone, there remain those who will do everything in their power to try to keep we the people in what they consider to be our place.  I am guessing that President Trump will have to fight hard to keep his campaign promises.  That being said, I still have much more hope today than I have had in the last several years.So I will continue as I have been doing - preserving whatever foods I can - adding to my supplies - learning as much as I can that will help me and mine weather whatever storms come our way.  Seems like the sensible thing to do."},
{"title": "Yesterday's Message", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2017", "text": "I have a Facebook account.  I don't use it to post my opinions, nor do I get involved in the political arguments I have seen springing up lately.  I mainly use it to swipe grandkid photos that have been posted by their parents.So I was pleasantly surprised yesterday when I found a message from my former sister-in-law.  We grew up close neighbors - she on her Dad's dairy and beef cattle farm and me right next door on my Dad's 20 acres that had once been part of the same farm.  She had been looking through some of her mother's things and had run across an old card that reminded her of our childhood.  She shared those memories with me.I answered her message by telling her some of the memories I had of that time.  Like when her older sister and I decided to try smoking corn silk.  I was about 13 years old then, and all we succeeded in doing was singeing our eyebrows nearly off.  There were memories of a playhouse where she and my sister played with their baby dolls and a tire swing behind it that was used by all the kids. I told her about the time my Dad came into our house, chuckling.  He said he had just seen the oldest boy in the family next door, running as fast as his 16 year old legs would carry him, across the barnyard, with his Dad hot on his heels.  Dad said he didn't know what the boy had done, but he kind of hoped he didn't get caught.  That Dad doing the chasing would later be the best Father-in-law anyone could hope for.  The boy doing the running grew up to be my husband and the father of my four children. After that little meander down Memory Lane, I got to thinking about other things from that time period of the late 1950's and early 1960's.  I wonder if anyone remembers the telephone party line.  In rural America it was common for several families to share a telephone line.  I think there were nine families on ours.  There were no long chats with friends.  You said what you had to say and then hung up, because someone else might be waiting to use the phone line.  That sort of put a crimp in the teenage social life.  And you didn't dare plan any shenanigans with friends over the phone, for there was always the one busybody on the line who loved to tell your mother when you were up to no good.  Don't ask how I know this.  :)I was thinking about TV programs back then.  Most farmers in my neighborhood didn't have a TV.  They were too busy to watch TV and they were content to get the weather forecasts and farm reports from the radio.  I was 15 years old when my family first owned a TV.   Kids living in town had more choices of programming, but the rural areas were lucky if two or three channels came in clear using the rooftop antenna.  The one kids program I remember most was \"Axel and His Dog.\"  Axel was a goofball with sort of a Scandinavian accent who lived in a treehouse.  Axel is sort of hard to explain to those who never saw this local program, so here is a clip.My Dad loved the ending of each show - the \"Birdie with a yellow bill\" part, because sometimes in the last line of that little poem, Axel would sneak in something that the kids might not understand, but the grownups would surely get the double meaning.Dad would chuckle.  Mother, on the other hand, was not amused."},

{"title": "Happy Dance Time", "date": "Friday, December 30, 2016", "text": "I have been going to weekly appointments at the physical therapy clinic due to the problems with my feet and legs.  Wednesday the therapist told me my legs have healed to the point where I needn't go back - I can just continue treatment at home.  Yep.  Happy Dance time!!I still have to keep my legs and feet bandaged and wrapped in Ace bandages and those have to be changed every other day, but the fact that this can be done at home with the help of a kid or two is reason to celebrate.  And when completely healed, I will have a compression device for each leg, kept closed with Velcro, that I think I can handle by myself.  That makes me even happier.  My kids have been great - hauling me to appointments and helping me with the bandaging in between times.  But I will be pleased when I don't need to ask for help. Funny, isn't it.  When family has asked me for help in the past, I have always been glad to help if I could and have never, ever considered it a burden.  But it makes me a wee bit (alright - a lot) crazy when I have to ask any of them to help me with anything.  My kids tell me that I am just stubborn, and I suppose they may be right.  Well, OK.  They are spot on, but don't tell them I said so!  But I think it is more that the older I get, the more I fear losing my independence. I have a few things I want to get done before the cleaners come in sometime in January, so I am taking off until after the first of the year.  There are a couple pieces of furniture to be moved and another shelving unit to be set up.  I am out of space on the shelves that hold my home canned food.  As a result, I have several cases of food in jars sitting on the floor of my bedroom.  They need to be shelved so the carpet can be properly vacuumed and after that I can shampoo the carpets.And when all is said and done, I plan to spend the rest of the winter sewing and quilting and crocheting.  Not very exciting, I know, but those are the things I enjoy.  Give me a nice, quiet winter, preferably indoors where it is toasty warm,  and I am one happy granny."},

So my family gave me cleaners.  They hired a company to come in to do a one-time deep cleaning of my apartment.  This will happen some time in January.  They won't let me stay home while the cleaners are at work.  They think I will try to help.  Don't know where they got that idea, but they are taking me out somewhere while my apartment gets a top to bottom scrubbing.Anyone who has physical limitations will understand that once we fall behind on those chores, it seems like an impossible task to get caught up again.  I have good days and not so good days.  On good days I can accomplish quite a lot.  On not so good days it is all I can do to cook meals and wash the dishes.  So I think it will be easier for me to maintain a clean apartment once the dust bunnies have been eradicated and the surfaces and corners I have trouble reaching have been dealt with.God has blessed me with a better family than I deserve.  And I  am forever grateful."},

{"title": "A Bit Nippy", "date": "Sunday, December 18, 2016", "text": "It looks like we got about 7 inches of snow in this recent go-around.  And then it turned cold.  Rob over at \"At The Lake In The Woods\" reports temperatures at his place fell to minus 31 degrees early this morning.  He and his family live 50 miles away from me - a shorter distance as the crow flies.  I am a craven coward.  I didn't want to know how cold it was then.  I checked my thermostat that registers both indoor and outdoor temperatures and found that at 10:30 am it was still 12 degrees below zero. I checked my Facebook page this morning as I usually do.  I rarely comment there, but look to see if any of my children have posted pictures of their families.  I chuckled when I saw my oldest son had posted two words before braving the elements to go to work this morning.  I quote: \"bursy toad.\"  Years past, when I would take my little ones to see their grandparents in the middle of a Minnesota winter, at least one of them would ask Grandpa how cold it was, knowing his answer would be, \"Brrrrrrzy Cold,\" said with the proper voice that was guaranteed to make the kids laugh.  The younger ones, having the usual pronunciation by toddlers, parroted the phrase as \"bursy toad,\" which has been our description of mind freezing weather ever since.I am happy to report that the healing of the legs is progressing nicely.  I have been going to therapy appointments twice weekly to have the progress assessed.  My legs are bandaged knee to toes, partly to deal with the seepage of fluid that goes along with the Cellulitis and mostly to provide the compression necessary to keep the fluid from building up and to help reduce the swelling of legs and feet.  I have been able to reduce the appointments to one a week and go from daily changing of bandages to every other day.  May not seem like much, but to me, it is a huge difference. I wonder when the insanity within the pharmaceutical industry will end.  Or if it ever will.  I realize there are folks who need medications that are much more spendy than those I need to take, but here is what I learned this week.  My doctor sent a prescription to my pharmacy for medication that should greatly increase my chances of having near normal feet and legs.  The usual dosage requires two refills each month.  One refill costs $365.  Two come to $730 per month.  I just signed up for prescription drug insurance which kicks in Jan. 1, so I won't know until then if this medication is covered.But what happens to those who can not afford insurance.  Those like me who are on a fixed income.  I did the math, just to see how I would fare should my meds not be covered.  Figuring in rent, monthly bills, groceries and the meds I already take plus the new one, I would wind up in the hole each month by over $400.  One of my kids is facing a similar situation.  His insurance does not cover his latest prescription, which is necessary in a life sustaining way, that costs nearly $900. a month.  He doesn't qualify for his clinic's program of financial aid to those who need assistance because he has insurance.  But if he were uninsured, other medical bills would eat him alive and our government would fine him for being uninsured.  I don't know what the answer is.  I do know that if either of us is required to pay these outrageous prices, the only way we could afford to live is if we pitched a tent in the park and lived there.One the bright side, my apartment stays warm and cozy even on the coldest of days.  And I need not go outdoors unless I want to.  I don't.  There has been one casualty due to the cold.  My herbs that have been growing nicely on my windowsills have given up the ghost.  I didn't think there would be enough of a variance in temperature next to the windows to affect them.  I was wrong.  I seem to have, once again, murdered my plants.  I was, however, able to make use of them while they still lived.  Parsley, sage, thyme and basil lived long enough to let me experiment with cooking using the fresh herbs.  I will give them a decent burial and try again in the spring.  But next time I will move them to a warmer place when the snow starts to fly.There is a pot of vegetable beef soup simmering on the back burner.  I think a pan of cornbread will go well with it for supper.  Until then, there is a half read murder mystery book that needs my attention.  And a mug of hot chocolate - with mini marshmallows - is calling my name.   Not a bad way to spend a cold afternoon here in the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes,\" which is now the Land of 10,000 ice skating/hockey rinks."},

As the train went clattering by swaying like a boat in rough water, he noticed the protruding end of a small log on top of one of the approaching loads. Knowing the dangerous spot he was in he jumped back to safety just as the log rolled off, landed on the far end of the depot platform, skidded straight through the bay window and came to rest with one end protruding into the ladies’ waiting room.\"\"One day a woman showed up at the Blackduck depot where my brother Andrew was agent. She announced that she was going to Bemidji right now and would ride in the caboose of the freight train then about to leave. It being against company rules to permit a woman to ride a freight train she was told she would have to wait for the evening passenger train. No, she would not wait, she was going on this freight and there was nothing anybody could do about it. Suiting action to words she picked up her bundles and climbed onto the caboose. The conductor argued with her all to no avail. She was in the caboose and in the caboose she would stay until it got her to Bemidji. Andrew and the conductor withdrew for a consultation and finally came up with a solution. They went back to the caboose and told the lady that if she  would not get off it would be necessary to set the caboose out at Blackduck and take the train on to Bemidji and leave her just sitting there. Even that did not budge her, so the conductor in her presence told his brakemen, “Well boys, set the caboose in on the house track out of the way, cut it off and we will have to ride the engine and on top.” So they set the caboose in on the house track, uncoupled it and away they went with the rest of the train, down around the curve and out of sight. Just as the train was disappearing around the curve one of the brakemen dropped off where he could keep an eye on the depot. A little further on the train stopped. Soon the woman in the caboose seeing no more hopes of getting to Bemidji on the freight came out, clambered down the steps and went back up town. Andrew, watching proceedings, then went out on the platform and gave the distant brakeman a back up sign, he in turn relayed it to the engineer. The train backed up to the depot, coupled onto the caboose and away they went.\"Grandpa had a pretty good sense of humor, I'm thinking!My cousin Gene's wife wrote this piece about the Blackduck depot some years ago.  I don't know when the depot closed or even if it is still standing.  But her article talks some about my Grandpa and gives an idea of his duties as Depot Agent.\"Living History by

building.    In the early 1900's a man by the name of Andrew Paul came to Blackduck as the depot agent.  There were many jobs to keep him busy.  He was the telegrapher, the freight agent, the baggage handler.    There were four or five freight trains through town each day, and two passenger trains each direction.  Many days a train known as an extra would also come into town.    The first passenger train arrived in Blackduck from Minneapolis about 6:00 A.M.  It was known as #11.  The destination of this train was International Falls.  It turned around there and returned late in the afternoon.  Then it was known as #12.  The other passenger train was a local.  It started in Kelliher and went to Bemidji.  It got into Blackduck about 1:00 P.M. and went on to Bemidji, returning about 6:00 P.M. and on to Kelliher.    At the depot which was much larger then,--to the West there was a large waiting room, for ladies only.  Just off the office to the East was a general waiting room.  To get to the restrooms, you had to go outside and across the tracks to the little building there.  It was a single building with two doors, LADIES and GENTLEMEN, and it had a center partition.    On the days when the \"extra\" train would be on the track it could not interfere with the schedule of the regular trains so the extra would have to go onto a siding.  Some times these trains were so long they would hardly fit on the siding.  At times the depot agent would stand out between the two tracks to make sure the large trains had sufficient clearance, and sometimes this was only inches.    Messages were relayed by telegraph from station to station.  The depot agent would take these messages off the key, which was an apparatus which tapped out the message in Morse Code.  Some of these messages were of special freight shipments coming in, or a message to be relayed to the engineer of a train which was passing through without stopping.  At these times the message was written out and clipped to a wire hoop.  This hoop was placed on the end of a pole which the depot agent held up at the end of the platform.  The engineer would reach out the window and slip his arm through the hoop and after removing his message, would drop the hoop at the other end of the platform.  Telegrams of a personal nature were also transmitted on these keys.  Messages were taken by the agent, written up and after his day was done the agent would go out into the country to deliver a telegram.  After Mr. Paul had been here a few years a man was hired especially for telegraphy work.  This was Paul Whitney, who is well known in the area.    Depot is defined as a place of storage.  There were many things stored to be shipped out.  Great quantities of wool were shipped at times.  It was stored in huge long gunny sack bales until shipping time.  Years ago the fishermen who were visiting the area would bring in their catch of fish which were packed in crates of ice and shipped home, mostly to Iowa.  Pulpwood was a leading industry in the are in those days.  All of it was shipped out by rails on flat cars.  One of the timber buyers would come in and request the cars, it was always, \"Andrew, you got any flatracks?\"  The depot agent and several employees were responsible for loading much of the freight into the cars.    There were many types of cars, each with a special use.  There were the slatted cars known as stock cars.  They carried livestock to market, or they have been known to carry a load of watermelon.  Refrigerator cars were cooled by ice which was stored in a compartment at the front and back of the car.  A fan in the top of the car drew the cool air through the car to keep the fruit, vegetables, or meat from spoiling.  Each car had a number which indicated to the agent it's contents.    It is sad to see an era end.  It is sad to realize that many will never have the enjoyment of riding on a train, dining in the elegance of a dining car with the tables so beautiful with the snowy white linens, the shining silverware, and the sparkling glassware.  Those who have not had this opportunity have missed a memorable experience.    And now there it stands.  A small white deserted building.  Just a reminder of a part of history we lived with.\"I have seen old train depots turned into useful businesses.  Just two blocks from my apartment is a beautiful old brick depot that had been vacant for years.  Some enterprising local ladies renovated it and turned it into a beautiful quilt shop, while retaining the look and feel of the depot.  It is good to see those old buildings put to good use instead of being left to fall apart."},
{"title": "Canning Marathon", "date": "Saturday, December 10, 2016", "text": "This week found a couple of pretty good sales at my grocery.  My order included four family-size packs of chicken thighs and three boneless chuck roasts, weighing about 4 lbs. each.  I also ordered potatoes, carrots, onions and two 1 lb. bags each of corn and peas.The chicken went into a couple of stock pots and were boiled until they were falling-off-the-bone tender.  Once they cooled, I stripped the meat from the bones and chopped it into 1/2 - 1 inch pieces.   While the chicken cooked, I chopped the potatoes, carrots and onions into 1/2 inch pieces.  All the vegetables were put into a large bowl and mixed.I put 1/2 cup of chicken in the bottom of pint jars and added 1 cup of mixed vegetables to each.  I covered that with broth from cooking the chicken.  There wasn't enough broth, so I got three quarts from my shelves that I had canned last year, to finish filling the jars.  I pressure canned this at 10 lbs. pressure (for my altitude) for 75 minutes.  I wound up with 31 pints of chicken vegetable soup, having one jar that broke during the canning process. I had leftover vegetables, so I packed them into pint jars, added water to 1 inch below the rim and processed these for 55 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure.  When canning mixed vegetables, the vegetable that requires the longest processing time dictates how long to process.  In this case, the corn required the longest time.  I got 16 pints of mixed vegetables.The beef was cut into about 1 inch cubes and packed into jars.  When canning raw meat I don't add any liquid.  That is a personal preference.  Liquid, either water or broth, can be added.  I just like the taste and texture better when I can raw meat without.  If the meat is cooked before canning, then it is necessary to add liquid.  I got 10 pints of beef cubes from the three roasts.There was some chicken left over, so I packed it into 3 half pint jars and added broth.  The chicken was processed right along with the beef at 10 lbs. pressure for 75 minutes.  The smaller jars of chicken, when drained, make good sandwiches.I also got a dozen bell peppers that were on sale.  Those I cleaned and cut into about 1 inch pieces.  They went into the dehydrator.  I have found that the skin on bell peppers doesn't rehydrate well - it stays sort of tough.  So when dry, I will run the peppers through the food processor, turning them into powder.  I can add the powder to various dishes to have the flavor of the peppers without the bothersome tough skins.We have snow in the forecast for this evening and tomorrow.  I wanted to get this canning done before, even though the forecast is for only 4 to 6 inches of the white stuff.  But here in Minnesota, you never know.  This same forecast has brought only a few flakes or it has been known to bring a surprise blizzard.  Whatever happens, my canning this week is done and I can sit in my rocking chair by the window, coffee cup within reach, a good book in hand, and green fuzzy blanket snuggled up to my neck.  Do whatever you want, Mother Nature.  I'm ready.  :)"},

{"title": "Pride Goeth Before a Walker", "date": "Thursday, December 1, 2016", "text": "It is official.  I have attained geezer status.  The therapist I saw yesterday has ordered one of those handy, dandy walkers with four wheels that have a seat attached so I can sit if needed when I am out and about.  Well, crap!I have had a misplaced sense of pride in the fact that I could continue to function without the aid of a cane or crutches or a walker.  Well, stick that pride on the back shelf and leave it there.  My therapy session yesterday was good in that I learned more about dealing with the problem of swollen legs and feet and cellulitis outbreaks than I had learned in two years with my family doctor.  I have another session scheduled for next week to learn the exercises and other methods for reducing the swelling.But the blow to my pride came when, after extensive questioning, it became apparent that most of my mobility issues were due to osteoarthritis rather than the lower leg thing.  I have gotten to the point where standing for more than 10 minutes at a time has become painful.  This is not a problem within my apartment, but it is limiting when I go out.  Hence, the walker.This turn of events is really a blow to my pride and my desire for continued independence.  After thinking about it overnight, I have come to the conclusion that I have two choices.I can rant and rave and throw a hissy fit and blame the gods for visiting this misfortune on me.Or...I can suck it up and learn to use the damn walker and learn the other things necessary to keep me here at home. I have decided on the latter.  And with that in mind, I have spent the morning going through my apartment and making a list of those things that are now difficult for me and figuring out alternative ways to do them.Having a shower has been challenging.  By the time I finish washing my hair, my hip joints and lower back are screaming at me for relief.  I already have one of those hand held shower heads installed.  And I am ordering a stool designed for the bath so I can sit when necessary.I have always scrubbed my kitchen and bathroom floors on my hands and knees.  That is no longer happening.  So I am getting one of those janitorial type mops and buckets with the wringer attached.  Having spent several years cleaning office buildings, I am familiar with them and am confident they will work better for me than any other type of mop.  And I can attach one of those green scrubbies to that kind of mop for getting the stubborn dried on spills off the floors.I have already dealt with the problem of lugging laundry up and down two flights of stairs by investing in a portable apartment sized washer and dryer.  Both work like a charm.  But the dryer sits on the floor.  The controls are beneath the dryer door.  That means there is a lot of bending over to put clothes in and take clothes out and to push the buttons for the proper settings.  I found that several of the big box stores carry those storage cubes that when two of them are set side by side, the combined size is perfect to hold the dryer up off the floor, making its use much easier for me.  Plus it will give me a handy place to store laundry supplies.A simple thing like putting on socks can be difficult when a person doesn't bend so well any more.  Yesterday I was shown a device that I can slip a sock onto, slide my foot in, and using the handles on either side, pull the sock up.  I will be ordering one of those devices as well as some over-sized tongs for picking up things from the floor that are hard to reach.  In addition, any shoes I buy once I can wear shoes again, will be the slip-on variety.The purpose of this post is not to encourage sympathy.  I don't feel sorry for myself, so nobody else should even entertain the notion of feeling sorry for me.  I just won't have it.The purpose of this post is to encourage those who may be dealing with similar life-changing circumstances.  I really hate having to admit that I need a walker to be able to enjoy being outdoors again.  And I hate having to change the way I do things due to limitations.  But there it is.  Old age ain't no picnic.  Some sail through without having to deal with aches and pains and others don't.  For those that don't, we need to remember that even though there are adjustments to be made, life is still grand.  And well worth living.My youngest son, David, took me to my appointment yesterday.  On the way home I remarked to him that I had always said I wanted to live long enough to be a problem to my children and that I may have reached that goal.  (That has been a standing family joke for years.)  His response was that he didn't think we had reached that time just yet.  He said he didn't care how big a pain in the whatever I was, they still wanted me here with them.God bless those kids."},
{"title": "Kitchen Table Folks", "date": "Tuesday, November 29, 2016", "text": "Sometimes my mind starts to wander.  Often times these days it goes skipping on down Memory Lane.  This evening the memories were about kitchen tables.When I was a kid my Uncle Ronnie and Aunt Em were our only relatives who lived close by.  This was a time long before cell phones, when people went visiting instead of texting.  The kids would play games outdoors and the grown-ups would visit.  My aunt and uncle had a nice living room in their house.  My parents had a nice living room in their house.  But the place they all sat to talk to one another was at the kitchen table.My Grandma in northern Minnesota had a kitchen table next to the only window in her kitchen.  When we went to visit her, we sat around the kitchen table while she cooked on her big wood burning kitchen stove.  Often we would sit there peeling carrots or shelling peas for her.  She could always find a glass of milk, fresh from the cow, and a cookie or two for a granddaughter to consume at that table.Mother's friends would stop in now and then.  It wasn't unusual to find two or three neighbor ladies sitting at our kitchen table, drinking coffee and catching up on the neighborhood gossip.  And when Mother and her sisters gathered around the kitchen table, there was always a lot of laughter and a lot more \"Remember when...\"When I had a home of my own, life seemed to revolve around the kitchen table.  Friends would sit there for a game of cards.  Others might bring their kids over to play with mine, and there were always coffee and cookies or cake or donuts to go with good conversation at the kitchen table.  Homework was done at the kitchen table.  Letters to relatives were written there.  Pictures were drawn by children, books were read while drinking countless cups of coffee and checkbooks were balanced - all at the kitchen table.I am not a fancy person.  I am much more comfortable with a mug of coffee at the kitchen table than I am sitting in a living room chair trying to balance a cup and saucer on my knee.  I suppose that comes from having a long line of kitchen table folks in my family history.  So should you ever drop in for a visit, don't expect tea in china cups.  With saucers.  You will, however, usually find cookies in the cookie jar and will always find a steaming mug of coffee.  In my world, it doesn't get much better than that."},

I am still dealing with some problems with my legs.  I am not in pain and I can still get around ok.  But I seem to be unable to reduce the swelling in my legs and feet.  As a result, I will miss the big family Thanksgiving dinner at David's house.  A few days ago oldest son Duane asked what my plans for Thanksgiving were.  I told him I would be home as I didn't think it wise to go out in the ice and snow.  The swelling is such that I can't fit these fat feet into shoes.  He and Lori talked it over and decided to stay home, too, so I would not be alone for the holiday.  Duane is roasting the turkey and making a bowl of scalloped corn, a long time family tradition. I have several physical therapy sessions scheduled in the upcoming weeks.  The goal is to reduce the swelling so I can wear shoes again.  Minnesota is not a really good place to be in the winter if all you can get on your feet is socks.  :) So today I will be busy.  There are pumpkin pies to make and stuffing to assemble and dinner rolls to bake.  I think I enjoy the holiday preparations nearly as much as the holiday itself. This year has been one full of blessings.  I have so very much to be thankful for.  I have reached the ripe, old age of 70, still pretty much intact.  Unlike many, I have a warm place to live, plenty of food to eat and I am surrounded by family who go out of their way to see that my needs are taken care of.  Although my body gives out on me from time to time, my mind still works reasonably well and I am able to spend my days doing the things I love to do. And I am blessed with blogging friends who visit here.  Your comments bring me happiness and I am grateful for each of you.  I wish for all of my blog friends a truly wonderful Thanksgiving.  May God bless each and every one of you."},
{"title": "Smoothies", "date": "Monday, November 21, 2016", "text": "No, I am not talking about those green ones that are supposed to be full of healthy stuff.  I'm talking about the fun ones.I love ice cream.  When I was a kid, the best day of the month was the one where the Schwan's man showed up with a freezer truck full of ice cream.  We didn't get a lot of treats, but Dad always bought one of those big tins of ice cream.  We took turns ordering our favorite flavors.  I nearly always ordered Butter Brickle or Mint Chocolate Chip.  If we were feeling flush, there might be a box of fudgesicles, too.I can order ice cream when I order my groceries to be delivered.  But the folks who do the actual shopping work between 6 am and 8 am.  My groceries don't arrive at my apartment until between 1 pm and 3 pm.  I don't care how good the packaging is for frozen foods, ice cream partially melts before I get it.I thought about getting an ice cream maker, but my kitchen space is very limited.  And most ice cream recipes call for ingredients I don't keep on hand, like whipping cream. Then I found this recipe:Fruit Smoothies3 cups frozen fruit1 to 1/2 cups milk(add sugar to taste if desired)Blend in a blender until smooth.So last month I ordered a variety of fruits - strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and bananas.  I did sort of a mix-and-match thing and filled freezer bags with 3 cups of fruit in each.  Last week I gave it a try and made a batch of strawberry, blueberry and raspberry.  Last evening I whipped up some strawberry and banana.  Both were delicious.The mixture turned out kind of like a cross between a fruity soft serve ice cream and a sherbet.  The recipe makes enough for two big bowls, so I just put the second half in a freezer container and froze it for later.  It isn't rich and creamy like real ice cream, but it is close enough to satisfy that ice cream craving.I love it when an experiment actually works.  :)"},

So today there is a crock pot full of apple butter cooking down and a stock pot on the back burner doing the same thing.  The other back burner holds a simmering pot of vegetable beef soup made with my canned beef and dried vegetables.  There are little granny squares of yarn to be crocheted for an afghan and quilt pieces to be sewn together.  There is music to be heard and appreciated.  There is probably a nap or two to be taken in my recliner, covered by my warm, green, fuzzy blanket.So world, you go right ahead and stomp your feet and throw your tantrum.  Today I don't care.  Today is for me."},

Morton's Tender Quick Cure SaltMix all the ingredients together.  Roll into firm rolls.  Wrap in foil with the shiny side out.  Refrigerate for 24 hours.  Punch holes in the bottoms of the rolls with a fork.  Place the rolls on a rack in a baking pan.  Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 35 minutes.Salami2 lbs. hamburger3 Tbsp. Morton's Tender Quick Cure Salt1 tsp. pepper1/4 tsp. mustard seed1/8 tsp. garlic salt1/4 tsp. peppercorns1 cup waterMix all ingredients thoroughly and form rolls.  Wrap the rolls in aluminum foil.  Refrigerate for 24 hours.  Place rolls in a Dutch oven, cover with water and bring to a boil.  Gently boil for 1 hour.  Drain and rewrap.If memory serves, I made 3 rolls out of one batch of either meat. These sandwich meats are not going to taste exactly like store bought summer sausage or salami.  But they will make some seriously good sandwiches.  And both freeze well.  I'm going to order some hamburger on my grocery order in two weeks, and get some Tender Quick.  I think I have everything else on hand.  Sure beats that packaged stuff at the store."},

I'm adding another row of sage green hexagons around each of these blocks.  The quilt has sort of an old fashioned look to it and I like that.  If I remember right, the quilt is done in rows of seven blocks each, making it seven rows wide and seven rows long, equaling about a 75 inch square quilt.  I'll post a picture of the finished quilt, if I ever get done with it.Sewing on my quilt - listening to some audio murder mystery books I downloaded - might turn out to be a good day after all."},

There was a very loud knock on my door.  When I answered, I found a well dressed woman standing there with a brochure in one hand and a clip board in the other.  She wanted me to look at her brochure and fill out a form.I just glanced at the brochure and remember it had something to do with drugs - perhaps drug usage in my town - I'm not really sure, for at that point I told her I was not the least bit interested.  She tried to get me to take the brochure and I refused.Then she wanted me to fill out her form, which I refused to do as well.  She was persistent, telling me I only had to fill in my name and address and phone number.  I made it perfectly clear that I would not give out any personal information, especially to people I did not know who came knocking on my door on a Sunday afternoon.  She didn't want to take \"No\" for an answer, so I finally just shut the door and locked it.Maybe I am just paranoid.  Maybe there was a legitimate reason for her calling on me.  But it just seemed strange that she knocked on my door on a Sunday afternoon rather than on a regular work day.  And the fact that she was so determined to get my personal information sent up a red flag.  The whole incident smelled like a scam to me.Anyone can go get brochures printed that look like legitimate worthy causes.  And the main goal seemed to be to procure my signature.  We are close to election day.  I have read about scams that involve getting signatures to be used in voter frauds.  Whether that was the reason for this visit, I can not say.  But I still will never give out information to strangers.  Just sayin'."},

There are several Russian families living there, most of them elderly.  Five of the ladies can be seen walking together when the weather is nice for walking.  They walk slowly so the one who uses a walker can keep up.  They all wear dark colored dresses and sensible shoes.  And each of them wears a brightly colored head scarf that is tied under the chin.  Which is why I fondly refer to them as \"The Babushkas.\"These sweet little ladies try really hard to converse in English.  But when they are talking to one another, it is always in Russian.  I think it probably is not easy to learn another language at their age.  They are so friendly that it is easy to take the time to listen and attempt to understand their broken English.  Their smiles will light up a dreary day.The Babushkas are an industrious group.  I have seen them working the soil in those narrow strips of grass, turning them into little gardens.  With spades and rakes, the four who are mobile get the soil ready in the spring.  The one with the walker supervises.  They plant all sorts of flowers next to the sidewalk - daisies, marigolds, zinnias.Behind the flowers they plant tomatoes, peppers, beets, green beans and cabbage.  I have often seen them out there tending their little gardens.  They are happy to show anyone who is interested what they are growing.  They once tried to teach me the Russian names for the plants, but I didn't do too well remembering them.  My efforts at wrapping my tongue round the Russian words made them laugh, so it was fun, just the trying to say them.I read an article not too long ago about another group of immigrants living not very far from here.  That group had several among them convicted of terrorist activities.  The families of the convicted were loudly protesting.  They were shouting about how unfair they felt American justice was.  Threats and demands abounded.I think we could use more Babushkas."},

America was battered.  America was bruised.  But America was by no means defeated.  Three firemen raised our flag at Ground Zero.  And we as a people came together.  Race didn't matter.  Religion didn't matter.  Social standing didn't matter.  We were Americans, one and all.Today we remember.  We remember the mind numbing pictures of destruction.  We remember those whose lives were taken.  We remember the heroes of that day.  And we remember who caused this tragedy.But most of all, we need to remember that we can come together as a nation.  As a people who love our country and who love our flag and all it stands for.  And we need to do so again."},

By the way, my bread machine works like a charm.  I have made three loaves so far...one for me and one for each of my boys.  The bread is delicious.  Oldest Son says it makes really, really good French toast.  Sometime today I will make another loaf for myself and maybe a couple of batches of cinnamon rolls.  I haven't used the baking feature, but am using the dough feature, putting the dough into pans and baking it in my oven.  Bread making has never been easier.  I just layer the ingredients, liquids first and then the dry ingredients with the flour on top and the yeast last.  Wish I had thought to invest in one of these machines years ago.  I didn't, but I am thoroughly enjoying it now!Note to Chickenmom who wanted recipes:  I just used the basic white bread recipe that came with the machine, but I am sure any yeast bread or roll recipe will work just fine.  The instructions call for bread flour and bread yeast, but I just use all-purpose flour and regular dry yeast because that is what I have on hand.  Didn't seem to make any difference because the loaves raised nicely, baked just fine and were tasty."},

So after one more cup of coffee, just to get my heart kick started, I am off to the kitchen to do a test run with the bread machine and to get going on turning crab apples into juice for jelly.  Looks like a busy day ahead of me.  :)"},

Boston's first competition in 2010.April 2016 competition.That she is so excited about her dancing and the new things she is learning tells me that the right choice was made when she and her parents made the decision to switch studios.Boston went on to tell me that her sister Maddie was busy with her gymnastics classes and her brother Jacob had finished flag football for the summer and was starting practice for \"real\" tackle football.\"I was just so excited about my solo that I had to call and tell you about it, Grandma.\"I'm so glad you did, Boston.  You made my day!Love, GrandmaThis is a quiet time of year for me.  The fall produce at the Farmer's Market - cabbage, apples, and squash - aren't quite ready, so my canning and dehydrating has slowed down until probably mid-September.  I did order 10 lbs of onions that are on sale, so Thursday I will get them to drying.  I seem to go through more onions than anything else.This summer has been a stinker for arthritis flare-ups.  One would think that our bitter winters would be a worse time, but the opposite is true.  Maybe it is the humidity.  I don't know.  At any rate,  we are having a bit of a cool down, with temps in the mid to high 70's, and that has helped.  I have an appointment with my Dr. next week.  They won't write refill prescriptions unless you show up and donate some blood to test so they can tell you nothing has changed.  I wish it was like it used to be.  We went to the Dr. when we got sick.  Instead we are being held hostage to our need for refills.  Sigh.Has anyone but me noticed that Doctors seem to want to just throw another prescription drug at you instead of discussing alternatives for a problem?  I am up to four different pills every day, most of which I think are unnecessary.  I have been reading about an herb called Moringa that is good for everything I am taking meds for at the moment.  Including arthritis.  It is readily available like over-the-counter vitamins.  Has anyone ever tried this herb?  I am thinking of giving it a try.  I would much rather go with an herbal remedy than prescription drugs.  Especially when there are no known side effects.  Ever read those reports that come with each prescription drug?  There are more side effect warnings than information on the benefits of them.  That alone seems to be a good reason to go with an alternative.I'm excited.  I have been thinking about getting a bread machine.  I already have a Kitchen Aid mixer, but my counter space is so small that it isn't practical to leave it out.  It is too heavy to live on top of my freezer, which is the only space available.  But a bread machine could sit there, no problem.  And with my limitations, kneading bread is becoming difficult.  Seemed like a good solution for someone who prefers homemade bread to store bought.Anyway, I mentioned this to my son's friend the other day when she dropped by for a visit.  She told me that her Dad was in the process of downsizing and she was sure he had one he was going to put on his upcoming garage sale.  A phone call confirmed this.  The machine is like new, having been used only a couple of times.  Son and his friend are going to see him this coming weekend where he lives in the northern part of the state.  They will check out the machine to make sure all the parts are there and that it works.  So with any kind of luck, I will be baking bread Monday.  Woo Hoo!!Takes very little to make me a happy camper.  :)"},

{"title": "Note on Mixed Vegetables and a Mini Rant", "date": "Wednesday, August 3, 2016", "text": "I decided to can the rest of the frozen mixed vegetables.  When all was said and done, the 24 lbs. yielded 23 half pints and 32 pints.  With what I had left on the shelf, that will do for now.This evening I was looking through the grocery delivery catalog.  Each page in the catalog has two columns.  There is one column devoted to just cookies and another for candy.  Nearly an entire page listed the frozen meals and entrees.  And about a column and a half for canned soups.  Same for boxed foods like mac and cheese or scalloped potato mixes.  And nearly an entire page for soda pop and bottled energy drinks.  But there was less than a column for fresh vegetables, the same for fresh fruit and only 10 items listed for fish, and most of them were the frozen kind where there is more batter than meat.This service is for Seniors.  I was told that the catalog was put together going by what people had ordered in the past.  I am surprised that more of my vintage don't cook from scratch.  We are retired.  We have the time.  And most of us were raised by mothers who made nearly everything from scratch.  Many of us gardened or had parents who raised vegetables.  When I was growing up, small family farms dotted the countryside.  Folks raised chickens and hogs and had a milk cow or two and raised one or two steers for butchering.  Unless your Mama was a really bad cook, the food we ate was good tasting and healthy.I wonder what happened.  I know that there are some who just don't like to cook.  I have days like that myself, especially if I am busy.  But truth be known, I would much rather eat my homemade baking powder biscuits than those that come in a cardboard tube from the store, even if it does take a little time and effort to make them.  Same with homemade bread.  And homemade soup that simmers all day on the back burner rather than just opening a can and heating that up.I don't know.  Maybe I should have been born into my grandparents generation.  Sometimes I don't think I fit too well in this one.I think I told you a while back about the changes in my grocery delivery service.   They have put out a catalog and I can only order what is included in it.  While it is substantial, that means if a specific item is on sale but not in the catalog, I can not order the sale item.  Much of what I normally order is included, but there are items I can no longer have delivered.This week, for instance, two pound bags of frozen vegetables are on sale.  Unfortunately, the catalog lists only one pound bags.  And that is where an angel of mercy came to my rescue.  Oldest Son's friend who lives with him now, said she would not mind a bit going to the store to get the sale items I can no longer order.  So this morning I tossed some cash and a list in her direction and off she went.She brought me 24 lbs. of mixed vegetables and 12 lbs. of green beans, along with a couple other small items.  When she brought them to me, it was then I realized I had not taken the weight of the vegetables into consideration.  There she was, poor girl, outside my door, all knackered out from lugging them up the stairs.  And she was still cheerful, bless her heart.The green beans are in the dehydrators.  12 lbs. of mixed vegetables are in my big stock pot on the stove, thawing out and heating up.  As soon as I see how many pints I get out of that, I'll decide whether to can the other 12 lbs. or dehydrate them.I know that for gardeners, it must seem like a sacrilege to be canning frozen vegetables.  I would prefer canning fresh from the garden as well.  But if I want my shelves of home canned foods to be full, I will do whatever is necessary to achieve that goal.  And should the time come when store shelves are empty, I doubt anyone will care about whether the vegetables started out as garden fresh or frozen.  I would think they would be happy to have food to eat when others do not, no matter what the source."},

{"title": "About the time I'm feeling grumpy...", "date": "Thursday, July 28, 2016", "text": "my kids make me smile.Youngest Son called this afternoon.   Their family Beagle had passed on earlier this year and they all are ready for another dog.  He had found a rescue group that had puppies so he had filled out the paperwork and sent in the processing fee.  He said he liked this particular group because they put their rescues into foster homes rather than keeping them penned up.  There was a little Corgi cross puppy there and Son wanted to know if I knew anything about the breed.   Sadly, I know nothing.  He wanted me to go online and take a look at the picture of the pup, so I did.  Cuter than a bug's ear, he is.  I don't know if this is the one they will get, but puppies always make me smile.Then this afternoon Oldest Son stopped by to bring me my mail.  And a slice of rhubarb pie.  It took every ounce of willpower I had to wait until after supper to eat it.  I don't think I have had rhubarb pie since I was a kid.  Sure brought back memories of the pies Mother made.  It was worth the wait.I guess it doesn't take much to un-grump me.....a puppy picture and a piece of pie.  It's more than that, though.   Youngest Son was telling me about an incident with one of the landscaping crews he manages.  They noticed something wrong at one of the townhouse complexes where they were working on the shrubs around the home.  I won't go into detail here, but it was unusual enough so that one of the crew called the police.  Turns out the old man who lived in that townhouse had died maybe a month earlier.  Nobody knew and apparently nobody missed him. I don't see or talk to my kids every day.  They all are working and they all are busy with their own lives.  But it is reassuring to know that not more than a day or so would go by before one of them would check to see why I didn't answer my phone.  And that knowledge tends to make a case of the grumpies disappear probably quicker than puppies or rhubarb pie do.  :)"},
{"title": "Mushy Pears", "date": "Wednesday, July 27, 2016", "text": "The summer of 2012 I canned what seemed like a truck load of pears.  I ate canned pears.  My kids ate canned pears.  I made cakes and muffins and cobblers using pears.  They were delicious.Then sometime within the past year the pears turned soft in the jars.  They were still good.  The seals on the lids were intact.  But the fruit had softened enough so I wasn't overjoyed with the texture.  I like a bit more firmness in canned pears.So what do you do with 16 pints of soft pears.  I am too frugal (read cheap) to just toss them out.  I thought about making pear butter, but my supply of canning jars is dwindling and I still have several foods left to can before winter sets in, so I kept looking for ideas.  Then I found a couple of videos showing how to make fruit rollups from canned fruit. I have 5 fruit rollup inserts for my dehydrator trays and even though I had never made rollups before, I decided to give it a go.I opened all the jars and drained off the liquid.  I had 4 pints of canned peaches left that had been canned about the same time as the pears, so I drained them as well, rinsing the fruit with water to wash off most of the sugar/water syrup they had been canned in, making them less sticky.  I ran the fruit through my blender to make a puree and filled 5 trays.  Each tray holds two cups of fruit puree.  I still have two quarts of puree in the fridge to dehydrate tomorrow.The fruit is drying nicely, but it is taking longer to dehydrate than expected.  I suppose that may be due to the high humidity in the air right now.  I will just turn the temperature down from 130 degrees to 100 degrees and let the fruit dry overnight.   The plan is to wrap the dried fruit rollups in waxed paper.  I will save out a few pieces for snacking and freeze the rest.  I think the pear rollups will make a nice evening snack for me or a tasty, healthy treat for the Grands.I read somewhere that about 40 % of the food in the US is wasted.  I grew up in a frugal family.  We wasted very little.  We couldn't afford to just toss out leftovers.  I will admit that once in a while a container of food will get shoved to the back of my fridge where it winds up looking like a science experiment run amok, but I try really hard to use up everything I cook.  I'm glad I was able to find a good use for those pears.  And there is the added bonus of having another 20 empty pint jars now to fill with something else.   I'm thinking a big pot of chili might be good."},

Those people are volunteers and without them it would be tough for me to grocery shop these days.  I order what I need, but I also try to keep in mind the fact that hauling boxes of groceries up the stairs, especially when it is hot and humid, is no picnic.I don't know why this happens, but it seems when the outside temps and humidity are high, it affects my arthritic joints even though my apartment is air conditioned.  So early this morning I finished the few household chores that needed my attention.  My crockpot is getting a workout this week.  It is the best way to cook without heating up the kitchen.  Last night was chicken breast.  Today there is a pot of vegetable beef soup simmering all day.  I may toss in some dumplings close to supper time.  Anything else requiring using my stove or oven will just have to wait until it cools down some.So I think I will find a couple of movies to watch on YouTube.  I saw a pattern for a crocheted afghan that is made of 2 1/2 inch Granny Squares in all sorts of colors, kind of like a scrap quilt, and I started working on that a couple of weeks ago, using the leftover yarn from other projects.  If I sit and make some more squares I can fool myself into thinking I didn't waste an entire day.  :)"},
{"title": "Sometimes...", "date": "Monday, July 18, 2016", "text": "you get more than you bargained for.My cleaning and decluttering frenzy had some unexpected results.  When I get busy canning I sometimes just stick the jars of food on my shelves willy nilly just to get them out of the way.  The shelves are now nicely organized.  I found that I have one entire shelf ( 48 inches long by 18 inches deep) of just chicken.  Either I am the poster child for buying chicken on sale or my memory has deteriorated to the point where I don't remember just how much chicken I have canned.  Anyway, I have left open spaces to fill in the foods I am getting low on.  But basically both shelving units (same size shelves, six per unit) are full.And the jams and jellies are in another cupboard.And I haven't canned pickles yet.  Or cheese sauce.  Or soup.  Or chili.I gotta buy another shelving unit.  I found one that is the same brand as the two I already have.  It is 36 inches long with the shelves at 18 inches deep.  I think it will fit in a corner of my living room.  I can hang a quilt on it for camouflage.    Oldest Son said he would pick it up for me and help me put it together.  We are supposed to get hot and humid weather starting tomorrow, so I think I will wait until it cools down some.  I don't like to can when it is so hot.  It doesn't take much to make this little apartment steamy.  And Son is no spring chicken any more.  Huffing 75 lbs. of shelving in a box up the stairs will be a bit easier if the stairway isn't over 90 degrees warm.I am not complaining, mind you.  I am delighted to have my shelves overflowing with canned food.  I use it on a regular basis.  When the weather is hot like this, it is nice to be able to open a jar of soup, heat it up in the microwave and keep the apartment cool.  Other times I always have the makings of a meal just by opening a jar or two.  That's what my parents and grandparents did.  I think they were on to something.  :)"},

There are several Farmer's Markets in our area, but the one we like is in St. Paul.  They have a website that includes a list of the produce and dates when it is available, so we are checking that weekly to make sure we are able to get what we need.  By the end of the season I hope to have everything I need canned, dried and on the shelves. I haven't had a chance to try out my washer and dryer as yet.  That will just have to wait until preserving the food I have here right now is completed.  It just seems to me that things are sliding downhill a bit faster now.  I am not in panic mode, but I do think it would be foolish let an opportunity go by to add to my food storage. So I am off to the kitchen to hull some strawberries in preparation for another canning session tomorrow morning.  I think I will take my laptop with me and listen to an audio book while working.  Cleaning berries and a good murder mystery.  What a combination!"},

{"title": "So last evening...", "date": "Tuesday, June 21, 2016", "text": "the fellow who calls me for my grocery order was telling me about some changes in the way their organization does things.  Instead of the order takers having to sift through the entire inventory of the big box store to find one item, they are issuing a catalog listing the products available for ordering.  While that may limit some of my selections, it will make it easier and faster to place an order.  I am not concerned.  Oldest Son calls me maybe once a week while on his way home from work to see if I need anything, so if I can't order something I want, I'm pretty certain he will pick up anything I need.Normally I place a grocery order every two weeks, but what with getting the order taker's computers changed over to the new catalog program and getting a new delivery schedule set up, it will be one month before I order groceries again.   Chuck (my order taker) wanted to know if the delay would be a problem for me, and then he started to laugh.  When I asked him what was so funny, he replied that he had been taking my grocery orders for quite some time now and he knew my grocery buying habits.  He said he was pretty sure that my pantry was well stocked enough to see me through longer than just a month.  He told me that he had changed the way he and his wife shop largely because of our conversations about the way I shop for groceries.  It is gratifying to know that there are still folks out there who can see the benefits of a deep pantry.The new schedule will give me a new order taker.  I am going to miss talking with Chuck every other Monday evening.  I know the sound of his wife's voice from hearing her in the background.  I know that his little dog waits until he is on the phone before barking at squirrels outside their window.  He has asked me how to can hamburger and I now have his recipe for sour dough starter.  He left messages of concern when I didn't answer my phone while I was in the hospital.  I worried about him when I found out he had a broken hip after a fall on the ice.It is reassuring to know there are still good people out there in the midst of all the hate and discontent and insanity surrounding us.  It is possible to develop friendships with folks you haven't met in person.Kind of like those I have met right here on this silly little blog.I had planted herb seeds in starter pots.  They all came up.  Looked so pretty and green.  When they were big enough I transplanted them into larger pots and set them on my window sills.  At which point most of them just laid down and died.I can grow just about anything in a garden.  But I'll be darned if I can keep a plant alive indoors.  I baby them.  I am careful not to over water them or under water them.  I even talk to them.  Tell them how pretty they are.  Doesn't matter.  They just won't grow for me.There are a few stragglers left and they look pretty sad.  So I'm going to give it one more try and plant the rest of my seeds directly in the larger pots.  And if that doesn't work I will just pack up the whole kit and kaboodle until next spring when I will buy starter plants.Sigh."},

I am finished with the dehydrating of vegetables from my last grocery delivery.  Everything turned out just fine, but I wasn't thrilled with the dried grapes.  They were kind of a sticky mess.  Others have had good results with drying grapes, but I don't think I will mess with it again.  While sorting out my closet pantry I found 10 of the large cans of diced tomatoes (not the # 10 cans, but the ones that are bigger than a regular can).  Because storage space is at a premium I drained the tomatoes and dehydrated them.  They dried down to fit in a quart sized freezer bag.  Draining them gave me three quarts of tomato juice.  I am drinking one of them and froze the other two to use in soup.I was thinking about using the four large drawers in the base of my new bed for fabric and yarn storage.  But while going through my pantry I realized that boxed mixes I have bought on sale were taking up room that could be better used for other things.  And yes, I buy mixes from time to time when the prices are really good.  I have cake and brownie mixes, scalloped potato mixes and (God forgive me) hamburger helper mixes.  There are also flavored rice sides and muffin mixes.  I know all the reasons for avoiding boxed mixes and for cooking from scratch.  And most times I do.  But sometimes, especially when the aging process has thrown me a curve and made it difficult to stand for long periods of time while cooking and baking, a mix that I can just stir together and pop into the oven just makes life a little easier.So I opened all of the boxed mixes, stapled the sauce mix bag, included with some like the scalloped potatoes, to the main ingredient bag, cut the instructions from each box and stapled that on as well, and packed them into gallon zip lock bags.  I wound up with two of the drawers full, freeing up pantry space and leaving me two more drawers to fill.  I was surprised at how much space those original cardboard boxes took up when stacked in the pantry.I spent some time making out my grocery order that will be delivered Wednesday.  My store has carrots on sale for 99 cents per 2 lb. bag, so I am ordering 20 lbs. to dehydrate.  They have boneless country style ribs on sale in the family pack size, so I have 4 of those coming, which I think I will can in large pieces using quart jars.  They can be used like a pork roast or maybe with barbecue sauce along with a vegetable and cornbread for a meal for two or three people.  Hamburger is on sale and while it isn't much of a sale, it is still a savings of a dollar a pound over the regular price, so I will can the 18 pounds ordered.  Whole chickens are going for 99 cents a pound so I am getting four.  I have one whole chicken left in the freezer and I think I will toss it into the crock pot tomorrow.  I really won't want to run my oven when it is so hot out.I have been trying to get caught up with the odds and ends here.  Oldest Son is making noises about a Farmer's Market run soon.  I checked out their website and they have strawberries now.  I need to make some jam and I would like to can some in syrup to use as ice cream topping or for things like strawberry shortcake in the winter months when fresh strawberries are really spendy. I'm thinking that retirement for me has nothing to do with sandy beaches and drinks with little umbrellas in them.  I guess I would rather spend my time making sure my family is fed.  And considering the insanity of the world around me, that seems to be a pretty good choice."},

About two-thirds of the way was the small town of Motley.  Motley was the home of Morey's Fish Company.  Morey's specialty is smoked fish.  Usually when we would head for the cabin with the kids, we would stop at Morey's for some smoked whitefish, which is a particular favorite treat for me.  I can buy Morey's smoked fish in my local grocery, but it just isn't the same as a smoked whitefish direct from Morey's, wrapped in white butcher paper.  Morey's has grown from its humble beginnings in 1934 to a major seafood plant today.  The quality of their products remain the best ever and the fish tastes just as good as it did back in the early 1970's when we would buy some on our way to the lake.Photos from Morey's website.This morning I woke to find that someone had sneaked a smoked whitefish, wrapped in white butcher paper, into my refrigerator.  Half of it is already gone.  It was really good for breakfast.  I'm saving the rest for a treat this evening.Oldest Son and his friend Lori had taken a road trip to Bemidji and stopped at Morey's on the way home.

I had ordered red seedless grapes that were on sale to experiment with dehydrating them.  Some folks dry grapes to make their own raisins, but this doesn't appeal to me.  Maybe if I grew my own grapes it might be cost effective, but using grapes bought by the pound at the grocery makes for some expensive raisins.  I had seen a video about dehydrating grapes as a kind of snack food like other dried fruit, so I filled half of a tray with grapes, cut in half to speed up the drying process, as a test.  I'll let you know how they turn out.The rest of the afternoon I washed and chopped and diced until the tomatoes and celery were ready to be dried as soon as the slaw mix is done.  Chopped onions can smell up the fridge even if stored in freezer bags, so they will wait until I am ready to dehydrate them.  Both dehydrators will be running until all of it is dried.  I was really lucky this week in that there were so many vegetables on sale that can be dehydrated.Yesterday was a fun day for me.  It was my birthday.  I don't do birthday parties or celebrations for myself any more.  I figure that after 70 of them, I have done enough celebrating over the years.  So I spent the day just puttering about with a little reading and a little sewing and a little napping.  All my kids checked in with birthday wishes.  Late in the morning Oldest Son and his lovely friend had run a couple of errands for me and they stopped by afterward with a pretty card and a cake, which we shared.  Later Oldest Daughter and my Grandson surprised me with a couple of house plants in a cute tin container.  She knows that I tend to kill flowering house plants, so she chose plants that have a fighting chance of survival.  I will do my level best not to murder them.Youngest Daughter had sent me birthday greetings earlier in the day, and early evening I answered the phone to hear a rousing rendition of \"Happy Birthday to You\" sung by Youngest Son and his offspring.  They were on their way home from Jacob's baseball game.  His team of 2nd grade aged kids had just won their third game in a row.  Woo Hoo - Go Jacob!  They said they had a Dairy Queen treat after the game, in my honor.  (That's an inside joke.  In this family most events, large or small or even made up, are celebrated with a treat at the local Dairy Queen.)I had a nice surprise later in the evening when my sister called.  She sang \"Happy Birthday\" to me as well and afterward we both decided we had inherited our singing abilities from our Dad, who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket!  We got caught up on all the family doings and it was fun talking with her.While talking to my Grands, one of them asked me how I liked being 70.  After thinking about it for a few seconds, I told her that I liked it.  Even though my body seems to be coming apart at the seams sometimes, for the most part I don't feel any different than I did 30 years ago.  Any day I wake up in the morning is a bonus.  Although there might be those who disagree, my mind still seems to be working fairly well.  I am not able to physically do some things I might like to do, but I can still do many things that make me happy and keep me busy.  I have family close by and that makes me happiest of all.  So all things considered, 70 is a pretty good thing to be.  :)"},

{"title": "Down Time", "date": "Thursday, June 2, 2016", "text": "The past few days have been spent napping and reading and grumbling to myself.  I have had the flu.  Not the influenza kind of flu, which is more a respiratory kind of thing, but the flu, which is what we call anything else that causes us to feel like crud.  The rumbly tummy, can't get warm even when wrapped in a large, green fuzzy blanket, no appetite - that kind of flu.When forced to be still, my mind wanders.  Well, it wanders anyway, but more than usual in times like this.  At one point I was thinking about my childhood and comparing it to that of my youngest grands.  They are active children, but their activities seem to be more structured.  I wondered if they had ever played Anti-I-Over with the neighborhood kids, or Fox and Geese or Duck, Duck, Gray Duck or Simon Says or Hopscotch.  Or if they had even heard of those games that were so common to my generation.I'm pretty sure that, after their chores were done, they haven't been turned loose on a summer morning to play with friends with instructions from Mother to be home in time for supper.  If we didn't show up for lunch, it was OK because sometimes another mother would provide a stack of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and a jug of Kool Aid, and sometimes my mother would provide lunch for the neighbor kids and me.When we were old enough for bikes, our horizons expanded.  We could ride to the local elementary school and play on the swings and slide and teeter-totters.  Or we could have bike races in the alley behind our houses.  Or we could ride about a mile or so to the woods where forts were built, cowboys fought the Indians and where Hide and Seek was much more fun than played indoors.Lest you think we were just a bunch of rowdy kids, I am here to tell you that there were rules.  \"Stay away from the railroad tracks.  That's where the bums hang out,\" or \"Mrs. Jones says no more crab apple fights in her orchard.  She needs the rest of the apples for jelly,\" or \"If you run through Mrs. Brown's garden again and trample her green beans, she will make you work all day, replanting and pulling weeds.\"  And she would.  With the blessings of our parents. One evening while reading one of my favorite murder mysteries, I heard voices from the street below.  The bicycle shop beneath my apartment has set out a nice metal table with four chairs for the use of its patrons.  At night, in the warmer months of the year, the bar patrons from next door make use of them.  Most times I just tune out the voices unless the conversations are amusing to me.  But the conversation that evening caught my attention.  Every other sentence contained words that would have brought out a bar of Ivory Soap to be used by parents for washing out the mouth of the offending child.  I realized that the ongoing conversation below was not unusual, but was the norm.  Nobody was angry - nobody was fighting.  Nobody was slurring words as if too many beers had been consumed.  It was just a regular conversation between friends.  I am not so naive as to believe that my own children and grands never say these words, but they have enough class not to utter them within my hearing.  When did language like that become acceptable in public places.  I think it boils down to respect - for ones self and for others.  Respect seems to be in short supply these days.I wonder how many of my vintage collected a weekly allowance.  Not I, she said.  If there was a toy or an article of clothing we just couldn't live without, we either pestered our parents until they gave in, or we saved for it, which was the usual procedure.  Pestering usually gained us time weeding the garden while pondering the error of our ways.  Sometimes grandparents or favorite aunt would put a dollar or two in a birthday card.  Once in a while a grandparent would sneak us a half dollar just for the fun of it.  Money could be earned by babysitting or mowing lawns or shoveling snow from sidewalks.  All of this hard earned cash was put into the Piggy Bank until enough had been saved to buy the object of our desires.  But an allowance for doing household chores?  Didn't happen.  We were told that we had a roof over our heads, food for our stomachs and clothes for our backs.  And as members of our family we were expected to pitch in and do our share.  But get paid for washing the supper dishes - nope.Well, today I am feeling much better.  Dirty dishes that were neglected for a couple of days have been washed.  A couple of soft boiled eggs and toast have been consumed for breakfast.  The better part of a pot of coffee has been drunk.  There are just a couple of small chores that require my attention, but not enough to cause a relapse.  Kids have been checking up on Mom - some who live farther away, by phone.  Oldest Son, who lives next door, brought me my mail and hauled out the trash.  He thinks I don't know he shows up every other day or so to do these things so he can check up on me, but I have figured that out. It is odd where a wandering mind can travel when the body is forced to spend time quietly.  I can only wonder what paths it will take the next time."},

Some came home to their families.  Some came home in boxes.  Some never came home at all. They all have more than earned our respect and gratitude.  And they all deserve to be remembered not only on this day, but every day."},

{"title": "So Far - So Good", "date": "Monday, May 23, 2016", "text": "After a weekend spent doing my best impression of a vegetable, my legs are feeling better.  I will ask Oldest Son to help me change the bandages tomorrow.  I am using the same method used by the home care people last year.  They came here once a week after I got out of the hospital, changed the bandages and re-bandaged with non-stick pads smeared with an antibiotic salve.  But instead of wrapping my legs in gauze and Ace bandages like they did, I use the compression socks to keep the pads in place.   It just takes more than my two hands to accomplish this and Son has been really good to help, bless him.Youngest Son called me a few days ago.  He tends to call when he is either taking a kid to an activity or when he is on his way to pick them up.  He has a speaker phone thingy in his truck, so sometimes I talk with him and sometimes I talk with the grands.  I love the way they stay in touch.Anyway, I asked him to do me a favor.  He is my only kid with a truck, so I wanted to know if he could pick up a new single sized bed for me.   He said he could, but he had a better idea.  He said that he and his wife were going to be getting a new bed for my grandson.  He said I could have the old bed if I wanted it.  The mattress is nearly new and it is the size I wanted.  There is a bonus of four drawers and a cubby in the base of the bed, which will give me more storage space.  I offered to buy the bed from him, but he wouldn't hear of it.  Bless him, too!Oldest Son brought me some herb seeds.  I have basil, cilantro, thyme, parsley, oregano and sage.  That's a pretty good start on my little window sill herb garden.  After lunch I will get them planted in the starter pots and see if I can actually get them to grow. I'm also working on sorting out my dehydrated foods.  I package them in freezer bags and store them in banker's boxes on shelves.  That keeps them out of the light.  I have used vegetables stored that way that were 5 or 6 years old and they were just fine.  But I got lazy and haven't put the latest dried food in their proper boxes, so that is my project for the rest of the day.  Once that's done, I will know for sure what I have and what I need to dehydrate.And that is the extent of the excitement here in my little corner of the world.  :)"},

{"title": "Up To My Elbows in Chicken and Corn", "date": "Thursday, May 12, 2016", "text": "I was getting a little bit low on jars of sweet corn and frozen corn was on sale this week.  There was a bit of a glitch in my order and I got only 6 lbs. of corn rather than the 10 I ordered.  No big thing.  It happens once in a great while.  I won't complain.  My groceries are delivered.  I no longer need to spend an hour on the bus to go grocery shopping or to haul the food up the stairs.  I'm happy. As soon as my order arrived on Wednesday afternoon, I put the corn into a stock pot, added enough hot water to cover and set it on the stove.  I didn't want to cook it - just thaw it out and heat it up.  That done, I filled jars and fired up the pressure canner.  I wound up with 10 pints.  When the corn goes on sale again I will order enough to fill a couple cases of half pint jars.While the corn was processing, I tackled the 40 lbs. of chicken leg quarters.  I separated the drumsticks from the thighs and bagged up the drumsticks for the freezer.  I got 8 quart bags of drumsticks.The thighs went into stock pots along with water and couple of carrots and some onion for flavor.  When the meat was falling-off-the-bone done, I removed it from the bones and bagged it up for the fridge.  It was getting too late in the day to start canning the chicken.  I strained the resulting broth, poured it into a clean pot and put that in the fridge as well.This morning I filled half pint jars with chicken and processed them for 75 minutes.  I have lots of chicken and turkey in pint jars on the shelves, but few half pints.  A half pint jar is just right for a couple of sandwiches or to add in a chicken salad or chicken and rice for one or two.  I got 22  half pints from the thighs.  There was still about a quart of diced chicken left after the canner was full, so I bagged that up and stuck it in the fridge to use for my meals the rest of the week.I skimmed most of the fat from the broth, added a little chicken bouillon to enhance the chicken flavor, heated it up and filled 12 quart jars.  Those I processed for 25 minutes.Some have wondered why I would bother canning chicken when I already have lots on my shelves.  Two reasons.  The first is that prices don't go down - only up.  A year ago this same sale on chicken legs packaged in 10 lb. bags was 39 cents a pound.  I paid 49 cents a pound yesterday.  Who knows what the price will be next year or if the store will even run the same sale.The second reason is that for under $20, I got 16 meals of chicken drumsticks (I can get two meals out of each bag.), 22 meals of canned chicken and 12 quarts of chicken broth.  That much broth alone, at Sam's Club, would run $19.92 at their price of $1.66 per quartYes, there is some work involved, but I'd say that I got some pretty good mileage out of my $20 investment!I also got a good price on bell peppers.  The lady who does my shopping is really good at picking out the freshest produce and always gets me the biggest peppers.  This time there was a combination of red, orange and green peppers.  While the chicken was cooking I cleaned and diced the peppers and got them in the dehydrator.  On peppers I have dehydrated before, the skins tended to stay a bit tough when rehydrated, so now I grind the dried peppers into tiny pieces and use them as flavoring.That being done, I believe a nap is in my near future."},

This is the official family portrait.  Grandpa and Grandma are in front with Emily.  Marjorie, Elaine, Duane, Margaret and Adella are in back.  Judging by Emily's age and the fact that Grandpa is in the picture (He died in 1947.) I would guess this was taken about 1945.  My cousins have likely seen this one, as I believe each of the siblings had a copy.I don't know where this was taken, or when.  Elaine, Adella and Duane are in front, with Marjorie and Margaret in back.  I think Mother looks about 15 years old, which would make the date about 1940.Left to right:  Grandpa, Duane, Margaret, Grandma, Marjorie, Mildred (Duane's wife) and Elaine.Mother told me this picture was taken in front of the building in Nebish where Grandpa held Sunday church services for the Indians.  As far as I know, Grandpa was not an ordained minister, but felt called to preach.  His family accompanied him to these services and provided the music.  The photo was probably taken in the early 1940's.One of my cousins remarked on the FB post that my Uncle Duane had been the favored one because he was the only boy in the family that included six girls.  And this was probably true.  He is quoted as saying that his sisters got him into trouble with their parents by telling them whenever something bad happened, it was Duane's fault because he made them do whatever the mischief was. Uncle Duane had a delicious sense of humor.  Combine that with a quick mind and shenanigans resulted.  One of my favorite Uncle Duane stories had to do with stealing melons.  Duane convinced some of his visiting cousins that it would be fun to go steal some melons from a neighboring garden.  He led the cousins, sneaking up and down the streets, through back alleys and back yards until, thoroughly confused, they arrived at the melon patch.  It was only when they took a good look around that they realized they'd been had.  They were stealing melons from Duane's family garden in his own back yard.I think Uncle Duane may have found a way to extract just a little bit of revenge on his sisters for their tattling.  He waited until his parents were away from home of an evening.  He would then rattle a doorknob like someone was trying to break in, or he would crash together pots and pans to create as much racket as possible, or he would make all sorts of ghostly sounds.  Any one of these would send his sisters, screaming in fear, upstairs to lock themselves in their bedrooms.  I am told it worked every time.Many thanks to my cousin Linda, Duane's daughter, for posting the picture on FB that sent me on this pleasant stroll down memory lane.  We really should do this more often."},
{"title": "Do You Remember May Baskets?", "date": "Sunday, May 1, 2016", "text": "When I was a small girl, at least 60 years ago, there was a spring tradition that has since gone by the wayside.  That was the tradition of giving friends and neighbors May Baskets.About the middle of April Mother would set out paper and scissors and glue and help my sister and me make May Baskets.  These weren't traditional baskets but looked like these. If we had colorful construction paper, we would use that.  Or often we would use wallpaper left over from wallpapering a room in our house.  Mother was frugal.Some followed the old tradition of filling the baskets with spring flowers.  In our neighborhood, candies were put into the baskets.  Sometimes there were jelly beans saved from Easter and other times Mother would make a batch of caramels, wrap the pieces in waxed paper and fill the baskets.  Still other times, Dad would make a batch of molasses taffy.  That was the most fun, for we got to pull the taffy until it was just right.  Waxed paper wrapped taffy pieces then went into the baskets. The morning of the first day in May would find us hurrying through breakfast.  As soon as Mother was satisfied that we wouldn't starve between breakfast and lunch, our May Baskets were carefully stacked in a cardboard box and off we would go.  The way to deliver our baskets was to sneak up on a neighbor's front porch, hang a basket from the doorknob, ring the bell and scurry off around the corner of the house to peek and watch the reciepient claim their prize.Mother made sure that there were enough baskets for each house on the block - both sides of the street.  There was even one for the grouchy old lady on the corner.  I remember being astonished at seeing a smile on her face when she found her basket.When the last basket had been delivered, we hurried home to find several May Baskets waiting for us, filled with all sorts of sweet treats.That was a more gentle time.  It was nice to have been given baskets of treats, but the fun was in the giving.  Too bad we don't do that any more."},
{"title": "Back At It", "date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2016", "text": "It is way too early for Farmers Market goodies, but this week my local grocery yielded some decent sales.   My grocery order was delivered this afternoon, so I have been busy putting groceries away and working on preserving the bounty.Those plastic bags of fresh cole slaw mix, containing shredded green and red cabbage and carrots, were on sale for 10/$10.  Seven bags were enough to fill 14 dehydrator trays, with another 3 bags full left over for tomorrow.  A handful of the dried mix tossed into simmering soup adds such good flavor.   Or sometimes I will soak to rehydrate enough to add to casseroles.Onions were on sale.  I just love the guy who calls me to take my order.  Sometimes a sale is not much of a sale.  He found onions for me that were less expensive than the sale price.  I ordered 10 lbs. of onions and they will be peeled, chopped and in the dehydrators when the cabbage mix is finished.Hamburger was on sale, but there was a limit of 6 lbs. per order.  I hate when they do that.  But I ordered 6 lbs. anyway.  They will be made into meatballs, browned in the oven, packed into pint jars, covered with broth and canned.  I use them for spaghetti and meatballs, heated with potatoes and gravy or I have even made meatball sub sandwiches with them.  It's all good.The last thing I ordered for preservation was cream cheese.  I had seen a video about canning cream cheese so I thought I would give it a try.  I don't use a lot of cream cheese, but I do like having some on hand.  Seems to me that canning, if it turns out good, would be a better option for me than freezing it.  This is another experiment, so I will wait and see how it turns out before recommending the process.  The same video discussed canning cheddar cheese, but I have to say I wasn't enamoured with the results.  The finished product looked sort of rubbery and although they said the taste was just fine, I think the texture would make it something I would not really want to use.Spring hasn't decided if it is ready to stay.  Temps have been in the mid to high 40s during the day and dipping down toward freezing at night.  I had to turn the heat back on and close the windows, as a stiff breeze and rain have accompanied the low temps.  My way of contending with the cooler weather is to bake something.  An apple crisp and a double batch of chocolate chip cookies are penciled in for tomorrow.  You just can't go wrong with something chocolate."},

The bananas I bought are finally ripe enough for banana bread, so I will make a couple of loaves later today.  I am guessing that after Oldest Son reads this, he will be knocking on my door, looking for some banana bread to take in his lunch.  Fine with me.  Half the fun of baking it is the sharing of it.And that is pretty much as exciting as my life gets this week.  In between watching the girls dance, I think I will do some sewing.  I have another quilt top all cut out and ready to put together.  And maybe a nap.  Yep, definitely a nap.  :)"},

Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity,” the company wrote.\"I have nothing against people who believe differently than me.  If a person wants to spend their days in a bunny suit or a matador suit of lights, have at it.  If they want to take on the persona of Mother Goose or Batman, I don't care.  But when you tell me that it is alright for a grown man to share a bathroom with my eleven year old granddaughter or share a fitting room area with my teen-aged granddaughter, I must disagree.I realize that the disease of political correctness has spread far and wide.  I understand that companies will trade common sense for compliance with demands of groups who stomp their feet, scream and shout and file lawsuits when their demands are not met.   I get the part where protection of LGBT individuals or any group of law abiding folks is a good thing.But please, please tell me why the protection of my grandchildren isn't just as important.  Tell me that you can guarantee their safety from the predators and pedophiles who will most assuredly take advantage of your policy decision in order to satisfy their lust for children.I don't suppose that it will do any good to remind you that if a six foot tall man wears a wig, lipstick and a skirt, that does not make him a woman.  That is not any different than if a person stands in a garage and proclaims himself to be a car.I am not foolish enough to believe that the loss of my dollars will have any effect on your financial status.

{"title": "Spring has finally sprung...", "date": "Monday, April 18, 2016", "text": "here in the land of lakes and loons.  The temperature got up to nearly 80 degrees today and now, in the middle of the night, is still at 68.  I turned off the heat for my apartment a couple of days ago.  It is so nice to be able to have the windows open again.  Early this morning about the time the dark of night gave way to the first gray of morning, I could hear the chorus of sparrows and chickadees that live in the trees outside my windows.  They are so incredibly cheerful sounding in the morning.  Takes me at least a half pot of coffee to even become civil.It has been a quiet week here.  Aside from a few bags of cranberries waiting in the freezer to be turned into juice, I am pretty well caught up in the food storage department.  I have been using about half of my every-other-week grocery order to get fresh fruit, vegetables, etc. and the other half to stock up on whatever is on sale.  The canning shelves are full.  The closet pantry is full.  The shelf holding the dehydrated food is full.  I think I could go for at least year without having to go to the store, if necessary.   It is real easy to become complacent when the shelves are full and I don't want to do that.  This week my local grocery has boneless chuck roast on sale for $2.99 a pound, which is a good price here.  I may have to ask Oldest Son to do a grocery run for me on his next day off, and get me at least 40 lbs of beef roast.  I have lots of jars of beef cubes canned, but it would be nice to have some bigger pieces for roast beef dinners.A couple of weeks ago my granddaughter, Maddie Mae, called to tell me that she had been named \"Student of the Month\" at her school.  The honor has to do with good grades and good citizenship and I'm not sure what all else.  It makes me glad when one of the grands calls to let me know what is going on in their lives.  Good going, Maddie.  You make me proud.A week ago on the weekend I was sort of glued to my computer.  The two youngest granddaughters had a dance competition and I could watch it being live streamed.  Each of them had a couple of dances with the whole age group, plus each had a solo dance and Maddie had a duet.  It was so much fun to watch.  The live stream was a bit dicey during the awards ceremony so I missed learning how they did.  But when I talked to Boston later, she said both of them had high marks including some first place trophies. It is always a bit jarring to see them in full costume and stage makeup.  When I think of them, this is what I see.Other than that, it has been just the usual hum drum life of a contented retiree.  A little quality time with a good murder mystery, an apple pie shared with Oldest Son (He is really good to help me eat baked goodies!), and naps.  Naps are a good thing.  I have about six bananas that are nearly over ripe so I expect there are a couple of loaves of banana bread in my future, probably tomorrow. I know there are all sorts of crazy things going on in the world around me.  Thing is, there is precious little I can do about any of it.  So I keep one eye on the news and the other on Home Sweet Apartment.  I'm going to be 70 years old in a couple of months.  So I have decided to enjoy the time I have left as much as possible.  That includes doing the things I like to do, such as sewing and quilting and scrapbooking and reading.  And spending time with my family.  And keeping on with the preps, for even if I never use all of it, there are those who will.  Some find joy in world travel and others in the whirl of social activity.  Me...  I'm perfectly content right here.  Can't ask for much more than that."},
{"title": "Firemen Who Aren't", "date": "Sunday, April 10, 2016", "text": "This past week I got a phone call.  The gentleman on the other end of the line told me he represented our local fire fighters.  Said he was raising funds for the benefit of the fire department.I asked him if he thought $5000 would be of some help.He allowed as how it would be very much appreciated.I inquired as to how the money would be used.  He sort of fumbled  around a bit and then told me it was for new hoses on the firetrucks \"and stuff.\"So I asked him for his name, mailing address and phone number, seeing how the number was blocked from my Caller ID.He inquired as to the reason I needed that information.I told him that my local fire station was just three blocks away from my house.  I said that when I went to the station to give my friends there my personal check, they would want to know who should get credit for getting that donation.The gentleman then told me that the fire department preferred credit card funds over personal checks.To which I replied that I was sure my friend, the fire chief, wouldn't mind getting my check.  I would go to the station right away as long as the department needed new hoses and stuff.  And as long as I was at it, I would call the police station to see if they needed new tires for their patrol cars.  Maybe I could help them, too.At this point the nice gentleman hung up on me.  I don't know why.I have been receiving these phone calls several times a year for the past ten years.  The first time it happened I asked a couple of the firemen I knew if this was one of the ways funds were raised.  They replied that the fire department never, ever solicited funds via the phone.One would think that after ten years of having an old lady mess with them, these scammers would have removed my name from their call list by now.  And they should really stop trying to scam us old folks.  We aren't happy about being old in the first place.  And we are retired with lots of time on our hands to think up ways to ruin their day.

{"title": "School Days", "date": "Friday, April 8, 2016", "text": "Things are quiet here in my little corner of the world, so I thought I might give you one more offering from Great Uncle Walter. That's Walter on the right, his wife Maud on the left and two of their children in between.  I believe this picture was taken in the early 1950's, about the time he was putting his memories on paper.Yesterday I was wandering through some of the news sites, reading about all of the foolishness going on.  Much of it had to do with school kids.  Things like out of control kids and teachers afraid to discipline them.  Things like college kids needing safe spaces, and trigger warnings and requiring counseling because someone chalked a presidential candidates name on the sidewalk.  And best of all, the demands that children of either sex should be able to use the bathroom and locker room of their choice, depending on whether they identify as male or female.  Really?  I always thought God figured that all out right in the beginning, seeing to it that boys were born with outdoor plumbing and girls had indoor plumbing.  Problem solved.Anyway, all of this stupidity reminded me of the following piece Uncle Walter wrote about his own education.  It would likely give those today a case of the vapors.  But Uncle Walter went on to work for a railroad as a telegrapher along with other supervisory duties as well as becoming a first rate photographer.  He raised his family, took care of business and lived a good life.  There are a couple of passages that contain words that would make the social justice warriors break out in a cold sweat, but I won't change a word of what he wrote, for that's just the way it was then.  Enjoy.School Daysby Walter E. PaulMy schooling, such as it was, commenced in 1894 when my folks were renters on the Andrew Anderson farm two and a half miles south of Barnum, Minn.      My sisters Grace and Clara and brother Andrew had attended school back in New York State but here in our new Minnesota home there was no school within walking distance of short childish legs. Something had to be done to take its place. After a family discussion of the matter Father and Mother appointed Grace to be our teacher, she being the eldest of us children.    Upstairs in a spare room of this Anderson house we had found a hodge podge of cast off school books no two of them alike, readers, spellers, arithmetics  including a “mental arithmetic,” and a ragged geography, These with the few old school books our parents had brought west were the only ones we had. The room was furnished with an old slope top desk, a few discarded chairs and a makeshift blackboard.    I started with a little red covered Swinton’s First reader. Each day Grace coached me on its simple words and how they were grouped together to form little sentences. A much battered arithmetic and a torn speller were later added to my curriculum.    On the first day I thought our little school was somewhat of a joke and began to act up accordingly until Grace set me right by jerking me out of my seat by my shirt collar and promising to report my misconduct to Father and Mother if I didn’t stop my monkey shines and concentrate on my book. Her timely action I afterward realized was one of the best lessons I learned. Owing to my tender years I was required to attend our little school in the forenoons only, leaving the afternoons to spend as I saw fit.    In the early winter of 1895 we moved to an abandoned lumber camp cabin five miles east of Barnum where we lived the remainder of the winter. This was wild country and game was often seen. The cabin stood on the edge of a tamarack swamp where snow-shoe rabbits wore cris-crossing trails through the deep snow. On the other side of the cabin heavy spruce, balsam and birch timber sheltered partridges and an occasional deer. When we needed meat and no venison was on hand brother Arthur on a sunny day would take the .44 Winchester and walk slowly along a tote road through the tamarack swamp. Catching unwary rabbits off guard as they dozed on snow hummocks in the bright sunshine he would surprise them by shooting their heads off. Returning with all the rabbits he cared to lug he would dress them, give Mother one to cook for our next meal and pack the others in a box full of snow to put away in a corner of the log barn for future use.     With the first warm days of Spring we moved our few belongings into a new but very rough log cabin Father and Arthur had built two miles further east on wild land recently purchased from the St Paul and Duluth Railway for five dollars per acre.    In the new cabin our tutelage continued under Mother and Grace until a year later when Grace left home to teach in a district near Barnum. This left Mother to continue teaching us as best she could along with the burden of keeping house and caring for her family in somewhat primitive conditions. I don’t remember that father took any hand in our schooling other than an occasional encouraging remark or inquiry about our progress. Anyway I sensed some of its importance and in spite of much squirming, biting my pencil, and lamenting over the difficulties encountered I really did work at it and felt a degree of satisfaction as I passed from addition to subtraction, the multiplication table, division and so on. Numbers were difficult for me. Spelling was easier  and in  time I became a fair speller. Geography I loved as it gave me opportunity to study maps and to day dream about parts of the world I would visit when I became a man with plenty of money and unlimited time.    Cost of writing paper being all of five cents for one large rough tablet we often used sheets of wrapping paper cut to suitable size. Slates were useful too. You could write on them with a slate pencil, then with a wet sponge, or, lacking that a little spit rubbed on with fingers or elbow would erase everything and prepare a clear space for more writing or ciphering.  Sometimes the slate pencil would develop a little grain of grit on the point which caused spine chilling schreeches as it slid over the slate surface. We would grind out the offending grain on some rough hard surface which restored the pencil to more quiet operation, save for its tapping on the slate as we wrote or did our numbers. Most every Christmas we could expect some relative to give us a few slate pencils and some of the cheapest lead pencils. These lasted us through the year.    Early in September 1897 Grace went to teach school in the Polish community of Split Rock eleven miles west of Moose Lake. A Polish family by the name of Kwapack had built a small frame addition onto one end of their log cabin. In this the teacher lived and boarded herself.    When Grace took the position she arranged for Andrew to go with her and attend her school. He stayed with her through the winter until school closed in the spring. The following year I went with Grace and attended school until Christmas then Clara went from New Years until spring.    When Grace and I went out to Split Rock just before school commenced, George Watson who later became her husband, drove us out from Moose Lake in a two horse livery rig. The horses were good steppers and the buggy was large enough to carry our personal belongings with us. We three sat in the front seat with the baggage piled behind. The horses were trotting along the dusty gravel road when we came to a log bridge spanning a small stream about a mile from the Kwapack house. As the horses trotted onto the bridge we heard a loud crash as the supporting logs broke in the middle and the bridge collapsed under us. Mr. Watson hollered “Whoa!” as he was pitched out headlong over the dash board landing in a heap against the horses hooves. Instantly the horses stopped, their front feet up high, their hind feet low and the buggy with its front wheelslow and hind wheels high. The break in the bridge was directly under the whiffletrees. Mr. Watson fearing the horses would kick his brains out in the position in which he lay had presence of mind enough to talk to them quietly while he painfully extricated himself, untangled the reins and stepped out onto firm ground groaning in misery because of a bruised knee. Taking the horses by their bits he slowly led them up the incline of the collapsed bridge the buggy with Grace and I still in it following onto firm road ahead.     I missed Father and Mother and the home surroundings sorely. This was my first experience away from home. How I wished I could have my dog Carlo near me to pet or to go hunting partridges and rabbits with. I still have one of Mother’s letters to me in which she told how the first few days after I left Carlo wandered about the place, looking here and there, watching the road, and occasionally whining disconsolately. However my time and attention was soon taken up with the new surroundings and experiences, and evidently in time Carlo also became reconciled.    Mrs. Kwapack had three or four small children whom she frequently whipped severely for small childish sins. Aside from her severity with her children she was a good neighbor, occasionally rapping on our door when she wished to come in, sit awhile and talk to “Miss Paul.”From our place a road ran across an open field into a maple and birch forest, down across the Split Rock River and up the opposite slope to the school house set back among the trees a little way from the main road. Heat for the school was furnished by a large cast iron heater burning big chunks of birch and maple wood a good supply of which the School Board kept piled close behind the building.    Most of the school children spoke broken English. On the playground their conversation was mostly in Polish which of course left me in the dark as to what they were talking about. I did soon learn some Polish words for “teacher’s brother” so knew when they were talking about me. Grace was careful not to show me any partiality on account of our relationship. She would correct me as sharply as any of the other children and on cold winter days she saw to it that I did not shirk my part when the kids had to bring in the days supply of wood from the pile behind the building.    There was no social and very little other kind of entertainment outside of school hours. Sometimes I amused myself by wandering off into the woods, sliding on the river ice or helping Grace with household duties. Sometimes I went to spend a little time with Joe Burlik or with Ignace Skruilock, schoolmates of mine, but most of the Polish children had farm work to do at home with little time left for play. Part of the long winter evenings were spent with my lessons for the next day. On Sundays, there being no Protestant church closer than Moose Lake, Grace and I would read the International Sunday School Lesson together and discuss it a little in sort of a Sunday School formality. For special Sunday treats we had a supply of Brazil nuts, or nigger toes as we called them. These were carefully counted, divided by the number of Sundays until Christmas and that number we cracked and ate each Sunday.    After Christmas Clara went to the Split Rock School to take her turn until spring. The following summer Grace and Mr. Watson were married so for a time that ended our formal schooling.    Two miles east of us in our community which had come to be known as Deer Park, lived the Dye family.  Mr. and Mrs. their boy William about my age and his half brother Clyde a few years younger. Mrs. Dye’s maiden sister lived with them as did also her mother Mrs. Munger, an elderly retired school teacher and a graduate of the Winona Normal School.    In the summer of 1900 Mrs. Munger sent out word to the parents of Deer Park that she would undertake teaching their children that fall and winter in her home providing each child would bring his or her own books, some kind of a seat, and of course any paper or pencils they might need. I hope we children appreciated what Mrs. Munger proposed doing for us as we did in later years when with more maturity we looked back to that time. I don’t think she ever suggested payment of any kind for teaching us, at least I never heard our parents mention it. Of course in our circumstances any payment would have to be very meager. The same thing was true with the other families.       On the morning of the opening day five or six children gathered at the Dye home besides William and Clyde. There was Clara and I, the three Lind girls and possibly one or two more whom I have since forgotten.  Mrs. Munger proved to be a very capable and likeable teacher. First, she examined each of our books no two of which were alike, and inquired how far we had studied in them. She assigned lessons for each pupil, admonished us to study the pictures accompanying the lessons and to think about them. She would then leave us in the bed room school room for a time while she busied herself with household duties. After awhile she would quietly return and ask one of us to stand up and tell her what we had learned, or do some of the arithmetic problems on our slate or rough writing paper. She would prompt us with questions as we went along, or, when applicable relate some little event out of her past to illustrate what she was trying to teach us. About 1030AM and again at 230PM she would send us out of doors for fifteen minutes of exercise and fresh air which we sorely needed after being cooped up in that small room. At noon we had an hour to eat our lunch either inside or, if weather permitted, outside under the nearby balsams. This makeshift school lasted through the winter and spring.    The spring and summer of 1901 a one room school building was erected a mile east of us on the main road running north from Woodbury’s place to Cain’s Corner. With the opening of this school that fall we of course had a regularly employed teacher, standard modern books, a large case of roll up charts and maps hanging from the wall, a globe, blackboards and a huge dictionary perched on a tall wobbly metal stand. Heat was furnished by a large wood burning heater in the back of the school room surrounded by a sheet of galvanized iron supported a foot from the floor the function of which was to help circulate heat on a cold day. Between the stove and this sheet of galvanized iron there was just room for a person to squeeze in and get the first heat of a slow starting fire before the rest of the room was warmed up.    There was unlimited play room around the building, room for baseball, tag, anty over, and fox and geese. The nearby forest afforded opportunity for Indian fighting, bear hunting and other Daniel Boone exploits. There was no well so we had to carry drinking water from Woodbury’s well a half mile away. On cold winter. days we ate our lunches in the hallway or huddled around the heater. Severe cold or deep and drifted snow did not deter us from plenty of outdoor exercise during the noon hour or at recess time. When the bell rang there would be a great scurrying into the hall to take off our snow laden overshoes, mitts and caps. Our wet garments were draped over the sheet iron encircling the stove, our overshoes placed under, then with much puffing and giggling we would slide into our seats keeping a wary eye on the teacher who was watching the commotion and patiently waiting for it to subside.    With the first warm days of spring what zest we ever had for education slowly oozed out of us as we often sat idling away a few minutes, gazing out the windows at screaming bluejays and whispering chickadees flitting about in the nearby balsams and spruces. Chattering red squirrels running up and down the tree trunks and leaping across from one tree top to another were noted with languid interest. As spring crept in and the winter snow disappeared frogs began singing in every swamp puddle. Most any day now we could hear the distant muffled drumming of partridges. In fact the whole creation now seemed to be coming into a new and stirring life while we kids were like galley slaves still chained to our desks, compelled to continue our tedious progress over the seas of more learning.    We liked our teachers, perhaps a little too well. Some of them were not much older than we and were always ready to join in any of our fun. The first one was Jeannette Hall. She started the school off from the very first day. She had good discipline and knew when to be firm but she could also get out and play with us, go on picnic excursions and be as much of a kid as any. Unbenownst to us kids the time came when she carried a clinical thermometer in her lunch bucket and each day took her temperature wondering what made it climb slowly higher and higher. Dr. Inez Legg who had an office in Barnum was finally consulted and found Jeanette had typhoid fever. We were dumfounded and could hardly believe the news. We talked about her in subdued whispers. Would she die? Would she recover? Would we ever have her for a teacher again? The substitute teacher was all right but still we could not get the face of Jeannette out of the school room entirely. After long weeks Dr. Legg announced that she was out of danger and would recover. How happy we were now. It seemed as though the only way we could express our feelings was to whoop it up a little louder on the playground, and perhaps work a little harder on our lessons.    Our next teacher was Alberta Pineo who also came to be much beloved of us kids. She also played with us and taught us much that cannot be found between book covers. When some of us older boys indulged in coarse  or unfair play her gentle, steady gaze was a more effective rebuke than words.Then came a Miss Poupores for a brief period. She had a boy friend and because of her devotion to him lost her job. Her term was filled out by Mrs. Woodbury the saw mill owners wife. She had once been a school teacher and was very popular with us because of the welcome we always found in her immaculate home.     Arthur Simpson taught us two years. He was older than the others and had very poor discipline but we did get a great deal of good from his instruction. He was deeply religious and read to us from the Scriptures each morning.    Friday afternoons were the high spots of the week. It was then after lunch that books and lessons were forgotten, Our teacher would devise some kind of diversion, a spell down, a guessing game, problems in mental arithmetic or a talk on some subject not found in our books. Arthur Simpson especially gave us talks on   astronomy, geology, exploration, foreign lands, or scientific experiments and discoveries. These talks were interesting for the older pupils but younger ones with a bad case of the wiggles were often excused and sent home. For awhile we even published a quarterly school paper called the Pine Knot, hand written on large sheets of fools-cap and illustrated with pen sketches by the most artistically gifted pupil. One of these issues I still have in my possession.    My schoolmates were a varied lot both in age and personalities They ranged from the second to the eighth grade. During much of the school session some one would be on the long bench up front reciting. Little jealousies and rivalries developed and were soon forgotten. Puppy love budded, blossomed and faded on the stem. In games and at school parties some of the older boys and girls often showed an attraction for each other which called forth derisive remarks from the younger ones who might themselves be secretly trying to conceal similar budding feelings toward their favorites.    Christmas programs given the last day of school before the Christmas vacation were looked forward to with mounting enthusiasm. We older boys went into the woods to cut a well shaped spruce or balsam tree six or seven feet tall. This we dragged to the school yard where we sawed the butt off square, nailed a short piece of wide board to it then set the tree up beside the teacher’s desk. Necessary guy wires from the tree to hooks high up on a window frame or on top of a blackboard prevented an unlucky upset. As was customary in those days the tree was lit by small wax candles of various colors set in small tin holders with clamps which held them firmly on the branches. Luckily these candles when lit never set our tree afire owing to the care exercised in placing them to see that the flame did not ignite some branch directly above it. The girls made strings of popcorn, chains of brightly colored paper, and with store bought spangles, glass balls and other glittering decorations borrowed from our various homes the tree became a thing of beauty adding much to our program of Christmas songs and spoken pieces.    I was given the job of janitor in this school. My duty it was to stay after school to sweep the floor and rearrange any misplaced books, paper or furniture. I arrived early in the morning to start the wood fire in plenty of time for the room to warm up before the teacher and first pupils arrived. I dusted the furniture and saw to it that the blackboards were clean and ready for the days work. The first of every month was pay day and brought me a school warrant for two dollars. This with what little trapping money I made through the winter kept me in  spending money, some of it spent for necessities such as sox, mittens, a cap, 22 shorts or school writing material.     In our home and in all the other homes in Deer Park there was a dearth of books or magazines suitable for growing children. Father had an oak book case handed down from his father which was filled with books. There were also four or five open shelves nailed to our log walls all of which were full of books but very few of interest to children. There were two leather bound volumes of Wesley’s Sermons, a leather bound volume of Foxe’s Book of Martyrs with many grisly wood cuts depicting various ways in which the martyrs died. There was Milton’s Paradise Lost, Young’s Night Thoughts Emerson Watt’s Improvement of the Mind, a set of six ponderous volumes of Clarke’s Commentary on the Bible, and a History of the Jews by Josephus. At Christmas   time we usually received a few children’s books from distant relatives which we read and re-read until they commenced to fall apart. When we came from New York State we brought two large home bound volumes of Youth’s Companions which were handled so much that they broke in the middle. Some of the half leaves were lost making it difficult to read an entire story but by guessing at what was lost in the missing half sheet we still enjoyed the stories. Finally after a few years we subscribed to the Youth’s Companion which I believe came weekly and was always awaited with much impatience.    In time some one in Deer Park heard about the Minnesota Traveling Library Service which could be had free on written request of a certain number of adult residents. On person was to be responsible for the books and to collect funds to cover carrying charges both ways. The proper application was made by the required number of people and Mrs. Young, whose cabin was centrally located was named librarian.     In due time the first consignment of books arrived packed in a sturdy book case holding perhaps forty or fifty volumes. Mrs. Young set the case on a bureau in their cabin and passed word to callers, and to folks she met at religious services held around the neighborhood each Sunday, that the library had arrived and was now in business. The books were mostly for grown-ups, but we children did find many gems fitting our ages; Alice in Wonderland, Jo’s Boys, Little Women, Little Men, Treasure Island, Robin Hood, Robinson Crusoe, and books of fairy tales fired our imaginations and introduced us to a life long enjoyment of good literature. After a few weeks when the first case full seemed to have served its purpose, it was returned and another one came in its place.    My formal education ended with the eighth grade. My parents were too poor to send any of their children away for further education, they did however instill in us an insatiable curiosity to find out just what lay beyond our immediate horizon. Grubbing stumps, raising potatoes and rutabagas, keeping a few scrub cows, and in the winter time cutting a little pulpwood or making a few ties, did not appeal to me at all. Soon after my final day at school I found a job, said good bye to Father and Mother, patted my aging Carlo on his glossy head and stepped out to see what lay beyond the distant horizon.Copyright © 2001 Kenneth E.

{"title": "The Trip to Town", "date": "Wednesday, April 6, 2016", "text": "While reading the comments on my last post, I got to thinking about how different our lives are from those of my Great Grandparents.   Going to the grocery store for many of us is just a matter of driving a few blocks, purchasing whatever we want and driving back home again.  Not so for my ancestors.In front, my Great Grandfather, Hollis Brayton Paul.  Behind, left to right, his youngest son Walter, my Great Grandmother Adella, the oldest daughter Grace, my Grandfather Andrew Jackson  and the youngest daughter Clara.   The two older boys, Arthur and Melvin at this time had secured homesteads of their own in the same area of Minnesota.  This photo was taken in front of their cabin in about 1897, right about the time of the following story.My Great Uncle Walter had a gift for writing and to his everlasting credit he wrote much about the lives of his family.  The story of \"The Trip to Town\" is rather long, but I found it fun and interesting, especially when compared to today.  It is my hope that someone else may enjoy this true story as much as I did.The Trip to Townby Walter E. PaulIt was early spring. In the spruce thickets the winter’s frost still lay under the deep blanket of moss. Leaf buds were swelling on the tag alders in the swamps. Willows were taking on a brighter shade of gold standing out in sharp contrast to the grays and russets of last year’s swamp grass in the lowlands and the darker pines and balsams of the ridges.    We were moving. With our big Round Oak heater slung between them on two tamarack poles, Pa and brother Arthur picked their way carefully over an abandoned tote road winding through the woods from the vacated logging camp in which we had spent the winter to a small clearing surrounding the newly constructed rough log cabin two miles away which was to be our future home. Every hundred yards or so the heavy heater was eased to the ground while they rested their arms, straightened their spines, wiped the sweat from their faces and selected some distant object beside the trail which they would try to reach before again stopping for a breather. Ma and we four smaller children followed, scrambling over roots and stones on the high ground, slipping and sloshing on the low ground meanwhile struggling with chairs, kitchen utensils, personal belongings, anything suited to our sizes and ability, tucked under our arms, hung from our shoulders or gripped in our hands.    For two years this old tote road was to be our only link with the outside world. After we had acquired a team of illy matched horses and a sled we could make this trip in winter clear through to Barnum and haul in the heavier supplies, flour, salt, feed, tools, needed for the following summer. When a wagon road to town was completed two years later we and other settlers in our area felt that indeed a door to the outside world had been opened even though the wagon road was several miles longer than the tote road route. Now we could hitch Jerry and Tom to the heavy lumber wagon and in spite of the bumps, “thank you moms”, violent shocks and hub deep mud with the resulting occasional showers of mud, actually drive the seven miles to Barnum and home again all in one day, sustaining no broken bones, loosened molars or other mishaps causing later discomfort in sitting at table or lying in our straw tick beds.    To me as a backwoods boy of seven and for several years thereafter, trips to town were events of major importance, a welcome break in what seemed to be a dull and uneventful life, something to be looked forward to, something to be long remembered. They were red letter days for all of us kids and, I more than suspect that they were not without glamour and a degree of excitement for Pa and Ma as well.    Such a trip did not call for my very best Sunday Clothes, not the nine dollar suit purchased not so long ago from T. M. Roberts Mail Order House and already revealing too much wrist and ankle and a corpulent appearance in front when the coat was buttoned. No, a pair of freshly washed overalls and a rough cotton shirt would do. Clean the mud off the work shoes and perhaps apply a little polish if we had any, otherwise just plain spit mixed with elbow grease and applied with an old rag would do. If it was summer and my straw hat was so ragged that little more than the crown remained it could be hid under the wagon seat just before entering town and a brand new hat purchased for five or ten cents at Goodell’s Store, that being the first store available after arrival.    Some trips could prove to be real exciting like the time Pa crated up our three bear cubs and took them to the Carlton County Fair. For once we kids felt vastly superior to ordinary kids as we rode on top of the bear crate, pretending to be solicitous for the welfare of our yowling charges while riding slowly down Main Street, hoping that we were making a proper impression on the crowd of children of all ages as they ran shouting beside our wagon, peering between the slats of the crate, the bolder ones climbing on top to have a better look. At the Fair grounds older people joined the younger until we were surrounded by a boisterous excited crowd as we took the bears to their allotted place of exhibition.    Then there was the day we returned home in what haste we could make hoping to escape a gathering thunderstorm. The sky grew black with ominous wind clouds piling up from the south-west. Tall swaying Norway pines whistled and moaned in protest of the buffeting gusts. Frequent stabs of lightning sliced the dark canopy overhead. As the advancing thunder began to crash in unison with every lightning flash Jerry and Tom volunteered their top speed, a shuffling gate a little faster than a spry walk. As we came in sight of our cabin the storm broke on us with violent fury. Big trees writhing in agony bent low then snapped and crashed to the ground sometimes taking other trees with them. Close behind our wagon one of the larger trees waving its limbs wildly as if trying to grasp us, swayed and staggered then broke and slammed down across the narrow road. A few minutes later we were in our barnyard stripping the harnesses from the horses. As they plunged into the shelter of their little log barn Pa and I bent low against the driving rain and scurried to the cabin. As we stomped inside where Ma had a cheery fire crackling in the kitchen range I overheard Pa say, “Well, Ma, the Good Lord surely held that tree up for us to get past!”    A proposed trip to town was usually announced at the breakfast table after Pa and Ma had duly discussed the shortages developing in our larder, the small amount of cash on hand  if any, what butter, eggs, or other mediums of exchange were available, and the probable state of the weather for the day. Ma always put up a lunch for us, sandwiches with cold partridge, venison or snow-shoe rabbit. On rare occasions there might even be cold roast pork or beef if we had recently butchered. A two quart fruit jar of fresh milk and some hard boiled eggs with a little salt wrapped in paper completed the lunch. Pa brought the horses up from the pasture, harnessed and hitched them to the lumber wagon. If they had recently been rolling on muddy ground he took a  gunny sack and a pail of water and gave them a rough grooming which might not bring much of a luster to their tawny coats but would at least give them a less sloppy appearance. We had no spring seats for the wagon, but used plain boards a little longer than the width of the wagon box, with cleats underneath to keep them from sliding off and precipitating the passengers by the wayside. A horse blanket doubled twice was to sit upon. If this arrangement became too hard before the end of the trip one could always get out and walk for a rest.    Sometimes we all would go, sometimes only two or three but for us children who went, home and all its surroundings now looked drab and commonplace compared to our childish anticipation of the sights awaiting us in town.    Last thing before starting Pa looked around to see if anything had been forgotten. There should be hay in the back of the wagon box for the horses at noon, an axe, a chain, halters, and of course our lunch. Ma would invariably run back  into the cabin at the last minute to satisfy herself that the fire in the stove was dead out, all the windows shut, and the eatables out of reach of mice and flies. Pa would then gather up the reins and with a shout of “Git up there!” away we would go, the horses at a walk, the big wheels turning slowly, the excitement of the day just ahead. Once in awhile Pa would slide the little sapling out from under the wagon seat, speak sharply to Jerry and Tom and give each of them a smart whack across the rump resulting in a startled leap or two as they suddenly came out of their lethargy, then a moderate trot for a few yards gradually diminishing to a rapid walk, then a slow walk, heads drooping again, ears flapping, tails lazily switching flies.    These two horses had different temperaments  and in a tough pull acted differently. Jerry the larger one would pull hard and fairly steady but he had one lame hind foot and was easily bewildered in an emergency. Tom, could not pull so much but had more spirit by far. Sometimes if the load would not move he would show signs of panic, snort, toss his head and roll his eyes although he never ran away or really balked. A short rest, some patting on his belly, a little scratching of his ears and a few quiet words would calm him so he would make another try with everything he had.    So, we took our leisurely way to town, over a bumpy, rutty, stony road through a mile  of woods to Clarence Reeves’ place where we came out on a graded road leading straight north to Cain’s Corner three miles away. This road through the woods sometimes was really a rugged stretch. Just after the frost went out of the ground in the spring or after a heavy rain it was next to impassible in spots. Once Pa invited a Reverend Brandt and his family to come to visit us for a few days. Having some difficulty in making the reverend gentleman understand where he was to turn off the graded road to reach our cabin, Pa promised to have a large sign nailed to a tree at the proper place to guide him. Sure enough, under Pa’s supervision brother Andrew made and painted a sign wonderful to behold and long to be remembered in our community. It was eight feet long by three feet wide. A hand with index finger extended pointed at the first mudhole nearby. Heavy black lettering bore the information for Rev. Brandt’s guidance,- “TO PAULS’ ONE MILE. DRIVE EASY AND ABSTAIN FROM PROFANITY.”    Cain’s Corner was considered the half way point. Here the road turned west toward Barnum. The hills we encountered were not bad ones except after a heavy rain or in early spring when the sticky clay and deep ruts sometimes made it necessary for the men folks to get out and walk beside the wagon going uphill. Going down, a chain always carried in the wagon box might be used, one end fastened to a box bolster and the other hooked around a wheel spoke so that the drag of one motionless wheel would slow our descent to the bottom. On Polar hill the chain was often necessary even in dry weather if we had a load of potatoes or wood going to market. From the top of Polar Hill two miles from town the scene changed. Here were several hills and valleys to cross, streams running under rough wooden bridges, the first glimpse of Barnum with Bear Lake off to the left shimmering in the summer sun with a little wooded island like an emerald near one shore. In the autumns this view was especially attractive with the maples, birches and oaks in a blaze of brilliant color spotted with the dark green of white pines while the dusty road ahead lay like a white ribbon edged in scarlet and yellow of the sumac and goldenrod spilling over into the ditches on either side.    Descending the long hill leading into Main Street we passed the Catholic Church, the Baptist Church and the High School then came Goodell’s Store stocked with treasures dear to the heart of every boy, candy, toys, traps, 22 rifles, fishing tackle and all the rest we had so often pored over in the mail order catalogues. All we lacked to possess these treasures was the price, but at least looking and wishing was something we could afford.    Slowly we rattled down the gravelly street, across the bridge, its loose planks banging and slapping together under the wagon wheels as we headed for the wagon shed in the rear of the Sauntry and Cain General Store. This was the most convenient place to leave our team where we unhitched them and tied them to the tail gate where they could reach the hay in the wagon box. From here we started out to do the town.    First place to visit was the post-office to collect our two or three weeks accumulation of mail. After exchanging a few friendly remarks with Mr. Barstow the genial post-master Pa and Ma would busy themselves reading letters or scanning the headlines of the weekly Barnum Gazette. This gave me a chance to watch traffic on the street or look timidly through the door into another room where stood the press on which the Gazette was printed as well as any job printing the town might offer. I never ceased to wonder how the printer, after inserting a sheet of paper into the rumbling press always managed to flip his hand out from between its chomping jaws just a wink before they came together. I figured that with sufficient time and patience to watch, I could some day see what would happen if he was just a teeny, weeny bit too slow.    From the post-office we went back to Sauntry Cain’s or to Goodell’s store to “trade” as Pa and Ma termed it. Later in life I learned that that trading could be just exchanging cash for merchandise. We, however usually swapped two or three jars of home made butter, a few dozen white or brown, speckled or plain eggs or some potatoes along with what cash we had in payment for what we took away. How well I do remember the day I took my first mink skin to the store receiving therefor the magnificent sum of ninety cents in spot cash, all my own to spend as I pleased.    With our trading done it was time to go out the back door of the store to the wagon yard, climb into the wagon and eat our lunch in company with the horses still munching their hay. They always appreciated an apple core if we had one or even a crust of bread to flavor their ground up mixture of clover hay and oats. When lunch was finished there might be a few more things to attend to, go to see some acquaintance, go to the bank, or make some nearly forgotten purchases,- a spool of thread, a can of baking powder, or a box of BB caps or 22 shorts for the old Flobert rifle at home.    When it finally came about hitching up time, Pa would usually say, “Well Walter, how would you like to go down to the depot to watch the Limited go through?” He knew as well as I that there was only one answer to that question. The Limited was considered a very fast train running from St. Paul to Duluth and stopping at the more important towns only. It must have made all of 45 or 50 miles per hour and at small towns like Barnum it never slackened its pace, snatching the mail pouch from the crane on the fly. As we walked over the rickety wooden sidewalk to the depot which was some distance from the business section,  would watch eagerly to see if there were any engines in sight. I dearly loved to watch them puff and wheeze and belch black smoke as they clattered back and forth about their business. Arrived at the depot Pa would ask Mr. Addington, the agent, if the Limited was on time. The answer would usually be “yes.” While we waited I  read all the lettering on nearby box cars,wondering what such wording as “capy” “gro.Wt.” “air brake” and other equally strange markings might mean. I stared in wonder at the shiny, chattering telegraph instruments on Mr.Addington’s desk, and when Pa explained that all the noise they were making was really messages passing over the wires to and from distant places, I tried to imagine what it would be like to understand it and do it myself for others to hear.    Bye and bye the far off whistle of an approaching train hurried us out on the depot platform. Looking down the track toward the water tank we could see a ribbon of smoke lying low over the tree tops and rapidly approaching, then past the water tank and leaning gracefully into the curve came the Limited, a white plume from the whistle, side rods dancing on the drivers, and a string of shiny varnished coaches clattering behind, Quickly we stepped around the far end of the depot and, holding our hats peered around the corner. Here she came, dust flying, bell ringing, rails singing, and with a final burst of noise as the whistle screamed its warning for the road crossing just beyond. the Limited thundered by.One day Mr. Addington said the Limited was two hours late. How my spirits slumped! Pa, undemonstrative as always, slowly and thoughtfully drew his big silver watch from his vest pocket and studied it a minute, rubbing its thick crystal with a calloused thumb. Turning soberly to me he said, “Well son.” I, sensing in a childish way that he was really disappointed the same as I, swallowed hard and filled in his unspoken thoughts. “Guess it’s too late for us Pa, some other day we can see it.” Looking at me with a strange light in his eyes I noted a slight shifting of his eyebrows, a little straightening of his sagging shoulders as he slowly led the way through the door and back uptown to our team and wagon, two chums sharing a mutual disappointment.     Soon we would be on our way home. With the horses hitched to the wagon and ourselves aboard we drove out of the wagon yard behind the store into Main Street heading for the hill. But now instead of crossing the bridge Pa would drive down into the river beside the bridge, stop in the middle of the current, step over the dash board and walk out on the tongue to loosen the bridles on the horses so they could plunge their lips down into the clear cold stream swirling about their knees and drink their fill. I would crane my neck and watch the horses’ lips suck in and out and note the little lump that ran up the outside of their throats as the gulp of water hurried to their stomachs. They would pause a few moments to catch up on their breathing, then plunge their lips in and pump some more. Soon as they finished Pa would fasten their bridles again, walk back on the tongue balancing himself with a hand on either horse, climb into the seat and we would continue our way up the gently sloping river bank, back onto the street again.    By the time we reached home and turned the horses out to pasture it would be time to do the chores, milk the cows, feed the pigs and chickens, get in wood for morning, then set down to supper where we recounted to each other the events of the day.   Trips to town in winter had much the same excitement for us. Instead of the lumber wagon we used the sled, sometimes removing the cross chains underneath and using only the front bob with a short box on it filled with hay to keep our feet warm as well as to furnish feed for the horses. If the cold was severe we would not use a seat, but spread a blanket on which we sat, with another blanket over our laps and wrapped around our backs, sometimes with a lighted lantern tucked in at our feet. Instead of taking the long road by Cain’s Corner and Polar Hill we would take a short cut through the woods, following an abandoned logging road coming out on Bear Lake and enter town from the south-east. Usually under the blankets we tucked away our 1873 Model 44 Winchester just in case there was an opportunity to pick up fresh meat enroute.    The virgin pine in our old neighborhood has long since disappeared giving place to a new stand of poplar, balsam and spruce which furnishes shade and proper growing conditions for a new generation of white and Norway pine now getting a healthy start. No one living there now can tell you the difference between a cross-haul and a bean hole. Road monkeys have not been seen in those parts for many, many years.Some summer day I shall go back to a bridge I know of over a small stream where my playmates and I went swimming and caught minnows. I shall sit down on the grassy bank, remove my shoes and sox, roll up my pant legs and dabble my feet in the cool stream again. The warm sun, the breezes in the willows, the chuckle of the stream and all the pleasant memories might do strange things to me. Could be, I might dimly see in the distance a team of poorly matched scrubby horses hitched to a rickety lumber wagon, coming slowly down the road. If the driver is a middle aged man with side-burns and wearing a straw hat, and the small, slightly stooped woman beside him is wearing a sun bonnet, I shall hail them and ask politely if I may go along on another trip to town.Copyright © 2001 Kenneth E.

{"title": "Canning Series - Pickles and Relishes", "date": "Monday, March 14, 2016", "text": "I have a confession to make.  I can not make good dill pickles.  I have tried and tried over the years to no avail.  I even begged my Auntie Em's recipe.  My Auntie Em made the best dill pickles in God's whole creation.  Whenever I went to her house I would whine until she opened a jar of them.  Knowing how much I loved her dill pickles she even gave me a jar of them for Christmas one year.  With a big red bow on top.   But even using her recipe, mine were a total fail.  So now I use this.Yep, that's Mrs. Wages Dill Pickle Mix.  Youngest Son and his kids had canned dill pickles a couple of years ago and shared them with me.  He is the one who told me about Mrs. Wages mixes.  I used it last summer when Oldest Son brought me some little cucumbers and dill from the Farmer's Market to make baby dills.  They are wonderful.  Just follow the directions on the package.  Easy.But if you are feeling adventurous, here is my Auntie Em's dill pickle recipe.  I'm copying it exactly as she wrote it down for me.Auntie Em's Dill Pickles (7 quarts)8 cups water4 cups cider vinegar1 cup canning salt2 heads dill per quart jarPack cukes and dill in jars.  Boil the brine - pour over cukes in jars - put on lids and rings.Set jars in canner of hot water to jar rings.  Bring to boil.  Shut off heat and let stand in water until sealed.You can put in some onion or garlic if you want to.That's it.  Short and to the point.  Maybe you will have better luck than I did.I do make really good Bread and Butter Sweet Pickles.  Mrs. Wages has as mix for those, too, but I haven't tried it yet.  Here is my Mom's recipe that I have used for many years.  I usually double the recipe for 7 - 8 quarts.Mom's Bread and Butter Pickles15 cups cucumbers, sliced 1/4 inch thick3 onions, sliced thin1/4 cup canning salt (NOT table salt)4 cups cracked ice2 1/2 cups cider vinegar2 1/2 cups sugar3/4 teaspoon turmeric1/2 teaspoon celery seed1 tablespoon mustard seedsCombine cucumbers, onions, salt and ice in a large bowl.  Mix well.  Let stand 3 hours.  Rinse and drain well.Combine vinegar, sugar, turmeric, celery seed and mustard seed in a large pot.  Add drained cucumbers.Place pot on medium low heat.  Bring almost to a boil.  Remove from heat.Ladle cukes and brine into jars.  Wipe jar rims and top with lids and rings.Process 10 minutes in a Boiling Water Bath.I maybe should have mentioned before that with a Boiling Water Bath, the time should start when the water begins to boil.My Dad loved beet pickles, so when I was still at home we raised some beets in the garden to can as a vegetable, but always made sure to plant enough for beet pickles.  I may have to see if I can lay my hands on some beets this year because I get a craving for these pickles every now and then.Beet Pickles3-5 pint jarsEnough smallish beets to fill 3-5 pint jars.  (5 pints for me are not worth the bother, so I at least double the recipe and maybe more, depending on how many beets I have to work with.)2 cups white sugar2 cups water2 cups vinegar1 teaspoon whole cloves1 teaspoon allspice1 tablespoon cinnamonWash the beets well.  Leave the root and about one inch of stems on them.  Put them in a stock pot, add enough water to cover and boil until tender.  Drain the beets and let cool a bit.  Trim off the root and stems - the skins will slip right off.  Leave the beets whole or slice 1/4 inch thick - your choice.Make the syrup of the sugar, water, vinegar and spices. Pour over cooked beets and simmer 15 minutes.Pack into hot jars.Process in a boiling water bath for 30 minutes.There was a crab apple tree growing in the small orchard by the house I grew up in.  The fruit was wonderful.  As kids we ate crab apples until we couldn't any more and Mother always made some into jelly.  But she made sure there were enough to make several jars of crab apple pickles.  We weren't allowed to open those jars because they were just for special occasions or holidays or for when company was at our house for a meal.  But they were a treat worth waiting for.Mom's Crab Apple Pickles3 lbs. firm crab apples, with stems2 cups cider vinegar2 cups sugar4 whole cloves1 cinnamon stickCombine the vinegar, sugar, cloves and cinnamon in a pan big enough to hold the crab apples.  Bring to a boil over high heat and stir until the sugar dissolves, 2 to 3 minutes.Reduce the heat to medium, add the fruit and cook until barely done, about 5 - 6 minutes.Using a slotted spoon, pack crab apples in hot jars.Ladle in hot syrup, leaving 1/4\" headspace.  Seal and process in a boiling water bath for 40 minutes.I don't make relish much any more and I'm afraid that the few recipes I used years ago have vanished.  I do can the following recipe every year.  It is good eaten as a relish and it can be drained and mixed with a little mayonnaise for a coleslaw.  The recipe says it may be canned or frozen, but I haven't tried freezing it.  I can it in pint jars and in half pints.  The half pints are just right for a meal for one.Coleslaw to Can or FreezeMakes 3 to 4 pintsNote:  I usually double and sometimes triple the recipe.1 medium head cabbage1 large carrot1 green pepper1 small onion1 tsp. canning saltSyrup1 cup cider vinegar1/4 cup water2 cups sugar1 tsp. celery seed1 tsp. mustard seedShred the vegetables and mix together.  I don't have a food processor so I just chop them up in my blender.Stir in the salt. Let stand 1 hour.Drain water from vegetables.Boil syrup ingredients together for 1 minute. Cool.Mix the syrup with the vegetables. Pack into jars and process (half pints, pints and quarts) in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes, or put into freezer containers and freeze.Cabbage is on sale this week for 9 cents a pound (5 pound limit) and I have ordered 5 pounds to make into this slaw.  I'm out of the half pint jars of it and I really like the stuff.  Hamburger is on sale this week at about half the normal price so I have ordered 12 pounds of that to can as well.  I wish the stores didn't put limits on the amount one can buy of some sale items, but there it is.  I may have to ask Son to stop at the store to get more hamburger.  Looks like toward the end of the week I will be writing less about canning and doing more of it instead.  That's a good thing for me!"},
{"title": "Canning Series - Meat", "date": "Sunday, March 13, 2016", "text": "I like having jars of canned meat on my pantry shelves.  I usually can the meat plain and then add it to whatever meal I am cooking.  By doing it that way, I have many more options than if I canned meat seasoned for a particular dish.I think I use more ground beef than any other canned meat.  When I first started canning ground beef, I browned it, packed it into pint jars, added either water or beef broth and pressure canned it.  I wasn't happy with the results.  It seemed to me to turn out sort of the consistency of dog food and didn't taste much better, either.So I tried a different method and have been using it ever since.  I brown the hamburger, drain off the grease and pack it into pint jars but do not add any liquid.  I wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth or paper towel dipped in white vinegar.  The vinegar cuts any grease left on the rims that could cause the jars to fail to seal.  I add the lids and rings and process the pints for 75 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure.  The pressure amount is according to your altitude and is usually listed in the pressure canner instruction manual..Hamburger canned this way turns out just like hamburger you would brown and use in any dish.  About one pound of meat will fit into a pint jar.   I have never tried canning hamburger in quart jars, but quart jars of any meat are processed for 90 minutes.Beef, pork, venison and ham are all canned the same way.  If you want roasts, cut the meat into large chunks, packing 4 or 5 chunks in each pint jar.  Bigger pieces can be used in quart jars.  Some will sear the meat before packing into jars, but I just pack mine raw without any liquid.  It is a personal preference as to whether or not to add liquid - either way is good.  Process pints for 75 minutes and quarts for 90 minutes.  For use in dishes like beef stew or barbecue pork sandwiches or scalloped potatoes and ham, I cut the meat into about one inch cubes and then proceed the same way as for roasts.    Sometimes I will can a few half pint jars of meat cubes.  These are just the right size to use in sandwich spreads.I have successfully canned meatballs.  I make up my favorite meatball recipe and form into about golf ball sized meatballs.  I lay them out on a cookie sheet and bake them until they are browned.  Then I pack them into pint jars.  Sometimes I will cover them with beef broth and sometimes I will dilute cream of mushroom soup in a ratio of one can of soup to one can of water, ladle the soup over the meatballs and process.  This way I have a choice of using plain meatballs in dishes like spaghetti and meatballs or using the soup covered ones for meatballs and gravy.I can chicken a bit differently.  Sometimes I will fill wide mouth quart jars with chicken pieces like drumsticks or thighs, cover with water and process.  The wide mouth jars make it easier to remove the chicken pieces from the jars.  If I want large chunks of chicken breast, I will cut the chicken into pieces, pack them into jars and cover with water or broth.  When I want small pieces of chicken breast to use in stews or casseroles, I will bake the boneless, skinless chicken breasts until they are cooked through and then cut them into one inch pieces, pack them into jars and cover with water or broth.  Some will raw pack chicken, but I like the results better using a liquid.  I also can some smaller pieces in half pint jars for sandwich spreads.At holiday time when turkey goes on sale I will buy several.  I get these ready to can two ways.The first way is to roast the turkey same as for Thanksgiving dinner.  I have only one large roaster pan, so when one turkey is done I will roast another right away.  When both are fully cooked, I will take the meat from the bones and refrigerate it.  Then I take the bones and cook them down for broth.  After that, I cut up the turkey meat, pack it into jars, cover the meat with the broth and process. The second method is to cut up the thawed turkeys as if I were cutting up a whole chicken.  The pieces go into stock pots and I add water to cover the meat.  I bring the water to a boil and then simmer the meat until it is cooked through.  I remove the meat from the bones, cut it up into small pieces and pack it into jars.  I strain the broth from simmering the turkey and ladle it over the meat and process.I have also filled quart jars about half full of shredded turkey and added broth to within one inch of the jar rim.  This is canned for the same time and pressure.  This makes a really quick, easy and good tasting base for turkey soup.  Sometimes I will dump a quart of soup base into a kettle, add a pint of mixed vegetables, thicken the broth and serve it over biscuits or rice.Bacon is a good thing to have canned.  There are videos on YouTube that have instructions for canning slices of bacon by first wrapping the slices in parchment paper.  I have not tried this as yet because bacon at my local stores is now over $5 for a pound.  Instead I can bacon bits.  I buy the boxes of bacon ends and pieces, cut the bacon into about one inch pieces and lightly brown the pieces in a frying pan.  After I drain off the grease (I save the grease for cooking.) I pack the bits into half pint jars and process for 75 minutes.  I use the bacon bits mixed in with scrambled eggs or sprinkled over a green salad or in one of those breakfast casseroles - anywhere I would use crumbled fried bacon.Sausage is canned the same as ground beef.  I use it in any recipe that calls for sausage browned and crumbled.  Some say that the sage in sausage seasoning will turn bitter in the canning process, but I have not found that to be the case so far.  I usually buy Jimmy Dean rolls of sausage at Sams Club or when it is on sale at the grocery. I'm adding a recipe here with the disclaimer that I have not yet tried it, but it sounds really good and when I have time, I think I will give it a go.  I like sweet/sour food and I think this would be good over rice.Sweet and Sour Chicken4.5 lbs chicken,boneless, skinless, thighs and breasts cut in bite sized pieces2 large green peppers chopped1 large red pepper chopped2 onions chopped3 20 oz cans pineapple chunks drained, reserve juice3/4 cup brown sugar1 1/4 cups white vinegar6 tablespoons soy sauce4 tablespoons ketchup1 tsp gingerLayer the chicken, onions, peppers and pineapple in quart jars.Heat the brown sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, ketchup, ginger, and 3 cups of pineapple juice (add water if there is not enough) and bring to a light boil until the sugar is dissolved.Pour liquid over the solids in the jar to the fill line.Pressure can for 90 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure or according to your elevation.If there is leftover sauce, it could be canned in a Boiling Water Bath for 10 minutes.  I think I would can it in half pint jars for use in other dishes.And that's probably more information than you all needed about canning meats!"},
{"title": "You know how sometimes you get busy... ", "date": "Thursday, March 10, 2016", "text": "with one thing and other things are neglected?  Well, that's what has happened here in my little apartment.  I've been working on turning all those bags of cranberries in my freezer into juice and canning them.  And while in the middle of that, I ran out of quart canning jars.  I had some dry foods like rice and cornmeal and instant mashed potatoes stored in quart jars, so it became necessary to empty all that into freezer bags.  Now I have enough quart jars for a while, but I also have several boxes of rice and cornmeal and instant mashed potatoes in freezer bags that need a place to live, so it is necessary to rearrange my shelf full of dehydrated foods in order to make room to put away the stuff in bags.  It's a vicious circle, I tell you.And then there is my kitchen.  I'm really not quite sure how so much cranberry pulp and cranberry juice wound up on my floor and on other surfaces, but there it is.  And my stove top has gone from slightly dirty to downright disgusting.  Something needs to be done about all of it.So I am taking Thursday and Friday to see if I can't get things back in order.  I'm not as young as I once was, so it takes me longer to accomplish what I need to do, but it will be done.  I just can't stand a mess.And I have decided that because I am usually busy with homemaker kinds of things during the week, I am taking the weekend to do something fun.  I haven't done anything crafty for a long time and I watched a couple of videos while waiting for the cranberries to cook down.  They were about an easy method of making scrapbook-type photo albums, which is something I want to try.  I have the supplies on hand so I think I will get them out and play.I'll be back on Monday with more in the Canning series.  In the meantime, I wonder where I put my mop..."},
{"title": "Canning Series - Jam and Jelly", "date": "Wednesday, March 9, 2016", "text": "There is something about homemade jam or jelly that brings back memories of Mom in the kitchen in the summer.  We made all sorts of jams and jellies using strawberries and raspberries we raised in our garden, from the wild plums we gathered and from our apple trees.  I think the only flavor of jelly we bought was grape, and that was because we didn't have our own grape vines.These days I make mostly jam from fruit bought in season, either at the grocery or the Farmers Market.  I use powdered Sure Jell in jam making.  Included in each box is a page of instructions for all the basic flavors, so I will not list all of those here.  I also don't make apple butter.  I probably would if I had my own apples, but it gets a bit spendy when I have to buy the apples.I will mention that it is not a good idea to double jam recipes.  The last time I got in a hurry and tried that, I wound up with several jars of strawberry topping that was supposed to be strawberry jam.  Doubling the recipe causes the jam to fail to set up most times.So here are some of the jams and jellies I make that are not the traditional flavors.Apple Jam (Makes 8 half pint jars)1 1/2 cups of water5 cups of finely chopped apples (you can put it in the food processor)1 Tbsp of butter (optional - to help keep down the foam)1 box of pectin (or liquid pouch)2 Tbsp of lemon juice5 1/2 cups of sugarPour the water into a heavy saucepan, and add the butter, apples, pectin and lemon juice. Bring to a full rolling boil on high heat, stirring constantly. Quickly add the sugar and return to a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down; then boil, stirring, for 2 minutes.Remove from heat and skim off any foam.If preparing jam for the pantry, ladle into one hot jar at a time, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wipe jar rims with a clean, damp cloth. Attach lid. Fill and close remaining jars. Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.If preparing for freezer or refrigerator, ladle the jam into clean jars (or freezer containers, leaving 1/2-inch headspace); apply lids. Let stand for 12 to 24 hours at room temperature; freeze or refrigerate.Frozen Orange Juice JellyYield: 6 Half Pint jars.2 (6 oz.) cans frozen orange juice concentrate2 1/2 cups water4 1/2 cups sugar1 pkg powdered pectinThoroughly mix orange juice concentrate with water and powdered pectin in a large saucepan.Stir constantly over high heat until it begins to boil.Immediately add sugar and stir well.Bring to a full, rolling boil and boil hard 1 minute, stirring constantly.Remove from heat.Skim, pour into jars.  Fill to within 1/2 inch of top.Put on cap, screw band firmly tight.Process in Boiling Water Bath 5 minutes.Kool-Aid Jelly1 package Kool-Aid, any flavor (no sugar added)1 package Sure-Jell3 cups granulated sugar3 cups waterMix water, Sure-Jell and Kool-Aid together.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.Stir in sugar. Stir and bring to a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down. Boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly.Remove from heat. Quickly skim off foam with a large metal spoon. Pour into jelly jars.  Process in a Boiling Water Bath for 10 minutes.Note:  I have made this using cherry, raspberry and black cherry flavored Kool-Aid.  All were good tasting.Quick Grape Jelly  (Yield: about 5 half-pints.)3 cups bottled grape juice 1 package powdered pectin4 cups sugarCombine grape juice and pectin in a large sauce pot.Bring mixture to a rolling boil.Stir in sugar and return to a rolling boil.Boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly.Remove from heat.Skim foam if necessary.Ladle hot jelly into hot jars, leaving 1/4th inch headspace.Process 5 minutes in a boiling water canner.I have not made this next one, but I am including the recipe just because it sounds really good and I plan to make some this summer.Spiced Tomato Preserves  (Makes 5 half pints)       3 c. prepared tomatoes (2 1/4 lb.)1/4 c. lemon juice4 1/2 c. sugar1 box sure-jell fruit pectin1 1/2 tsp. grated lemon rind1/2 tsp. cinnamon1/2 tsp. allspice1/4 tsp. ground clovesScald, peel and chop tomatoes. Cover and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Measure 3 cups into a 6 or 8 quart sauce pot. Add lemon juice, grated lemon rind, allspice, cinnamon and ground cloves to tomatoes. Add a bit of butter (about 1/2 tsp) here, if using, to reduce foam. Measure sugar and set aside.Stir sure-jell fruit pectin into prepared tomatoes. (Sauce pot must be no more than 1/3 full to allow for a full rolling boil.) NOTE: The Sure-Jell folks suggest mixing the pectin with some of the sugar (like the odd 1/2 cup) to insure a better mix and adding that small amount of sugar/pectin mixture in at the beginning of the cooking process.Bring to a full boil over high heat, stirring constantly. All at once stir in sugar. Stir and bring to a full rolling boil (a boil that cannot be stirred down). Then boil hard 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.Skim off foam with large metal spoon. Immediately ladle into hot clean jars, leaving 1/4 inch space at top. With a damp cloth, wipe jar rims and threads clean.Immediately cover jars with lids. Screw bands on firmly. Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.I'm also including the following recipe for chokecherry jelly, even though it has been more years than I care to remember since I have made it.  When I lived in northern Minnesota, the woods behind my house had an abundance of chokecherry trees that were loaded with the tiny cherries late in the summer.  It took lots and lots of chokecherries to make a batch of jelly, but the result was so worth the effort.Chokecherry JellyWash the fruit in cool running water.Add water to cover the chokecherries.Bring to a boil in a covered stainless steel or enamel kettle and then simmer for 15 minutes, or until soft.Cool and strain through cheesecloth or a damp jelly bag.Note:  When extracting juice from chokecherries, DO NOT crush the seeds. These seeds contain a cyanide-forming compound which can cause illness or death if eaten in large amounts.Chokecherry Jelly Recipe3 cups chokecherry juice6 1/2 cups sugar1 box pectinPour juice into large heavy saucepan. Add sugar and stir to mix. Place over high heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Stir in pectin. Bring to a full, rolling boil and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Stir and skim off foam for 5 minutes. Pour jelly into hot, half-pint jars to 1/4 inch of top and seal with two-piece canning lids.  Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.Back when I was making chokecherry jelly, maybe 40 years ago, we never used canning lids for jam or jelly.  We poured the jam into jelly jars and let them cool.  Then we melted paraffin wax and poured a layer of the wax on top to seal the jars.  It worked, except once in a great while the wax would come loose from the inside wall of the jar and a thin layer of mold would form on top of the jam.  We just scraped the mold off and ate the jam anyway.  Nowdays there are those who would have an instant case of the vapors at the thought of such things.  I guess we were a lot tougher then, and a lot poorer, so we didn't waste a jar of jam just because of a bit of mold on top.  :)"},
{"title": "Canning Series - Fruit", "date": "Tuesday, March 8, 2016", "text": "Fruit doesn't need to be pressure canned.  It can be canned using the Boiling Water Bath method, which is placing jars of fruit in a pot, adding enough water to cover the jars by at least 1 inch, bringing the water to a boil and boiling it for the required time.  There should be a rack of some sort in the bottom of the pot to keep the jars from touching the bottom.  I use my pressure canner with the rack that came with it.  And I use the lid for it, but make sure it is set on top of the canner cattywampus so that it can not and does not slide all the way closed, thus building up unwanted pressure.  How do I know about the lid?  I'll tell you.My Auntie Emily was cooking up a batch of vegetable soup prior to canning it, using the biggest pot she had, which was her pressure canner.   She set the lid on the canner while the soup was simmering, but didn't pay attention how she set it there.  The lid slipped down onto the rim of the canner and the pressure built up.  And BLAM!  She said she spent the rest of the day cleaning vegetable soup off the stove.  And the walls.  And the floor.  And the cupboards.  And the ceiling.  Luckily, she was out of the room when the lid blew off.  That is the one and only time I have ever known a lid to blow off a pressure canner and then it was only being used as a stock pot.  If I am going to be out of the kitchen while the water is boiling to can fruit, I will put my largest cookie sheet on top of the canner instead of using the lid.  Otherwise I use the lid set off center so it can't slip, but have learned to be careful and keep a close eye on it.I'm not going to go into the basic canning of fruits.  I usually can peaches, pears, apricots and cherries if I can get them at a decent price.  All are canned in a simple sugar and water syrup or in plain water and are processed in a Boiling Water Bath.  The directions typically come with the canner instruction booklet and there are a ton of websites with tutorials.  One website I keep bookmarked is the \"National Center for Home Food Preservation\" which gives basic instructions.I get cranberries in 25 lb. boxes from the Farmers Market.  The vendor that sells them always has absolutely beautiful berries.  Here are a couple of uses for them.Cranberry Juice4 quarts (4 pounds) cranberriesWater2-1/2 cups granulated sugarBring cranberries and 4 quarts water to a simmer in a large pot. Simmer 5 minutes, or until most berries burst.Pour berries and juice into a colander or large strainer set over a large pot or bowl.  Let juice drip into the bowl.When you have extracted as much juice as possible from the pulp, return pulp to the cooking pot with 2 quarts water.  Return to a boil and simmer 2 minutes.Pour this pulp and juice again through the colander to extract remaining juice.   Combine both batches of juice.At this point I will pour the juice through a colander lined with three layers of cheesecloth.  This gets rid of any remaining pulp.Add sugar to suit your taste* and 1 more quart water. Heat to dissolve sugar completely, but do not boil.Pour the juice into clean, hot jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.  Wipe the rims and add lids and rings.Process in boiling water bath for 15 minutes.Yields 6 to 7 quarts. *The original recipe called for 3-1/2 cups of sugar but I found that was too sweet for my taste.  2-1/2 cups is just right for me, but you might want to adjust the amount according to your own tastes.Note:  My son usually gets 50 lbs. of berries at the Market.  That's a lot of berries!  So this year I measured them out into gallon freezer bags and froze them.  That way I could take out a couple of bags at a time.  I didn't thaw them but just poured them into a stock pot with the water and proceeded from there.  It wasn't so overwhelming to process the berries a little at a time.Cranberry Sauce - Fresh or to Can(Recipe can be doubled, tripled or more.)1 cup water1 cup sugar3 cups cranberries (1 bag)Bring water and sugar to a boil. Add cranberries, return to a boil. Turn down and simmer for 10 minutes.Pour into jars. Remove air bubbles, wipe rims. Place lids on and can for 15 minutes in a boiling water bath canner.This makes the kind of cranberry sauce that has pieces of cranberry in it.  I have never made the jellied kind.  I can these in half pint jars for my own use and in pint jars for when there are more people. ApplesauceApplesauce is kind of a staple in my house.  I like it with a meal or when I just want a bit of a snack.  And I use it in cakes, cookies, muffins, etc.  Sometimes I get apples from the Farmers Market and sometimes they come from a small apple orchard nearby that sells \"seconds.\"  The apples aren't pretty like the ones in the store.  They may be odd shaped or have a blemish or two on the skin, but they are delicious.I have one of these handy, dandy apple peeler/corer/slicer gadgets.  Last I looked, they were about $20 at Fleet Farm.  They are worth every penny.I just run the apples through the gadget and put them in a stock pot with a little bit of water to keep them from sticking to the bottom of the pot.  They are cooked over a medium low heat until the slices are soft.  I add sugar, either brown or white sugar to taste.  The last applesauce I made didn't need sugar at all.  I like applesauce that has chunks of apples in it.  Son likes the smooth applesauce, so I make both.  To make the applesauce smooth I just cool it down some and run it through the blender.  I can most of it in half pint jars.  That is a good amount for a meal for one and a good size for Son to take in his lunch.  I also can some in pint jars and it can be canned in quarts as well.  All three sized jars are processed in a Boiling Water Bath for 20 minutes.Spiced applesauce can be made by adding allspice or cinnamon to taste along with the sugar.  I have also taken some of the cranberry pulp left in the cheesecloth from straining cranberry juice and added that to the applesauce for a different flavor.  Add the cranberry pulp and sugar to taste.Strawberry Rhubarb Sauce1-1/2 pounds rhubarb4 cups strawberries1 to 1-1/2 cups sugar1/4 cup water2 teaspoons lemon juiceThoroughly wash rhubarb and strawberries.  Cut rhubarb into 1-inch pieces, making 5 cups. Remove hulls from strawberries; halve large berries.  In a large kettle or Dutch oven combine rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, water, and lemon juice.  Bring fruit to boiling; boil 1/2 minute.*Pack hot fruit and syrup into hot jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.  Adjust lids.  Process in boiling water bath (half-pints and pints) 15 minutes.  Makes 7 half-pints.  Recipe can be doubled.*This recipe says cook for 1/2 minute, but I cooked it a little longer until the rhubarb had cooked down just a bit and was completely tender.Note:  Strawberry Rhubarb Sauce is good as a dessert sauce, but it is really good over vanilla ice cream.And that is enough for today.  :)"},
{"title": "Canning Series - Beans", "date": "Monday, March 7, 2016", "text": "I've lately been going through the recipes stored on my computer.  I am a recipe junkie, so there are lots of them.  But I need to get realistic about them, so I am discarding those that might sound wonderful but require extra shopping for ingredients that I ordinarily would not have in my pantry and those that are fiddly to make.  I don't do fiddly.So I thought I might share some of the recipes I have used and found to be good, starting with the canning recipes.  Some of you are experienced home canners, but I find there are many who fear the process.  I think this fear comes from the horror stories about Grandma blowing up her pressure canner which resulted in needing a new roof put on the house.  I'm here to tell you that in the 55 years I have been canning food, I have never known anyone who blew up a pressure canner.  It is just a matter of following the instructions to the letter.  There are safety features built into pressure canners, like the rubber plug in the lid that will blow out should the pressure inside the canner reach unsafe levels, bringing the pressure down long before the lid blows off.  That's not to say there isn't a learning curve.  There is, but it isn't rocket science.  It is mostly common sense. There are many reasons to home can.  If you are able to have a garden, canning is a good way to preserve the harvest.  Those who can't garden, like myself, can find good, locally grown food at Farmer's Markets, where I get most of the fruit and some of the vegetable I can.  I have also canned frozen vegetables from the grocery.  I buy them when they go on sale.  This makes sense for me.  It is easier for me to store vegetables in jars.  I can them in pint and half pint jars, so there is no waste.  Those with larger families can process vegetables in quart jars.  And my freezer space is then available for other things and I can stock up without worrying about freezer burn.I have noticed that cans of pork and beans from the grocery have changed somewhat.  Some companies have kept the price the same but have made the cans smaller.  Others have reduced the amount of beans in the can but have added more sauce.  By canning my own, I get the taste of home baked pork and beans and I know just how much is in each jar.  Here are the recipes I have used with good results.Pork and Beans to Can2 qts. dried navy or other smaller beans1 lb. ham, cut into about one inch pieces*6 large onions, diced (3 onions were enough for me)1 1/2 cups brown sugar4 tsp. salt4 tsp. dry mustard1 1/3 cups molassesSort beans, rinse, then cover with 6 quarts fresh water.  Let stand overnight in a cool place and then drain.  Cover beans with 6 quarts water in large stockpot. Bring to boil and then reduce heat.  Cover and simmer until skins begin to crack. Drain, reserving liquid. Pour beans into a very large baking dish.  I use a turkey roaster pan.  Add ham, and remaining ingredients and 8 cups reserved liquid. Ladle sauce over beans.  Cover and bake at 350 degrees for about 3 hours. During baking, add water or cooking liquid as needed.  You want them a bit watery. Pack hot beans and sauce into hot jars, leaving 1 inch of headspace.  De-bubble jars, wipe the rims with  damp paper towel or cloth and add lids and rings.  Process pints for 80 minutes and quarts for 95 minutes at 10 pounds pressure, or at the pressure recommended for your altitude.*Some use pieces of fried bacon or salt pork.  Others may have found this satisfactory, but it has been my experience that bacon gets sort of limp and a bit slimy when canned with beans.  Ham adds flavor but retains its texture.Easy Canned Pork and Beans2 lbs. of dried Navy BeansSauce:6 cups water1 cup molasses1 cup brown sugar2 tsp.ground mustard1 Tbsp. saltPut dried beans in a large pot and cover well with water.  Bring to a boil and cook for 1 hour.  Keep water level deep enough to keep the beans covered. Turn off heat and let soak for 2 hours.  Drain and rinse the beans in a colander.  Divide the beans into canning jars filling the jars about 2/3 full of the beans.Sauce:Mix all ingredients together and heat well to dissolve the brown sugar.  Pour over the beans in the jars, leaving 1 inch head space below the jar rims.  Run a table knife or wooden spoon handle through the beans to get rid of any air bubbles and to distribute the sauce evenly.  Wipe the jar rims and add lids and rings.Process in a pressure canner.  Pint jars are processed for 65 minutes. Quart jars are processed for 75 minutes.This recipe will make about 20 pints of beans.Canning Dry Beans(This recipe from Jackie Clay at Backwoods Home Magazine)\"Dry beans are very handy, canned up, as you don’t have to soak them overnight or cook them for lengthy periods to eat them. All dry beans are canned the same way. I first boil my dry beans in plenty of water and let them sit for 2 hours. Then I pack them and process them as usual. This means heat the beans and liquid to boiling, then drain, saving liquid. Pack jars 3/4 full with hot beans, add small pieces of fried lean bacon or ham, if desired, then fill with hot cooking liquid, leaving 1 inch of headspace. Process pints for 75 minutes and quarts for 90 minutes. — Jackie\"I have used all three of these recipes with success.  Hope you find them helpful."},

{"title": "Early Spring Cleaning", "date": "Tuesday, February 23, 2016", "text": "I've been looking to get rid of my queen sized bed and replace it with something smaller.  Perhaps a daybed.  Oldest Son finally decided that if he could slide the box spring and mattress down the hall, maneuver it around the corner and into his apartment, he would take it.  That was accomplished Sunday evening.It has been a good, comfortable bed.  But instead of the spring sitting on a regular bed frame, it sat on a wood base that didn't allow for any under-the-bed storage.  And because the only space for my shelves that hold my home canned foods is in my bedroom, things were getting a bit cramped.  And maybe with more space I could fit in the small quilt frame I have been lusting after.  No room anywhere else for it.Anyway, this seemed to be a good time to do some early spring cleaning.  I haven't been able to move the bed by myself to clean behind it.  That was glaringly obvious when the bed left my apartment.Sometimes the cat I had would disappear - especially when someone other than me was in my apartment.  I never could find where she was hiding.  Even a couple of years ago when there was a fire in the building, the firemen rescued the dogs I had at the time, but couldn't find the cat even though they took more risks than they should have in the effort.Now I know where she hid out.  There was a vast amount of cat hair in the tiny space between the head of the bed and the wall.  How she managed to wedge her fat self in there without getting stuck is beyond me.  I think I vacuumed up enough cat hair to build a whole new cat.So spring cleaning is coming early this year.  I need to wipe down the wall and woodwork and run the carpet cleaning machine over the carpet.  It is kind of nice to have a head start on that project.  Looking on the bright side, I am already nearly done with two-thirds of the spring cleaning!"},
{"title": "Rain.  Really?", "date": "Friday, February 19, 2016", "text": "This morning I awoke to a strange sound.  Took me a few minutes to realize it was the sound of rain.Whoa, Nellie!  Rain.  Really?This is Minnesota.  This is February.  We should be hip deep in snow now. Dad's car after a snowstorm in the early 1950s.This is the land of winter carnivals and ice castles and snow sculptures.  We live and breathe ice fishing contests and snowmobile races.    This is the time of year when ski masks are used not to hide identity while robbing a bank but worn to keep faces from freezing off.  The season when by the time we bundle the kids up enough to send them outside to build a snowman, they have so many layers of clothing on they can barely walk.  That is a typical Minnesota winter.I take a look out my living room window.  Any traces of snow have vanished.  There are puddles of water in the alley across the street.  The weather forecast tells me that by this afternoon the temperature will be nearing 50 degrees.  Predictions are for well above freezing temperatures for this coming week.I am not complaining.  I am not fond of winter.  But I feel for those who count on a typical Minnesota winter to make their money.  The ski resorts and sellers of snowmobiles and snowshoes can't be doing well right now.  Those towns that host the usual winter celebrations and activities have to be hurting.  And the folks who spend a typical winter plowing and shoveling snow have to be having a really bad year.And then I remember that winter here is not over - not by a long shot.  We still have March on the horizon.  March is the month where Mother Nature shows her mean side.  About the time we think Spring is just around the corner, a March blizzard will smack us upside the head and remind us that winter isn't done with us just yet.  Here we have the Minnesota State High School Basketball Tournament blizzards.  In the middle of the tournaments held in March each year, we could pretty much count on excessive snow and wind to either slow down the event or bring the games to a screeching halt. So I guess I will wait a bit longer before packing away the wool socks and long johns.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if this warm weather spell is just Mother Nature's way of setting us up for another icy winter blast.  Some say Mother Nature has a sense of humor and I will agree with that notion.  However, that perverse sense of humor in the month of March usually doesn't bode well for we Minnesotans."},
{"title": "The Attention Span of a Gnat", "date": "Wednesday, February 17, 2016", "text": "Yep.  That would be me.Everyone has their morning routines.  Mine is basically stumbling into the kitchen and making a pot of coffee.  I am completely useless until I have at least two or three cups of coffee in me.  And don't even try to talk to me before then.  I snarl.Coffee mug in hand, I will usually fire up my computer.  I'll check the news stories of the day and see what the weather has in store for my area.  I'll see if I have any email and then move on to reading some of the blogs I enjoy.  But somewhere in the middle of that my inner gnat grabs me.This morning for whatever unknown reason, my glance caught sight of the basket I keep my latest crochet project in, which led me off the blogs and into a search for sales on yarn.  When you crochet (or knit) you always \"need\" more yarn.From there I jumped to a couple of YouTube channels about scrapbooking.  I have been toying with the notion of making some scrapbook-type recipe organizers to use up some of the scrapbooking supplies in my stash and sure enough, I found a video on the subject.  Which killed another 15 minutes and another cup of coffee.Then I checked Facebook.  I rarely if ever post anything there.  I check to see if my kids have posted any photos I might want to steal.  And now and then those same kids will post something that makes me laugh.  I am so glad they all were blessed with functioning senses of humor.About that time I notice that a couple of hours have passed.  Well, crud.  I am still in my jammies and there are things I want to do today.  So after I have dressed and made myself presentable enough so I don't scare bejeebers out of anyone who might see me, I get busy.Unfortunately, that gnat's attention span is still with me.Take the other day, for example.  I was busy rearranging the shelves that hold my home canned food, trying to find more space to store the jars that are in boxes on the floor due to lack of space on the shelves.  While stacking jars of applesauce it occurs to me that an applesauce spice cake with caramel frosting sure would taste good.  So I take a jar of the applesauce to the kitchen.  And decide I need to find the recipe.  I sit at the table with my box of recipes and start looking for the one for applesauce spice cake.  And then the one for caramel frosting.  At which point I'm not sure if I have any powdered sugar.  While checking the cupboard for powdered sugar I decide that cupboard really needs to be cleaned so I can see what is on the top shelf toward the back.  Which leads me to finding a box of those paper cupcake liners.  Which gets me to thinking about maybe baking some blueberry muffins to have for breakfast the next day.  And on and on it goes.I'm not so sure any more if it is that attention span thing.  Seems like it could be one of those \"Oh, look!  Squirrel!\" things.Whatever the reasons, I guess I will just live with it.  At least I am never bored."},
{"title": "Having Fun", "date": "Monday, February 15, 2016", "text": "The headlines are grim.  The world is chaotic.  Senseless violence is on the upswing.  And politicians give a whole new meaning to the word corruption.  Sometimes I need to just back away before my head explodes.So this weekend I did some work entering data into my genealogy program.  Part of that time was spent sorting through pictures, deciding which ones I wanted to add.  While doing that I found some that reminded me of the fun that happened when my parents and their siblings got together.This is my Dad and his sister, Clarice.  There was a special bond between them that lasted over 90 years.  It began when they were children.Close to the ends of their lives they both lived in the same nursing home in the small town not 10 miles from the farm where they grew up.  Clarice's memory went away and Dad's body wore out.  But their senses of humor remained intact.My cousin told me this story about the brother and sister.  Both used wheelchairs.  Some days they, along with other residents, sat in their chairs and did exercises to help maintain upper body mobility.  Seated side by side they dutifully did the required exercises.  Until Dad would reach over and tap Clarice on the back of the head.  They would continue on until Clarice's arm would shoot out sideways, smacking Dad lightly on the shoulder.  This went on, both of them looking straight ahead, doing their level best to maintain a straight face.  Until the physical therapist said, \"You two Matheny kids behave yourselves,\" and they would dissolve into laughter.About 15 years ago Dad gave me a cardboard box of old family photos.  They weren't in albums but were just loose in the box.  I spent hours going through them, sorting and remembering.  While trying to bring the pictures to some sort of order, I found this.Curiosity got the best of me and I called Dad.  I explained that I had found a picture of somebodys backside.  I said I recognized the stairs in the photo as being the ones attached to my Grandma's house in St. Paul.  But I wanted to know about the picture.  Dad chuckled and then told me about it.Dad and Mom grew up within 10 miles of each other.  Dad knew Mom's family all of his life.  He was always on good terms with Mom's brother and her five sisters.  On the day that photo was taken, Mom's sister Margaret was teasing Dad about something long since forgotten.  Dad, being Dad, could not let the teasing go unchallenged, so he countered with a smart remark of his own.  At this point Margaret proceeded to express her disdain of his remark.  And Dad snapped the picture.After I was able to bring my own laughter under control, I asked Dad why on earth he had kept that photo for well over 50 years.  He said it reminded him of the fun that happened when they were all together.  Dad and Mother's family remained close for the rest of their lives.This is a much better picture of Margaret!You might say that those of my parent's generation lived at a time when America was still America and their freedoms were still intact, so it must have been easier for them to laugh and have fun.  Really?Those people lived through two world wars and at the end of the second one, they had all their illusions about humanity shattered with the news of the concentration camps in Europe.  There was hardly a family that escaped losing a loved one in the wars.  They lived through the Great Depression where people couldn't find work and where folks were lined up on city streets to get their only meal of the day at soup kitchens.  Their lives were no walk in the park.One evening maybe 20 years ago I sat with my Dad on the balcony of his apartment, watching the sunset and enjoying the cool of the evening.  We had talked of many things, including the shenanigans of the children in his large family.  I asked him how it was that they could keep a sense of humor during such hard times.  He said humor was what kept them going.  If they could find something worth laughing about, it didn't change anything, but the cares of the world didn't seem quite so bad.Dad was a pretty smart cookie."},
{"title": "Staying in Touch with Family", "date": "Friday, February 12, 2016", "text": "You know how sometimes you just lose touch with people?  Not their fault.  Not your fault.  Just happens.My Mother's side of the family is spread out.  I grew up knowing cousins who were descendants of her Father.  But many of my cousins who were descended from my Grandfather's siblings and who lived at the time of my youth in Minnesota, I did not know and never met.  I have no idea why my branch of the family was separate from the other branches.  I suspect there is some back story there, but I have never found it.Anyway, one of these long lost cousins and I found each other when I was actively tracing my family tree.  We emailed each other regularly.  Then when I became interested in other things, the genealogy got set on the back burner and the emails slowed down and finally stopped.  No particular reason.  We were on good terms with each other.  We just sort of drifted on.Well, this morning when I checked my email, I found one from her.  What a lovely surprise.  There was no particular reason for it - just to say hello and tell me what she had been doing and ask how I was.  I emailed her back right away, bringing her up to speed on my family and letting her know that in spite of this thing called aging, I was still as mean and ornery as always.  :)My cousin lives on the East Coast.  She mentioned that the blizzard a couple of weeks ago had dumped about three feet of snow on them.  She works at  local grocery store and she said that a day or so before the storm hit, the grocery shelves were pretty much emptied.  Can't say that surprised me much.  Same thing happens here before a bad storm is due to roar through.That email served to remind me how important it is to stay in touch with family.  Granted, all of us have the Crazy Uncle Louie or the Weird Cousin Jane that we kind of wish were related to someone other than us, but that's not the case here.  I don't remember ever meeting her in person and we have communicated mostly through emails, but even so, I really like my cousin Jackie.  And I am glad she took the time to write.I need to do a better job of staying in touch with my family."},
{"title": "How to Waste a Couple of Perfectly Good Days", "date": "Wednesday, February 10, 2016", "text": "I have lately been on a quest to make my own convenience foods.  Or to at least find quicker methods of making some of the foods I use often.  Here is what I learned.First I tried a couple of recipes I found for making your own rice side dishes.  I like those Knorr Rice Sides and Rice-A-Roni.  I like them once in a while with a meal instead of potatoes or sometimes I will add my canned chicken or beef to them for a skillet type meal.  So I followed the recipes and made both a chicken flavor and a beef flavor rice mix.  I added meat to half a batch and left the other half plain.  And I have to report that I didn't much care for any of it.  Both the homemade mixes were bland and sort of tasteless.  Even doctoring them up didn't help much.  Given a choice between the homemade mixes and the store bought, I would choose the store bought for flavor every time.I had seen posts on a couple of food and preparedness blogs about making baking powder biscuit dough and freezing the biscuits to be baked later.  Thinking that might work well for me, I followed the instructions, using a recipe included in the blog post for one batch, using the Bisquick recipe for another batch and finally using my tried and true biscuit recipe for the third.  I mixed the dough, rolled it out and cut the biscuits.  I put the raw biscuits on parchment lined cookie sheets and popped them into the freezer.  When frozen, I bagged and labeled each batch and back into the freezer they went.  The instructions said to bake them, just place the frozen biscuits on a baking sheet and bake as usual.  So I took two biscuits from each bag and put them on a parchment paper lined sheet, writing on the paper with a Sharpie so I wouldn't mix them up, and baked them.  When they came out of the oven, the first two would have made great substitutions for hockey pucks.  The biscuits made using my recipe were a little better, but not much.  They weren't nearly as light and fluffy as I like them but were more dense and heavy.So far, I'm not doing real well with these experiments.  But I had one more to try.I had found a YouTube series about making no-knead bread.  Thought it was worth trying.  I watched the videos and wrote down the recipes and instructions for a loaf of white bread and for rolls.  I followed the instructions to the letter.  The guy in the videos made it look so easy, and it was fairly quick and easy to mix the dough.  But when the loaf of bread came out of the oven, I found I had a really nice smelling door stop.  It was heavy and had a really tough crust, even after I brushed butter on the outside to soften it up a bit.  It didn't taste nearly as good as a loaf made the conventional way using my favorite recipe.  The rolls weren't any better.So that is how I managed to waste a couple of perfectly good days.  I suppose they weren't a total loss.  I learned that quick and easy isn't always a good thing.  I learned that sometimes substitutes for a dish like the rice sides can't be duplicated to taste like what I am used to.  And I learned that even though kneading bread takes time and energy, the results are well worth it.  I'm not trying to discourage anyone from trying any of these methods.  Could be Operator Error.  But personally, I found that for me, it just wasn't working.  I will continue to stock the store bought rice mixes and make bread and biscuits from scratch, the old fashioned way.So mostly I learned that if it ain't broke - don't fix it!"},
{"title": "Dad's Generation", "date": "Monday, February 8, 2016", "text": "My mind has been on my Dad lately.  Even though I was privileged to have him until he reached the age of 93 and even though he has been gone from us for eleven years, I still miss him every day.What set him on my mind today was some articles I read about the current entitlement generation.  Those who think someone else should pay for their food, their housing, their medical expenses, ad nauseam.  Add to that the myth of white privilege.  I'll tell you just how entitled and privileged my Dad and his generation were.Dad told me stories about when his family needed cash money.  Not just the Depression years, but all the time, for a farmer like my Grandfather on a sandy soil farm in northern Minnesota would never get rich.  Matter of fact, they would rarely get out of poverty.When Dad was old enough to do the work of a man, in the summer and fall, he and one or two of his brothers would go to the nearest town and catch a freight train going west.  No comfortable passenger cars for them.  A person had to have cash to ride the passenger cars.  They found an empty boxcar and rode it to the wheat fields of the Dakotas or Montana - wherever they could find work on threshing crews.  It was hard, hot, dirty work.  This website tells a little bit about it.  Once they managed to get places on a crew, they stayed as that threshing crew moved from farm to farm, threshing the wheat crop.  They kept out just enough of their wages for their basic needs and sent the rest to their parents. When threshing season was over, they looked for other jobs.  Most times they found jobs picking potatoes.  That was back breaking work, following behind the horse drawn machine that lifted the potatoes out of the ground, the men going after, picking up the potatoes, tossing them into buckets or baskets and filling gunnysacks.  This is a photo of a potato picker and although it is not my Dad, it could have been.My grandmother kept this postcard in her Bible.  It was written by my Dad in October of 1934.It reads:  \"Dear Mother,  Got here at Helena today and are going out on a potato picking job in the morning.  Ken (Dad's brother) went out on another potato job to nite.  Don't write cause I don't know how long we'll be here.  As always, Ralph (my Dad).Here's my point.  Dad's family needed money.  There was a little money to be made working in the woods in the winter, but no work in northern Minnesota in the summer and fall of the year.  The family raised chickens and hogs and milked a few cows.  They raised a big garden and foraged for berries and such in the summer.  But a large family still needed cash for what they couldn't produce themselves.They didn't expect anyone else to give them anything.  Dad and one or two of his brothers went where there was work to be had.  Another brother stayed home to help their Dad on the farm and after their Dad's  death in 1936, they saw to it that their Mother could stay in her home and saw to it she was cared for in her old age.  The girls helped their Mother garden and preserve food and bake bread.  When some of the girls were old enough, they earned teaching certificates and taught school to bring in money for the family.This life wasn't unique to my family.  Many, many other families across the country were working hard to keep a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs.  And they did it on their own, without standing in line for welfare benefits.  They would have been ashamed to ask for a handout.Take a look at this picture.That is my Dad at the top of the ladder.  That is his brother below him.  The picture was taken around 1920.   They are just oozing \"white privilege,\" aren't they.  And yet, I never once heard Dad complain about being poor.  And I never knew him to turn down a job because it involved hard work or getting dirty or didn't pay a king's ransom.  He was just happy to have work.I'm thinking that those who think they should have everything given to them should be introduced to the reality my Father's generation lived through.  His generation was comprised mostly of hard working, God fearing folks who did whatever it took to keep their families going.  They had pride in a job well done.  They considered a handshake as good a contract as any signed document.  They were the people who made America what it used to be.We sorely need more like them."},

Oldest son stopped in a few minutes ago.  His workplace had sent their employees home early.  Son said that not much was being accomplished anyway.  He said whenever he stopped his forklift, the tires would just spin when trying to move again. His drive between home and work normally takes a half hour.  This afternoon it took him an hour and 15 minutes.  There was maybe 5 inches of snow on the ground then, but it is heavy and wet, and where vehicle tires have packed it down it is just like ice.  He said there were very few places where there were no cars in the ditch and one point there was a car in the median and another across the road laying on its top.  At another point on the freeway the entire road was blocked by cars stuck in the snow.Son said he roared through the next town over at a whopping 15 mph.  Said he just slid through a couple of intersections here in town.  Said he was glad to be home.Methinks it is about time for a nice cup of cocoa."},
{"title": "Back to Basics", "date": "Monday, February 1, 2016", "text": "I admit it.  I got lazy.  I still bake the occasional loaf of bread, but mostly I have been ordering bread from the store in my every other week grocery delivery order.Until now.It has been nearly two weeks since my last grocery delivery.  At that time I stashed an extra loaf of store bought bread in the refrigerator.  Don't ask me why I didn't put it in the freezer.  I don't know.  I just didn't.  And it sort of got pushed to the back where it has languished for nearly two weeks.  Until this morning when I ran out of bread and remembered the stashed loaf.I fully expected that loaf to be hard, stale and likely growing all sorts of moldy stuff.  It wasn't.  It was still soft, had no stale smell or taste and there was nothing green growing anywhere on it.  That scared me.  I began to wonder just what the commercial bakers put in the dough to preserve it that long.  So I looked up the ingredients in commercially baked bread.  That scared me even more.  Look it up.  You will see what I mean.The way I look at it, those of my advancing years have enough health issues to contend with without filling up on food that contains stuff I can't begin to pronounce.  Anything that will keep a loaf of bread from turning stale and moldy after sitting out for two weeks can't possibly be good. So I crossed bread off my grocery order.  And tomorrow morning I will get back into my old routine of baking bread once a week.  It takes time and effort to do that, but I think it is well worth it.Incidentally, I went over the rest of my grocery order list and to my chagrin realized that bread wasn't the only thing I was ordering just for the sake of convenience.  So I reworked my order to include mostly fresh fruit and vegetables and the ingredients to make my own convenience foods.  I have a whole box of recipes for various mixes - from baking mixes to flavored rice mixes to seasoning mixes.  I have two large shelving units packed with jars of home canned meats, fruits and vegetables and more.  I have boxes full of dehydrated foods.  I have the ingredients stored to cook and bake nearly anything I want over at least one years time.  So I have no excuse for buying anything I can make myself.I have had a less than stellar January.  I find I am tired much of the time and haven't felt as good as I should.  It isn't just this cold I have been fighting lately.  It has been going on longer than that.  I can chalk part of it to the \"winter doldrums.\"  But I am willing to bet that if I get away from using store bought convenience foods and other commercially made foods like bread, I will start feeling better. It is way past time to get back to the basics."},

{"title": "Charlie Was a Good Old Dog", "date": "Thursday, January 28, 2016", "text": "Last evening I received a phone call that I knew was coming but did not want to hear.  My youngest son called to tell me that the time had come when the quality of life of their family dog, Charlie, had deteriorated to the point where the only option left was for their vet to help Charlie pass peacefully on to his reward.Charlie came into their lives over 15 years ago.  He was the cutest little bit of fur who endeared himself right off the bat by chewing up some of the woodwork in their rented house while they were at work.  Thankfully he outgrew that habit.Charlie was there to welcome each of the three children born to my son and his wife.  He was so good with the kids and they loved him dearly.I often thought his name should have been \"Hoover\" for he was like a mini vacuum cleaner, cruising the kitchen whenever there was a remote possibility that some stray piece of food would hit the floor.  This earned him jail time when meals were served.  I always felt sorry for him, so I would sneak him a treat whenever I could.  I don't think I was the only one.  Those eyes would get me every time.I babysat Charlie more than once when my son and his family were going out of town for a few days.  On one occasion, my son brought the large wire kennel for Charlie to use while I was at work.  Well, that didn't go over too big with Charlie.  I could hear him barking and howling all my way down the stairs and out to the street.  I was working at a dog grooming shop next door at the time, so I caved and brought him to work with me.  He was in his glory, meeting and greeting all those people and dogs who came to the shop that day.After a while my son wouldn't let me babysit Charlie any more.  He claimed that whenever Charlie stayed with me he gained 5 pounds.  I said it wasn't my fault that Charlie loved french fries.It doesn't seem fair that a dog's life span should be so short.  They give us so much more happiness than we can possibly give them.  They love us no matter what.  That's something we can't say about most people.Charlie, you were a good old dog.  You will be missed."},
{"title": "Another Fading Memory Surprise", "date": "Tuesday, January 26, 2016", "text": "I have a cold.  Nothing serious.  Just mildly irritating.  Caused me to sleep most of the day away.  Which causes me to be bright-eyed at 2 AM.  Good thing I am retired and don't have to explain my odd sleep patterns to a boss.  Or to anyone else, for that matter.  I have found that 2 AM is a good time for writing another blog post.I am maybe one of the few who actually likes being my advanced age.  Take for example this fading memory.  The other day I had finally dug my way to the back of my Fibber McGee's closet.  I had dragged out a tub full of fabric.  If you are one who sews, or more particularly, one who quilts, you have a stash of fabric.  And you never, ever throw any of it away, not even the scraps.  Because you might need it.....someday.  And if the fabric shop has a really good sale on cotton quilt fabric, you buy more.  Because you might need it.....someday.Anyway, about halfway through sorting and folding, I found these.Yep...my fading memory handed me 30 quilt blocks that I had completely forgotten about.  Once I saw them, it came back to me how I had cut the squares from a set of fat quarters that I bought a long time ago for a project long forgotten.  I had sewn the squares into simple blocks and then got busy with something else and had put them away.  So as soon as my nose unstuffs and I stop sneezing, I will sew the blocks together into a quilt top.  I'm sure I have fabric for the back, but I will need to make a run to the fabric store for quilt batting.  These blocks will make a nice sized quilt - just right for snuggling under on a cold winter evening.I just love this kind of surprise!"},
{"title": "Canning Apple Juice", "date": "Sunday, January 24, 2016", "text": "I like fruit juice.  So when a good brand of apple juice went on sale I bought 10 of the larger frozen cans.  I stored them in the fridge for a couple of days to thaw.  Then I made up all ten cans at once in my stock pot, heated the juice to the simmering point, ladled it into hot pint jars and processed them in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes, according to the instructions on the National Center for Home Food Preservation website.  (That website has lots of good information for canning, freezing and dehydrating foods.)  I got 36  pints of canned apple juice.Now some would wonder why I don't just put the juice cans in the freezer and mix the juice up one can at a time like normal people do.   Here's why.Each frozen can makes 48 ounces of juice.  That's just too much for me to use up.  A pint jar of juice is just right for one person.Should I lose electricity for any length of time in the warmer months, I would have to do something with the frozen juice when it thaws or lose it. If the electricity is out, that means the pumps that bring water to my apartment are not working either.  I need water not only to make up the juice, but to fill the water bath canner as well.  As an apartment dweller, I have limited space for water storage.  I store enough to keep me in drinking water for a long time, but not if I have to use some of it to can juice.And fruit juice is a liquid, which means that if I have several kinds of juice canned and on my shelves, they will serve to keep me hydrated in an emergency and save some on my water storage while giving me a flavorful change from drinking plain water.As frozen juice goes on sale, I will buy other flavors and can them as well.  Even if I never need to use them in an emergency situation, they are still a good addition to my food storage.  I keep a couple of jars of juice in the fridge all the time and sometimes it is nice to open one for breakfast or for a bit of a treat."},

{"title": "Waste Not, Want Not", "date": "Wednesday, January 20, 2016", "text": "I guess I will never get the hang of cooking for one person.  When you spend several years cooking meals to feed four hungry kids it is not easy to scale back, even when the kids have been out of the house and on their own for a goodly number of years.I have had three meals of the turkey vegetable soup I made on Sunday.  That's pretty much my limit of how many meals of leftovers I can handle.  So I dumped the remaining soup into the crock pot this morning and added another quart of turkey broth.  I thought maybe some peas and corn would taste good in the soup, so I tossed in a pint of each, too.  Let it heat on the Low setting the better part of the day.This afternoon after I had put my grocery order away and had the salad fixings in the dehydrators, I heated some pint jars and filled them with soup.  They went into the pressure canner and were processed at 10 lbs. pressure for 75 minutes.  I got 7 pints of soup to add to my canning shelves.  That might not seem like much, but I just hate to waste perfectly good food.  Those 7 pints equal a weeks worth of lunches.  I may be a bit tired of it now, but it will look pretty good to me after a while. Remember when TV dinners first appeared in the stores?  I think every family on the block owned a set of TV trays and we would take our TV dinners and put them in front of us on the TV trays in the living room and eat supper watching the Ed Sullivan Show. Mothers everywhere loved TV dinners because they could serve their family a meat and potato meal just by popping the frozen dinner in the oven.  My parents, being frugal, bought just enough TV dinners to collect maybe a dozen or so of the aluminum trays.  They washed them well and then filled them with leftovers, covered them with aluminum foil and stacked them in the freezer.  I have to say that the TV dinners made with home cooked food tasted way better than the store bought variety.I sometimes think my parents were the King and Queen of Waste Not, Want Not!"},
{"title": "Outside the Box", "date": "Tuesday, January 19, 2016", "text": "So today was my grocery order day.   I had gone through the weekly store ad and my list was ready.   Before the guy who takes my order called, I looked the ad over again to see if I missed anything.  I  had.The store had those 1 lb. bags of shredded salad fixings on sale for cheaper than buying the ingredients and making them myself.  I usually don't get pre-packaged food, but I thought I could make good use of these.I ordered 4 lbs. of what they call salad greens.  This is just shredded leaf lettuce.  I will dehydrate all of it and store it in a canning jar.   A small amount added to ham salad, egg salad or chicken salad for sandwiches will be good, or sprinkled on top of a pasta salad or a potato salad for flavor.I also ordered 6 lbs. of shredded coleslaw mix, which is a combination of green cabbage, red cabbage and carrots.  When dried, a handful in any homemade meat and vegetable soup adds extra flavor.  And that combination is good in any number of casseroles. The experts tell us to store beans and rice, and I do have those items in my food storage.  But mostly I store ingredients to make the meals I like.  Beans and rice are good to have for they provide nutrition necessary for survival.  But a steady diet of them would get old in a hurry.  I like to have as much variety as possible.  Sometimes it is good to think outside the box a bit, like dehydrating salad and coleslaw mix, especially when it is on sale for cheap.Even a small thing like dried salad mixes to flavor a meal, or a variety of herbs and spices to use for the same reason, can make life during hard times just a little bit easier to take."},

{"title": "Frugal Cooking", "date": "Thursday, January 14, 2016", "text": "After my last post about pancakes and sausage, I got to thinking about meals when I was growing up.  They were plain meals but even so, we never went hungry.  I think the way we ate had to do with two things.First, we didn't have a lot of money.  If we were poor, I didn't know it, but now I do know that much of my Dad's income went for medical bills.  My mother suffered with rheumatoid arthritis nearly all of her life, and that disease took its toll, both in the horrible crippling of her body and in the cost of hospital stays, medicines, doctor visits, etc.The second factor was that both my parents grew up during the Great Depression.  Even though both my grandfathers were among the more fortunate who had jobs at that time - one as a railroad depot agent in a small town and the other as a farmer and logger, it was still tough to feed their families of seven and nine children, respectively.  My parents quickly learned that waste was not to be tolerated.  They lived by the saying, \"Use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without.\"  Both brought their frugal upbringing to their marriage and to raising their family of three children.As a child, I remember that Sunday was my favorite day of the week as far as dinner went.  Sunday was the day my mother would put a roast or a chicken in the oven before we went to church.  When we came home, she would make potatoes and gravy, a vegetable and maybe a dessert, usually consisting of fruit we had canned in the summer or if we were really lucky, a cake or a pie.The rest of the week, suppers consisted of dishes that weren't expensive to make, like macaroni and cheese, chili with rice, chicken ala king made with the leftover Sunday chicken and served over biscuits, or beef stew made with the leftover beef roast.  We ate pasta dishes like spaghetti or goulash as well as a variety of pasta or rice based casseroles.  Here in Minnesota, they are called \"Hot Dish.\"Mother was the Queen of Creamed Anything over Toast.  She would make a standard white sauce using flour, margarine (butter was a special treat as it was expensive, even then) and milk.  To the white sauce she would add salt and pepper and whatever vegetables were ready for picking in the garden.  This was usually peas or a combination of peas and carrots.  My favorite was when the asparagus bed started producing in the spring and she would make creamed asparagus on toast.  Once in a while Dad would splurge and bring home a jar of dried beef and we had creamed chipped beef on toast, better known as s**t on a shingle.I think we had so many of the creamed vegetables over toast because bread was the one food that was plentiful.  Mother baked loaves of bread, buns and cinnamon rolls.  She taught me the art of bread baking when I was about 10 years old, knowing that it wouldn't be long before the pain from the arthritis would make it impossible for her to do this task.  Dad would buy flour in 50 lb. bags and yeast in bulk.  Bread baking was a weekly happening, usually on Saturdays when I was home from school.  I still like homemade bread better than store bought.We often ate breakfast for supper.  My parents bought eggs and milk from a local farmer so eggs were plentiful and cheap.  My Dad would make a stack of pancakes and fry up eggs to go with them.  Most times he would heat a jar of homemade jelly until it became a liquid and that was used as syrup.  Sometimes on Monday evenings supper would consist of hash made from Sunday's leftover potatoes and roast beef, heated and topped with an egg for each person.   Other times it might be scrambled eggs with a little grated cheese on top along with thick slices of toast and homemade jam.When I got to thinking about these meals I ate as a child, I wondered if the Depression Era my parents lived through had anything to do with the way they cooked.  So when I Googled \"depression era coooking\" I found that many of the meals my parents made were either similar or the same as those they ate when they were children.  I believe they ate better than most during that period of time, for their fathers were able to provide the basics for their families, when many were standing in lines in the cities, waiting for a meal at the soup kitchens that were common then.  My grandparents had large gardens as did my Dad, which was a major factor in feeding their families.  And my Dad's parents on the farm were able to raise animals for meat as well as for eggs, milk, cream and butter.My Dad found a solution to satisfying his sweet tooth.  He would tear a slice of bread into small pieces and put them in a large water glass.  He would pour hot coffee over the bread and then sprinkle on a bit of sugar.  I asked him once where he learned to make what he called \"poor man's pie.\"  He told me that during both the Depression and during the years of WWII, sugar was either very expensive or it was rationed.  His mother was careful with the amount of sugar she used, so cakes, cookies and pies were a rare treat.  But she would sometimes let her kids make poor man's pie because it took only a small amount of sugar and she knew that sometimes the hard life of farm work could be made a bit easier with a small, sweet treat.The time is not all that far off when we may experience changes in the way we live.  Grocery stores may not be able to keep their shelves stocked as they do now.  It might do us well to study how the people during that depressed time were able to feed their families, especially those who lived in towns where growing their own meat and vegetables would be a problem. We could stand to learn the more frugal ways of our parents and grandparents.  We may have to."},
{"title": "Pancakes and Sausage", "date": "Wednesday, January 13, 2016", "text": "One of my old stand-by meals has been pancakes and sausage.  In times when I was really broke, it was just the pancakes.  There was a time when I ate more pancakes than anything else.  After a while I could hardly stand the sight of them.  Thank God, that has changed and now I can fix a pancake meal and enjoy it.A while back my local grocery had pancake mix on sale for a ridiculously low price - the kind of mix that requires the addition of just water.  I bought several boxes.  Because I sometimes have a lazy streak when it comes to cooking for myself, I decided to spend an afternoon making pancake and sausage meals ahead for those lazy times - or for times when I needed to eat but was busy with other things.  Sort of my own version of convenience food meals.I mixed up a large amount of pancake batter and fried up the pancakes.  As each was done, I put them on parchment paper lined cookie sheets to cool.While cleaning out the freezer of my refrigerator, I came across several 1 lb. rolls of breakfast sausage.  I had bought them on sale, stuck them in the freezer and promptly forgot about them.  One of the things about getting old and having your memory fade at times is that your life is just chock full of little surprises like finding rolls of sausage in the back of your freezer!  I defrosted a couple of the sausage rolls, sliced them up into patties, spread them in a single layer in cake pans and baked them until they were cooked through and nicely browned.  I set the pans on my kitchen table to cool the meat to room temperature.When it came time to assemble the meals, I tore off squares of aluminum foil and smaller squares of waxed paper.  A waxed paper square went in the center of an aluminum foil square, topped with one pancake, topped with another waxed paper square, topped with a second pancake and another waxed paper square.  Then I added two sausage patties and folded up the aluminum foil, sealing it tightly and into the freezer the packets went.So now if I want a quick breakfast or supper, all I have to do is remove the waxed paper and heat the pancakes and sausage in the oven or toaster oven.  I suppose I could lay the food on a plate and microwave it, but I haven't tried that as yet.  I like the idea of having a quick and easy meal on my lazy or busy days.  I'm thinking about trying this with a slice or two of ham or maybe some pre-fried bacon slices.  And if I'm really hungry I can always fry up an egg or two to go with it.  The frugal side of me likes that I got 12 meals for not much more than two similar meals from a fast food place.  Convenience food homemade.  I like it."},
{"title": "The Old Wood Stove", "date": "Monday, January 11, 2016", "text": "My youngest son left a couple of comments on my last post.  One was teasing me about going for a snowmobile ride or sledding, knowing how I detest the winter cold.  The other reminded me of an old pot-bellied type stove that was the main source of heat in an old house where we lived in northern Minnesota, many years ago. There is a gas furnace that provides heat for my building.  It does a good job of keeping my apartment warm, even though my landlord regulates the temperature settings.  The windows keep out drafts and the floors stay warm.  But it just isn't the same as using a wood burning stove.The air in northern Minnesota seems to get very dry in the winter.  Most folks run a humidifier to keep the dryness at bay, but at that time I couldn't afford to buy one, so I kept a pot of water on top of the stove to add moisture inside the house.  This worked pretty well.My kitchen stove was electric, and to keep the bills down in winter, I would often use the stove as a crock pot.  We ate a lot of venison then, for the price of beef was mostly outside my budget and deer were plentiful.  A venison roast in a dutch oven, surrounded by potatoes, carrots and onions, slow cooking all day, makes a meal fit for a king.  Having raised chickens, I would cook one for a meal the same way.  I don't know what the difference is, but those meals tasted better than anything I roast in my oven.I would make soup the same way, putting a pot of meat, broth and vegetables on top of that wood stove early in the morning, right after my kids got on the school bus.  By the time they got home, the soup was done and all I needed to do was slice a loaf of homemade bread for supper.During the time we lived there, I was gifted a knitting machine.  The closest larger town had a woolen mill with a store of sorts attached to it.  There I could buy wool fabric remnants and bulk yarn.  The yarn came in hanks that had to be wound into a ball or a cone, using a small hand cranked yarn winder.  I didn't mind doing this, for the prices of the yarn was so much less than the skeins sold in the stores.  I took a class to learn how to use the knitting machine, bought some yarn and got busy.My kitchen table was in the same room as the wood stove.   Many hours were spent with my knitting machine on my kitchen table, making knit caps, scarves and mittens for my family, the stove keeping me toasty warm as the winter winds howled outside.  At that time, a style of ski cap was popular with the school kids.  It had the name of the town on one side and the name of the kid on the other, the letters embroidered on when the hat was completed.   My kids were really good walking advertisements, wearing their caps, and I soon had more orders than I knew what to do with.  I set a comfortable rocking chair next to the wood stove and there, in the middle of all that warmth, I sewed the knitted garments together and embroidered names like mad.I wouldn't mind getting another knitting machine.  The ones they sell now are computerized and can do all sorts of fancy stitches and patterns, but I really liked the no frills machine I had then.  If I wanted a pattern on a garment, I just embroidered it on.  I'm wondering if it might not be worth having something like that machine, for it didn't need electricity to work.  And I could make sweaters and afghans with it as well as the caps and mittens.  I might have to check into finding another machine like it.It is funny how a simple comment can bring back memories like those of my old wood burning stove."},
{"title": "Snow and Cold", "date": "Friday, January 8, 2016", "text": "About 4 AM I looked out my front window to discover that snow had fallen.  It wasn't much - maybe an inch or two.  A fresh snowfall can make even a city street beautiful, especially when the street lights look like those old fashioned lights that required a lamplighter.    The street was quiet.  No tracks yet in the snow.   Made me wonder if this was how my town looked in the late 1800's when this building was built.I have seen pictures of a couple buildings in this block, taken back in the late 1800's.  They don't look much different than they do today.  My landlord has plans to take the stucco off the outside of this building and get it back to the original brick.  He wants it to look like it did when it was new.  I like that idea.Later in the day the snow started falling again.  Huge flakes.  Took a break in my rocking chair with a cup of coffee and watched the snow fall for a while.  The town is quiet today.  It was so peaceful just sitting there.  Why can't our world be like this all the time.The snow won't last long.  The outside temperature is 35 degrees today.  Change is coming over the weekend, though.  Last night Son was teasing me that if I went out over the weekend, I would likely freeze my knickers.  The temps will be  dropping down to single digits with overnight temps in the below zero range.  I told him that my knickers weren't in any danger, for I plan to sit them down in front of my sewing machine.  Indoors.  Where it is warm and cozy.Winter can be beautiful.  But it is also cold.  When I was young the cold didn't bother me.  I went sledding and ice skating and built snow forts and had snowball fights with friends.  Later when I was a bit older, I rode snowmobiles on trails through the woods and across frozen lakes.  But these days I will view the beauty of winter from my rocker.  I have become a coward when it comes to cold.  And I'm all right with that."},

Drying them seems to be the best way for me to keep onions.  I will hold out a couple to use fresh, but I like having the dried onions on hand and I mostly use them in that form.I have noticed something about the grocery store lately.  The sale ads run from Sunday to Saturday.  Used to be that whatever the store had on sale, there was plenty to last the length of the sale.  More often than not these days I get a phone call from the person who does my shopping, telling me the store is out of at least one sale item from my order.  This week they were out of fresh chicken breast.  No substitutions or rain checks.  And this was only Wednesday.  I have to wonder if this is a sign of things to come.Time to get busy again.  Son called earlier wanting to know if I needed anything from the store.  I said I didn't, but would he like a BLT and homemade french fries for supper.  He allowed as to thinking he probably could choke them down!  :)   Sometimes a person just has to go for the taste good thing.  I love fries."},
{"title": "Getting Busy Again", "date": "Wednesday, December 30, 2015", "text": "Today I finished cleaning stuff off the TV stand I gave to Oldest Son.  With a small shelf unit stacked on top, it had become kind of a catch-all for odds and ends of sewing supplies, quilt books and crafty supplies.  Son's workplace is generous with holiday time off - paid, which is nice for him - so maybe tomorrow or the next day while he is home we can drag the stand down the hall to his apartment.There are a couple of bags containing ham bones defrosting in the fridge.  Son picked up two of those bags of mixed beans for ham and bean soup and the beans are soaking in water until morning.  Tomorrow I'll boil the bones, remove the ham and simmer the soup all day.  After we have had a couple of meals of it, I will can up the rest.There are four gallons of cranberries thawing in the fridge.  Once the soup is simmering I can start cooking the berries up to make cranberry juice to can.  Son brought me 50 lbs. of berries this past fall and I need to get them out of the freezer.  It is full right up to the lid, mostly with cranberries.  There are probably all sorts of good things down in the bottom of the freezer, underneath all those berries.  The only advantage I can think of about having a less than perfect memory is that you get surprises now and then.  Like when you find out what is at the bottom of the freezer that you forgot was there.There is a reason for this burst of energy.  I really want to spend some guilt-free time with my sewing machine, and that is a bit hard for me to do when I know I should be doing things like making cranberry juice, especially since I have put it off for so long. I have always enjoyed sewing since my mother taught me more years ago than I care to think about.   I was listening to my granddaughters talking about the latest fashion trends - the ones with the hefty price tags, and I had to smile thinking that they would be horrified if they were clothed the way I was at their ages.  I don't think I had a store bought dress until I was at least a Junior in High School.  My mother and I sewed nearly all of my clothes and when I think back, I had some really nice things to wear.  We didn't shop for clothes, but for patterns and fabric.  I don't sew clothes so much any more, for the prices of patterns and fabric have gotten so high that it no longer pays.  But I do love making quilts and that is what I am looking forward to working on.Just as soon as the last gallon of cranberries is in jars and on my shelves in the form of juice."},
{"title": "Monday Ramble", "date": "Monday, December 28, 2015", "text": "I have a tendency to postpone projects in December until after Christmas.  I don't know why, for I have not one legitimate excuse.  My place is too small for family gatherings, so there is nothing extra for me to do for Christmas except make a few goodies to take to our family day.  I stopped putting up a Christmas tree when I had cats, for they would begin to undecorate it just as soon as I hung the last bit of tinsel.  The final straw was cutting my foot on the remains of a glass ornament the cats had been using for a rousing soccer game.  And yet, even without any extra holiday preparations, I still put things off until December 26.  Makes no sense. I am busy cleaning out a fairly large TV stand that sits in my living room.  It has deep shelves on the bottom and smaller shelves on the sides.  It serves no purpose for me since I gave away my TV, and when I asked Oldest Son if he could make use of it, he said it would work well in his apartment to hold a microwave on the top and maybe pots, pans and kitchen stuff on the shelves.  The only bad thing about our apartments is the lack of kitchen storage pace.   I'm glad he can use it.Once the TV stand is gone I can move my desk and set up my sewing machine.  The desk is an old one I bought at a garage sale many years ago.  It opens up with leaves like a dining room table, and with the TV stand gone, I will have room to add maybe three leaves and have a nice sewing area.  I have fabric for several quilt tops that I want to cut out and sew together over the winter.   I have been using my kitchen table for a sewing table, but it is irritating to get part way through sewing a project and then have to move it all in order to use the table for meals and other things.  It will be nice to have a permanent place to sew.I have been glancing out my windows from time to time today, looking to see if the predicted snow has started to fall.  The weather guessers are telling us we could get nearly a foot of the white stuff.  We have had plenty of moisture here, but mostly in the form of rain and sleet.  Today the temperature sits at 23 degrees, so I am hoping for the sake of those who have to be out and about that we get the snow and not ice.   The radar shows we are on the edge of the storm with states to the east and south of us getting the brunt of it.Seems like a good day for comfort food.  I thawed out a bag of leftover turkey and set it to simmering in homemade turkey broth along with some seasonings.  Later I'll make dumplings in the broth and open a jar of green beans to go with it.  Chicken or turkey and dumplings is one of my favorite comfort foods.  My Dad used to make the best chicken and dumplings.  More than once I showed up at his house, chicken in hand, and begged him to fix that dish for me.  Sharing that meal with my Dad is one of my best memories.I am all done rambling now.  I have some apples that need to be used, so I think an apple crisp would taste good for dessert.  I'm having a nice day.  Hope you are, too."},

{"title": "Times Remembered", "date": "Sunday, December 20, 2015", "text": "This morning I read a post over at Gorges' Grouse.  Gorges is good at writing interesting articles about times past.  This one was about a barn in his neighborhood that recently burned, and his memories of many years associated with that building.  It brought to mind a building in my memory that suffered a similar fate.When my grandfather homesteaded his land in northern Minnesota, there were no schools in his neighborhood.  The closest school was in the small town several miles from their farm, and in the early 1900's, there were no school buses that would transport his growing family of children to school.  I suppose my grandmother could have taught them at home, but I am fairly sure that raising her nine children in addition to all the other chores on the farm that needed her attention took up nearly all of her time.  She prepared the meals, baked bread in the oven of a wood burning stove, planted a garden, preserved every bit of food she could, cared for the chickens, washed clothes in a washtub with water from the pump outside the house, heated on her stove.  And in her spare time, she mended their clothes and sewed shirts and dresses for her children.  Not much time to spend on lesson plans.So my grandfather got together with some of his neighbors and they built a one room schoolhouse about a quarter mile from his farm.  By the time my Dad, the youngest of the children, was ready for school in about 1917, his oldest sister had her teaching certificate and was his teacher.  Dad once told me that having his sister as his teacher sort of put a crimp in the shenanigans he could get away with.  Dad was big on shenanigans.  His sister was big on threatening to tell their father.That school stood for many years, even after the rural kids started going to school in town.  It was used as a town hall and for neighborhood get-togethers.  Many times over the years I visited that school.  And every time I looked at my Dad's initials carved in one of the boards that served as siding. This was done when he was about 10 years old.And then one night just a few years ago, some boneheaded fool decided to burn down the schoolhouse, just for fun.  That idiot took away part of my family history.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, for anyone who would burn a schoolhouse just because they have nothing better to do wouldn't care about hurting the people to whom that building had meaning and memories attached to it.Like Gorges, I never took a photo of the building that held memories for me.  The building is gone but the memories linger.  Listening to Dad tell stories about his school days.  Running my fingers over the initials carved so long ago on the side of the school.  Nobody can take that away from me.I do have one picture from that period of time.The three boys in the back are Dad's brothers, Keith, Kenneth and Bruce.  The dark haired smallest girl in front is Dad's sister, Clarice.  Dad is on the end, the one studiously studying his hands.The children are standing by the schoolhouse.   That is the closest thing to a picture of the school I have.  And when it comes right down to it, that picture of my Dad and his siblings is far more precious to me than any building."},
{"title": "Minnesota School Includes Muslim Prayer Song in Holiday Concert", "date": "Friday, December 18, 2015", "text": "Be forewarned.  This is a rant.First, I object to the term \"holiday concert.\"  On December 25th of every year, we celebrate Christmas.  We may have become a materialistic society, all wrapped up in finding the perfect gift, spending more than we can afford and glorifying Santa Claus, but the reason we have a holiday at this time of year is because on that day we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.  Were it not for that event, there would be no holiday at all. Generations of Americans have attended school Christmas concerts, Christmas plays and Christmas programs.  But now, with the trend toward political correctness, these Christmas celebrations in our schools are no longer allowed.  And that is to our everlasting shame.Second, there is a time and a place for exploring other religions and the traditions of other countries.  A school in a suburb of Minneapolis has chosen to include a muslim song in its \"holiday\" program.  To be fair, there are songs from other countries and faiths included within the concert.  Local news reports state that, for instance, a Jewish song will be sung.  So why do I object to a muslim song and not a Jewish song?  Because to the best of my knowledge, the Jews are not beheading anyone, nor are they burning people alive in cages, nor are they engaged in mass shootings in theaters.  As far as I know, no Jew has ever waged jihad on America, nor has even one stood in the streets screaming, \"Death to America.\"  That's why.I have no problem with school children learning about other countries and the religions of those countries, nor do I have a problem with them learning songs from other countries to get a feel for any nationality or religion.  It is good to know what other countries and religions are all about.  We can never learn too much.  But these teachings and songs belong in a classroom setting and not in a \"holiday\" concert.I have ancestors who came here from England, France, Germany and Scotland.  My children have ancestors who came here from Norway and Denmark as well.  They brought with them the religions and traditions of the \"old country.\"  But each and every one of those ancestors learned the language.  They entered this country legally.  They jumped through all the hoops to become citizens.  They became Americans.  And they were proud to be Americans.The excuse the school district gave for including the muslim song in their concert was this:\"In a statement, the district said that they have students from many different backgrounds and cultures, and they promote equal opportunities for all students.\"That is all well and good.  I'm all for equal opportunity.  But this all inclusive politically correct BS needs to stop.  A Christmas concert is no place to celebrate a religion that wants nothing more than to kill me.As far as I know, the concert has been given.  I have been unable to find any news source that reported on it after the fact.  Whether or not the school kept to the original program is unknown.    But if they did, shame on them.Sources:http://pamelageller.com/2015/12/minn-students-to-sing-muslim-prayer-allahu-akbar-at-high-school-christmas-concert.html/http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2015/12/17/parents-question-choice-to-sing-allahu-akbar-at-holiday-concert/"},

There was a birthday party for a family friend.  Youngest Grandson's hair is still damp from working up a sweat jumping about in one of those blow-up things where the kids crawl inside and bounce around to their hearts content.  A good time was had by all.Oldest Granddaughter told me that when they were coming back through town, she noticed that they were only a block away from Grandma's house and she told her Dad they needed to stop in to see Grandma.  Which they did.Middle Child said they were on their way to a mall nearby where they were going shopping for their Mother's Christmas present.  Each of them had a certain amount of money to spend, and they were trying to decide if they would buy three smaller gifts or if they would pool their resources for one really nice present.  All three were excited to be going Christmas shopping for Mom.We talked a bit longer, including their Dad in the conversation.  The Grands saw the jar of popcorn, a big bowl and my roaster pan sitting on the cupboard.  I explained that I was going to make a batch of caramel corn later.  Caramel corn is one of the treats I always made at Christmas time when my children were young.  The Grands extracted a promise from me that I would bring some when we get together for our Christmas. And then all three lined up again to give Grandma a hug goodbye.  Dad even got into the act.  We are a huggy group.  I like that in a family.They weren't here very long.  They didn't have to be.  The fact that they wanted to stop in to see Grandma was enough.Later in the afternoon Oldest Son showed up at my door with a good-sized spiral cut ham in hand.  His workplace had given each of their employees a ham for Christmas.  Son used my WiFi while the ham baked in my oven.  I added mashed potatoes and candied carrots to the menu and we enjoyed a really good meal.  After supper Son cut most of the meat from the ham bone to use for sandwiches to take to work in his lunch, leaving me the bone to make a pot of ham and beans with, and a freezer bag full of ham slices so I could enjoy a few ham sandwiches this week.I'm thinking Saturdays really don't get much better than that!"},

{"title": "Seeds", "date": "Wednesday, December 9, 2015", "text": "One thing I forgot to mention in my previous post is that I save seeds.  I know that sounds silly for an apartment dweller to save seeds when there is no place to plant a garden.  But I save them for two reasons.The first is that when things get bad, I have children who have lawns that can be converted into garden plots, should said children finally see the error of their ways and discover that raising food is a good thing.  To be fair, one of them has done this with a couple of raised beds.  Should seeds become hard to get, they need look no further than Mom's shelves.The second reason is that my building has a communal deck large enough to raise several different kinds of plants in buckets or tubs.  Someone in a newer building than mine (this building was built in the late 1800's) probably has a balcony for each apartment that can be used as well.  Over the winter I plan to research the best way to garden in containers.  In the meantime, I have purchased seeds and I save seeds from produce, mostly from the Farmer's Market.  I am aware that hybrid seeds will not always produce fruit just like the fruit the seeds came from.  I don't care, as long as they produce something edible.  And sometimes seeds from purchased produce will not grow at all.  So to test those I have saved, I sprinkle a few seeds on damp paper towels, wrap that in a damp kitchen towel and wait to see if the seeds sprout.  If they do, I package the remaining seeds and mark them, storing them away from heat and light.Another idea I saw was to sprout seeds in a quart jar.  Google \"sprouting seeds\" for instructions.  There are lots of websites and videos on how to do this.  I have not tried sprouting my seeds as yet, but will be giving it a go over winter.  There are seed sprouting kits in stores and online.  I see no reason not to buy seeds in bulk and use only those according to your own tastes (some might like radish sprouts while others may not, etc.).  Seems to me this might be a good way to add fresh green things to a person's diet. We apartment dwellers may be challenged as to storage and gardening space, but with a positive attitude and a bit of research, there is no reason we can't find ways to accomplish what we set out to do."},
{"title": " What Do I Store", "date": "Tuesday, December 8, 2015", "text": "I have been asked to do a post about the items I store other than food.  I have been struggling a bit with this one.  There are many websites, blogs and videos out there telling about what folks should have in their preps.  A good place to start is researching those for information and ideas.  Many of those sources include things like water storage, tactical gear, options for cooking and heating with wood, etc.  While excellent advice, much of it is not applicable to my living situation.I have to make decisions based on an arthritic granny living in a three room apartment.  I have no place to store the large barrels of water, so I save soda and juice bottles, wash them out, fill them and store them wherever I have a bit of space - behind my couch and other furniture, behind a door, in the corner of a cupboard.  I keep some empty five gallon buckets that can be filled from my bathtub in a power outage, before my building loses water pressure.  My \"Need to Buy\" list includes a water filter system to utilize the water from the river located a block away.This past fall I purchased a good camping stove and a space heater, both fueled with propane.  I buy the small propane canisters as I have no place to keep larger ones.  These fit into boxes with lids that can be stacked, saving space.I have several flashlights and batteries.  I buy candles whenever I find them on sale and keep a large supply of wooden kitchen matches.  My \"Need to Buy\" list includes several oil lamps.  I would prefer the old kerosene type lamps, but storing kerosene in an apartment is probably not a good idea.  Another lighting source I am looking into is the solar lights used in outdoor yard or patio decor.  Seems to me these could be used indoors at night and be recharged during the daytime hours.  Same goes for a solar charger for recharging computers, Kindles, cellphones, etc.I have a basic first-aid kit and add to that items like non-stick bandages, gauze, tape, bandaids, etc.  I also buy antibacterial creams, burn ointments, hand lotions, lip balms, etc.  A couple of my favorites that I have used for years are A & D Ointment and Bag Balm.  Aspirin helps me with arthritis pain so I stock several bottles of that along with multi-vitamins.  I find that prescription drugs are a problem.  Most doctors, including mine, tend to write prescriptions rather than recommending alternatives, and they don't seem to want to write these prescriptions for more than 6 months at a time.  So the next time I have to make an appointment to get my several prescriptions refilled, we are going to have a chat about alternatives, and in the meantime, I am doing my own internet research on herbal medicines.I have a large picnic basket with a lid that I have filled with sewing supplies - needles, threads, pins, velcro, various kinds of scissors, rotary cutters, etc.   Remember Grandma's button jar?  Got one of those, too.  The time may come where buying a new shirt just because a button fell off the old one will not be an option.  We need to know how to sew and mend and patch.  I also keep darning thread for mending socks.  These old skills could be more valuable than cash at some point.  I buy fabric on sale - all different kinds.  Some are good for clothing, some for quilting, etc.  Fabric is stored in tubs in the back of my closet.  Yarn for making caps, scarves and mittens is stored the same way.I have a Kindle.  I love my Kindle.  I have several hundred books stored on it.  But I also buy paperback books at garage sales and charity stores.  And when I find information online that will be useful, I print it out and save it in a binder.  I do the same with recipes and instructions for canning and dehydrating.I often buy a few boxes of canning lids at a time, trying to build up a good supply.  I have found that if I am careful not to damage a lid when removing it from a jar, it can be used once or twice more, so I save all my used lids.  I suppose it would be wise to invest in Tattler reusable canning lids, but right now their price is not within my budget.  I do have four boxes of them in each size and have used them with few problems so I may get more when I have the rest of my \"Needs\" list filled.I have a tub of bar soap stored but lately have been looking into stocking the ingredients to make my own.  Same for laundry soap.  I store Borax, Washing Soda and Fels Naptha bars.  Small amounts of these ingredients will make gallons of laundry soap at a fraction of the cost of commercial laundry detergent. This list could go on forever, but I think this is enough for now.  Each person needs to decide for themselves what is important to store and what is not.  Parents with small children would have items on their lists that I have no need for.  Those who are into bushcraft would have the need for tactical gear, where those of us that find the need for it is not practical for our lifestyles, do not.  However, I can not stress strongly enough the need to be able to defend ourselves, our families and our property.  Even in the best of times, there is a very real possibility that someone with evil intent could break into my apartment.  I refuse to live in fear, cowering behind locked doors, so I have made sure I have the means to stop the criminal before I am hurt or killed. The surface has just been scratched here, but I hope it will be of some little help."},

{"title": "What a Difference a Day Makes", "date": "Wednesday, December 2, 2015", "text": "Winter came sliding in on Monday.  There wasn't much snow here.  Just enough on top of freezing rain to make the roads treacherous.  The local news reported nearly 150 vehicle crashes and several injuries.   After a harrowing drive home from work Monday evening, Son braved the elements and started out early Tuesday morning.  After his car slid through the first two intersections he came to, he turned around and came home, called his workplace and took a vacation day.  There is a mentality of bravado here in Minnesota when it comes to driving on icy roads.  Many risk life and limb just to be able to brag that they didn't let a little ice or snow slow them down.  Those of us with functioning brain cells realize that if our cars are wrecked or if we are wrecked, we won't be going to work for a while.  No work, no paying the rent.  Better to miss one day than a lot of days.  It is called common sense.Yesterday was a strange day.  I spent the better part of it snuggled under my warm, fuzzy blanket.  I just couldn't seem to stay warm.  The only thing that tempted my appetite was a bowl of the turkey soup I had made.  And fruit juice.  Son came over to use my WiFi and I slept in my recliner through most of his time here.  I knew things weren't right when the coffee he brought with him didn't appeal to me.  My poor landlord came by early in the evening to do something or other in my apartment.  I'm not sure just what that was, for he took one look at me and said he would be back in a couple of days.  Guess I looked pretty rough.  Thankfully this morning I woke up feeling fine. So now that I have had several cups of coffee, it is time to catch up on the household chores I let slide yesterday.   I have two large stock pots of turkey broth in the fridge to can up as well as the rest of the turkey soup.  The soup turned out really good, but I find that I am pretty much turkeyed out.  I have given up on trying to make small batches of soup.  Just can't do it.  I still have leftovers even when I palm some off on Son.  I still have a large pot of the soup left, so I will can that up as well.  I think it will taste pretty good to me in a month or so.  In the meantime, supper of scalloped potatoes with ham sounds good.  What a difference one day can make!"},
{"title": "Sunday - Rest.  Monday - Work.", "date": "Monday, November 30, 2015", "text": "I am trying to adhere to the Biblical \"Day of Rest.\"  So yesterday I did just that.  There was some reading and some napping and some messing about on the computer and some crocheting and movie watching in the evening.  The biggest thing I did was heat up leftovers for hot turkey sandwiches with mashed potatoes, dressing and gravy, shared with Oldest Son for supper.  It was a nice day.Just because some of us are retired doesn't mean that every day is a day of rest.  I had the meat from my 21 lb. turkey, minus a couple of meals, in the fridge so I saved out enough for a few days worth of sandwiches and packaged up the rest.  I was able to wedge it into the freezer by doing a bit of restacking.There were the bones and scraps from three turkeys waiting for me, so those have been cooking all morning.  When the pots cool down, I'll strain out the bones and bits of skin, pour the broth into my large stock pot and refrigerate it over night.  By morning the fat will have solidified on top of the broth and I can skim it off.  This I will save for frying as it adds some really good flavor to potatoes and other fried foods.  Using the fat this way means there is less cooking oil to buy.  I do the same with bacon grease.  The broth will be heated, ladled into jars and canned.I have some broth and carrots, potatoes and onions simmering on the back burner.  Soon I will add pieces of leftover turkey gleaned from the bones and maybe a handful or two of rice to the mix.  It is turkey soup and cornbread for supper.  Snow is predicted here today and Oldest Son said soup would likely taste pretty good to him after a day of working outside in this weather.  Most times Son does his own cooking when he gets home from work, but now and then it is nice to have him come over to my apartment and share a meal.Those who guess what the weather will be like on a daily basis are telling us we may get up to 6 inches of snow, starting this afternoon and continuing into tomorrow.  It isn't all that cold, the outdoor temperature sitting at 33 degrees this morning, which means the snow will more than likely be heavy and wet.  Power outages can be caused by that kind of snowfall.  My Kindle is charging just in case.  I have all the food and water I need and the propane space heater and the propane camp stove I bought this fall are both ready to go.  Yesterday Son got a few things at the grocery and he brought me a bag of Peanut Butter Cup minis and some other snacks.  I have plenty of coffee, chocolate and something to read.  You know, the important stuff.  I am ready.  :)"},
{"title": "Family", "date": "Friday, November 27, 2015", "text": "Yesterday was such a nice day, even though it started out not so great.  It started to lightly snow in the morning and made the first ten miles of our journey sort of exciting where the snow stuck to the road and made driving interesting.  Once reaching the freeway the roads were just wet and we arrived at Youngest Son's home on the other side of the city with no problems.  I am thankful that Oldest Son is a good driver and knows how to drive on slippery winter roads.The turkey dinner with all the trimmings was a treat.  Oldest Daughter brought a corn/cornbread dish that was wonderful  I need to get that recipe.  Maddie Mae had made appetizers by wrapping dill pickles in slices of deli ham and cutting them crosswise.  They were pretty and delicious.  Boston had lined muffin tin cups with pie dough, filled them with apples and spices, added a lattice top and baked them into mini apple pies.  I took one home with me and enjoyed it as a bedtime snack.  I am pleased that my Grands helped in adding to the meal.  After pie with real whipped cream, we headed home, where a nap was necessary!  It was a good day with family.  I am thankful for them all.Oldest Son and I will have two more turkey dinners this week.  The company Son works for gave each of the employees a turkey, and his is about 20 lbs.  I added a turkey to my grocery order that was on sale at 99 cents a pound.  The lady who does the shopping found the biggest one she could, at 21 lbs.  Neither Son nor I have freezer space for large turkeys, so Son will roast his later today and I will roast mine on Sunday.  Each of us will have leftovers enough to satisfy our appetites (Leftovers are one of the best thing about turkey dinners.) and both of us will be able to squeeze small packages of meat into our respective freezers for future use.Youngest Son packaged up the scraps and carcass of our Thanksgiving turkey and sent it home with me, knowing that I would put it to good use.  I will wait until the other two turkeys have been cooked, take the remains of all three birds and make turkey broth to can and a batch of homemade turkey soup.  I am glad that I grew up with frugal parents who taught me to make use of everything, including turkey bones.My grocery order included six bags of frozen hash browns.  I have dehydrated four bags already and the last two are drying now.  Roll breakfast sausage was also on sale and I ordered 12 one-pound rolls.  Three rolls will be made into patties and squeezed somewhere in the freezer.  Hopefully!  The rest I will brown, drain and can tomorrow to add to my food storage shelves. One last note:  When I arrived at my Youngest Son's home yesterday, my youngest grandson was playing football in the front yard with his neighbor friend.  He wasn't the least bit embarrassed to come running to give his Grandma a hug.  His sisters were at the front door with more hugs.  And when my taller-than-me older grandson arrived, he too delivered a hug for Grandma.  And that, my friends, is what life is all about."},
{"title": "An Early Happy Thanksgiving", "date": "Wednesday, November 25, 2015", "text": "Wednesday is a busy day.  I don't think I will be spending much time with my computer.  First off it is grocery delivery day and it takes time to get it all put away.  I am spending Thanksgiving with my kids and grands, and this year I am in charge of the pumpkin pie baking and I also have had a request to bring a batch of chocolate chip cookies.  As my freezer is full, the baking has to wait until Wednesday.  I don't mind.  It is fun to make goodies, especially for the grands. I know that our world is in a turmoil.  There is so much insanity going on at the moment that sometimes it is hard to keep up with it all.  And I know how important it is to be informed. But on Thanksgiving I want to concentrate on my family.  A good share of what I have to be thankful for will be gathered at my youngest son's home and I plan on enjoying every second of our time together.I am thankful for all of you as well.  You read whatever silliness I decide to post and you comment, too.  I don't know if you realize how much that means to me. So I am wishing all of you a safe and happy Thanksgiving Day.  God bless."},
{"title": "Using Canned Foods - Part 3", "date": "Monday, November 23, 2015", "text": "The last post in this series isn't so much about how to use home canned foods as it is about finding alternatives when you have no way to grow your own produce.  As you know if you visit here, I live in a downtown apartment, surrounded by asphalt and concrete.  After trying to use my windowsills, which are wide enough to hold pots for growing herbs, I find that there just doesn't seem to be enough direct sunlight for anything to grow well there.  I am planning to try next spring to plant a few vegetables and herbs in containers on the communal deck on the west side of the building, but even if I am successful, I won't be able to produce nearly enough for canning.  At best I will have fresh salad greens, tomatoes and maybe enough parsley and other herbs to dehydrate.  A community garden would be nice if one existed here.The Farmer's Market is an excellent source for fresh produce.  I can get cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and squash at reasonable prices and the quality, depending on the vendor, is very good.  My son has been going to the Market for several years and has learned which vendor sells the best produce for the least amount of money.  Even though there are several Farmer's Markets close by, he drives to the one in St. Paul, which is farther away but where he knows the vendors and knows the produce will be good.  It is worth going the extra mile.  Some other Markets have vendors who just buy produce for resale, but we know who raised the food we buy in St. Paul.  The difference between a store quality tomato and a locally grown tomato is more than obvious.Sometimes the cost at the Market is prohibitive for canning purposes.  The prices for sweet corn, peas and green beans in my area are fine if I want these fresh for a meal or two, but are too spendy for canning.  I suppose I could just buy those vegetables in cans from the grocery, but I find that because I am mostly cooking for one person, often times a regular can of corn is too much and won't get used up unless I want to eat corn for several days.  And the prices for individual sized cans of vegetables are beyond outrageous, if you can even find them any more.  So for much of my vegetable canning, I wait for a sale on frozen vegetables and can those.  That way I am able to can them using half pint jars, which is just right for one or two meals for me.  I have successfully canned sweet corn, peas, peas and carrots, green beans and mixed vegetables using the frozen vegetables.  It is just a matter of pouring the frozen vegetables into a pot, adding water to cover and heating them until they are thawed and warm.  They can then be jarred and canned using instructions for timing for that particular vegetable.  And why would I bother canning vegetables that are already frozen?  Because there may come a time when water is scarce, and the water used in canning is enough to be able to heat the food on whatever heat source is available without burning it.  And because a freezer full of frozen vegetables is useless should the power be out for any length of time, causing the vegetables to thaw and go bad.  And because canned vegetables, as well as anything else that is home canned, is fully cooked and can be eaten right from the jar if necessary.When canning tomatoes I have found that it takes too many of them to make my own tomato sauce or ketchup or barbecue sauce.  Same goes for tomato juice.  I can diced tomatoes in both pint and quart jars.  If I want tomato juice I just dump the contents of a jar into my blender and whirl it for a bit.  If seeds in juice is a problem, just pour the juice through a strainer. I use the canned tomatoes for any dish that calls for them.I admit to buying tomato products like spaghetti sauce, ketchup, barbecue sauce and tomato sauce at the grocery.  And yes, I know about GMO foods, but when on a budget, you can't always be a purist when it comes to some foods.  I do try to avoid food products made in other countries that do not have strict food processing regulations.  Now and then I will find #10 cans of tomato products reasonably priced, and then I will re-can them in smaller jars.  I have successfully re-canned the above products, as well as mustard.Another item I like to have on my shelves is beans.  I will make pork and beans to can.  I don't know if doing that is very cost effective, but I do love the taste of homemade pork and beans.  There are many recipes online, those made with a tomato sauce and those made with molasses.  I also keep a few jars of canned dry beans like Great Northern Beans on the shelf.  When canned, they are fully cooked and can be used for ham and beans or any other bean based dish, without having to soak the beans overnight or spend half the day cooking them.  Sometimes older dried beans will stay hard, no matter how long you cook them.  Canning them eliminates that problem.I have experimented with canning foods that might not otherwise be considered when one is planning what to can.  The experiment of canning meat for Sloppy Joes was a dismal failure, as the taste of some of the ingredients completely changed in the process.  I use that up in casseroles or spaghetti sauce where the taste will be overpowered by other ingredients.  But the experiment in canning hamburger made into taco filling was successful.  I also tried canning diced celery, and although it softened up considerably, it is good for dishes where I want the taste of celery but don't necessarily need it to be crisp.  Don't be afraid to  experiment a bit, like with the taco filling,  Sometimes I wind up with something that is really handy to have on hand.Other foods I can like fruit or jams and jellies or pickles require no explanation as to how to use them. There are those who find it much easier to just buy their canned goods at the grocery.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Canning food requires time and there is work involved.  And there is the initial expense of a pressure canner, jars and lids.  Perhaps it has something to do with the way I was raised that makes home canning preferable to me.  Canning is something that my parents and grandparents did to insure their families would have plenty to eat over the long Minnesota winters.  It is something I have done most of my life, and I will admit to having a sense of satisfaction when I see all those full jars on the shelves.  Plus it is the best way for me to insure that my family will not go hungry during hard times.  That alone is worth it to me."},
{"title": "Using Canned Foods - Part 2", "date": "Saturday, November 21, 2015", "text": "There are a few more meats that I regularly can.  One of those is hamburger, if I can find a good sale.  We are now paying $4.99 per pound for hamburger, with the leanest going for $5.49 per pound, so I haven't canned as much as I would like to this year.  I brown the hamburger, drain it, pack it into jars without adding liquid and can it.  I found that adding liquid to hamburger gave me a product that reminded me of canned dog food.  Canned without liquid, the meat is indistinguishable from hamburger freshly browned.This meat can be used in any recipe that calls for browned hamburger.  I make Sloppy Joe sandwiches from it.  I add it to spaghetti sauce or to lasagna.  I use it in casseroles or in tacos or in gravy over mashed potatoes or rice.  The possibilities are endless.Sometimes I will make up a meatball recipe, brown the meatballs on a cookie sheet in the oven, pack them into jars and can them.  I have used cream of mushroom soup diluted with an equal part of water and canned the meatballs covered with the soup to make meatballs and gravy.  The plain ones are good with spaghetti or just plain, and the ones in mushroom sauce are good over mashed potatoes or rice.There are some who can bacon by rolling slices up in parchment paper, stuffing the package into wide mouth jars and canning it that way.  I haven't tried that method yet, but plan to soon.  I buy boxes of bacon ends and pieces, cut the meat into about one-inch dices, lightly brown it, pack it into half pint jars and can it.  Canned this way, these bacon bits have several uses.  I mix them with scrambled eggs or add them to omelets.  I have used them in scalloped potatoes.  I have mixed them into those hashbrown and egg breakfast casseroles and in other casseroles for bacon flavor.  They can be sprinkled on a green salad.  I'm sure there are many other uses for canned bacon bits that I haven't thought of.When I find a sale on bulk breakfast sausage I get as much as I can.  This is canned just like hamburger.  The sausage is good in scrambled eggs, omelets and casseroles.  I have used it in spaghetti sauce and lasagna.  But my favorite way to use this is in biscuits and sausage gravy.Sometimes I find a product that comes in a #10 can.  Cheese sauce is one of those foods.  I know that I could buy the ingredients and make my own, but the cost of a large can is way cheaper than investing in the separate ingredients.  I heat the cheese through, ladle it into half-pint jars and can it in a water bath canner for 90 minutes (per Jackie Clay's instructions).  I have tried canning regular cheese and found that it turns out with a rubbery texture that I don't care much for.  The cheese sauce turns out great.  I use this for mac and cheese, as a sauce over vegetables like asparagus, as a dipping sauce for nacho chips, in casseroles and poured over scrambled eggs or omelets.  I'm sure there are many other uses for this that I have yet to discover.I mentioned earlier that I have canned potatoes, but I'm going over that again here.  Living alone, it is sometimes hard to use up a bag of potatoes before they start to sprout or turn soft.  A couple of years ago, Oldest Son got a good deal on potatoes at the Farmers Market and brought me 100 lbs. of them.  I dehydrated some, but most I canned. Some were cut into larger chunks and those I use like you would any boiled potato for a meal. Some I cut into about two-inch pieces and filled quart jars half full, adding similar sized chunks of carrots to fill the jars to the top.  Those I usually use with a roast of some kind, either in the oven or the crock pot. Some I cut into about one-inch chunks, filling quart jars with 1/3 potatoes, 1/3 carrots and 1/3 peas.  These are handy for soups but I mainly use them in stews.Some I diced them into about half-inch pieces.  These I use for fried potatoes and for potato salad.  I added chunks of onion to a few of the jars.  The onion turns soft during the canning process, but the flavor is still there and adds to the flavor of fried potatoes.The last thing I want to talk about is soup.  I have found that having a variety of home canned soups on my shelves makes life easier at times when I am busy and need to refuel but don't want to spend time cooking, or on those rare occasions when those nasty little viruses invade my system and I need to eat but don't really feel well.  I can soup in both pint and quart jars.  A pint is just the right amount to fill a soup bowl, and a quart is good for a couple of meals for one person and is enough to feed two people.Chicken/turkey vegetable soup:  I fill a jar about 1/3 full of diced chicken or turkey and top that with frozen mixed vegetables that have been thawed.  I add water to cover and add whatever seasonings I want when I heat the soup to eat.The rest of the soups I make the same way as I would if I were cooking them for a meal, only in large quantities.  As with the chicken soup, I add seasonings when I heat them to eat.  I am better able to control the amount of salt that way and sometimes seasonings will become too strong or turn a little bitter in the canning process.  I usually have the following soups on my shelves along with the chicken vegetable soup:  ham and bean soup, split pea soup and vegetable soup.  If I want vegetable beef soup, I just add canned beef when heated.  Some have canned cream soups, but I have not tried those as yet.  And others also can homemade tomato soup, but I am not really fond of tomato soup, so I have not.The other food I like to can is chili.  And this I season as I normally would, with good results.  I make a huge pot full and can it in both pint and quart jars.  As with any food that is either a combination of vegetables or contains meat, the processing time is the longest time recommended for one of the ingredients.  When that ingredient is meat, it is always 75 minutes for pints and 90 minutes for quarts.And that is enough for this post.  I have one more coming that deals with the vegetables and other odds and ends.  Hope this helps."},
{"title": "Using Canned Foods - Part 1 ", "date": "Friday, November 20, 2015", "text": "Someone left a comment in an earlier post, asking me about my go-to recipes for using the foods I can.  I have been thinking about it and have come to the realization that I don't have recipes as such.  As a dedicated carnivore, my main meals usually have meat of some sort as the base, which is why I like to can as much meat as possible.  Unless I have company for a meal, I usually go with quick and easy.  Canned meat is fully cooked and as such lends itself to all sorts of applications.  The best I can do here is tell you what I can and how I use it.I have more chicken breast on my shelves than any other kind of meat.  That is because it is one of the less expensive meats and local stores run sales fairly often.  And because I like it.  I usually cut the chicken into one-inch pieces to can.  Here is how I use it:Often I will combine a jar of chicken with a jar of mixed vegetables and a jar of broth (or broth made  with chicken bouillon).  I add dehydrated onion and parsley and whatever seasonings sound good to me.  Heated, that makes a good soup.  Or I might make dumplings, either from scratch or using Bisquick, and drop those on top of the soup for Chicken and Dumplings.  Or I might make biscuits, thicken the soup to a gravy-like consistency for Chicken and Biscuits.Sometimes I shred the chicken and heat it with barbecue sauce for hot chicken sandwiches.  Or I will take the shredded chicken, add some mayo, onion and pickle relish for cold sandwich spread.Canned chicken can be used in any casserole recipe calling for cooked chicken.I am not opposed to having a few convenience foods on my shelves.  I can get large bags of  Stove Top Stuffing at my grocery, and I divide that into meal sized portions to store.  I will make up a portion of the stuffing and stir in canned chicken.  That, served with a vegetable or salad and some cranberry sauce makes a good meal.Sometimes I use the chicken cubes in a cold macaroni salad - kind of like a tuna salad only with chicken.One of my favorites is to make a sweet and sour sauce with pineapple chunks, add the chicken cubes and serve it over rice.If I get to Sam's Club, they carry fresh chicken breast for a reasonable price.  Those chicken breasts are huge - one piece is more than enough for two people.  I will cut that chicken into large chunks for canning.  To use it, I will often just empty a jar into a pan, top with barbecue sauce and heat it in the oven. That makes a good meal with a baked potato and a salad or with a plate of potato salad.  I  will also top the chicken with stuffing and bake it until it is heated through.  It is good that way with a vegetable and maybe some cranberry sauce.Now and then, whole pork loin goes on sale, and I will buy as much as I can afford.  I always cut maybe half of one loin into boneless pork chops and freeze them.  The rest I cut up the same as the chicken breast for canning and use it pretty much the same way.  It is a nice change of taste from chicken, especially using it for pulled pork sandwiches.I can some beef in large chunks to use like a beef roast.  A couple of years ago I canned chunks of potatoes and carrots together in quart jars.  I will dump the beef into a pan, surround it with the contents of a quart of potatoes and carrots, add thick slices of onion and bake it until it is heated through and the meat is slightly browned.  That makes a good roast beef Sunday dinner.I use a lot of the smaller beef cubes for beef stew.  I had previously canned cubed potatoes, carrots and peas together in quart jars.  So I will combine the beef and vegetables, adding a pint of canned diced tomatoes and some dehydrated onion and maybe a bit of parsley along with some beef bouillon or beef soup starter for flavor.  Just a basic beef stew.  Sometimes I will serve it plain with homemade bread or sometimes I will have it over biscuits.The small beef cubes are good used to make restaurant style hot beef sandwiches with mashed potatoes and gravy. I recently canned the meat from six bone-in hams, cutting the meat and canning it the same as with the other meats.  The large chunks can be used the same as if I were making a traditional ham dinner.The small chunks can be used the same as many of the chicken dishes.  I also use them to add to scalloped potatoes.I think that is enough for this post.  I will do another about some of the other foods that I regularly can.  There are those who prefer to freeze meat and I do that, too, freezing enough for about a months worth of meals.  But should I lose power for whatever reason, the frozen meat runs the risk of going bad should it thaw.  There is also the problem of freezer burn.  I find that the home canned meats will last for years if kept in a fairly cool, dark place.  And for someone like me who lacks the patience and inclination to cook fancy meals, the canning solution works well."},
{"title": "Another Ramble", "date": "Thursday, November 19, 2015", "text": "Things seem to be slowing down here in my little corner of the world.  Canning and dehydrating seasons are about finished.  I would like to dry some more frozen hash browns.  I just spread them out on the mesh lined dehydrator trays for drying.  No need to blanch and they keep forever.  To use them, I just soak enough for a meal in hot water for about 15 minutes and fry them up for a quick and easy addition to a meal.It has been raining here for the last couple of days.  Not a steady rain, but more wave after wave moving through.  Luckily, we did not get the high winds that some in other parts of the country had to contend with.  Today is clear but cold - the temperature being 31 degrees about noontime.The company that Oldest Son works for has ordered a new forklift for him to drive.  It comes with an enclosed cab that has heat and air conditioning.  Son stopped in last evening when he got home from work.  He surprised me with a treat of a box of Little Debbie Nutty Bars.  Life is worth living if one has a box of Little Debbie Nutty Bars.  :)  Anyway, he showed me his insulated gloves that were soaked clear through.  The roof on the forklift he now drives had kept him fairly dry and he was bundled up in several layers of heavy clothes.  But I think he will be really happy when the new forklift arrives.Years ago I lived in northern Minnesota, near Bemidji.  That town has had statues of Paul Bunyan and Babe, the Blue Ox as a tourist attraction near the lakefront.  The Paul Bunyan statue is 18 feet tall and they have been there since about 1937. Picture from the Bemidji C of C website.There is a web cam there now and every once in a while I will go to their Chamber of Commerce website to watch the tourists taking pictures of themselves with the statues.  It is fun to watch the kids - they seem to have so much fun standing on Paul's foot or running underneath Babe.  I looked at it today and found that it was snowing heavily there.  Don't suppose it will take too long before the snow moves south and everything here will be covered in a blanket of white.My family will get together on Thanksgiving at Youngest Son's home.  I always enjoy spending time with my family.  My contribution to Thanksgiving dinner is the pumpkin pies.  I may have to make some other treats for the kids.  It isn't often I get the chance to spoil my Grands.  I do have to be careful of the ingredients in whatever I make.  Maddie Mae has a peanut allergy, so peanut butter cookies are out of the question.  Maybe chocolate chip cookies.  I don't remember seeing so many kids with allergies when mine were young.  Maybe that's because so much food now is processed, where then most everything was made from scratch.I'm off the get a couple of things done, like wash my kitchen floor (How one person can make such a mess of one floor, I will never know!) and put away the extra bottles of ketchup and cooking oil I bought for my food storage.  After a little supper it will be time to settle in with yarn and crochet hook.  Maybe I can find a good movie on Hulu to watch.  With all of the insanity going on in our world, sometimes it is nice just to sit back and enjoy a movie.  Even though I know that the terrorists are still flooding in and the perpetually offended are still causing more hate and discontent, and I know that the other shoe is apt to drop shortly, I still do rather love this quiet life for as long as it lasts."},
{"title": "Rain, Rain, Go Away", "date": "Tuesday, November 17, 2015", "text": "Doesn't look like it will any time soon.  By the time this band of rain that starts in south Texas and is working its way north through Minnesota has come and gone, I predict the building of at least one ark.  My sympathies today are with my sons - one of whom spends many of his days driving all over the metro area, checking on the properties his company services with lawn care and landscaping and the other who is, as I write, out in the rain, playing in the mud, either loading trucks with his forklift or moving pallets of soil and mulch from one place to another.  They don't complain.  They are employed.I don't care what the skeptics say.  Anyone with even a hint of arthritis in various joints of the body will swear that rain equals pain.  Therefore, you will find me over in that recliner in the corner, coffee mug on the table next to me, Kindle in hand, covered toes to chin in my green, fuzzy blanket.  Most times I will work my way through it, but just for today I believe I will take the easier road and rest.  This aging thing is a bugger sometimes."},
{"title": "Carrots, Carrots and More Carrots", "date": "Monday, November 16, 2015", "text": "I started with 24 lbs. of carrots that were on sale for 99 cents per 2 lb. bag.  That's a really good price for my area.  If they were carrots I had grown myself or had bought at the Farmers Market, I would have just scrubbed them clean.  But commercially grown produce often has been treated with chemicals to prevent sprouting between field and market, so I peeled them.Next the carrots were cut to fit my Vidalia food chopper.  For canning I often slice carrots, but the diced ones hold up better in soup, so I chopped them into 1/2 inch dices.  I ended up with 18 quarts of diced carrots.These were going to be dehydrated.  You can dehydrate carrots without blanching, but they rehydrate faster if blanched for three minutes before drying.  And they hold their color better.Dehydrated vegetables shrink down considerably, so I use plastic mesh inserts on my trays to prevent the small pieces from falling through.  I have 14 inserts, so I filled 14 trays, using 15 quarts of the diced carrots.  The other three quarts went into the freezer.  I set both dehydrators at 135 degrees.  I am not sure how long the drying process took.  The length of time depends a lot on humidity.  Vegetables dry faster on clear days than on rainy ones.  I started these early in the afternoon and just let them run all night.  They carrots were completely dried by noon the next day.  The 15 quarts of diced carrots dried down in volume to about 1 - 1/2 quarts. There are several ways to store dehydrated vegetables.  Some use mylar bags with oxygen absorbers.  Others use canning jars and still others use Food Savers to remove the air in the bags and to seal them.  I have tried the Food Saver method, but often dehydrated food has sharp edges that can easily puncture the bags.  And canning jars take up too much shelf space.  I found that if I store the dried vegetables in freezer bags, sometime using double bags if there are a lot of sharp edges, that works just fine.  I am not recommending this method - just saying what I do.  Air and light are not the friend of dehydrated foods.  So I bought a bunch of those cardboard bankers boxes with the lids - the kind that can be found at most office supply stores.  If you have read previous posts here, you know that I whine a lot about my lack of storage space.  But I have one of those heavy duty plastic, snap together shelving units that fits nicely behind my bedroom door.  Each shelf holds 3 boxes.  I can fit 15 boxes on the shelves - 18 if I stack the top boxes two high.  Each is labeled with the contents, and that whole setup works well for me.  I have used dried vegetables that are 5 years old, with no difference in looks or taste from those recently dried.If I want carrots as a vegetable for a meal, I will use my canned carrots.  But if I am making soup, which I do often in the fall and winter, I use the dried carrots.  I don't have a recipe.  I just put two or three quarts of water in the crock pot, some bouillon for flavor, a pint jar of whatever canned meat sounds good to me, and several handfuls of whatever vegetables I like.  The biggest problem is remembering that a large handful of carrots will rehydrate into at least a pint of carrots, so I need to use them sparingly. I really like having the dried vegetables in my pantry.  They work so well for soups and stews and, if soaked in boiling water, most will rehydrate well enough for use as a side dish.  And it just gives me another option for food storage without taking up as much space as the canned vegetables do.  Works well for me."},

{"title": "Where's The Beef", "date": "Thursday, November 12, 2015", "text": "Tuesday evening Oldest Son stopped at the store on his way home from work and bought a little over 25 pounds of beef roast that is on sale.  I spent the evening removing fat and gristle from the roasts, cutting them into about one inch cubes, bagging it up and storing it in the fridge.Wednesday afternoon my grocery delivery included another 15 pounds of beef.  Cleaned and cut into cubes, that also went into the fridge.Early this morning I started filling pint jars with beef cubes.  When canning raw meat I rarely use water or broth in the jars.  The meat makes its own juices during the canning process.  Some like to add salt at this point, but I don't.  I season the meat when I use it, and if I use bouillon as flavoring in a dish, that contains enough salt.Because the meat is cold when I pack it into jars, I take time to get the canner up to pressure.  Too much heat applied too quickly can crack jars, so I will usually take 45 minutes to an hour to heat it up.  After venting the canner for ten minutes, the pints are processed at 10 lbs. pressure for 75 minutes.  Quarts would take 90 minutes.  (Canner pressure varies according to elevation.)I wound up with 38 pints of cubed beef.I really like having canned beef on my shelves.  It has so many uses.  I have canned quarts of potatoes, carrots and peas together and combined with the canned beef, a pint of tomatoes and a bit of dehydrated onion and seasonings, makes a wonderful beef stew.  Just needs to be thickened and ladled over biscuits.  I also use it in a gravy over rice, potatoes or noodles.  Made into a sandwich and served with mashed potatoes and gravy, it makes a really good restaurant style hot beef sandwich.  It can be added to home canned vegetable soup or mashed up with a little pickle, mayo and onion for a sandwich spread.  Or it can just be heated in the oven along with home canned potatoes and carrots for a quick meal.  The uses for home canned beef are limited only by one's imagination.While the beef is processing, it is on to the carrots."},
{"title": "A Comment on Comments", "date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2015", "text": "My last post brought several comments from readers.  I have been blessed with a readership who leave kind, encouraging and often funny comments.  I suppose that is due to the fact that I tend to shy away from political commentary, although I will confess to going on a bit of a rant now and then when I have read about something that is so incredibly stupid that I just have to write about it to keep my head from exploding. This time the comments included some suggestions for future posts.  The suggestions were very good ones and I will be addressing those in posts just as soon as I deal with the canning and dehydrating coming up this week.  If you read my last post, you know that I have about 15 pounds of beef roast ordered.  Sometimes the grocery delivery service gets it right and sometimes...not so much.  Regardless, I know that Oldest Son is bringing me 25 pounds of beef either this evening or tomorrow.  As freezer space is minimal at best just now, I will be canning up the beef right away. I also ordered 24 pounds of fresh carrots that are on sale at 99 cents per two pound package.  I have plenty of carrots canned, but need to add to my dehydrated stash, so that will also keep me busy for a day or so.  I thought that canning/dehydrating season was over for the year, but at the rate grocery prices are increasing, it seems foolish not to take advantage of good sales.When I first started this blog in 2009, I was convinced that my only readers were maybe one or two of my kids.  And the grands who liked it when I wrote about them.   It still is amazing to me that others find my writings interesting.  I have been lucky in that the trolls have been very few.  For a time I was flooded with those badly worded comments telling me what a wonderful writer I am, that I have such an impressive blog with important information found nowhere else and always ended with an invitation to visit their website.  They didn't know who they were dealing with.  This granny didn't fall off the turnip truck just yesterday!  My \"delete\" button took care of the problem. I appreciate very much all of you who take time to visit here and those who comment.  It is fun for me to see what you all have to say.  Thank you."},
{"title": "Brick Wall", "date": "Sunday, November 8, 2015", "text": "Sometimes I hit a brick wall when it comes to finding interesting things to write about.  I look at all the other blogs I read...the ones who have homesteads and tell about all the things they are doing.  They are building greenhouses and outdoor kitchens and taking care of chickens and goats and pigs.  They have dogs and cats who do amusing things.  And then I look around at my three rooms and wonder what on earth can I find that is worth writing about.And then after a lady I consider a blogging friend left a comment on another post, wondering if I was OK because I hadn't posted for a while, I got to thinking that I was just being silly.  I may not have the chickens or pets or outdoor kitchens, but I do more than just sit here and stare at the walls.  I once knew a woman a little older than me who spent her days in a recliner set three feet away from her TV.  Most  days she didn't bother to get dressed, but sat there in her robe and slippers - all day - every day. Now I rather like my life that is pretty much free of drama.  A quiet life suits me.  But not that quiet!  The things that happen in my life may not be as exciting as the things that others write about, but I'll bet dollars to donuts (I wonder where that expression came from.) that there are others who have lifestyles like mine.  And just maybe they would like to know how someone in the same situation fills their days.  I know I have often wondered what the day to day lives of my grandmothers were like.  All I have to tell me are a very few letters written long ago.  At least when my grandchildren are old enough to wonder, they won't have to ask.So with that in mind, I will tell you that evenings this week I have spent time crocheting granny squares for a rug to use in my bedroom.  I make granny squares because they are easy and require very little counting of stitches.  I have tried crocheting afghans or rugs that are made in rows, but I usually screw them up, either dropping stitches at the end of a row or winding up with too many stitches in a row.   When I make the squares to sew together, I can watch something interesting on YouTube at the same time.  This week it was episodes of Antiques Roadshow, United Kingdom version.  I love listening to the British talk.This morning I got a phone call from Nicki, who is in Texas.  She is taking classes to become an Army Medic.  She told me all about what she is learning and about her schedule for completing the course.   What she wouldn't tell me is the date she will be home for Christmas.  She is planning to just walk in and surprise us, the stinker!  She is excited about her classes and very glad to be done with Basic.  She graduates from this training in March and then will find out where she will be stationed.  It was so good to hear her voice.This afternoon Number One Son popped in, laptop in hand.  He can pick up WiFi in his apartment, but the signal is much stronger here, so he came to catch up on computer stuff.  I talked him into staying for supper of homemade chicken nuggets and squash.  It didn't take much persuasion on my part and I probably didn't need to use the bribe of a pan of brownies, but it was fun for me to make goodies for his lunch next week.I made out my grocery order for next week.  The store has a sale on boneless beef roast, so I am ordering 15 lbs.  Son said he would stop at the store and get me another 25 lbs. of beef.  I know that $3.99 a lb. isn't cheap, but hamburger here is running about $5.00 a lb., so I decided to take advantage of the sale before the price went even higher.  I shop only the sales now, with just a few other items like milk and butter added.  I have reached my goal of having a years worth of food put back, and because I use from my pantry on a regular basis, I mostly just need to replace what I use from time to time.  That's a good feeling, knowing that my family will be able to eat when things get tough.I am sort of wishing that the presidential election was to be held this month instead of a year from now.  Not that I think it will matter much who is elected, but that I am already tired of the posturing and the sniping at one another and the accompanying lies.  I am afraid that our country is already so far gone that it will take a miracle to bring it back where it needs to be.  It would be nice, though, if there were more emphasis on dealing with the problems we face and less on poll numbers.  Sigh.Here in the North, fall is fading fast.  Temperatures are close to freezing at night - cool during daylight hours.  Not too long ago I heard a flock of geese, honking like mad, heading south.  The weather guessers here predict a cold, snowy winter, a warm winter, and all points in between.  Me... I don't care.  I can fort up and stay busy all winter if necessary.  Sounds like a plan.  :)"},

There will be more letters as soon as I have her new address.  Because I lead such a quiet life (read boring) I have been writing some about my family when I was growing up and about the lives of my parents when they were children.  She said she enjoys those stories and I am glad she does.  She is one more of that generation who will know who and where she came from.  I think it is important to pass on the family stories from one generation to the next.Pictures are nice and I am glad to have them.  But what I am really looking forward to is a hug from my granddaughter when she is home for Christmas."},
{"title": "Jar Count", "date": "Monday, October 26, 2015", "text": "Well, it is actually more of a freezer bag count.  The pumpkin and squash were baked in the oven until tender.  I put 3 cups of squash in each freezer bag and got 12 bags of squash deliciousness.  The baked pumpkin was a bit lumpy when scraped from the shells so I ran it through my blender to smooth it out, put 3 cups of pumpkin puree into each freezer bag and that yielded 9 bags.I had three large bags of apples that looked, just by eyeballing them, to be at least one bushel.  Those I ran through my handy, dandy apple peeler, corer, slicer gadget, and filled quart sized bags as full as possible.  That yielded 17 1/2 bags of apples.Now about the cranberries.  I have found, much to my chagrin, that I am not as young as I used to be.  Birthday Number 70 is on the horizon.  I realize that there are many folks of my vintage who just skip along like they were still 30.  I'm not one of 'em.  This past year has been a bit of a trial due to health issues, one of which kept me hospitalized for two weeks last winter.  Arthritis flare-ups have made it difficult to stay on my feet for prolonged periods of time.  Understand, this is not a major whine nor is it a bid for sympathy.  I have no time or patience for either.  It is just a statement of fact.  Those are the cards I was dealt.  Those are the cards I play.So with that in mind, I had to admit to myself that 50 lbs. of cranberries were not going to be processed all at once.  These berries are just plain beautiful and I didn't want to lose any of them by having them sit too long before processing.  I still have a lot of cranberry sauce on my shelf so I plan to make juice from these.  Son and I can go through a lot of juice in a year.I got out my recipe to see how many cranberries it takes for one batch of juice and then I bagged up the berries accordingly and froze them.  Making cranberry juice is time consuming, so this way I can make a couple of batches at a time which is much easier on my failing body than trying to process 50 lbs. all at once.  Here is the recipe I use:Cranberry Juice4 quarts (4 pounds) cranberriesWater3 to 3-1/2 cups granulated sugar  (I cut the amount of sugar per batch to 2 1/2 cups)Bring cranberries and 4 quarts water to a simmer in a large pot. DO NOT BOIL. Simmer 5 minutes, or until most berries burst.Pour berries and juice into damp jelly bag or a colander lined with four layers of clean cheesecloth. Let juice drip into a large bowl. DO NOT squeeze the bag.When you have extracted as much juice as possible from the pulp, return pulp to pot with 2 quarts water. Simmer 2 minutes.Pour this pulp and juice through jelly bag again to extract remaining juice.Place the 2 batches of juice in a large pot.Add sugar to suit your taste and 1 more quart water. Heat to dissolve sugar completely, but do not boil.Quickly pour into clean, hot jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace; seal.Process in boiling water bath for 15 minutes.Yields about 7 quarts.I have enough cranberries frozen to make 13 batches of this recipe which should yield about 90 quarts.  I have other things that need my attention this week, so I will probably make a batch or two of juice every week, starting next week.  I have to say that once you have a glass of homemade cranberry juice, you will not want to drink the store-bought kind ever again.  :)And with that, I believe canning season is about done.  Unless I find a really good sale on meat.  And even if I don't, my shelves (and a closet in Son's apartment) are full to overflowing.  It is such a good feeling to know that whatever Mother Nature decides to throw at us over the winter, be it blizzards or ice storms which are par for the course here in Minnesota, I have enough food on my shelves to feed Son and me and any other children or grandchildren who may need it.  I can rest easy until Spring, when the cycle will start anew.  Just as my parents and grandparents did it.  Just as it should be."},

{"title": "Batter Bread", "date": "Thursday, October 22, 2015", "text": "In the cooler months of the year I like to make my own bread.  Although I usually use my favorite tried and true recipe, sometimes I am busy with other things and kneading bread takes time.  When I found the recipe for a batter bread that requires no kneading, I decided to try it, for I thought it would be good for those busy days when I need to bake bread but am pressed for time.  I am pleased with the results.  It has a good flavor and is easy to mix up without the mess and time involved in kneading bread dough.  The recipe came from the Red Star Yeast website.America's Favorite Batter Bread3 cups water (120°-130°F)2 TBSP vegetable oil or shortening6 1/2 cups bread flour  (I used all-purpose flour)1 TBSP salt3 TBSP sugar4 1/2 tsp (2 packets) Red Star Active Dry Yeast (any dry yeast will work)Butter as desiredTraditional Baking MethodIn large mixer bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups flour, yeast, sugar and salt; mix well. Add water and shortening or oil to flour mixture. Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. By hand, gradually stir in remaining flour to make a stiff batter. Cover; let rise in warm place until double, about 30 minutes.Stir down batter with a spoon. Divide dough evenly between 2 greased bread pans.  Cover; let rise in warm place until batter reaches tops of pans, 20 to 30 minutes. Bake in a preheated 375°F oven for 35 to 40 minutes until golden brown. Remove from pans immediately; place on rack. Brush with butter; cool before cutting.These loaves aren't as pretty as loaves from kneaded bread dough in that the tops are a bit lumpy looking rather than smooth.  But they came out of the oven a beautiful golden brown and smelled and tasted wonderful.  I have heard that there are people in some circles who will pay a lot of money for \"rustic bread\" from a specialty bakery, so we will just call these loaves \"rustic.\"  :)I haven't tried the next recipe that came from the same source, but as long as the loaves turned out so good, I thought these rolls would be worth a try.Batterway White RollsThis recipe makes 18 3-inch rolls3 3/4 cups Bread Flour  (Can use all-purpose flour)1/4 cup Sugar1 1/2 tsp Salt1/3 cup Shortening, soft1 1/2 cups Water4 1/2 tsp Active Dry Yeast1 Egg, room temperatureIn large mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, yeast, sugar and salt; mix well.

Cool.If anyone tries this roll recipe before I get around to it, please let me know what you think of them.  Most times I don't mind taking the time and effort to knead roll dough and shape it into buns, but I think this recipe might be a fairly quick and easy way to have fresh baked rolls for supper on a busy day.  Any day that I can have fresh baked bread for a meal is definitely a very good day!"},
{"title": "A Bit of a Ramble", "date": "Wednesday, October 21, 2015", "text": "A couple of times every year I go through a period where I have to dig deep to find something to write about.  This is one of those times.  I suppose if I lived a life full of strife and drama, there would be all sorts of things to report, but that just isn't the case.  All of my kids and their spouses and a couple of grands are gainfully employed.  Nobody is sick.  Everyone is reasonably happy.  No drama there.  I like it that way.Youngest daughter is on her way to Oklahoma.  My Granddaughter graduates from Army Basic Training on Friday with Thursday being Family Day.  We are missing Nicki so very much and at the same time are so very proud of her.  I have to sort of smile when reading her letters.  Each letter I receive shows me a more grown-up person than the one I saw before she left home.  After graduation she goes to Texas where she will begin her training as a Medic.  I told her Mom to give Nicki a huge hug for me and I wanted pictures.  Lots of pictures!This past weekend didn't work out for another Farmer's Market run, but Son says he plans to go early Saturday morning for cranberries, squash, pumpkins and whatever else he can find that I can make use of.  I wouldn't mind getting more apples for canning apple slices.  A couple of years ago I canned some apple pie filling but was not overjoyed with the results.  I do like having pints of apple slices on the shelf and I wouldn't mind having some in the freezer as well.  We shall see what he can find.I am enjoying the cooler weather we are having here in Minnesota.  That means that I can bake without heating my apartment up to sauna conditions.  I made a double batch of chocolate chip cookies Monday.  One bag of them disappeared.  I think they walked down the hall and into Son's apartment.  :)  I am experimenting with a no-knead bread recipe and two loaves are rising in the kitchen.  If I like them I'll post the recipe.  I just love homemade bread.I was needing a rug for my living room.  The carpet is old and getting sort of shabby looking.  It is a huge hassle to move everything in order to install new carpet, especially when living in a small apartment with no real place to set the furniture for the installation, so an area rug seemed to be the answer.  However, area rugs are spendy. Now I was raised by parents who lived through the Great Depression.  They lived by the words, \"Use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without.\"  They passed that idea of frugal living on to me.  So rather than go out and spend a bucket of money just for a rug, I started looking around me to see what alternatives I could find.  My gaze landed on an afghan I had made a couple of years ago.  It is large and its only purpose was to look pretty draped over the back of a small bench at the foot of my bed.  I had never used it for anything else.  So on the floor it went. I have to admit that it is a bit unusual, but it serves a purpose and I rather like the result.  I think I have enough leftover yarn to make a couple more smaller rugs for my bedroom.  Like I have said before, my apartment will never grace the pages of \"House Beautiful,\" but I like it and I guess that is all that matters.I think the bread is ready for the oven and I am done rambling.  I suppose I may have something a bit more exciting to write about later on, but I doubt it.  When it comes right down to it, I will take my quiet, boring life over those whose lives are knee deep in drama, any old day of the week."},
{"title": "It's Hot Chocolate Time!", "date": "Wednesday, October 14, 2015", "text": "Here in southern Minnesota the leaves are starting to turn color.  The nights are sliding closer to freezing temperatures and the days rarely are above 60 degrees.   One of these days I will glance out my window and see those flakes of white in the air.  It is time to make hot chocolate mix.Every fall I make a large container of cocoa mix.  Other years I have used this recipe:Malted Hot Cocoa Mix1 (25.6 ounce) box nonfat dry milk powder1 (16 ounce) container instant chocolate milk mix1 (13 ounce) jar malted milk powder1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar1 (6 ounce) jar powdered nondairy creamer1/2 teaspoon saltIn large bowl, combine all ingredients and stir until well blended. Store in an airtight container. Keep in a cool place.To serve: In mug, pour 6 ounces of hot water over 1/3 cup cocoa mix, and stir until well blended.Although this makes a delicious cup of hot chocolate, I am thinking a bit differently about the ingredients I use.  Other years I have bought Nestle's Quick and powdered sugar and malt powder just for this purpose.  But I feel the need to be a bit more frugal.  Grocery prices across the board have increased substantially over the last year.  I can find other uses for my money than to buy fairly expensive ingredients.  So I tried this recipe using mostly what I already have on hand:Cocoa Mix2 cups nonfat dry milk3/4 cup white sugar1/2 cup non dairy creamer2 Tbsp cocoa powderpinch of saltMix ingredients together well and store in an airtight container.To make a cup: put 3 heaping tablespoons of cocoa mix into a mug and add 1 cup of hot water. Stir to mix well.This made a small amount for taste testing purposes.  It is good.  It tastes more like the cocoa we made when we were young before microwaves and packets of Swiss Miss - the kind where we heated the milk in a pan on the stove and added sugar and cocoa powder.  The only thing I don't normally keep on hand is the non dairy creamer.  You can't leave that out.  The recipe won't work without it.  But better to buy just one ingredient than several.  I will add Creamora to my food storage list.I, along with many others, live on a fixed income.  If I can save a dollar here and there, so much the better.  Comfort foods are an important part of food storage.  They help keep up morale during hard times.  And hot chocolate is one of those things that make me smile, especially when the wind is blowing and the snow is falling and I am watching it, cup of cocoa in hand, from my rocking chair by my living room window.  Which, in my opinion, is the best way to experience winter."},
{"title": "Coffee Delivery Service", "date": "Sunday, October 11, 2015", "text": "It is funny how things work.   I have lived alone for over eight years now, so when Son needed a place to stay, it took some getting used to, having another person living here.  And now that he has moved out, it takes some getting used to again.  I have to admit, he spoils me some.  Little things, like making a pot of coffee for me before he left for work at dark-thirty in the morning.  I had teased him that because he was moving to the apartment next door, there was no reason he couldn't continue that practice.I have railroad tracks running a block away from my apartment.  I can sleep right through the noise of a train whistle as it crosses that street intersection.  No problem.  But there are some noises that will awaken me from a sound sleep.  Years ago, when I lived close to my parents and when my mother was so very ill and her health was precarious at best, it was not unusual for me to get a phone call from my Dad in the middle of the night asking me to come to the hospital where she had been admitted for one complication or another relating to her rheumatoid arthritis, including several bouts of pneumonia.  Since that time I am wide awake at the first sound of the phone ringing.  Another sound that will wake me up is the sound of a key turning in the lock of my door.  And that is what I heard early this morning.When Son came into my kitchen, a fresh cup of coffee for me in hand.And about a half hour later, when he brought his coffee pot to refill my cup.I love his sense of humor!There has been nothing very exciting going on here in my little corner of the world.  I am still working on getting my apartment reorganized since Son's move.  He has taken several cases of my home canned food over to his place, and that has helped free up space for the ham, tomatoes and ham & bean soup I recently canned and which had been stacked in my kitchen for lack of room to put it away.  I thought I was about finished with canning season for this year, but I think there will be one more Farmer's Market run this coming weekend for cranberries and more butternut squash and maybe some pumpkins.  I like having cranberry juice on hand and the homemade juice is so much better tasting than anything I can buy premade. I think I will take time to make a couple of loaves of banana bread this afternoon.  I will keep one loaf and share the other with Son for his lunches this week.  It is always more fun to be able to share."},

Groceries were delivered.When you rely on a service for groceries you don't always get what you want.  Bone in pork chops were on sale and I had ordered two family sized packages.  Sometimes what you get are paper thin chops and you are stuck with them because you ordered the sale chops.  This time they were thick cut and huge.  I repackaged them for the freezer, saving out two for supper.  We baked them with seasonings and barbecue sauce and fried up some potatoes to go with them.  Delicious.Earlier in the day Son and I tag-teamed baking a cake.  Normally he would have just gone ahead and made it himself, (He was a restaurant cook in another lifetime and knows his way around a kitchen!) but he is still without glasses and can't see much.  I mixed up the batter for a yellow cake.  He buttered the cake pan and spread brown sugar over the butter.  I had a can of pineapple chunks that he opened and then decided to add mandarin oranges as well.  Over the fruit we sprinkled coconut and I poured the cake batter over the whole works.  Forty-five minutes later we had a wonderful smelling dessert. I had just started washing the supper dishes when the phone rang.  Youngest son was a couple of blocks away and he couldn't remember the code to get in the outside door.  He had a piece of cake with us and we sat and talked, mostly catching up on the activities of his children.  Finally he needed to leave.  It was getting late and he was still an hour from home.  With a hug for his Mom and another for his brother, he was gone.It has been a quiet evening.  Fall is upon us with nighttime temperatures dropping nearly into the forties.  There was some reading of a murder mystery and some snoozing in my recliner with a heavy crocheted afghan pulled up under my chin and some more reading.Today I just let the world carry on without me.  Tomorrow I will read the news sources on my computer and get mad at the stupidity of politicians, but for today, I settled for just having a nice day.  And it was enough."},

The cheapskate in me loves that the meat was a bonus left over from canning ham a couple of weeks ago.  Beans are still relatively inexpensive.  The onions and carrots were purchased on sale and dried using my dehydrators.  And I now have more meals that will feed us, no matter how high grocery prices get or no matter what happens around us.  Add a pan of cornbread and we will eat well."},
{"title": "Achoo and the Importance of Backups", "date": "Thursday, September 24, 2015", "text": "Yep.  Head colds.  Both of us.  Son is sneezing a lot.  I've had little energy the past couple of days and thought I was just tired but woke up this morning with a stuffed up head.  Nothing serious.  Head colds come and head colds go.  We will survive.Son is worse off than I am.  On Tuesday he was cleaning the lenses of his glasses when they fell apart.  Right where the nose piece connects with the lens frame.  Glasses are now two separate pieces.  Can't be fixed.  Optometrist didn't have a frame that the lenses would fit.  Friday is the earliest he can get in for an eye exam.  In the meantime he is home.  It is tough to run a forklift when you can't see more than six inches beyond the end of your nose.  He says he was way overdue for an eye exam anyway, but isn't happy about having to miss work.  Still has his sense of humor intact, though.  While feeling his way to the kitchen to make a pot of coffee, he allowed as to how learning braille might not be a bad idea.  :)This got me to thinking a bit more seriously about having a backup for some of the common items I use nearly every day.  We have a Mr. Coffee.  Useless without electricity.  I do have one of those coffee pots where you pour hot water in the top and it drips down over the grounds.  That pot is about 70 years old.  Got it from my Dad.  Makes great coffee.  But it might be a good idea to invest in another coffee pot that doesn't need to be plugged in.  After all.....coffee is the elixir of life.  I really don't know if I would want to face another day without coffee.  :)Can openers are another thing I  would not want to do without.  I have two hand-held openers.  Because of a bit of arthritis in my hands, I need ones that are large, easy to grip and easy to operate.  Should the ones I have cease to work, I would be hard pressed to open a can.  I should have more can openers stashed away.I have two kitchen mixers - one stand mixer and one hand held mixer.  Both have electric cords attached.  I think I need to find one of those old fashioned mixers that has two beaters that are operated by turning a crank.  One of those old beaters was a necessity in my Mother's kitchen.  She didn't have an electric mixer until I was about 15 years old.  (That was a banner year.  Got our first electric mixer, our first television set and my first and only baby brother that year!)  And although the new mixer was a time saver and labor saver, we had managed just fine without it.  Now I dearly love my Kitchen Aid stand mixer my kids gave me for Christmas a couple of years ago.  It makes life easier when the aches and pains of aging slow me down somewhat.  But as a backup, the old beater mixer would be a good thing to have.Now that I can see again, I have been doing some sewing in the evenings.  I've been piecing a quilt using just needle and thread to sew the pieces together.  Just wanted to see if I could make a quilt without using my sewing machine.  So far - so good.  I like the results even though it is time consuming.  Anyway, that got me to thinking about sewing supplies.  A couple of years ago I took advantage of a sale at Joann Fabrics.  Stocked up on pins, needles, thread, etc.  I noticed lately that my supply of thread was getting low.  We live in a throw-away society.  Lose a button or get a hole in a garment, out it goes and we buy new.  Well, some of us buy new.  Others like me were raised to fix what we had.  Sewing supplies for hand sewing could be important in a grid-down situation.  That includes the kind of thread for darning holes in socks.  I know.....nobody darns socks any more.  But if your last pair has holes in the heel and you can't get any more, darning socks is a useful skill.I think I need to go over my list (Yes.  I am one of those.  I make lists.) of items to add to my preps.  Seems I have forgotten a few things.  The world around me doesn't seem to be improving much, so I don't think it would be wise to delay."},
{"title": "Good News and Bad News", "date": "Saturday, September 19, 2015", "text": "Sometimes good news and bad news can come in the same package.  Both came to Son and me by way of a phone call from my landlord.I had wondered what happened to my neighbor, Alberta.  I had knocked on her apartment door several times but there was never any answer.  Nobody in the building seemed to know what had happened to her.  My landlord told me that Alberta had been hospitalized.  The tests run by her doctor showed she was full of cancer.  There was nothing to be done but keep her as comfortable as possible.  She passed on a couple of days ago. She had been my neighbor for probably 15 years.  I would tease her that she must have radar that could detect when I was canning, for often she would come by about the time I was taking jars out of the canner.  I knew that she missed having the home canned food, for she talked about all the canning she had done when she lived on the farm.  I always sent her home with a couple of jars of whatever I was canning.  Her radar worked on homemade bread as well.  When I still had my Yorkies she would knock on my door once in a while and ask if she could visit them.  They loved her and they made her laugh with their antics.  She was a good woman and a good neighbor.The good part of the phone call was that now there was an apartment available.  My landlord wanted to know if my son wanted it.  Of course, the answer was \"Yes.\"  We both had checked around town for apartments and anything decent was way more expensive.  My landlord includes all utilities except telephone and cable in the rent.  In a climate that can see -20 degrees or colder in the winter and hot, humid days in the summer, having the heat and air conditioning covered is a big deal.  It will be a little while before he can move in as the landlord is having the apartment painted, new carpet installed as well as replacing the old appliances.  But it is a relief to Son to know where he will live.   And it is nice for me to have one of my children within hollering distance.I have mixed feelings.  I am sad to lose a good neighbor and I feel bad that the apartment became available the way it did.  But at the same time, I am glad for my son because he really wanted to be able to live in this building.  I guess that's just the way life turns out sometimes."},

I don't want to see any more videos of mutilated babies.  My heart is already broken when I think of all those lives taken.  Babies who never had the chance to find out who they were.  Or who they could become or what they could accomplish.  Babies who were then cut up like so much meat to be sold. I don't want to see the latest method the terrorists use to kill people.  It was more than enough to see the beheadings and the crucifying and the burning in a cage and the drowning in a cage.  I don't want to see any more of the dark, evil hatred that lives in the hearts of those who can even think up those new ways to torture human beings.I really don't want to listen to any more of the snarky insults that presidential candidates toss back and forth like a beach ball.  Are they candidates for the most powerful leader of the free world or are they third graders on the playground.  Hard to tell the difference.I don't want to hear about any more executive orders done in secret on a Friday afternoon or a holiday weekend.  I particularly don't want to hear about the latest one that promotes the study of behavioral patterns of American citizens.  Really?  And why does our government need to know this?I don't want to watch any more news reports about the hordes of people crossing borders, both at home and in Europe.  Or about the terrorists making their way into my back yard.  Or about our leaders allowing and encouraging this to happen.And I really don't want to hear any more Black Lives Matter rhetoric, especially the calling for the killing of our police as recently happened just a few miles from my front door.  I would like to know, however, just who are you going to call to save your backsides when all the police are gone.  I sort of doubt that Sharpton and his ilk are going to come riding in to save the day.Sometimes I envy those who go blithely on their way, happily ignorant of the turmoil in the world around us.  Maybe there is something to be said for keeping your head buried in the sand.  Or for staying asleep.  But for those of us who are awake and have seen these horrors, these attacks on our God given rights, this calculated effort to ruin America, there is no way to unsee it all.  And what gets to me the most is the knowledge that there is nothing I can do about it. I can vote, but more and more that seems like a lesson in futility.  We think we are electing people who will make a difference - who will actually care about what the voters think.  Only to discover that about 15 minutes after taking the oath of office, they are ready, willing and able to begin feathering their own nests while leaving us out in the cold. I know that I need to stay informed.  If I don't know what the danger is, I won't know how to keep away from it or how to meet it head on, whatever the case may be.  But right now I am on news overload.  I don't know whether to scream or cry.So instead I will pour a glass of milk and grab three freshly baked chocolate chip cookies.  And when the rain stops tomorrow I will go sit on a bench and watch the Minnesota River flow lazily by on its way to the Mississippi.  And I will spend an afternoon sewing quilt pieces together.  And I will write a letter to my granddaughter in the Army, telling her how much her Grandma loves her.  And I will let the world continue to speed ahead toward disaster without my knowing about it.  Just for a day or two.  For sometimes - not very often, but sometimes - that is the only way I can deal with our world without having my head explode."},

No one really knows how old he was since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape. He selflessly devoted his life to service in schools; hospitals, homes, factories and offices, helping folks get jobs done without fanfare and foolishness.For decades, petty rules, silly laws and frivolous lawsuits held no power over Common Sense. He was credited with cultivating such valued lessons as to know when to come in from rain, the early bird gets the worm and life isn't always fair.Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend more than you earn), reliable parenting strategies (the adults are in charge, not the kids), and it's okay to come in second.A veteran of the Industrial Revolution, the Great Depression, and the Technological Revolution, Common Sense survived cultural and educational trends including feminism, body piercing, whole language and new math.But his health declined when he became infected with the \"if-it-only-helps-one-person-it's-worth-it\" virus. In recent decades, his waning strength proved no match for the ravages of overbearing federal legislation.He watched in pain as good people became ruled by self-seeking lawyers and enlightened auditors. His health rapidly deteriorated when schools endlessly implemented zero tolerance policies; when reports were heard of six year old boys charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; when a teen was suspended for taking a swig of mouthwash after lunch; when a teacher was fired for reprimanding an unruly student. It declined even further when schools had to get parental consent to administer aspirin to a student but couldn't inform the parent when a female student is pregnant or wants an abortion.Finally, Common Sense lost his will to live as the Ten Commandments became contraband, churches became businesses, criminals received better treatment than victims, and federal judges stuck their noses in everything from Boy Scouts to professional sports.As the end neared, Common Sense drifted in and out of logic but was kept informed of developments, regarding questionable regulations for asbestos, low-flow toilets, smart guns, the nurturing of Prohibition Laws and mandatory air bags.Finally, when told that the homeowners association restricted exterior furniture only to that which enhanced property values, he breathed his last.Common Sense was preceded in death by his parents Truth and Trust; his wife, Discretion; his daughter, Responsibility; and his son Reason. His three stepbrothers survive him: Rights, Tolerance and Whiner.Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone.Author Unknown"},

{"title": "Ham In A Jar", "date": "Thursday, September 10, 2015", "text": "I like to have a variety of home canned meat on my shelves.  The one that I ran out of a while back was ham.  I have used the boneless hams for canning in years past, but have not been completely satisfied with it.  I'm not sure why.  It tastes just fine.  Maybe it is because when cubed and canned, the cubes remain very firm.  Silly reason, I suppose, but there it is.So I asked Son to bring home six hams from the grocery for canning.  Last evening I cut the meat from the bones.  I purposely left some meat on the bones and froze them for future use in making ham and bean soup.  This morning I cut the larger pieces to fit into wide mouth pint jars.  The rest I cut into about one-inch pieces and packed them into the small mouth pints.  I don't add liquid to the jars as the canning process creates enough liquid in the jars.  They are processed for 75 minutes at 10 lbs. pressure.  I wound up with 42 pints of ham.The larger pieces will be heated and used for meals, the same as if I were baking a ham.  The smaller bits are good for ham salad sandwiches, mixed into scrambled eggs or in scalloped potato dishes.  I think the uses for this ham is limited only by a person's imagination.And now I think I am done canning meat for this year.  It has taken some time, but I finally have enough canned to last at least a year, which was my goal."},
{"title": "Chicken Vegetable Soup", "date": "Saturday, September 5, 2015", "text": "So Friday afternoon Number 1 Son did a grocery run and came home with about 40 lbs. of chicken thighs.  They don't go on sale all that often so I thought we had better take advantage of the 99 cents a lb. price. I filled my big stock pot and two smaller pots with the chicken thighs, added water to cover and let them cook until they were falling off the bone done.  When they were cool enough to handle I pulled the meat from the bones and cut it into about 1-inch pieces.  I had thawed 6 lbs. of frozen mixed vegetables, so I layered a generous cup of meat and a cup of vegetables into quart jars.  I used the broth that the chicken cooked in to fill the jars to within 1-inch from the top.  I had 17 quarts of chicken vegetable soup when I ran out of vegetables.I still had quite a bit of chicken left, so I put 2 generous cups of meat in quart jars and added the broth.  I wound up with 12 quarts of chicken in broth.  I figure I can use that as a soup or stew base, or thicken the broth for chicken and gravy over mashed potatoes or rice or baking powder biscuits.  It probably will work in chicken casserole dishes as well or for chicken and dumplings.Some people add salt when they can meat or vegetables, but I usually do not.  Often I will add a bit of chicken bouillon for extra flavor when I heat it up and that generally is enough salt.I was kind of surprised at how much mileage I got out of the chicken.  Haven't a clue where I'm going to store it all, but I sure am glad to have it.  I think of all the different meats I can, I use chicken the most.  Chicken soup is kind of a comfort food and the Farmer's Almanac is predicting a really cold winter here this year.  Probably going to need to be comforted long about February.  :)"},
{"title": "Does Anyone Write Letters Any More?", "date": "Thursday, September 3, 2015", "text": "When my granddaughter came to see me before leaving for Army Basic Training, her one request was that I write to her.  She isn't allowed to keep her cell phone, so no calls or text messages.  No email either.  But she is allowed to receive mail.  I warned her that letters from me might be pretty boring.  I lead a  quiet life.  Not much drama here.  She said, \"I don't care if your letters are boring.  Just please write to me.\"  So I have had to dust off my letter writing skills and get busy.Her request for letters got me to thinking about how things have changed over the years.  As a kid, I wrote a lot of letters, mostly to my grandmas and cousins.  Back then, long distance phone calls were expensive so they were reserved for emergency situations.  But we could always come up with a few pennies for a postage stamp.  So we wrote.I have in my files a few letters written by my aunts to my parents.  They almost always included letters in the cards they sent at Christmas time.  It is fun to re-read those letters from time to time.  Most of them are over 50 years old and some trigger memories of what was going on within our family back then.  Something of the personalities of each writer shows in the style of writing.  One aunt with a great sense of humor would write about the funny side of her life.  Another aunt who had sort of a sour disposition would write letters full of complaints.  Most times I could tell who had written the letter before ever getting as far as the signature.One of my cousins shared the transcripts of about 60 letters written by my great-grandparents and by their adult children.  They date from 1893 to 1918.  They provide a picture of what life was like for that family around the turn of the century, mostly when they were homesteading in Minnesota, having moved here from New York.  I had all their information - birth dates, death dates, names of their spouses and children - already entered in my genealogy program.  But the letters showed me who they were - their personalities, their likes and dislikes, their love for one another.  Fascinating.My all time favorites aren't the letters themselves, but the envelopes.  The following were scanned from my Mother's scrapbook.The first is a clipping from a Twin Cities Sunday newspaper.  Mother's sister, Margaret had left home in northern Minnesota to work in St. Paul.  She sent a letter in an envelope with her drawings for the address.  My grandfather lived in Blackduck, Minnesota at the time.  Her likeness of him was so accurate that the letter reached him without any problem.The second is an envelope from a letter written by the same person - Mother's sister.  The likeness of my mother is so good that the letter reached her without delay.And now I am off to write to Nicki.  After all, I promised."},
{"title": "Make Plans...", "date": "Wednesday, September 2, 2015", "text": "and the gods hold their sides, laughing.I had big plans for chicken thighs that are on sale this week.  They come in a family pack and I had ordered six of them.  The plan was to make chicken vegetable soup to can.  But the gods said, \"I don't think so.\"  There was a power outage at the store where the grocery delivery service shops.   The delivery guy told me that there was no meat at all available when my shopping was done.  It crossed my mind that if it all goes to hell like it seems to be doing, this kind of food shortage could be the norm rather than the exception.  No point in getting upset.  Couldn't be helped.  Luckily it was just one store that had the problem and Son will pick up the chicken I need for the soup at another store.  Take that, you snickering gods!I did get twelve 1-lb. bags of baby carrots that are on sale for $1 each.  I like to put a roast or chicken in the oven, surround it with potatoes, carrots and onions and slow bake it, or do the same in the crock pot.  So I packed the carrots in pint jars, added water to cover them and pressure canned them for 25 minutes.  Wound up with 27 pints of carrots. While I was working on the carrots, I had pretty much decided just to forget about canning the chicken soup.  But then I got to remembering the reason I do all of this.  We could go on for years, doing a slow slide into third world status, or we could drop to the bottom with a bang.  Either way, the whole idea is to be prepared for whatever happens.  I have been told that I am foolish to have this much food on my shelves.  \"What are you going to do with it all,\" they ask.   \"Nothing is going to happen,\" they say.  I hope they are right.  I hope that life continues as it has for generations.  But if it doesn't, seems to me there is a real possibility that the last jar of chicken soup may be the very thing that saves someone in my family from starving.   So I will continue to can the soup, continue to add to the household and medical items that will be useful and in some cases, necessary should they become scarce in the future.It is called \"common sense.\""},
{"title": "Dad and Sister", "date": "Tuesday, September 1, 2015", "text": "This photo was taken in the spring of 1912. Dad is the baby and his sister, Clarice, is holding him.  They are seated in front of the first house that my grandfather, Clifford Alton Matheny, built on the land he homesteaded near Blackduck, Minnesota in 1904.  Some years later, he built a new, more modern house that was stucco on the outside and had a second story for the children's bedrooms.  Dad told me they built the new house around the old one.  They tore down the old house as the new one went up.  The new house had electricity, but no running water or indoor plumbing.  I remember that water was pumped using a hand pump just off the back door of the house, and the outhouse was a short distance in the same direction.  Water had to be carried into the house, and I remember that the drinking water was in a white enamel bucket sitting on a stool by the kitchen door.  There was a metal dipper in the bucket, and when someone wanted a drink of water, they filled the dipper and drank from it.  It was the best tasting water I have ever had, and I don't think anyone ever got sick from drinking from the dipper.  Folks were a lot tougher then.This photo is also of Dad and Clarice, and Dad said it was taken in the fall of 1912. Clarice's job was to watch over her baby brother, and she continued to do so for over 90 years.  They probably had one of the closest sibling relationships that I know of, and even when both were in the nursing home in Blackduck, they enjoyed each other's company.  Dad is wearing a dress in this photo, and he said that was common practice back then for a boy to wear dresses until about the age of three years, when he was old enough to manipulate the buttons on the fly of a pair of pants.I have always treasured these two photos for the fact that they are now over 100 years old, and they are the only photos I have of Dad as a baby.I think this may be my favorite picture of Dad and Clarice in their later years. I have always thought that Dad looks like he either has been up to some mischief, or that he is about to.  Which wouldn't surprise me one little bit."},
{"title": "Another Bogus Protest", "date": "Friday, August 28, 2015", "text": "The Black Lives Matter contingent is at it again.  This time they are planning a protest outside the Minnesota State Fairgrounds.  Their beef?  They claim that minority vendors are being discriminated against and not enough of them are being awarded space to sell their wares during the fair.The Minnesota State Fair Board is responsible for taking applications and awarding vendor space.  Being able to sell at the State Fair is a highly prized outlet for vendors.  There are a limited number of spaces available each year and it can take years of applying every year to finally win that space.  Some have applied for 10 years or longer before being accepted. I found the downloadable application at the State Fair website.  It is a standard form.  Photos of the products and booth set-up are required.  So is proof of having previously sold at other fair venues, such as county fairs.  In other words, vendors need credentials to qualify. Nowhere on the form is the question of race addressed.  This has nothing to do with race and everything to do with the quality of the product being sold and the appropriateness and curb appeal of the booth design and the previous experience of each vendor.Our governor weighed in saying that tomorrows protest was inappropriate.  If this group had complaints, they should have taken them to the Fair Board months ago.In my opinion these protests are not about racial inequality, but are all about causing trouble.  I don't know about anywhere else, but here the citizens are getting a little tired of it all.  I think that about 11 AM tomorrow when this protest is due to begin, I will turn on the scanner and set it for Ramsey County.  Should be interesting to see what happens when these fools try to shut down the State Fair, which has a long tradition in Minnesota of being a place to spend an enjoyable day with family and friends."},
{"title": "Lets Be Fair", "date": "Wednesday, August 26, 2015", "text": "This morning I spent a little time with Youngest Son.  When we are together, part of our conversation is always about his three children - my beautiful grandchildren.  This morning we talked mostly about the youngest, Jacob.Jacob played football this summer.  At the end of their season there was a tournament involving several teams.  Jacob's team lost their first game and won their second.When the last game had been played a table was set up.  On the table were the awards of trophies and ribbons.  Jacob asked his coach which of the awards were his.  His coach kindly told him that thoseawards were for the team that won the tournament.I am impressed that my grandson didn't stomp or cry or make a fuss because he didn't get a trophy.  The credit for this belongs in two places.First, he had a coach that doesn't believe in rewards for just showing up.  If the kids want a trophy they have to work for it.  They have to pay attention and learn the game and learn teamwork and practice.  They are kids, so it should be fun as well.  But the winner of the tournament gets the trophy.Second, and most important, he has two parents who both have excellent work ethics.  They have taught all of their kids that if you want something, you need to work for it.  Jacob has learned that lesson in the sports he loves.  His sisters have learned that their dance and gymnastics earn rewards through hours of hard work and practice.Oh, there are the occasional treats - an ice cream on the way home - a night out to a ball game with Mom and Dad - time spent with family.All three children earn every penny of their allowances.  There is no payment for just being there.  As my son put it this morning, \"There aren't going to be any trophies for just showing up at a job.  They will be expected to earn their salaries when they grow up.\"  I heartily agree with him.  As adults there will be nobody who will pat them on the head and tell them how wonderful they are for just showing up and participating.  These people who hand out rewards for just participating are creating a false atmosphere of fairness.  They think that it is not fair that some kids don't get the trophies or ribbons.  But as Son put it, \"Nobody ever said that life was fair.  If the kids who do what is expected of them get the same rewards as those who don't, then why should they bother.  Then there is no incentive to work hard and do better.\"And that gives me hope for the future."},
{"title": "Farmers Market Finds", "date": "Monday, August 24, 2015", "text": "Early Sunday morning, Number One Son headed to the St. Paul Farmers Market.  He came home loaded down with goodies.Cucumbers were in the first bag I opened.  They were the small ones, just right for dill pickles.  I washed them, trimmed off the blossom ends, packed them in pint jars with a bit of dill and added boiling brine.  I cheated on the brine and used Mrs. Wages Dill Pickle Mix.  I have a long history of making really lousy homemade dill pickles.  Youngest Son uses the Mrs. Wages mix and his dills are excellent, so I went that route.  The pickles went into my water bath canner for 10 minutes.  I got 25 pints.  We figured out later that even with using the mix and buying cukes, it was still less expensive than buying pickles at the store on sale.  With any kind of luck Son will be able to find some larger cucumbers next weekend that I can use for sliced Bread and Butter Pickles.  I make awesome Bread and Butters.  :)He brought home four cantaloupe that are probably some of the best tasting I have ever had.  There is such a huge difference between the locally grown and the ones that are shipped into the stores.  I peeled them and cut them into chunks.  We have been eating off them for the past two days and still have at least two quart bags full left in the fridge. By the time I finished the pickles I was, as some of our friends across the pond would say, knackered.  So I left the cabbage until this morning.We buy cabbage from the same vendor every year.  I don't know what kind they are, but they are huge.  They aren't round like the ones you typically see in the store, but are a more flattened shape.  They average about 12 inches across and maybe six to eight inches tall and they are solid.  The vendor charges only $2 each.  Son brought home five of them.  This morning I started making sauerkraut.  As I don't have a good place for a crock or bucket, I use this recipe instead.  I have made sauerkraut this way in the past and it has turned out really good.Easy SauerkrautCabbage (the amount depends upon how much kraut you want to make)Canning Salt,Sugar 1.  Shred cabbage and pack tightly into quart jars up to 1/2 inch from the top.2.  Add 1 teaspoon canning salt and 1 teaspoon sugar to the top of each quart.3.  Pour boiling water into each jar up to the top of the kraut.4.  Use a knife gently inserted into the jar to remove any bubbles.5.  Put on canning lids and screw on cap loosely, not tight.6.  Put the jars in a sink or pan so that any bubbling water won't make a mess.7.  Let ferment for 24 hours.8.  Remove the caps, remove any scum if necessary and refill with boiling water as needed.9.  Seal as tightly as you can with your hand.10.  Let ferment for 3 days. It does smell a bit, so you might want to do it in a basement, garage or spare room where it isn't too cold.11.  Now it's ready to process!12.  Process the quarts for 20 minutes in a boiling water bath. Store for a minimum of three weeks before eating.I put the filled jars into the boxes they came in that are lined with plastic so if there is any bubble-over it won't soak through the cardboard.  I have never had a problem with the smell.  I have 14 quarts and 16 pints of sauerkraut happily fermenting away.  The pint jars are an experiment.  Right now there are two of us here, but later there will be just me.  A quart of kraut is just too much for one person.  I just put half the salt and sugar into each jar and proceeded from there.I still had a head and a half of cabbage left, so I cut it up into about one-inch pieces and filled my dehydrator trays.  Both dehydrators are running, each with 8 trays and I still have enough cabbage to probably fill all 16 trays again. My dill pickle jars are sitting in boxes on my kitchen floor.  The reason my dill pickle jars are sitting in boxes on my kitchen floor is because I have no more room on my shelves.  I am going to have to take part of a day and do some serious rearranging in order to have a spot for everything.  I am not complaining, mind you.  It has taken me several months to build my home canned food back up after using so much of it over the winter.  With the world around us in such a turmoil, it is comforting to know that no matter what happens, my family will not go hungry.to someone who has decided they are about to die?Yesterday afternoon my neighbor knocked at my door.  When she sat down at my kitchen table she told me that she wanted to see me before she died.Alberta has had a rough go of it.  She is about my age but looks 20 years older.  She has already gone through treatment for cancer and she won that round.  She has been experiencing pain and has had all sorts of tests run.  The results will be in on Tuesday and she will find out what is wrong. Alberta's life has been one of hard work and struggles.  She spent many years doing farm work with her husband up to the time of his death.  She lost a daughter who passed on several years ago.  Her grandson is in jail for attempted burglary.  She has a couple of other useless adult children, the worst being her son.  I have seen him sitting behind the wheel of his car, watching his mother who walks with a cane, struggle up the walk with half a dozen bags of groceries.  The only thing preventing him from helping her was a case of lazy.And now she has made up her mind that she is about to die.As I was trying to figure out what I could say to her to help, I remembered that she is a very plain spoken woman.  You never have to wonder what Alberta thinks.  She will tell you straight out.So I said, \"Alberta, you know that you are just plain too mean to die.\"And she looked at me and started to laugh.  I reminded her that she hadn't seen the test results yet.  Maybe things weren't as bad as she thought.  I said that she should just wait and see what happened before deciding to die.  And she agreed that would be the best course of action.She left my apartment with a smile on her face and a promise to let me know what happened at her Tuesday appointment.Maybe Alberta's condition isn't all that bad.  Maybe it is worse.  Maybe she will die soon.  Only God knows.  What I do know is sometimes we are required to come up with just the right thing to say or do in a particular situation.  I don't know if I am up to that task.And if you are of a mind to, please remember Alberta in your prayers.  She needs all the help she can get."},
{"title": "Time To Say \"No More\"", "date": "Sunday, August 23, 2015", "text": "At a time when nearly all news is bad, it was refreshing and hopeful to read the following.  I am posting the article in its entirety because I think it is important.  You can also read it here.\"School band told to stop performing 'How Great Thou Art'By Todd Starnes  Published August 21, 2015There was no halftime show under the Friday night lights at Mississippi’s Brandon High School — the marching band had been benched.The band was ordered off the field because the Christian hymn “How Great Thou Art” was a part of their halftime show — in violation of a federal court order.“The Rankin County School Board and District Office are very saddened students will not be able to perform their halftime show they have worked so hard on this summer,” the district wrote in a statement to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.In 2013 a student sued the district over a series of Christian meetings that had been held on school property, the newspaper reported. The district later settled the lawsuit and acknowledged they had violated the student’s First Amendment rights. In July, U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves ruled the district had violated the agreement after a Christian minister delivered a prayer at an awards ceremony. Judge Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President Obama, came down hard on the school district — ordering them to pay thousands of dollars in fines. He also warned the district that future violations would cost them $10,000.“Defendants are permanently enjoined from including prayer, religious sermons or activities in any school sponsored event including but not limited to assemblies, graduations, award ceremonies, athletic events and any other school event,” the order reads.Word about the band getting benched spread across the town quicker than kudzu. I must have received emails and Facebook messages from nearly the entire state - from Desoto County to Yazoo City. Something must be done to right this wrong, people said. A message had to be sent to the likes of Judge Reeves. Locals  gathered in coffee shops and garages to devise their plan.And what they did — would become known as the musical shot heard around the world.During halftime of Friday night’s game - a lone voice began to sing the forbidden song.“Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee,” the singer sang.Brittany Mann was there and she witnessed the entire moment of defiance.“We were just sitting there and then one by one people started to stand,” she told me. “At first, it started out as a hum but the sound got louder and louder.”She said it was a “truly incredible” moment to watch hundreds of people singing together in the stadium.“At that moment I was so proud of my town - coming together and taking a stand for something we believe in,” she said. “It breaks my heart to see where our country is going — getting farther and farther away from the Christian beliefs that our country was founded on.” I suspect Miss Brittany wasn’t the only one who felt a sense of pride in the Magnolia State on that warm summer night. “We may be pictured as toothless, barefoot, uneducated people around the country, but we are far from it,” nearby resident Mandy Miller told me. “I’m from Mississippi and I’m not ashamed to take a stand.” Oh what a sight it must have been — as hundreds and hundreds of people stood together and with one voice — sent a message to Judge Reeves.“This is the kind of thing that makes me proud to be from the South,” Miss Mandy told me. “We are getting tired of being told to sit down and shut up. People are ready to fight back.”Miss Mandy is absolutely right. The time has come to stand up to the secularists.The time has come to put an end to their cultural jihad.I hope the Rankin County School Board will reconsider its decision and allow the marching band to resume performing “How Great Thou Art.”   And should Judge Reeves make good on his threat to financially punish the school district, I will personally pay the $10,000 fine. \"It may be just a small thing.  David of the Bible and his slingshot were small things compared to the size of the giant.  So was the pebble that felled the giant.Every day there are those who would seek to ruin America.  They delight in forbidding us through laws or executive orders or judges to freely express our opinions and our faith.  Yet they expect us to honor their beliefs without question. The time is now to say \"No More.\"  I am just a chubby, gray haired granny.  I can not change our Godless government.  But what I can do is to refuse to comply.  I can refuse to give up my faith to the whims of the Godless.  I can keep on speaking my truth.  I can keep on writing my truth. And if need be, I can stand alone in a stadium and sing \"How Great Thou Art.\""},
{"title": "A New Kitchen Gadget", "date": "Thursday, August 20, 2015", "text": "The other day while waiting for my surgery to begin, I was chatting with my daughter about this and that.  I mentioned that I had been looking for a juicer to use for making fruit juices and maybe vegetable juices.  I love my coffee, but like a glass of juice now and then.  Sometimes the store bought juices are overly sweet and I thought maybe making my own would be a good way to control the sugar content.I had forgotten that my kids are constantly in touch with one another.  Tuesday morning I got a phone call from Youngest Son.  \"I hear you are looking for a juicer,\" he said.  I replied that he was right.  He told me he had a friend who had one to sell.  Like many specialty appliances, the machine had been purchased and the novelty had worn off after about a half a dozen uses.  I can understand that if you are making only a couple of glasses of juice at a time it might be more bother than it was worth to drag out the machine, make the juice and then do the cleanup, but for me who likes to can up all sorts of food products, it would be a great time saver plus making the whole process easier.  He told me the brand name and said that his friend had paid $200 a year or so ago and that he would sell it for $75.I looked the juicer up online and found that the price paid for it new was about right.  Then I watched several videos on how to use the machine.  Looked to me like it would work well for what I had in mind.  I found there was the possibility for a bonus.  The machine discards the fruit or vegetable pulp into a container after extracting the juice.  I think the pulp can be spread on dehydrator trays lined with fruit roll-up sheets and dried.  Carrot or celery or tomato pulp could be used as flavoring for soups.  Fruit pulp could be used in muffins or fruit breads or other baked goods. Anyway, Youngest Son delivered my new-to-me juicer this morning.Over the weekend I will get a variety of fruit and vegetables at the grocery and give it a test run.I love kitchen gadgets!"},

{"title": "Canning Bacon Details by Request", "date": "Sunday, August 2, 2015", "text": "My friend Mary over at \"Adventures Of My Life!\" asked if I would give details on how I can bacon bits, so I decided to answer her in a post just in case anyone else might be interested.The end product is bacon bits - not the canned bacon strips.  I haven't yet tried canning bacon strips, but there are lots of videos out there giving basically the same instructions.  I may give that a go at a later date but right now, I can the bits.I buy the packages of bacon ends and pieces.  I'm going to chop it all up so I don't need pretty slices.  They usually come in three pound packages and cost less per pound than regular packages of bacon.  Most times I can nine pounds at a time. Note:  The only time I have had disastrous results was when I used bacon that was only smoked and not cured.  It turned into a greasy, slimy mess that I wound up tossing.  The bacon should be cured the same as the bacon that comes in the regular packages at the grocery.I just grab a handful of bacon, flop it onto my cutting board and slice into about half-inch pieces.  When the bacon is all cut up, I put about three handfuls into a dutch oven and fry it over a medium-low heat until it is lightly browned.  (Sorry about the exact measurements here, but that's how I do things!)  I want the bacon to be light brown in color rather than crisp because it will cook more in the pressure canner.  As each batch is done, I just drain it in a colander that sits over a bowl to catch the bacon grease.  I save the grease for other uses.When all of the bacon is cooked and drained, I pack it into half pint jars, tamping it down with a wooden spoon, to within one inch of the top of the jar.  DO NOT add any liquid or bacon grease to the jars.  The rim of the jar is carefully wiped with a paper towel dipped in vinegar.  The vinegar will cut any grease from the jar rim.  This step is important because any grease left on the jar rim can cause the jar to fail to seal.  Add lids and rings.Process the jars of bacon in a pressure canner for 75 minutes at whatever the correct weight is for your area.  Mine is 10 lbs. pressure.  Higher elevations would be more.  Follow the instructions for your particular canner.  Mine doesn't have a gauge, so the instructions are slightly different from those that do have a gauge.  Pints and half pints are canned the same amount of time.The last batch of bacon bits I canned using nine pounds of bacon yielded 17 half pints.  Probably would have had one more jar, but Son and I kept snitching bacon while it was cooling!Bacon bits can be canned in pint jars as well, but I find for my use, the half pints are just right.  I mix the bits in with scrambled eggs or use in omelets.  They can be sprinkled on a green salad.  They can be used in any number of egg or potato casseroles.  I even add them to scalloped potatoes.  The uses for these tasty little nuggets are limited only by your imagination.So there you go, Mary.  Hope this helps.  :)"},

Friday the circus starts with a pre-op checkup.  Monday is the cataract surgery on my right eye, followed by two post-op checkups.  Two weeks later we do it all over again for my left eye.  I'm not looking forward to the actual surgeries nor am I happy about all the running back and forth to doctor's offices.  But I am looking forward to the possibility of being able to see clearly for the first time in 60 years. I am extremely nearsighted.  Without my glasses, the largest line on an eye chart is a gray blur.  I have always lived with the little nagging fear that I would break my glasses when out somewhere and not be able to see well enough to find my way.  I am thankful that this worry will be eliminated.My children, bless their hearts, are organizing getting me to and from all the appointments.  I have a list.  My job is to be ready at the right time on the right day.  They are taking care of everything else, including holding Mom's hand because although she talks like she is brave, she really isn't."},

It has been hot and humid here this past week.  Early this morning (Friday) one of those fast moving storms rolled through.  A lightning strike close enough to bring me completely awake from a sound sleep (takes a lot to accomplish that) knocked our power out for an hour or two.  We have had few storms this summer so far, but the ones we have had have been fast and violent.  I would like to see a day of just gentle rain that would cool things down a bit.  I am really looking forward to fall."},

{"title": "I Wondered How Long It Would Take...", "date": "Tuesday, July 21, 2015", "text": "before the gun grabbers would come after me.  Didn't take as long as I thought it would.I have been reading about the plan to have the Social Security Administration share information with the government so they know who to allow to own a gun and who to ban from owning a gun.  I am not going to take the time to cite references.  Google \"Social Security gun grab.\"Before going any further, let me make one thing crystal clear.  There are those who consider Social Security an entitlement.  I do not.  Every paycheck I received from age 15 on had money for Social Security deducted from it.  My generation was told of the benefits of these deductions.  We were told that at the end of our working life we would have this money available for our retirement...to keep us from starving in our old age.  To help keep us off of the welfare rolls.  You might ask why some of us didn't save for retirement.  That is a fair question.  Many of us were unable to save.  Many of us could not afford the education for higher paying jobs.  Many of us needed every dime of our take home pay just to survive.  We needed it to feed our families.  We needed it for the ever increasing cost of living that always seemed to outrun pay raises.  We needed it to take care of ourselves and our children without relying on welfare, for my generation considered it shameful to beg for a handout.  There just plain was no money left at the end of the month to put into savings.  We believed what our government told us about Social Security.That being said, I now find that Social Security has the potential to be used against me.  This, really, is nothing new.  Every now and then some politicians use the threat of cutting Social Security in order to get what they want in Congress.  I have heard presidential speeches, particularly the last six years or so, in which statements are made to the effect that it would be a shame to have to make cuts to Senior Citizen's Social Security checks, but unless our resident tyrant gets his way, that may very well happen.  I doubt that Congress would allow that to happen, but this president is sneaky.  He has that phone and that pen and he isn't afraid to use them.So now instead of threatening the Gray Hair Brigade, he is trying to use Social Security to disarm us.  The plan is for the Social Security Administration to report which of us need help with our finances.  There is a laundry list of other things the government wants to know, but this particular criteria is the one that could affect me.I have, as have many like me, added one of my children to my bank account.  There are two reasons for this.  The first is to insure that even if I am ill or housebound as I was over the past winter and spring, there is a trusted family member who can physically go to the bank for me should the need arise, and take care of whatever business needs to be transacted.  The second is that I am on the downward slope of life.  When I die I want my children to have access to whatever is in my bank account to divide between them and to pay any outstanding bills.So now I find that this act of convenience for me and my children has the probability of being used as proof that I am incapable of managing my own finances.  That I need help to do so, when nothing could be further from the truth.  I keep track of my own money.  I balance my own checkbook.  I spend or save my money as I please.  And now this decision of convenience can be used to make sure that I am left with no way to defend myself or my property.I fully understand that putting a loaded gun in the hands of an elderly person with dementia is not a good thing.  And I understand that there are other circumstances where gun ownership by Seniors would pose a danger not only to others, but to themselves as well.  But for those of us who are still fully functioning citizens of a certain age, the notion that we should be deprived of our Second Amendment rights is ludicrous.Our government officials seem to have forgotten one thing though.  And I call upon all geezers who are still upright, taking nourishment and still have their senses about them to remember, as my Daddy used to say:\"There's more than one way to skin a cat.\""},

{"title": "White Coats and Appointments", "date": "Friday, July 17, 2015", "text": "So I had an appointment a week or so ago with my family physician.  They make you come in every three months.  They don't like to refill prescriptions unless you do.  So I did.My children take me to these appointments.  They do so because I don't own a car.  And because they don't trust me to follow doctor's orders.  They know about the dislike I have for doctor visits.  Comes from my parents, I think.  Mother was ill nearly all of her life and spent countless hours and days in doctor's offices and hospitals.  Dad developed an attitude of thinking doctors were gods.  After Mother's death and in his later years, he became obsessed with seeing a doctor for every little ache and pain.  A perfect example was this:Got a call from my brother who lived near Dad at the time.  Dad was living in the small nursing home in his home town, where he was well cared for.  His physical condition was such that he could no longer live at home, but his mental capacities were as sharp as ever.  Anyway, brother called to tell me that Dad was on his way to the hospital.  Seems he was having some pain in his shoulder and because of his history of heart problems, he had convinced the nursing home staff that he was probably having a heart attack.  I told brother to let me know what was happening and that I could be there in a few hours if needed.  The call came a couple of hours later.  I asked brother what was wrong with Dad.  He said the doctors told him that he had a sore shoulder and sent him home.  But Dad was happy.  He got to ride in an ambulance the 25 miles to the hospital.  He got to see a couple of doctors.  And he got to flirt a bit with the nurses.  All at 90 + years of age!  I really miss that sneaky old man.Anyway, I kept my appointment.  Which resulted in two more appointments - one with a podiatrist yesterday (foot care is apparently important to diabetics) and one this morning with an eye specialist (it seems that diabetics also can have major eye problems).  Daughter set up both appointments, knowing that I probably wouldn't. Youngest Son took me to the podiatrist appointment yesterday.  My feet are ugly, but healthy.  But now I am told I need special shoes designed for diabetics.  So Youngest Son took me directly to the office of the shoe people and proceeded to make an appointment to be measured for shoes.  He was taking no chances on my backing out of that.  Couldn't do anything about it.  His truck - he kept the keys - had to go along with it.  I was too far away to walk home.So this morning I am thinking I will see the eye doctor, get a new prescription for glasses and that would be the end of it.  Been doing this since I first wore glasses at 8 years of age.  No problem.  Wouldn't have to see anyone wearing a white coat for a while.  Silly me. Cataract surgery on my left eye is scheduled for August third, followed by surgery on the right eye two weeks later.I suppose most of this is my own fault.  I haven't kept up with these things like I should have.  But I had the feeling that my life was out of control.  The one thing I really dislike - the doctor's visits and all - was happening and I didn't like it.  Until my daughter broke through my anger and told me I did have a choice.  I could have the surgery and be able to see without glasses for the first time in over 60 years, with the exception of over the counter reading glasses for close work, or I could choose not to have the surgery and be able to see less and less clearly.  She was right.  I stuffed my anger and stubbornness into my back pocket and made the appointments.But when this is all done with, I don't want to see a white coat wearing medical person for a long time.  :)"},
{"title": "Canning Cheese Sauce", "date": "Tuesday, July 14, 2015", "text": "A couple of days ago Son came home with one of those packages containing two large bags of cheese sauce.  What he thought he had was the flavored cheese for nachos.  What he got was plain cheddar cheese sauce, which he discovered with the first bite.  We can't eat up one of those bags full, so I decided to can them.  It is something I have been wanting to try and this was a good opportunity.  So early this morning I dumped the cheese into a kettle and heated it until it was hot all the way through.  Then I ladled it into half pint jars, wiped the rims with a vinegar soaked paper towel to remove any residue and oils and added the lids and rings.  It was processed for 60 minutes in a water bath canner.  All 12 jars sealed.  One day next week I will make some mac and cheese for lunch to test how it turned out.  If I like it, I may can more.As long as the kitchen was already warm, I decided I might just as well keep going, rather than heat it up a second day.  I had 10 bags of frozen peas and 9 bags of frozen corn languishing in my freezer, taking up space.  I spread the corn on dehydrator trays and set them to drying.  Corn is a vegetable that will rehydrate right back to where you can't tell it was ever dried.  And ground, it makes wonderful cornbread.I dumped the peas into a stock pot, covered them with water and set them to heating on the stove.  I didn't want to cook them - just thaw them out and heat them through.  That done I ladled them into half pint jars, covering them with the water I heated them in and got 24 of them going in the pressure canner.  I have another 18 half pints to go in the next load.Most of the companies that process frozen vegetables have not raised their sale prices.  I got these for $1 a bag.  What they have done is put 14.5 oz. in each bag rather than the 16 oz. each bag contained previously.  Sneaky buggers.So why bother to can frozen vegetables, you ask?  I'll tell you.  At present there are only two people in this household.  After a time there will be only one.  A half pint of any vegetable is enough for a meal, even with two people.  Vegetables keep longer canned in jars.  If water is at a premium, there is enough liquid in each jar to use when heating for a meal.  I have a small chest freezer.  I have no room for a larger or a second freezer and I would rather use the freezer space for meat or things other than vegetables. And yes, I know all about the scary GMO foods.  But I have no way to grow my own, much as I would prefer to obtain vegetables that way.  So I do the best I can within my budget.  And if a person is really, really hungry, I sort of doubt whether they would turn down peas or corn that wasn't grown organically from heritage seeds.  In times of famine, people have eaten worse.I don't know about the rest of you, but I think I had better keep at it and get as much done in as short a time possible.  There is a feeling in the air similar to waiting for the other shoe to drop.  The world around us seems to have lost its collective mind and I want to make sure I am as ready as I can be for whatever is waiting for us just over the next hill.  Whatever it is, it ain't gonna be good."},
{"title": "Poking My Head Out...", "date": "Sunday, July 12, 2015", "text": "giving a wave and saying \"Hi.\"  I haven't fallen off the edge of the earth.  Just a slow week.Saturday Son went back to the Farmer's Market, looking for raspberries or blueberries.  He said what he found was way over priced.  So he brought me five nice bundles of fresh parsley.  I snipped the leaves from the stems and dehydrated them, giving me three pint jars of dried parsley.  The apartment smelled really good while they were drying.  If the herb vendor still has some the next time Son goes to the Market, I think I'll have him get more.  I use parsley a lot in cooking.  And home dehydrated is so much more flavorful than store bought.Son also visited our favorite honey vendor and brought back a two-quart jar of honey to add to the food storage..  The same vendor sells pure maple syrup, so he brought home two quarts of that lovely liquid. The weather here has turned hot and humid, although not as bad as for those living in the south.  But we here in the north are summer weather wimps, so 90 degrees is miserable for us.  Son went out for a while today and said it was like walking into a sauna.  There are storm warnings out this evening, but so far they seem to be mostly to the north of us.  We are listening to the scanner for the area where the storms are going through.  They have called out their weather spotters and so far the predicted tornadoes and hail have not materialized.  Hope it stays that way.Me...I'm just hanging out in the cool of the air conditioning, coward that I am.  I've got a couple of quilt tops in the works and am doing some more digital scrapbooking on my computer, working on albums for my own pleasure.  Storms are predicted for the coming week and there is nothing I need to go out for, so here I stay.  Seems like the sensible thing to do.  Old folks tend to drop like flies in the heat and I don't plan to be among them."},
{"title": "Whew!   Done With the Strawberries", "date": "Sunday, July 5, 2015", "text": "This is kind of a record for myself so I will remember how much I can get out of the strawberries and rhubarb I buy.  Have to write it down.  Can't trust my memory.  Funny, I can remember what happened years ago, but not what I had for dinner last night.  The joys of aging.I started out with six gallons of strawberries and a gallon and a half of cut up rhubarb from four bundles bought at the Farmers Market.I used the strawberry jam recipe from the Sure Jell box. 8 cups strawberries7 cups sugar1 package Sure JellMix the berries and Sure Jell and bring to a rolling boil.  Add the sugar and bring again to boil.  Boil 1 minute.  Ladle into jars.  Wipe jar rims and top with lids and rings.  Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.I wound up with 28 half pint jars of jam from four batches plus about 2/3 of a pint that went into the fridge.Next was the strawberry-rhubarb jam.4 cups strawberries2 cups rhubarb5 cups sugarsplash of lemon juice1 box Sure JellThe process is the same as the strawberry jam.  Two batches yielded 14 half pints.On to the strawberry-rhubarb sauce.  The following is the doubled recipe.10 cups rhubarb5 cups strawberries10 cups sugar1/4 cup lemon juiceI cooked the mixture on a medium low heat until the rhubarb was soft and the sugar was completely dissolved, stirring often to prevent scorching, and then brought it to a rolling boil before taking it off the heat.  Both pints and half pints are processed in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.  Two batches of the above recipe gave me 8 pints and 16 half pints.  There was maybe a 3/4 of a cup left over after filling the jars and Son ate that over vanilla ice cream.  Said it was delicious.By that time I was wearing down.  Can't seem to work as long or as hard as I once did.  It's that age thing, I suppose.  At any rate, I still had berries left, so I bagged them up and into the freezer went nine quarts.  I think between Son and I, we probably ate close to another quart fresh and in strawberry shakes.  So now I know what I can get out of six gallons of strawberries.  This coming winter when the temperatures are falling and the snow is blowing, a little bit of summer in a jar is going to taste really good.So early yesterday morning Number 1 Son made a run to the St. Paul Farmers Market.  We talked about going to one of the markets closer to home, but we have had such good luck with produce and prices at the Market in St. Paul that he decided to stick with that one.  He wasn't disappointed.The quest was for strawberries.  He bought three flats that all together contained six gallons of berries.  The price was about what I would have paid at the grocery, but the quality was excellent.  Many times the store berries are large and pretty, but don't have much taste.  The Market berries were smaller but absolutely bursting with flavor.  Plus they were grown without the use of chemicals.Took us until the middle of the afternoon to clean the strawberries, after which I made two batches of strawberry jam.  That gave me 16 half pint jars of jam with a bit left over that I will run through later this morning when I make one more batch.Son also found a vendor who was selling rhubarb, so he bought four bundles.  I cleaned them and cut them into about half-inch pieces, so when I am finished with the strawberry jam, the plan is to make a couple batches of strawberry-rhubarb jam.  The rest of the rhubarb will be combined with berries for a strawberry-rhubarb sauce that makes a great dessert sauce or is wonderful over ice cream or cake. Son took a friend with him to the Market.  She bought two large bundles of cilantro and I am dehydrating it for her.  She does her own canning but doesn't have a dehydrator, and I am happy to help out.  While son and I were cleaning the berries he asked me if I would use herbs like the cilantro.  He said there were herb vendors there with really nice bundles of herbs for cheap.  I told him that it seemed like so many think if they store rice and beans, that's enough.  But if that's what you are living on, it would get pretty boring in a hurry without herbs and spices to cook with.  So when he goes to the Market next weekend, he will see if he can get me a variety of fresh herbs to dry.The vendor that we have bought honey from in the past is there again this year, so Son brought home two quarts of honey.  It is so good - nothing like the store bought stuff that is mostly honey flavored corn syrup.  This is the real deal.  I was getting low on honey, and because it will keep forever, I want to stock up on it.  I think we will get a quart or two each time Son goes to the market, and by the end of summer I should have a nice stash of the stuff.It is going on 1 AM, July 5th.  Sounds like the local celebrants have run out of fireworks to set off in the middle of the street outside my windows.  I can't get too upset.  It is only once a year and they are having fun!   But it is time to sleep for a while and then get an early start on the jam marathon while my kitchen is still cool.And if you put some vanilla ice cream, a bit of milk and a handful of fresh strawberries into a blender, whirl the mixture around for a bit, you get the best tasting strawberry shake ever.  I might have to save out enough berries to do that again.  :)"},

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.    He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.    He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.    He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.    He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.    He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.    He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.    He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.    He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.    He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.    He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.    He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.    He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.    He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:    For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:    For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:    For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:    For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:    For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:    For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences    For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:    For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:    For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.    He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.    He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.    He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.    He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.    He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.(Signed by 56 patriots.)"},

{"title": "I Miss America", "date": "Monday, June 29, 2015", "text": "I grew up in America.  The country where I now reside goes by the same name, but bears little resemblance to the America I knew and loved.My America was a place where a person could speak their mind.  A place where opinions could be voiced without fear of being labeled \"racist\" when those opinions did not toe the government line.  A place where folks could agree to disagree without it becoming a headline.My America was a place where God was not only worshiped but respected.  A place where prayer was allowed anywhere.  Heck, I probably would never have made it through high school had it not been for prayer.  But now it seems that any reference to God is being eradicated.  Christmas nativity scenes cause some to hyperventilate.  The ten commandments can not appear in any government building.  And churches are expected to go against the teachings of the Bible in order to be \"politically correct.\"  I am expected to bend over backwards to respect others religions or their lack of same, but I don't see much respect for mine.My America was a place where kids were taught the basics of reading, writing and math.  They were taught so that when they left high school they were either ready for college or a job, depending on what they wanted to do.  Now they leave high  school without being able to read.  They can't even figure out how to make change.  They are being dumbed down under the guise of fairness.  And if they choose college, they wind up with so much debt that chances are pretty good they will be paying for those loans for many years to come.  And most still will not be suited for real work.  My America was a place where government welfare was considered an absolute last resort.  We now have millions jumping onto that gravy train, encouraged by our leaders in Washington.  In the town where I grew up there were maybe one or two families who had the reputation of being career welfare recipients.  They were scorned by the rest of the population who believed that working for a living was honorable and right.  In my family, if money got tight we did not stand in line for a handout.  We stood in line at the employment office, looking for a second job.My America had two genders - male and female.  And yes, there were gays and lesbians among our friends and relatives.  But nobody thought anything about it, for we believed that whatever happened within the privacy of one's home was nobodys business.  Now kids are being taught that it is perfectly normal to choose from several different genders.  Bathrooms are for whatever gender they think they are.  I have to wonder what the reaction of my son would be should he discover that hormone driven teenage boys are allowed to use bathrooms or gym showers with his daughters.  Guess I don't have to wonder.  The resulting explosion will be seen for miles.My America was a place where a kid could just be a kid.  We rode our bikes all over town.  We walked to school without parental supervision.  We climbed trees.  We built forts.  We had snowball and water balloon fights.  And we were not wrapped in bubble wrap topped off with a helmet.  Yes, we had skinned knees and we got dirty playing in the mud.  But we were kids.  That's what kids are supposed to do.  Today we are raising a generation of wimps who are so afraid of anything gun shaped or of getting dirty or of getting a scratch or bump that by the time they reach adulthood, they will be afraid of their own shadows.How did we get to this point?  Were we so wrapped up in television and video games and cell phone apps that we didn't see it coming?  Or are we so self centered that we just don't care.  The part I don't understand is why so many are content to let the government dictate how they live their lives.  Maybe I have just turned into a grumpy old lady, but I resent the hell out of some joker in Washington telling me what I can say and what I can eat and how I should think.  And if I am offended, so what!  Nobody said life was fair and nobody said that feelings would not be hurt.  Get over it.  I really do miss my America."},
{"title": "Uncle Kenneth", "date": "Sunday, June 28, 2015", "text": "My last post was about my Dad's devotion to his family and in particular, his love and devotion to his ailing wife. This was not unique to Dad within his family.  His older brother, Kenneth, was cut from the same cloth.Kenneth was born to my grandparents in 1906.  He and his eight siblings were raised on the small farm his father had carved out of the northern Minnesota woods.  The house he grew up in was built by his father, first a log cabin and then a stucco-covered two story home, built around the cabin.  It is this house I remember from early childhood.  It was not fancy.  There were no carpets, but wooden planks for floors.  The house had electricity in the late 1940's, but no plumbing.  Water was hauled inside from a hand pump near the corner of the house close to the kitchen door.  The outhouse stood a little way off.   The house was heated by an huge wood burning furnace in the cellar, with a single iron grate in the downstairs floor to allow the heat to rise.  I loved that house.My grandmother was widowed in 1936.  She was 66 years old.  She would live in her farm home for another 19 years.  Thanks to her son, Kenneth. Uncle Kenneth served in the Army during WWII.  Whether he joined or was drafted, I do not know.  And I know little about his war experiences for, like so many of that generation, he didn't talk about it.  He left, knowing that his brothers, including my father, would take care of their mother and the farm in his absence.  He came home to the farm at the end of the war.My Uncle Kenneth scared me, as a small child.  I was used to my clean-shaven father who, other than his work bib overalls, was usually neatly dressed.  Uncle Kenneth was scruffy.  I think he might have shaved his beard maybe once a week.  Maybe.  He usually wore what I call \"barn clothes.\"  This was topped off by a disreputable looking slouch hat.  His voice was somewhat gruff and he had inherited the Matheny family trait of being able to say something totally outrageous with a completely straight face.  Unless you had learned to spot the twinkle of the eye, you never knew if he was joking or seriousUncle Kenneth, I believe, knew that his appearance scared a little girl of five or six years old.  He never, ever tried to force his attentions on me.  But he won my heart in other ways.Kenneth knew of my love of animals, so he would ask if I wanted to go to the barn at milking time to play with a new litter of kittens.  Knowing that this was something I could not resist, he would pick up a kerosene lantern in one hand and take my little hand in the other, and off we would go on the path to the barn.  The promised kittens were there, just waiting for a little girl to show up and give them all sorts of love and attention.  Uncle Kenneth would show me how well trained the adult cats were.  When he started hand milking the two or three cows, the cats would line up.  Every now and then he would squirt a stream of milk in their direction and one or the other of them would catch the milk in their mouths.  I was delighted.When the milking was done, we headed back to the house.  On the screened back porch was a cream separator machine.  The milk was poured into the top.  A crank was turned and the milk flowed down one spout into a bucket, the cream going into another bucket via another spout.  Uncle Kenneth would wait until a goodly amount of rich foam built up in the cream bucket, and then he would, without a word, hand me a spoon.  It was understood that I could spoon off as much foam as I wanted to eat.Uncle Kenneth made a choice as to how the rest of his life after the war would play out.  He decided to stay home and take care of his mother.  There was no question of her having to leave the home that meant so much to her.  He farmed the sandy, rocky land, raised cows and pigs and chickens on a small scale for food.  He chose a life that was by no means easy, but one that would bring peace and comfort to his mother in her old age.  He continued to do this until her death in 1955.  He was nearly 50 years old.Eventually he sold the farm.  At age 54 he married the love of his life.  He never once regretted the years spent caring for his mother.Heroes don't have to be the ones who rescue people from burning buildings.  They often don't leap tall buildings at a single bound.  They don't always come galloping in on the back of a white horse to save the day.Sometimes heroes are those who care for an ailing wife, day in and day out, without complaint.  Sometimes heroes are those who devote 19 years of their lives to caring for an aging mother.  The mindset today seems to be to stick Grandma into an assisted living facility or nursing home so that we are not inconvenienced by our loved one's illness or old age.  Never mind that Grandma would much rather be home, if at all possible.  My mother could not stay home.  She needed constant medical care.  But my Grandmother could and did stay in the home she loved, where she was comfortable and happy, even without today's modern conveniences we think we can't live without.Those two brothers are my heroes."},
{"title": "Dad Was Tough", "date": "Saturday, June 27, 2015", "text": "I have always loved this picture of Dad. He is the one sitting in the car and three of his friends are sitting on the running board. I am old enough to remember running boards. A couple of Dad's cars had them. Dad told me that he was in his mid-20's when this picture was taken, but he couldn't remember where they were or why someone took the picture. He told me the names of his friends, but none of those names meant anything to me and I have long since forgotten who they were. All I know is they are not relatives.Dad looks so tough in the picture. He wasn't. Not in the way we think of as tough. He has sort of a rebel James Dean thing going on there. Kelly and I thought that this group looked like they were auditioning for a Bonnie and Clyde type movie. Dad was tough in other ways. He was not gangster-type tough. He was kind and giving and caring. His toughness was in living. He was tough when it came to taking care of his family. He worked hard all of his life. I remember that when Mom became more seriously ill and required more medical care, he worked two and sometimes three jobs to pay the bills and keep food on the table. He was not an educated man, completing school through the eighth grade, but he was a well-read man, and knew much about many things. His lack of education meant that he worked at menial jobs, many times back-breaking jobs. He was a janitor at the First Baptist Church in Willmar, where we attended church. He also cleaned other buildings at night in Willmar, and then went to work at 6:30 every morning to his main job, climbing into boxcars loaded with grain and taking samples to be tested. He took a job feeding turkeys and cleaning the turkey barns on a farm near Willmar. He took on other part-time jobs over the years.Taking care of a spouse who is chronically ill is not an easy task. It requires an inner toughness. It means putting that person first and your own wants and needs second. Dad had that kind of toughness. He spent many hours at Mom's hospital bedside over the years when she had to be hospitalized for one problem or another related to her arthritis. He got up an hour earlier each morning to see that her needs were taken care of before leaving for work. He brushed her hair, he bathed her, he helped her use the bathroom. When she couldn't get her hands to work, he fed her. He did many things for her that most of us never dream we could do or would have to do. And he did them without ever complaining. When it finally became too much for any one person to handle and when she required constant medical attention, she went to live in the nursing home. Many people would have been grateful not to have to spend so much time on their ailing spouse, but not Dad. He spent every hour that he could at the home with Mom. They talked. They listed to music. They played Scrabble. When I would call, knowing that Dad was always with Mom in the evenings, I would ask what they were doing. He nearly always answered that they were playing Scrabble, that Mom was winning. And then he would add, \"But she cheats!\" He always maintained his sense of humor, and I think that was one of the things that helped him keep going as long as he did. I asked him once how he did it...how he could devote his entire married life to taking care of her. His answer was simple logic to him. \"I love your Mother.\"Yeah.....Dad was tough."},

Although this particular album cost me a bit more than I was planning for.  Earlier this week I started printing pages.  After seven or eight pages, my old printer decided it really didn't like the photo paper.  And although it still works with regular computer paper, it refused to run any more of the thicker photo paper through.  I fiddled with it and couldn't find the problem.  So finally I gave up and called the closest store that carries printers.  Got lucky and talked with a nice young man who sold me a printer that I didn't need a bank loan for.  He also got together the ink I needed as well as more paper and had it all ready for Son to pick up the next evening on his way home from work.Here are a few of the pages.I had so much fun working on this.  I wound up with 58 pages.  And Nicki loved the finished album.  And that is what is important.I think I will keep on scrapbooking my pictures this way.  I have lots of pictures on my computer and on a backup drive, but I like having a regular album to sit and look through now and then."},
{"title": "What If You Can't Garden - Part 3", "date": "Monday, June 15, 2015", "text": "There are circumstances where canning and dehydrating don't work for some.  There may be physical limitations or financial ones.  The initial costs of canning equipment and a dehydrator can be prohibitive.  And not everyone has access to Farmers Markets.  And there are some who just plain dislike this sort of activity.  I know if I didn't like to do the physical work involved in the processes, it would be hard for me to be as enthusiastic about it as I am.That being said, I don't think I can stress strongly enough the necessity of having some sort of backup plan for feeding our families.  We have all read the articles that talk about grocery stores having only three days worth of food in their storerooms.  They count on regular deliveries.  How long do you suppose it would take to clean out a grocery store if those deliveries were interrupted?  I know that if a winter blizzard is forecast for my area, it doesn't take any time at all to wipe out the bread and milk isles.There are tons of websites and videos out there telling us what we should store and how much of each item.  They have lots of good advice.  However, I have found that I need to pick what works for me and toss the rest.  For instance, many say that a person should store wheat.  And for many, that is good advice.  But if I store wheat, I need a way to grind it into flour.  And common sense tells me that if it is necessary for me to grind wheat to make a loaf of bread, chances are pretty good that the electricity is gone.  Which leaves me having to grind wheat with a hand crank grinder.  That is just not going to be possible for me.  So I store flour.  I tend to store the basics - flour, yeast, sugar, salt, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, etc.  I know what my family likes to eat, so I store the ingredients.  Just because people like me enjoy the process of preserving foods, doesn't mean that you need to do things that way.  There is absolutely nothing wrong building up your food storage with commercially canned and dried foods.  The \"prepper police\" aren't going to show up in your kitchen and slap your hands for not doing home canning.  There is no right way or wrong way to build up food storage.  It is all about the personal preferences of your family.  If nobody likes beans, then storing a couple of buckets of pinto beans is just silly and a waste of space and money.There are those who say they can't afford food storage.  Where is it written that you have to buy all of it at once?  Even tossing one extra can of tuna or one extra small bag of flour into your shopping cart each time you do your grocery shopping, will help.  It will add up.   It has taken me several years to reach a point where I am comfortable that my family will survive on what I have stored. And who says that you have to have tons of freeze dried food or buckets of whatever.  You don't.  If your family likes pork and beans, then buy a few extra cans when they are on sale.  If spaghetti is a favorite, just put back cans of spaghetti sauce and boxes of noodles.  You just need to keep adding to your storage so that when the time comes where you can't get food, you will have some put back for emergencies.There are those who go all crazy over foods that are not organically grown or are genetically modified.  I understand this.  I agree with much of what they say.  But the simple truth of the matter is that this granny who lives on a fixed income can not afford to buy all organic or non-GMO.  And at the end of the day, I think what really matters is that there is food to fill a growling stomach.  I seriously doubt that those people world-wide who have suffered famine would question whether the morsel of food they had to eat was organic.  If you look back into history, I think you will find that starving people ate things much worse than genetically modified corn.I guess what it boils down to is that there is no right or wrong way to build up food storage.  What is important is that we have food put back for emergency times.  There are lots of other things to consider like water and medicines, but those discussions are for another time.I was talking with someone in my neighborhood a while back.  The conversation came around to the question of what would we do if the grid went down and we no longer had electricity.  Her statement was that the government would bring food to feed her and water to drink.  I asked if she actually believed that an agent of the government would come knocking on her door with food and water for her.  She said, in all seriousness, that she believed that would happen because the government has to take care of us.  I just quietly walked away.I understand that my food storage methods are not sustainable.  There will come a time when I will run out of food.  There is nothing, given my particular circumstances, that I can do about that.  But the bright side is that we won't starve right away.  We will have a cushion of perhaps a year to see how things shake out.  That gives us time to work out the next step, while others will be busy just trying to stay alive.  Although far from ideal, that's worth something.For me, the bottom line is this.  I do not ever want to hear my grandchildren cry because they are hungry and I have nothing to give them ease their pain.  I don't know what the future holds.  But more and more I hear rumblings about bad times coming in the fall.  Maybe so...maybe not.  But whatever happens, I sure don't want to be standing in my kitchen amongst empty cupboards, waiting for someone from the government to knock on my door with food and water that I should have had enough sense to store myself.I have two dehydrators.  Neither are top of the line.  Both came from Fleet Farm where prices seem to be reasonable.  I bought the first one to replace my first dehydrator that did not have a temperature control.  The old one also had the fan in the bottom.  That didn't work out very well as some peas I was drying fell into the hole in the bottom for the fan, effectively stopping the fan blades and basically burning up the unit.  The new dehydrator has the heating and fan in the top.  Much better design.The second dehydrator came to me via Oldest Son.  He heard me complaining loud and long about my frustration in trying to dry a large number of tomatoes before they turned bad.  Dehydrating takes time.  So he hot-footed it over to Fleet Farm and presented me with a second unit.  I showed my appreciation, as mothers are want to do, by mildly cussing him out for spending his money on something for me.  He promptly told me that this second dehydrator wasn't mine - it was his.  He just chose to store it at my house.  Sneaky kid!I don't dehydrate meat, other than jerky.  I have seen articles and videos showing others drying hamburger and chicken.  But I am not brave enough to try it.  I know that fats in meat will cause the dried product to go rancid.  I guess I am too cheap frugal to risk spending money on meat only to take the chance of having to toss it.I do dry a large variety of vegetables.  Because I have no garden, some of these come from the Farmers Market.  They include sliced potatoes, diced potatoes, green peppers and cabbage.  Others come from the frozen food section of the grocery.  When on sale, I stock up and dry sweet corn, peas, peas and carrots, cauliflower, broccoli, green beans and mixed vegetables.  All dry easily, with no blanching beforehand, as they are already blanched before freezing.Sams Club has a 50 lb. sack of onions for a little over $25.  That's far less than I would pay in a regular grocery.  I either slice them on my mandolin slicer or run them through my Vidalia Chop Wizard, for diced onions.  And yes, drying onions will smell up the living space.  The only room that I can shut off from the rest of the apartment is the bedroom, so I set the onion-filled dehydrators next to the two open windows and shut the door.  It sort of works.  At least nobody in the building has complained, yet.  My local grocery often runs sales on fresh carrots, making them less expensive than at the Farmers Market.  I dry those either sliced or diced.I have experimented with dehydrating a variety of fruit, and have had success with canned pineapple, apples and chopped cranberries.  I need to try a few more kinds of fruit as that is one hole in my food storage that should be filled. I like to dry frozen hash browned potatoes.  They rehydrate in a matter of a few minutes and the taste and texture is identical to the frozen when taken from the freezer and cooked.  So why mess with dehydrating?  Two reasons.  The first is that dehydrated foods will last for years.  And second, because when most food dries, the volume is significantly reduced, making it possible to store more food in less space.Some talk about storing dehydrated vegetables in sealed Food Saver bags and then in mylar bags.  I can't afford to do all of that.  So I store my dehydrated foods in heavy duty plastic freezer bags, using double thickness on those vegetables that have sharp edges that can puncture plastic.  Then they go into cardboard banker boxes with lids.  Those fit onto the shelves of a standing shelf unit.  Moisture and light are the enemy of dehydrated foods.  I don't have a basement for storage, so the shelves for both home canned and dehydrated foods are kept in my bedroom, which seems to stay cooler than the rest of my apartment.  So far, after several years, this seems to be working well.  My bedroom will never, ever be featured in a fancy home decorating publication.  I don't care.  I'm not trying to impress anyone.  I'm trying to insure that my family and I stay alive for a while should the time come when this is all we have to eat.So now you have all this dried food.  What are you going to do with it?There is a website called \"Dehydrate 2 Store.\"  There you will find videos of how to dehydrate various foods and how to use many of them.   There are also a ton of videos on YouTube about dehydrating and using what you dry.I have found that some vegetables rehydrate better than others.  Corn will come back to its original form.  So will carrots.  Green beans - not so much.  So my canned vegetables are used for meals and my dehydrated vegetables are used mostly in soups.  I make a lot of soup using my crock pot.  I can eat off a pot of soup for a couple of days and then thicken the rest and have it over biscuits or dumplings.  If I make too much, I just freeze the leftovers for another day.I have one of those little grinders that looks like a mini food processor.  I use it to grind dried corn into coarse cornmeal.  Mixed half and half with store bought cornmeal, it makes the best cornbread or corn muffins.I use a lot of onions in cooking.  As I have no cold storage place, dried onions are the best solution for me.  Sometimes I will soak them in water to soften them up a bit and other times I will just toss a handful into whatever I'm cooking.  If I want just the onion flavor, I will run some dried onion through my little grinder until it becomes a coarse powder.  I do the same with dried sweet green peppers.  Dehydrated potato slices work well for scalloped potatoes.  When I dry them, I slice them uniformly using my mandolin slicer.  I suppose you could use a food processor for this step.  As they are sliced, I toss them into a bucket of cold water to which I have added a little lemon juice.  This keeps them from turning brown.  Then the slices are blanched for 3 minutes and spread in a single layer on the dehydrator trays.  I usually let them run overnight and most times they are crispy dry by morning.The big food storage companies sell #10 cans of freeze dried fruits and vegetables.  These are not the same as home dehydrated.  Freeze drying is a whole different process.  I have never tried the freeze dried food.  I understand that in some respects, it is superior to home dried.  But I just can't justify the cost.  So unless I find that pot of gold at the end of that rainbow, I guess I will continue on with drying my own foods.There will be one more post in this series within the next day or two."},
{"title": "What If You Can't Garden - Part 1", "date": "Sunday, June 14, 2015", "text": "There is a blog called \"Thoughts From Frank and Fern\" that I regularly read.  If you don't, you should.  They are a wealth of information on homestead related subjects as well as communications.  Fern just posted a question to her readers concerning sustainable gardening.  She wanted to know what folks would do with their gardens if they knew that a catastrophic event was just around the corner.  You can read the article here.  I'll wait.Now Fern's article got me to thinking.  There are many of us who, for a myriad of reasons, can not garden.  In my case, health issues prevent that activity.  And I live in a small apartment in the burbs, surrounded by concrete and asphalt.  The very best I can do to grow food are buckets of tomatoes on the communal deck of my building and herbs in pots on my windowsills.  That's not going to go very far to keep me alive for a year.  So I have come up with a few solutions to the problem that might give others in the same circumstances an idea or two.If you can afford to invest in a pressure canner, jars and lids, do so.  I realize that the initial cost can stretch a fixed income budget, but it is well worth it in the long run.  Also look into the price of a dehydrator.  It should have the ability to set the temperature for various foods.  There are blogs and videos out there that tout the wonders of the top of the line canners and dehydrators.  They would be nice to own, but not necessary.  I have a pressure canner that cost around $60 at Walmart and another that cost a bit more that was a gift from one of my sons.  Together they cost less than the top of the line canner, and both work just fine.  My two dehydrators are from Fleet Farm and together cost less than half of the top of the line dehydrator, even with the addition of extra trays and plastic mesh liners.   So if you don't have a garden, what do you can, you ask.  I'll tell you.I can meat - hamburger, meatballs, beef roast, beef cubes, pork roast, pork cubes, ham cubes, chicken breast chunks, chicken breast cubes, whole chicken thighs, turkey shreds (cooked, removed from the bones and cut into about one-inch pieces), broth from cooking the turkey, bacon, sausage, pepperoni.  And if I am lucky enough to have a hunter in the family who gets a deer, I can venison.  All but the venison are purchased on sale at the grocery.  I freeze enough sale meat for about two weeks of meals and can the rest.  Should I lose electricity for a length of time, I still am able to can up the meat in the freezer before it goes bad.  Home canned meat will keep for years if stored in a relatively cool, dark place.  And it tastes good.  And doesn't get freezer burn.I can vegetables.  The Farmer's Market is my favorite place to find these.  I have canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato sauce with green peppers and onions, pasta sauce, pizza sauce, cabbage, sauerkraut, Amish slaw, potato cubes, potato chunks with carrots, potato cubes with peas and carrots, and butternut squash, all from the Farmer's Market.  Except the peas.My local grocery runs an occasional sale on frozen vegetables - usually 10 for $10.  When this sale occurs, I stock up as much as possible.  Then I can the frozen vegetables.  And why would anybody in their right mind can frozen vegetables, you ask?  Because they keep longer in jars than in a freezer.  Because I can most of them in half-pint jars that are just right for one or two people, and some in pint jars for meals and other uses.  And because I can't grow them myself, but I still want jars of canned vegetables on my shelves.  And because most of the time it is cheaper to can the frozen vegetables than it is to buy individual cans at the store.  At present I have on my shelves from frozen:Sweet corn, peas, peas and carrots, mixed vegetables and green beans.  All taste just like the canned vegetables sold in stores with the exception of the green beans.  Those are just a bit softer, but that doesn't bother me although some might not like them.I can fruit in various forms.  The city stores don't seem to carry lugs of fruit for canning, but the outlying farming community stores sometimes do.  I have canned both peaches and pears from those stores.  We have a number of apple orchards in my area.  Most are tourist trap places where there are pony rides and camel rides and those inflated bouncy things for the kids and restaurants and gift shops that sell everything apple related and oh, yeah, you can pick your own apples at highly inflated prices.  I no longer go to those places.  There are a few smaller orchards that sell bushels of apples for cheap, if you don't care that each apple isn't the perfect size or the perfect color or it has a blemish on the skin.  I don't care.  I'm going to peel them and cut them up and make something from them.  As long as the quality of the apples are good inside the skin, I don't worry about appearances.  I'm kind of that way with people, too.  Anyway I make and can applesauce and apple pie filling, mostly.  If have made apple jam and may try some apple butter this fall.  I also make jam and jelly out of whatever fruit I can find.  And I get cases of cranberries from the Farmers Market that are used for cranberry juice and cranberry sauce.I think we all like homemade soup.  This can be successfully canned as well.  I make turkey vegetable, ham and bean, split pea and ham, vegetable soup and chili.  All are great when you just want a quick meal.  Just open a jar, add a pint of meat if you want, heat it up and dinner is served.  I also keep canned Great Northern beans on my shelves.  That is sort of like a convenience food because I don't need to soak the beans overnight or wait a length of time for them to cook.  They are cooked and ready to use right from the jar.  I may can a few other varieties of beans just to have on hand for quick meals.This post is already too long, so I will talk about dehydrating tomorrow.  There are many other foods that people home can, according to their own families' likes and dislikes.  What I have listed are the basics that are on my shelves.  I tend to can ingredients except for the soups and then put dishes together at the cooking stage of things.  Works better for me that way.  And this post is not intended to be a brag fest about my canning abilities.  It is all about putting an idea or two out there with the hope that someone else in my position - retired, living on a fixed income and being an apartment dweller - may find this helpful."},

{"title": "Chicken Drumsticks", "date": "Wednesday, June 10, 2015", "text": "So my grocery order was delivered today.  The store had family packs of either chicken drumsticks or thighs on sale for 99 cents per pound.  I had ordered four packages of drumsticks.  Neither Son nor I are particularly fond of chicken thighs.  The idea was to repackage the drumsticks in meal sized portions and freeze.When I took the packages out of the grocery bags I found that whoever did the shopping had given me four packages of chicken thighs.  Aarrgh!The delivery guy was long gone.  I suppose I could have called the office and complained.  But when I thought about it, I decided that I'm pretty lucky to be able to have groceries delivered at all.  And the people who do the shopping are volunteers.  They don't get paid.  And people make mistakes.  And it's not like we are going to starve if we don't have those drumsticks.  So I let it go.Now I have to decide what to do with about 20 lbs. of chicken thighs that I didn't want in the first place. I dug through my empty canning jars and set out some wide mouth quarts, washed them and stuffed them full of chicken thighs.  Some of the pieces were so big that it only took three to fill a jar.  I added water to about an inch below the rim, wiped the rim with a paper towel soaked in vinegar to get rid of any meat bits and fat, put on the lids and rings and ran them through my pressure canner for an hour and a half.And now I have eleven quarts of chicken cooling on my kitchen table.  This meat will be really good in chicken and dumplings or chicken salad or chicken pot pie or chicken and rice.  The canning process cooks it so it is falling off the bone tender.And now I am on my way to the kitchen for a bowl of ice cream.  With chocolate sauce.  And sprinkles.  Which is my reward for spending a good share of the day canning when it wasn't in the plan.  It almost always seems to work out anyway, though.  :)"},

{"title": "Tuesday Ramble", "date": "Tuesday, May 26, 2015", "text": "It is fairly quiet here in my little corner of the world.  We had some rain over the weekend and it has rained all day today.  Our local weatherman is predicting storms for the end of the week, but unless I see nasty clouds headed my way, I don't get too excited.  The weathermen here get all wild about winter storms, talking like the storm of the century is coming, and usually there isn't enough snowfall to notice.The food preservation has slowed down.  We are kind of waiting for the Farmers Markets produce, which may be later this year due to the cool spring.  Generally that produce is well worth the wait.  In the meantime there are a couple of meats that I want to get into jars and on the shelves.  I have canned meatballs successfully and am all out, so that's on the list.  And if ham ever goes on sale I would like to can some more of that as well.  Until then I am just ordering sale items that I regularly use, buying enough to put a couple of cans in the cupboard and stash the rest.  Mandarin oranges were on sale, so I ordered 10 larger cans with my grocery order to be delivered tomorrow.  I think a batch of orange muffins is now on the \"to do\" list.I've been looking at alternative cooking methods.  My kitchen stove is gas and even when there is no power, I can still light the burners.  But if for any reason the gas were shut off, I need a back-up.  Because of my location, I'm not crazy about grills or camp stoves out on the deck of my building.  I'm thinking they would attract unwanted attention.  And storing propane or camp stove gas in my apartment probably wouldn't be the smartest thing I have ever done.  But I saw several videos and articles about the little one-burner alcohol stoves and wondered if anyone has ever used one.  I know that the Heet used in vehicles and other kinds of alcohol can be used in these burners, and that might not be quite as bad to store as other fuels.So until I am back to canning, I am working on projects that have sat far too long.  I have enough of these made for a quilt.This is all hand sewing, but it is relaxing for me.  I'm in the process of sewing all the hexagon flowers together using a sage green fabric for the connecting hexagons.  I may finish this quilt this year and I may not.  But it keeps me busy and I enjoy it.  I really need a trip to the fabric store.  If you are a quilter, you know that we often have several quilts in various stages of completion and that we can never have too much fabric!I'm feeling a bit sorry for Oldest Son who worked in the rain all day.  For supper I'm heating up the delicious chicken and rice soup he made a couple of days ago, because I don't want it to go to waste, and am having grilled cheese sandwiches with it.  But thinking that just wasn't enough, I made a Peach Crisp that just came out of the oven.  I hope it tastes as good as it smells!"},

{"title": "Dehydrating Pineapple and Celery", "date": "Friday, May 22, 2015", "text": "A while back 20 ounce cans of pineapple were on sale.  I bought eight cans of tidbits and eight cans of chunks.  I had used a few cans of the tidbits, but that still left me with a number of cans taking up valuable real estate on my shelves.  So last evening I asked the tall person in the household (My, but it's nice to have a tall person in residence, especially when you have to climb to reach the top shelf!) to leave two cans of each in the cupboard and set the rest on the table.  He did.This morning I dumped the pineapple into colanders and let them drain, saving the juice.  When they stopped dripping, I spread the pieces onto my dehydrator trays, keeping the sizes separate.  I had read somewhere that if fruit is dried at too high a temperature, the outside tends to dry while the inside stays moist, so I lowered the temp from the normal 135 degrees to 115 degrees.  It will take longer to dry, but I would rather that than have pineapple that spoils because it isn't completely dry.  The bonus was two and a half quarts of lovely pineapple juice to drink.Last year Youngest Son gave me lots of celery from his garden.  I wasn't completely happy with the celery I had previously dehydrated.  It dried just fine, but was not the best when rehydrated.  I knew it wouldn't be like fresh celery, but it just didn't want to completely rehydrate unless used in soup that simmered all day.  So I cut up my gifted celery and canned it.  I wanted to be able to use the celery in casseroles and other dishes where the dehydrated wouldn't work well, and canning solved that problem.Except that now I have lots and lots of half pint jars of canned celery - more than I will use in the next several years - taking up space.  And I am really low on empty half pint jars that I use to can bacon bits and I don't want to buy any more.  So I decided to experiment a little.  I had canned some of the celery in five pint jars that I had used when I ran out of the smaller ones while canning.  So I opened them, drained the celery and spread the pieces onto my dehydrator trays.  They went into the second dehydrator at the same temp as the pineapple.This is an experiment on both fronts.  I have read about and seen videos on dehydrating pineapple, all with good results, but I had never before tried it myself.  Most people cut celery into quarter to half inch pieces, blanch it and dry it.  I've never heard of anyone drying canned celery.  I'm thinking it all may be dry tomorrow sometime.  I hope the experiments are successful, for dehydrated foods take up so much less space than the canned.  I'll let you know what happens.my phone rang.  It was Youngest Son.  He often calls me while he is sitting and waiting.  He waits for his daughters to finish dance lessons.  He waits for clients to show up for meetings.  Yesterday he was waiting in traffic.He was fussing because he wanted to be sure to get home on the other side of the city in time for his oldest daughter's induction into the National Honor Society.  I told him to be sure to take a picture.He made it in time.  Here is the picture of proud Daddy and daughter.Congratulations, Boston.  Our family is so proud of you.Especially your Grandma."},
{"title": "You Have Got to Be Kidding", "date": "Wednesday, May 20, 2015", "text": "Political correctness has crossed the line from ridiculous to \"You have got to be kidding.\"I'm pretty sure by now most of you have read about the Boy Scouts ban on squirt gun battles.  I really don't know why I was surprised.  This anti gun thing has totally run amok, from kids being sent home from school for wearing a t-shirt depicting any sort of weapon, to elementary age children being reprimanded for pointing a finger at a classmate and saying \"pow, pow, pow,\" to the now famous nibbling of a Pop Tart into what was perceived as a \"gun shape.\"  And now Boy Scouts are not allowed to have squirt gun fights.And yes, I am going to go down that \"When I was a kid\" road.Dad bought a series of squirt guns for my sister and me.  As the youngest of nine children, I'm pretty sure he remembered the fun of water connecting with a sister.  We were kept busy for hours, chasing one another, each trying to stay dry while soaking the other.  Or hiding around a corner or behind a tree, waiting for the opportunity of a sneak attack.  Or getting off a really good shot at a neighbor kid.  Who then proceeded to soak us.  And when the cheap plastic squirt guns would wear out or break, he would bring home more.  The only ban on squirt guns came from Mother who didn't allow us to use them in the house.  Oddly enough, neither of us grew up with homicidal tendencies.  Imagine that.My kids played with squirt guns.  Pretty much the same way as my sister and me.  Kept them occupied and out of my hair for hours.  And guess what.  There isn't a mass murderer in the bunch.I sometimes think that there is a plan to sissify our boys.  My boys learned to shoot at a young age.  For that matter, so did my girls.  They all took gun safety courses.  Both my boys hunt and both have provided their families with venison.  In my Dad's time, learning to hunt was a necessary skill.  It kept food on the table.  There were times when the only meat my family had was the result of hunting.  But now it seems that our children are supposed to run and hide when firearms are mentioned, seen pictured on a shirt or even pretended in little boy play.  There may very well come a time when shooting skills are the only means of obtaining meat.  These kids are going to grow up clueless.Little boys are no longer allowed to be little boys.  Little boys are loud and obnoxious and like to do battle.  It is their training ground for their responsibilities as adults to take care of and defend the family.  But now if a boy acts like a boy, he is usually drugged.  He learns that any sort of weapon is bad.  He is taught to fear rather than respect firearms.So let's say that the little boy grows up.  He has a wife, a couple of children.  And some mean and crazy person breaks into his home.  Won't happen?  Read the papers.  Watch the news.  Happens somewhere every single day.  So what's he going to do.  He has no weapon for defense.  It has been drummed into him that guns are bad.  Mean and crazy isn't about to wait while he calls 911, or wait until the police arrive.  Mean and crazy is going to, at best, hurt him and his family.  Mean and crazy doesn't care if his victims are women and children.  At worst, this husband and father won't live to regret his choices concerning the wisdom of owning a gun.So lets just keep on banning anything that smacks of defense.  Lets keep on making our younger generation vulnerable to the mean and crazies of this world.  Lets just keep on telling them that they should be tolerant and that gun free zones really work and nobody should have guns and nothing bad will ever happen to them.  Because we all know that if guns are banned, surely the criminals  won't have them either.  Worked for England, didn't it? And for God's sake, lets not allow little boys to be what they are - little boys.  Who grow up to be men.  Who believe in the responsibility of caring for home and family and country.  Who willingly defend them against all evil. That just would never do, would it?"},
{"title": "Wake Up Call", "date": "Saturday, May 16, 2015", "text": "A couple of days ago I read this post on Frank and Fern's blog. Then this morning Mary posted this.Sometimes it takes being hit with a 2x4 on top of the head to get someone's attention.  Apparently I am one of those people.My smug self has been working hard to build up my food storage.  I have been canning all the meat I could lay my hands on and dehydrating vegetables to fill in the gaps on my dried foods shelf.  And in the process, forgetting about other things that are really important.I have never given much thought to a bug out bag.  My reasoning was that I'm not going anywhere.  Even if I could physically walk a distance from my home, which is doubtful at this stage of my life and state of my health, there is little chance I could do it carrying a bag full of supplies. After reading those two posts this morning, I remembered the fire that occurred in my building.  I had found myself sitting on a bench across the street, watching the firemen working to put out the fire that gutted one of the ground floor apartments.  The biggest thing I remembered was the awful feeling I had when I realized that all I had with me were the clothes on my back and my keys in my hand.  I didn't even have on a proper pair of shoes, for I had slid my feet into a raggedy old pair of tennis shoes I used for excursions with the trash out to the dumpster.  That's about all they were good for.Afterwards I had all sorts of good intentions.  I would put the important stuff in a bag and keep it where I could just grab it and go if anything like the fire ever happened again.  That was  Almost.  Two.  Years.  Ago.  And I have yet to do it.  Shame on me.So I started on this project this morning.  Dug around in my closet and found a small duffel bag.  I will replace this with a backpack as soon as possible, for a backpack is easier for me to carry.  I also decided that, even though I rarely carry a purse, I have one with a shoulder strap.  I will use that for some things and keep it handy to grab as well, on my way out the door.  And I made a list.  With my memory that is fading, a list is necessary.Everybody has different needs, so each person has their own list of what needs to be included.  My purse needs to include a months supply of medication plus a bottle of aspirin to help with arthritis symptoms.  Paperwork, including my Social Security card and information, my photo ID and a list of phone numbers for my children.  I don't have a cell phone.  Perhaps I need to rethink the need for one.  And cash.  Sitting on that bench two years ago and realizing that I didn't have two nickles to rub together was horrifying.  Also a book of blank checks and my banking information.  There are other items, but those are basic.The bag needs to include at least one change of clothes, from the knickers on out.  And a decent pair of shoes.  For health reasons I need to wear compression socks all the time, so a pair of those need to be added.  A hooded sweatshirt for cool weather and lightweight shirts for warm days.  Wintertime necessitates the addition of a knit hat, scarf and mittens.  I remember how hungry I was after several hours of waiting to get back into my apartment after the fire was put out.  So emergency rations of things like hard candies should my blood sugar levels drop, a couple of bags of dried fruit and things like granola-type bars and snacky things that will keep for a time are needed.  Also the travel size shampoo, soap and lotion, along with a small towel and washcloth.  And some bottled water.  And something small that easily fits in a purse or backpack for my personal protection, which is on my \"need to buy now\" list.I'm not packing for an extended stay in the woods.  Heading for the hills is not practical for me, so packing like I might for a couple of nights at a motel is more what I need.  I'm sure there are other additions to my list, but for now I am going with the basics, which is more than I had done.My thanks to Frank, Fern and Mary for getting my attention.  Being prepared isn't just filling the shelves with food.  There is so much more to preparing than that, and I aim to make those corrections now."},
{"title": "Microaggression", "date": "Thursday, May 14, 2015", "text": "While browsing through the WND website as I do most days, I ran across this headline:\" 'WALK-ONLY ZONES' CALLED MICROAGGRESSION AGAINST DISABLED\"The article can be accessed here.  It says in part:\"(Campus Reform) Arizona State University students are petitioning the university to change the name of its pedestrian walkways as its current name—Walk-Only Zones—might be a “microaggression” and “offensive” to people who cannot walk.\"I've been seeing this word \"microaggression\" fairly often lately.  Unsure of it's exact meaning, I looked it up.  Wikipedia says, \"Microaggression is a form of unintended discrimination. It is depicted by the use of known social norms of behavior and/or expression that, while without conscious choice of the user, has the same effect as conscious, intended discrimination. Psychiatrist and Harvard University professor Chester M. Pierce coined the word microaggression in 1970 to describe insults and dismissals he said he had regularly witnessed non-black Americans inflict on African Americans. In 1973, MIT economist Mary Rowe extended the term to include similar aggressions directed at women; eventually, the term came to encompass the casual degradation of any socially marginalized group, such as poor people, disabled people and sexual minorities.\"It seems that I can't open my mouth to say anything these days without offending someone.  Do I care?  Not particularly.I live with fun being made at my expense all the time.  How many Senior Citizen jokes have you heard lately?  How about Fat jokes?  I hear them or read them often.  And do I get my panties in a wad over them?  Not likely.  Some I actually find funny.  Like when I told one of my daughters that my goal in life was to live long enough to be a problem to my children.  Her reply was that my work here was done.  Now, that's funny!As far as I can tell, there is not one single word in our Constitution about the right not to be offended.  We will be offended by something or someone, often on a daily basis.  I am offended when I hear the language used by the drunks in the street below my window.  But the same freedom of speech that allows me to write this blog gives them the right to talk as they wish.There is a time and place for everything.  If, for example, I am in a family restaurant with small children and someone is loudly holding forth using the same profanity as the drunks outside the bar, I might have a chat with the manager of that restaurant, requesting that he/she speak to the offending party, asking that because of the children present, they tone it down just a bit.  If this doesn't happen, I will simply take my family and leave, making it crystal clear that not only will I cease to do business with this establishment, I will tell everyone I know about the circumstances. Many years ago I was in the market for a pickup truck.  I  went to a local dealership to see what they had to offer.  The salesman asked me if I thought I could handle driving a pickup.  Did I get mad? Nope.  Did I scream at him for offending my female feelings.  Nope.  I merely told him that his commission would not come from me that day.  I added that he might do well to refrain from making assumptions, considering at that time my job was driving an 18-wheeler pulling a flatbed trailer, carrying steel and lumber to points in the lower 48 states and Canada.  And I wished him a good day on my way out the door.I had two choices.  I could let his remarks offend me and hurt my feelings or I could let them roll off me like water off a duck and get on with my life.  The first would keep me angry and annoyed and eventually give me ulcers.  The second would make me a happier person.  The look on the salesman's face when he realized his mistake was absolutely priceless and still causes me to smile when I think about it.When it comes to being offended over a \"Walk Only\" sign, I know whereof I speak.  My Mother was wheelchair bound for many years.  There was a time when I would take her shopping or to visit a friend or just for a drive in the country, if that's what she wanted to do.  Never - not even once - did I hear her complain that she was offended because others could walk and she couldn't.  Matter of fact, I can't ever remember her complaining at all, even though the pain in her joints must have been horrific due to the rheumatoid arthritis that ravaged her body.  But offended?  Never.We can't control what others say or do.  We can only control how we let it affect us. Finding things to be offended about is a choice.  So is being happy.  I choose to be as happy as possible.The weather radar screen shows solid rain for today, slowly moving north from Iowa.  No storms, but just a steady drip, drip, drip.  It is expected to last all day.  Most are glad to see it.  My sons are not.Oldest son works mostly outside, driving a forklift, loading and unloading trucks.  Last evening he came home and told me that until further notice he would be working from 6 AM to 6 PM Monday through Friday and 7 AM to 3:30 PM on Saturday, starting today.  He was really happy about the chance to get in some serious overtime.  The rain...not so much.  But last week he bought some rain gear, so he is prepared.Youngest son spent yesterday loading a large rental truck with boxes, bins and tubs full of his family's belongings.  Today the movers come to get the heavy furniture.  And tonight David's family will sleep in their new home.  Luckily the new house is only a few miles from their old house, so it isn't like they have to travel far.  But unloading the trucks in the rain will not be a joy.  The kids are excited.  I think by now Mom and Dad are too tired out and just want to get the moving part over with. Me...even though I have been told several times before that because I am not made of sugar, I won't melt in the rain, I don't think I will test the theory.  It is a good day to sew or crochet or work on Granddaughter's photo album.  Last night I took a 12 lb. turkey breast out of the freezer to thaw and will roast it later for supper.  The best part is turkey sandwiches made with the leftovers.  And I think a nap is probably in my future as well.Unless you are in a drought area, I hope your day is dry and sunny."},
{"title": "Weekend Totals", "date": "Monday, May 11, 2015", "text": "So after Son made another couple of grocery runs, here is what I have:A total of 45 lbs. of chicken breast that yielded 54 pints.  I had one jar break in the canner and another that didn't seal, using all metal lids.  The one that didn't seal will be supper tonight, in gravy over biscuits.12 lbs. of bacon ends and pieces, cut into pieces no larger than 1 inch, yielded 19 half pints of bacon bits.  The yield is less than other meats due to shrinkage when I fry it up before canning.  There might have been a little more, but it's bacon and the temptation to sample as I worked was just too great.They jury is still out on the 28 lbs. of carrots.  They are all diced and waiting to be blanched before being dehydrated.  All I know for sure is that I will have 28 lbs. of carrots that, when dry, will likely fit into a one gallon freezer bag.And now I'm going to take a nap."},

{"title": "This One Is For You, Boston", "date": "Saturday, May 9, 2015", "text": "Boston is nearly 13 years old.  Boston isn't usually wearing makeup, but this picture was taken while she was in stage makeup for one of her dance competitions last month.  It is the latest picture I have of her.Boston had a goal.  She wanted to make the National Honor Society.  So she worked to make it happen.  Yesterday it did.The letter was waiting for her when she got home from school.  She called her Dad.  He told me she was so excited that he couldn't understand a word she said.  He had to wait for her to calm down and speak a little more slowly, without the squeals of delight.  Girls who are almost teenagers squeal with delight.  A lot.  I think it is in their DNA.I called her last evening.  I wanted to congratulate her and tell her how proud her Grandma is of her and her accomplishment.Because I am.to see just how much I can accomplish in a weekend.  It is probably a good thing that much of it can be done while sitting at my kitchen table.  :)Last evening Son came home with 15 lbs. of frozen chicken breast.  The price hasn't gone up as yet, so he is going back to the store today for more.  Every day we hear of the bird flu spreading to another farm.  I have lost track of how many millions of chickens and turkeys have been destroyed.  One of the largest chicken/turkey processing plants in our state just laid off 233 workers because of it.  It is a sad state of affairs, especially for those who were working and now are not.  Common sense tells me that before too long the prices in the stores will reflect the damages.  The local news reports have even suggested that folks would do well to think about serving something other than the traditional Thanksgiving turkey dinner this year.  So I am buying as much chicken as I can now while it is still affordable.  When canned and stored under the right conditions,  it will keep for years.Our local store got rid of that awful bacon I canned and then had to toss, and replaced it with the good stuff.  Another 3 lb. package came home with Son as well.  Both of us really like the bacon bits I can and even though he won't be living with me forever, he will still benefit.  All of my kids know they can shop in Mom's pantry whenever they want, and they can leave their cash and credit cards at home.  That's what makes Moms happy - feeding their kids, even when they are all grown up.Fresh carrots are also on sale this week for 50 cents a pound, so Son grabbed 10 lbs.  Last evening I peeled them and cut them into pieces that will fit in my Vidalia Chop Wizard.  I love that little gadget.  I already wore one out and replaced it.  Lucky for me our local Target store carries them.  Tomorrow I will dice, blanch and get the carrots to drying in the dehydrators.  I really like having the dehydrated vegetables on hand.  They take up so much less space than the canned.  I prefer the canned or frozen for meals, but for soups that I simmer all day on the stove or in the crock pot, the dried can't be beat.  And kept away from light and moisture, they will keep indefinitely.  Son is getting more carrots, too, as long as they are so cheap.I finally feel like I am getting caught up from this past winter.  Before I started with the grocery delivery service, I pretty much just ate from my food storage.  And I ate well.  There are those who can't figure out why I spend so much of my time on food preservation and storage.  I am blessed to have children close by who have been happy to bring me the food I needed at other times when I couldn't get out myself.  And I have no doubt that any of my four would do whatever I asked of them.  But it is very important to me to be able to take care of myself, even with the physical limitations that seem to show up fairly regularly as I age.  And should everything come crashing down around our ears, the knowledge that my family will not go hungry is a huge comfort.  I pray we never have to test the theory, but if we do, I would rather be ready than wonder where the next meal was going to come from.  Been there.  Done that.  Don't ever want to do it again."},
{"title": "Today I'm Canning Pork", "date": "Friday, May 8, 2015", "text": "The other day I sat at my kitchen table enjoying a cup of coffee and browsing through my local grocery store sale ad for this week.  I noticed they had boneless country style pork ribs on sale for $1.99 a pound.  I don't know how it is in other parts of the country, but you can't hardly ever find any kind of meat for that price here any more.  I told Oldest Son about the sale and he said he would stop on his way home from work yesterday and get some.So late yesterday afternoon Son came in the door with just a bit under 28 lbs. of pork.  He said he cleaned out their display.  I know from past experience that when the store runs a sale on this kind of meat, it isn't the neat, evenly cut pieces that one usually gets.  Some of the pieces are large and thick while others are smaller.  It isn't as free of fat as pork loin, but the fatty bits are small and easily trimmed.  There is very little waste.After supper I browned the pieces of pork in my cast iron frying pan.  I  could have skipped this part, but I think it helps keep the meat moist and adds to the flavor.  It was too late in the evening to start canning, so the meat went into the fridge overnight. This morning I put the meat pieces into 9x13 cake pans and into the oven for 15 minutes just to warm them before packing into the jars.  I wound up with 18 quarts of pork.  I will use them like I might a pork roast.  One quart jar will yield one nice pork roast meal for one or two people with leftovers for sandwiches or soup.  I think that's well worth the time and money."},

{"title": "Once Upon a Time...", "date": "Friday, May 1, 2015", "text": "there was a relatively peaceful building with apartments above a bicycle shop.  This peace and quiet was shattered about 11:00 last evening by the sound of a smoke alarm.  There was no smoke smell and my alarms were quiet.  I headed out into the hallway to see if I could tell where the noise was coming from.  It was coming from the apartment directly across the hall, which is occupied by a single guy and his  dog.I gave the guy a little bit of time to get the alarm shut off.  I know all about our smoke alarms that will sound for the most slim of reasons.  But he doesn't shut it off.  By this time 10 minutes have past.  I knocked on his door, thinking that maybe something was wrong with him.  No answer.  His dog started barking when I switched from knocking to pounding.  Still no answer.Down the hall and around the corner I went, fashionably dressed in nightgown and robe, to see if I can rouse the caretaker couple.  No such luck.  Back to my apartment, meeting another neighbor on the way who was just as fashionably dressed as I was and who was not pleased about being awakened.  If we had chickens, she would be going to bed when they did and getting up with them.  Unlike the night owl that I am.I called the landlord, apologizing for the lateness of the hour and explained the situation.  I didn't want to call 911 if there is no reason.  He says he will call me back.Took the landlord two calls to wake up the caretakers.  The guy in the apartment where the smoke alarm was still beeping like mad, never did answer.  The dog was not happy.  Neither was the sleepy chicken lady neighbor.  20 minutes had now passed since I first heard the alarm.Turns out the guy across the hall had been doing his level best to see that the whiskey industry remained solvent.  When the caretakers finally went into his apartment, they found him passed out on his couch and his pizza that was in the oven, burned to a crisp.  The dog was glad to see the caretakers.  He is such a nice dog.  They shut off the alarm, deposited the round piece of charcoal in the kitchen sink and ran water over it to stop it from smoking, shut off the oven and fed the dog.  And we all lived happily ever after.  Except for the guy across the hall who is probably nursing a monumental hangover today.The End.read the instructions.When canning any food, I take the jars from the pressure canner and set them on a towel on my kitchen table.  There they stay overnight, giving jars and food plenty of time to cool.  In the morning I remove the metal bands and wash the jars in hot soapy water to remove any residue, label them with the contents and date, and stack them on my shelves.This morning while removing the bands from the pints of hamburger I discovered to my absolute horror that over half of the lids had not sealed.  I had used the Tattler lids on these jars.  And that's where the reading the instructions part comes in.When using Tattler lids, the metal bands that hold the lids in place need to be tightened and then backed off about a quarter inch before canning.  I did that.Often times while processing, the metal bands will loosen.  So when the jars are removed from the canner, the bands need to be tightened down immediately.  I did not do that.I forgot.Read.  The.  Instructions.  Especially if you have a memory like a sieve as mine is.I wiped down the rim of each jar that hadn't sealed with vinegar on a paper towel to remove any grease or food particles that would keep the jars from sealing.  Back into the canner they went for another go-around. I used all metal lids on the jars of bacon, and they all sealed just fine.  But then, they don't require any special handling.  Used to be that metal lids needed to be simmered in hot water to soften the rubber part that adheres itself to the rim of the jar, but that isn't even required any more.Sometimes I think my mind is just slowly turning into Jello."},

And now I'm off to clean up my messy kitchen.  I really wish I were one of those tidy people who can wash a dish as soon as it is dirtied, dry it and put it back into the cupboard.  Alas, I am not.  I have two dishwashers, but both are located on the ends of my arms, so there is no hiding away the dirty dishes.  Pray for me.  And if I don't resurface in a day or two, send in a rescue party."},
{"title": "Canning Experiment Results", "date": "Wednesday, April 29, 2015", "text": "So my 12 lbs. of hamburger yielded 10 pints of taco meat and 4 pints of Sloppy Joe meat.  That's about right.  I always figure about one pint per pound of meat.  Yesterday we tried the Sloppy Joe meat.  I will not be canning any more.  It isn't bad, but it isn't very good either, at least not for it's original intended use.  It won't go to waste.  I can use it in spaghetti sauce or something else that will hide the flavor.I know that sometimes when ingredients are added to meat for canning, the flavor doesn't always turn out as one would like.  So I was kind of afraid to try the taco meat.  But we put on our brave faces and had tacos for supper.  They were really good.  And even though I liked the results, I probably will stick with my original plan to can plain meat as ingredients rather than risking a failure.  Groceries are just too expensive these days to mess with what I know works.The grocery delivery guy brought me 18 more pounds of hamburger.  I had 6 pounds left from the previous batch and I froze that for burgers, meatloaf, etc.  This afternoon I browned the 18 pounds and tomorrow morning I will pack it into pint jars and run it through the pressure canner.Son started his new job today.  He came home smiling.  He says the people there seem like they will be good to work with and he gets to drive a big, ol' diesel forklift, moving pallets of potting soil and mulch.  And he gets weekends off, although he can get overtime if he wants it.  His previous Minnesota job worked him two weeks at a time with only two days off.  He worked holidays as well and because he worked nights, a good share of his days off were spent sleeping.  Looks like this new job is a good fit for him.  And he says that he is always happier when working a opposed to being unemployed.Anyway, on his way home from work today, Son stopped at the grocery store.  He brought me home 10 lbs. of the good bacon ends and pieces as well as 10 lbs. of Great Northern beans.  I will dice, brown and can the bacon as soon as I'm done with the hamburger and then can up at least half the beans.  I like having beans in jars on the shelf.  There are so many uses for them and it is nice because I can use them without having to soak them overnight or spend a long time cooking them.  Kind of a prepper's convenience food.Looks like I will be spending lots of time in my kitchen the next couple of days.  Not complaining, mind you.  I am so glad to be able to add to my food storage.  A person doesn't have to prepare for anything in particular.  I'm really not expecting  street full of zombies outside my building.  Although there are some days when I think maybe they have already arrived.  Lots of strangeness running around loose these days.  But if I am ready for just the normal stuff that happens, then it is good."},
{"title": "Buying Meat.....", "date": "Monday, April 27, 2015", "text": "before the prices go completely through the roof.I couldn't find any chicken in the sale ads that came out over the weekend.  But hamburger was on sale.  If you call the already outrageous prices a sale.  But still, I'm saving around $1.25 per 3# chub of meat, so I guess that's better than full price.Son went to the store and brought me back 18 pounds of hamburger, along with some taco seasoning.  I'm doing an experiment.  I like to have a variety of home canned food on my shelves, so I browned up 9 lbs. of burger, drained it and seasoned it with the taco seasoning.   It will stay in the fridge overnight and in the morning I'll can it in pint jars. Then I took another 3# of meat, browned it, drained it and added the ingredients for Sloppy Joes.  We will give both a taste test in the next week or so and decide than if I want to do more.Wednesday this week is grocery delivery day.  I have another 18 pounds of hamburger ordered, giving me a total of 24 more pounds of hamburger to can just plain.  I hate paying the high prices for meat at the store, but I know that prices are not coming down any time soon.  Even if I have to pay full price for chicken breast to can next week, should there be none on sale, I think it will still be worth it.  Minnesota, as well as some of the surrounding states, is dealing with the bird flu outbreak.  Our governor has called out a National Guard unit to help in hauling truckloads of water to the poultry farms where the birds were killed, to mix with the chemicals used to get rid of the disease.  I fully expect that the lower prices we have enjoyed for chicken and turkey will soon be a thing of the past.  Anything that I can have on my shelves at today's prices is a good thing."},
{"title": "Adventures in Groceries With Dad", "date": "Sunday, April 26, 2015", "text": "In my last post I made as silly remark about fixing myself a fried Spam sandwich which garnered me a couple of comments about that kind of food.  That got me to thinking about some of the foods I grew up with.  Mother was very conventional in her notions of what food should consist of, but Dad was another story altogether.Dad dearly loved pickled pig's feet.  Every once in a while he would buy a jar as a treat for himself.  Mom turned up her nose.  She didn't like how they looked or smelled, so Dad and I would go out on the back steps and eat pickled pig's feet straight from the jar, tossing the bones to the dog, who then wasn't allowed in the house until the effects of the pickled bones had passed through his digestive system.Dad loved the pies and cakes that Mom made.  And he could bake an apple pie to rival all others himself.  But often times when no dessert was on the table, he would tear up a slice or two of bread into his coffee cup, pour a little hot coffee over the bread and top it off with a spoonful of sugar.  He called this Poor Man's Pie.  He told me once that desserts were rare when he was growing up.  His family was rather poor, eking out a living on a small farm in northern Minnesota.  With nine children in the family, basic meals were more important than dessert.  He said his mother came up with this concoction as a means to satisfy a sweet tooth.Mother didn't go into town alone very often.  Riddled with arthritis, she was physically incapable of grocery shopping and carrying heavy bags of food from the car into the house.  Dad worked in town, so he mostly bought the family groceries on his way home after work.  Which is why an odd assortment of food in cans or jars wound up in our cupboards.  Dad liked to try new things.One of the first of these experiments that I remember was Potted Meat.  Comes in a little can - smaller than a can of tuna.  Looks kind of like bologna that has been whirled in a blender for a while.  It tastes sort of spicy.  Whether it is really meat is open for debate.  Dad loved the stuff.  He made sandwiches with it.  What he liked best was that it was cheap.  As a kid I had to try most everything he brought home that was new and different.  I found that I actually like the stuff.  It is on my food storage list as something to have on the shelf for a quick, easy sandwich.  Along with Spam. I wish I knew what brand of canned ham Dad used to buy.  It was delicious.  We went on a lot of picnics at the lake in the summertime.  Mostly with my aunt, uncle and cousins.  Our family nearly always furnished a canned ham that we sliced up to go on homemade buns, and potato salad.  Sometimes the ham was sliced and fried for breakfast and sometimes it was roasted in the oven until nicely browned, usually with a raisin sauce on top.  It was all good.  But the last canned ham I bought that I could afford was so bad the dog wouldn't even touch it.  We're talking about a dog who, given a 10 second window of opportunity, would be buried up to her tail in a sack of evil, foul smelling garbage that was sitting by the door, waiting to go out to the dumpster.    That's bad.About the only thing that Dad brought home to try that I couldn't eat was sardines.  I think sardines are one of those foods that a person either loves or hates.  Dad loved them.  I hated them.  Just couldn't stomach those oily little fish crammed into that can.  Dad said that was alright.  He would eat my share for me.Gee, but I miss Dad."},
{"title": "Change Isn't Always Good", "date": "Saturday, April 25, 2015", "text": "I love my old computer.  I have had it for nearly 7 years.  It has had a workout, for I use it for many tasks as well as entertainment.  It is a desktop model with a large monitor screen, so often in the evenings I would find something interesting to watch, get comfy in my recliner and sew or crochet and watch a video.  Or listen to music.  Or listen to an audio book.  Or listen to the police scanner.But more often than not, my trusty old computer has been showing me the blue screen of death.  Lucky for me, while recovering from health problems this past winter,  Youngest Son agreed to go buy me a new laptop.  It's not his fault.  He bought exactly what I told him to buy. The latest version of Windows is, in my opinion, the worst operating system ever.  In the vernacular of my Father, \"You have to go all the way around the barn to get to where you want to be.\"  I've sort of got it figured out now, after much trial and error and the use of many new swear words muttered under my breath. But it's not just the inconvenience of the operating system.  I had Google Chrome installed on the old computer.  I didn't have it installed on the new one. I was using Explorer.  This version of Explorer doesn't like Google's Blogger or YouTube.  While working on a post for my new genealogy blog, I needed to upload photos.  Sometimes I could, and other times not.  I get all sorts of error messages popping up when trying to post.  And worst of all, while trying to watch a YouTube video, I get sound but no picture.So I installed Chrome, which fixed some of the problems.  But I still can't watch videos, which irritated me no end as I wanted to watch my granddaughters dance via streaming video over this weekend.Guess I'll have to swallow my pride and get a computer savvy grandkid over here to sort it all out for me. On the up side, I hope to be knee deep in poultry next week.  According to the news reports, the price of chicken and turkey will be going up due to the outbreak of bird flu here in Minnesota and some of the surrounding states.  The sale ads for the local grocery stores come out over the weekend, and #1 Son says he will do a grocery run to buy up any chicken that is on sale.  And even if I have to buy it at regular price, and even if the bird flu weren't a factor, the meat will still cost more by next year.  Whatever I am able to can or freeze now will save money in the long run.I have been sorely lacking in blog posts lately.  My only excuse is that I have been spending time working on my granddaughter's scrapbook for her graduation in June.  I don't know why it is, but when working on anything that takes just a bit of artistic creativity, the mojo is either there, or it isn't.  Sometimes the digital scrapbook pages go together like a dream and other times I fight to get the look I want.  It has been a good time for indoor activity, for the last few days have been cool and wet.  No storms but just lots of drizzle.  This morning the temperature has warmed to 48 degrees and the sun is shining.  Sunshine is good.  Makes for a whole new outlook on life. And now I am off to make a fried Spam sandwich for lunch.  My Dad dearly loved a fried Spam sandwich and he passed that love along to me.  It is one of my comfort foods.  I'm sorry.  :)"},
{"title": "April in Minnesota", "date": "Tuesday, April 21, 2015", "text": "This morning Son had a job interview in a suburb north of here.  He said that it was snowing when he got there.  I looked out the window about a half hour ago at 6:30 PM and saw a few flakes in the air.  Enough, already.  In a normal year folks around here are wearing shorts and flip flops by now.  I'm seeing heavy jackets and hoodies in abundance. But I have faith that within a month or two I will probably be complaining just as loud and long about the heat and humidity.   We are never satisfied unless the temperature is in the mid-70's and the sun is shining.  I wonder which day that will happen.Oh, by the way...Son's job interview went really well.  As soon as the drug test results come back and the company checks out his references, it looks good for him to be employed at just the kind of job he has been looking for.  He is happy about it and greatly relieved.  His instincts were correct when he decided to come back home.  Always believe in your gut feeling, I think.So what with cold temperatures, snow flakes in the air and being a generally gloomy day, it seemed a good idea to bake some bread.  The fact that I had about half a loaf left in the house influenced that decision.  Three loaves, two dozen buns and a pan of cinnamon rolls are cooling on the kitchen table.  Of course some of it had to be taste tested right away.  If it isn't the law, it is at the very least the rule of this household that at least some bread must be consumed right out of the oven.  So we did.  :)"},
{"title": "Just Playing", "date": "Sunday, April 19, 2015", "text": "I went through the scrapbooking supplies I have on hand and discovered that I am sorely lacking what I need to make a conventional decorative scrapbook album for my granddaughter's graduation.  Supplies are spendy.  I'm not so sure I care to put out a bunch of cash right now for a hobby, even if it is a gift.I got to thinking that I had, at one time, a blog that consisted of family pictures featured in scrapbook pages that I made using graphics and my computer - digital scrapbooking.  I found that I still had those graphics saved on my external hard drive.  I wondered why I couldn't make the decorative pages using the graphics program I have and then either print them out myself or take them somewhere for printing.  Easy enough to do using an 8 x 8 background and printing to fit into a nice 8 x 8 album, sliding each page into protective sleeves I can get at the craft store.  And there is the advantage of being able to put the album pages on a DVD and make copies for anyone else who might like to have it.  Her mother, for instance.So I spent last evening downloading some new graphics to add to my collection.  There are some digital scrapbook designers that offer a selection of freebies for the digital scrapbook enthusiast.  They are free to use as long as they are not used commercially.  I am doing this just for family, so no problem with copyright issues.If you would care to see what these scrapbook pages look like, here is a link to my old blog.  I am amazed that it can still be accessed, as it hasn't been added to for several years.  I used it just for family pictures.momsscrapbookpages.blogspot.comMy methods and choices in graphics have, I hope, improved since then.  At any rate, today I am messing about with it all to see what I can come up with for the album.  It is a good day for it - cool and damp outside.  A good day to stay indoors and just play."},
{"title": "Lots of Chicken", "date": "Thursday, April 16, 2015", "text": "Grocery delivery guy arrived yesterday.  Usually he doesn't get to my apartment until the middle of the afternoon, but yesterday he was here before noon.  My order this week included 18 lbs. of chicken breast that was on sale.  The early delivery gave me time to can it up the same day.Sometimes I pack cut up chicken breast into the jars raw.  When I can turkey I cook it first to make it easy to get off the bones.  I decided to cook the chicken mostly to thaw it all quickly so I would have time to can it before evening.Son helped.  He put the chicken on cookie sheets and baked them in the oven until they were done through.  He passed the pieces on to me and I cut them up into bite-sized pieces and filled the jars.  Most of the time when cooked meat is canned, a liquid is needed, so I filled the jars with hot water, wiped off the rims, added the lids and ran them through my pressure canner for 75 minutes.  21 pint jars of canned chicken are waiting to be wiped off, labeled and put on the shelf.I wondered if there was any difference in price between canning on-sale chicken breast at home or buying the cans of chicken breast at Sam's Club.  I did the math this morning,  It would have cost me nearly $20 more to buy the cans than to buy the 18 lbs. of frozen chicken breast and can it myself.  I didn't figure in the cost of jars or the Tattler lids as I already had them and they had all been used at least once before this.  And they can be used again as opposed to opening a can and tossing it when empty.  I think it was worth the cost.Cub Foods also had smoked sausage on sale - the kind that is like ring bologna.  I bought 5 of the rings, cut one of them into about 1-inch pieces, packed the pieces into jars and canned them with the chicken.  They look good in the jars and I will taste test later this week to see if I like the result.  I hope so, for that could be another variety to add to my meat shelf.So until I have more to add to my food storage, it is on to another project.  My oldest granddaughter graduates from high school in June.  Each graduating grandchild gets an afghan crocheted by her grandma and a photo album full of pictures of her taken over the past 18 years.  The afghan was completed over the winter, but I haven't started on the album.  The photos will be placed on decorative scrapbook pages and put into a nice album for that purpose.  Son is off running errands and will bring me the supplies that I have run out of and need to do this.I love scrapbooking.  This is gonna be fun!"},

{"title": "Beef Stew and Biscuits", "date": "Monday, April 13, 2015", "text": "So yesterday morning Son says to me, \"I'll make you a deal.  I'll make beef stew for supper if you will make the biscuits.\"  Being a reasonably intelligent person as well as a lover of stew and biscuits, I jumped all over that deal.Middle of the afternoon he raided my canning shelves.  A couple jars of beef chunks, a jar of potatoes, carrots and peas, another of green beans and a small jar of corn and a quart of tomatoes went into the pot.  He mixed in seasonings and let it simmer.  While the biscuits baked, he thickened it for gravy.  It was wonderful!  And the leftovers will be good tomorrow, too.The kid can cook.In the interest of honesty and not wanting anyone else to experience the same failure, I have a bacon update.My method for canning bacon bits is to cut up the meat into about half inch pieces.  Then I lightly brown the meat in a pan, drain off the grease, pack the meat into jars and pressure can for 75 minutes.  And the result has been lovely bacon bits, fully cooked.  Even the fatty pieces are crispy.  Just like when you fry up bacon in a pan for breakfast.It didn't work out that way this time.  Last evening I opened the jar that hadn't sealed.  Wanted to see how it tasted.  The first piece I pulled from the jar was one of the fatty bits.  It is bacon.  There will be fatty bits, but this one was slimy.  Even with the frying before packing into the jars and even with an hour and 15 minutes in the pressure canner, the fatty bits did not crisp up.  I have 23 jars of slimy fatty bacon bits that are browned on the outside and disgustingly greasy in the middle.  It is something I would have a hard time eating without gagging.It is my own fault.  The boxes the bacon was packed in said that the product was smoked but not cured.  This was different from all the other bacon I have previously canned successfully.  I should have paid better attention and canned up a couple of test jars to see how it turned out before canning the whole works at once. Who knew.  I thought bacon was bacon, either smoked or cured.Live and learn."},

This bacon had been chopped before packaging so there wasn't the variety of sized pieces I was used to.  The pieces were a bit large for the jars, so I cut them a little smaller, browned them slightly and packed them into half pint jars.  Wound up with 23 jars.  And a quart jar full of lovely bacon grease for frying and baking.It looks like one jar didn't seal, so we will use that in scrambled eggs for breakfast one day this week.  If we like it, I will buy more.  The price is less than the previous brand, so that is a plus.I'm confident that this bacon will taste good after canning.  I mean, it's bacon.  I have yet to find bacon that didn't taste good!"},

Early yesterday afternoon my new stove and refrigerator were delivered.  I have to admire the cheerfulness of the two delivery guys, who, in spite of huffing appliances up and down the steep stairs to my apartment, were smiling and pleasant.  I remarked to one, a tall, muscular young black man, that I marveled at how he and his partner could spend their days carrying heavy refrigerators, especially on stairs like mine.  He laughed and replied that it was a job and he was glad to have it.  He said that many who don't have jobs wind up behind bars and he would much rather be working.  Besides, with all the lifting and carrying, he didn't have to go to the gym to get a work-out.The new refrigerator is larger than the old one.  The guys took my apartment door off the hinges.  They removed the doors from the refrigerator.  They took a part that was protruding off the back.  And even with all of that, they only cleared the doorway by maybe a quarter of an inch.  But the old, troublesome appliances are gone and the pretty new ones are in place.  Landlord came by about suppertime and hooked up the gas to the new stove.  I think it is a good day to test the oven with a batch of homemade bread.Son went to the store this morning and brought me back two packages of bacon ends and pieces, for a total of 6 lbs.  This afternoon I will chop the bacon into about half-inch pieces, lightly brown them and can them in half-pint jars.  The homemade bacon bits are so good on salads or in scrambled eggs or omelets.

{"title": "My Children...", "date": "Thursday, April 2, 2015", "text": "lost their Grandmother today.  She was 98 years old.I met her nearly 60 years ago when my Dad purchased a 20 acre parcel of land with an old farmhouse, from a family member.  It was located literally next door to the family farm.  In 1964 I married her oldest son.  And when we could no longer make the marriage work, she said she loved me anyway.She worked harder than most women.  She kept a big, old farm home spotless.  She raised a family of five children.  She kept a huge garden to help feed that family.  And when her husband and sons were out working in the fields, she hauled countless lunches to them so they didn't have to take the time to come to the house to eat.  She was involved with the local 4-H club and never missed a Sunday of church services.After a time she and her husband, along with those children remaining at home, moved into town.  She lived in the same house for many years after her husband's death.  And when she began taking Senior bus tours all over the country, I was glad that she was doing something for herself.She cared for her own home well into her 90's.  My youngest son once called me.  He had stopped by her home to see her, only to find she was out someplace having coffee with her friends.  \"She's gone all the time,\" he complained.  \"She is 90 years old,\" he said.  \"Good for her,\" I replied.She lived about 100 miles from me.  I saw her occasionally at family get-togethers with my children and grandchildren.  She was always interested in what I was doing and always had a hug for me.  She always told me she loved me.I will always be grateful to have had such a wonderful mother-in-law.  She was a remarkable woman, dearly loved by family and friends alike.  I will miss her.The first thunder storm of the season rolled through here last evening.  I had been listening to the police scanner when the storm reached my county.  When the Weather Bureau issued a severe storm warning, the weather spotters were called out.If you are at all interested in following storm tracks, the spotters make it kind of interesting.  Here in my county there is one central dispatcher for the weather spotters.  Each spotter has an area of the county that they cover.  They radio in to the dispatcher, sort of like a roll call, to report conditions in their area.  They tell if the lightning is in the clouds or hitting the ground.  They report on wind, rain, hail and anything else they see.  It is one thing to follow a storm on radar, but by listening to the weather spotters, it is easy to tell if anything bad is headed this way.It wasn't much of a storm this time.  Just a little wind and rain and spotty small hail.  Some, but not much, lightning hit the ground.  I didn't even have to close my windows.I have always liked to watch a storm.  As a kid, my Dad and I would stand in our front porch and watch the storm clouds roll in.  Unless the weather turned really nasty, we would stay there and watch as long as we could.  Sometimes the lightning displays were spectacular.  And the cloud formations were fascinating.  And it was even more fun to be brave and stand with Dad on the porch, as opposed to cowering in the basement with Mom and sister!I still like to watch a storm, and if one is headed my way from the west, I can probably be found out on the deck, watching the clouds."},
{"title": "Popcorn and the Smoke Alarm", "date": "Wednesday, April 1, 2015", "text": "For quite some time now I have had issues with the smoke alarms in my apartment.  The locations of the two smoke alarms make sense only to someone who actually understands the fire codes for this city.  One alarm is located on the kitchen ceiling about a foot away from my bedroom door.  The other is located on the bedroom ceiling about a foot away from that same door.  Which puts the alarms about two feet apart.My kitchen stove is across the room from the kitchen smoke alarm.  That alarm works fine.  The identical alarm in my bedroom will go off if I leave the door between kitchen and bedroom open and use any burner on my stove or open the door on the hot oven.  That alarm not only beeps loudly, but screams \"Fire, Fire!\"  Doesn't matter what the landlord does to fix this problem.  This is just the way it is.  And it is not easy to shut off.  Takes a little time to get it to stop beeping and screaming.I like popcorn.  I like popcorn for an evening snack.  I particularly like popcorn dribbled with a little bit of butter, sprinkled with Lawry's coarse ground garlic salt with parsley and then with Parmesan cheese.I haven't owned a popcorn popper for a while.  The last one I had was one of those hard plastic bowls used in the microwave.  Cat knocked it onto the floor and it broke right in the middle.Then I made my own microwave popcorn by putting about a half a cup of popcorn kernels into a brown paper lunch bag, taping the bag closed with Scotch tape and microwaving it.  Worked like a charm.  Until I ran out of lunch bags.  Do you suppose I can remember to buy more bags?  Not likely.So I have been making my popcorn in my cast iron frying pan.  Works well.  Except when I get careless about watching it and I burn the heck out of the popcorn.  Which sets off the smoke alarm because I also forgot to shut the door between kitchen and bedroom.  At 11:00 at night.  I don't think my neighbors were very happy with me.I'm thinking there will be no more popcorn in my future until I get to the store and buy a popcorn popper that is smoke alarm friendly.Sigh."},

I just love those old books.  Especially the murder mystery ones.  It is fun to sift through the clues to try to guess \"who done it.\"  I am often wrong, but it is fun just the same.  Yes, I know.  I am easily amused!"},
{"title": "Ball and Kerr Lids vs Tattler Lids", "date": "Saturday, March 21, 2015", "text": "Lately I have been experiencing lid failure in my canning - that is, jars that don't properly seal.  I seem to have more failures with the meat I can than with fruit or vegetables.  Some of this may be due to operator error.  Maybe I didn't wipe down the rim of the jar well enough or maybe I should have simmered the metal lids in hot water, even though the directions now say not to do so.  I don't know.I'm not losing any product, for I just put the unsealed jars into the freezer and use them before using the ones on my shelves.  But that's not the point.  If I wanted frozen hamburger, I would have wrapped it and froze it to begin with.  I want canned hamburger in jars on the shelf.  And this last batch left me with five jars destined for the freezer, out of 13 jars, total.  That's way too many failures.A while back I bought three boxes of the wide mouth Tattler lids and three boxes of the regular size.  Tattler lids are plastic with a rubber gasket that goes between the lid and the rim of the jar and forms the seal.  I tested these lids with fruit, vegetables and meat, all with good results.  They worked just fine.There are two reasons I didn't buy any more Tattler brand lids.  The first is the price is more than double that of the standard metal lids.  But Tattler lids can be used again and again until the rubber gasket wears out and then new gaskets can be purchased, so the price is probably justified.  The second is a perfectly silly reason.  Tattler lids don't have that satisfying popping sound when they seal like metal lids do.  You don't know if they have sealed until you test them the next day to see if the lids are firmly attached.  I didn't like that.  Silly me.I'm seriously considering investing in a large number of the Tattler lids.  I don't need to add shipping, for my local grocery store now carries them.  So I'm wondering if anyone else who cans has had similar problems with metal lids recently (since Ball and Kerr have made changes to the sealing component on their lids) or have used the Tattler lids and if so, with what results.Inquiring minds want to know.  :)"},

{"title": "Making Do", "date": "Sunday, March 8, 2015", "text": "I've been craving green salads lately.  My last grocery order included a head of lettuce and a couple of tomatoes.  I forgot about the salad dressing.I have in my recipe collection, several recipes for a dry mix to make and keep on hand to make a Ranch Salad Dressing.  But in looking over those recipes I found that I was missing several of the ingredients.  So I dug through my old recipe box that contains recipes I have had for many years.  Sure enough, I found a recipe for Ranch Dressing that I could make with just a few minor adjustments.Ranch House Dressing2 C. buttermilk  (I found buttermilk powder at the grocery store, so I keep a couple of cans on hand and make up just the amount I need.)2 C. Mayo  (I use Miracle Whip)1/4 C. chopped fresh parsley  (I use the same amount of dried.)1/2 of a large onion, chopped (I used a handful of dehydrated onion.)1-2 cloves garlic, finely chopped (I used 2 tsp. garlic powder.)Dump everything into a bowl, whisk it together and refrigerate.  This dressing doesn't taste exactly like the store-bought ranch salad dressing, but if you like ranch, you probably will like this substitute.  It will fit into a quart canning jar.As long as I'm on the subject of salad dressings, here is a recipe that I've been using for over 40 years.  The name of the recipe is FrenchDressing, but it is more like a darker, richer Russian dressing.  It is really good on a green salad.French Dressing1/2 C. vinegar1-1/2 C. ketchup2 Tbsp. lemon juice1/4 tsp. paprika1 large onion, grated2 C. vegetable oil1 C. sugar1/2 tsp. salt1 heaping tsp. celery seedWhisk to blend.  Pour into jars and refrigerate.  This dressing will separate in the fridge, so just shake it up before pouring on a salad. I've taken pork chops, covered them with slices of raw onion and poured this dressing over the chops like you would a barbeque sauce.  That's when I tried this - when I was out of barbeque sauce!  Baked in the oven until well done, they are delicious.I think one of the most important things my parents taught me was how to \"make do.\"  Growing up, we lived 10 miles from town.  If we were out of something, we couldn't just jump in the car and go to the store.  We \"made do\" with what we had.  I have found that making do with what I have often saves me money in the long run.  And as grocery prices continue to rise, I think I will be making more of the things like salad dressings rather than buying them pre-made.  Both of these dressings cost me much less to make than to buy.  Same goes for making things like cakes or brownies or cornbread or pancakes from scratch rather than buying ready-made mixes.I know there are times when buying new is necessary.  But when it comes to cooking and baking, I think the lessons I had on how to make do were a good thing."},

{"title": "Back At It", "date": "Thursday, March 5, 2015", "text": "Not much blog worthy going on here lately.  Just the normal cleaning, laundry, etc.  You know - exciting stuff!  However, yesterday was grocery delivery day and I am back to working on my food storage.I know that the way I do things is a bit unconventional.  Most of the folks whose blogs I read regularly have gardens, or raise their own meat chickens or goats or other meat animals.  But as an apartment dweller, I don't have those options.  I have the best landlord in the universe, but I'm pretty sure he would be unhappy if he found a goat or two living with me.  And there are no community gardens in my neighborhood, so I have to rely on other resources for some of my food storage.I prefer home canned foods to commercially canned.  Mostly because I was raised on home canned food and because I have, over the years, continued preserving food this way, first for my family and now for myself.  I buy frozen vegetables when they are on sale.  This week it was 32 oz. packages of green beans and mixed vegetables.  I bought 6 bags of each.  Yesterday afternoon I canned up the green beans and got 24 pints.  Later today I'll run the mixed vegetables through my pressure canner.There wasn't much for meat on sale this week, but there were apples for 99 cents a pound, which is good for my area.  I bought 12 pounds.  This morning I peeled and sliced the apples and they are cooking down for applesauce.  I prefer chunks of apple in my applesauce and by making it myself I can have it just the way I like it.  I can also control the amount of sugar by adding just enough brown sugar to taste good.  I'll water bath can the applesauce as soon as it has cooked down enough.I like to have fruit juice on hand.  But if I buy the frozen concentrate, chances are good that I won't drink a whole can before it goes bad.  Same with the half gallon jugs.  Juice is sugary so those of us with blood sugar issues need to drink it sparingly.  I get around the problem this way.  Half gallon jugs of cranberry juice and cranberry-apple juice were on sale for $1 each.  I bought 6 bottles of each flavor.  When I finish with the applesauce and vegetables, I will pour the juice into a large pot, heat it to near boiling, fill hot pint jars with the juice and water bath can it for 15 minutes.  By canning it in pint jars I can still have a glass of juice from time to time without messing up my blood sugar, as I can drink half a pint one day and the rest another.  And it is a good thing to have on hand should my blood sugar get low.  And I won't have to throw any away because it has sat in the fridge too long, as has happened before I started canning it in smaller containers.I guess I write about the way I do things so that maybe somebody else in my position will be encouraged to at least give it a try.  I hear excuses from some of my vintage for not having any food storage at all.  They say that they can't have a garden.  They tell me that they have no room to store anything.  They say they just want to buy what they need each week.  This last excuse I just don't understand.  People get sick - particularly within my age group.  I am the perfect example of that.  If I didn't have food put back and if I lived in an area that didn't have a grocery delivery service, I would have been screwed.  I am lucky to have adult children living close by, but many of my peers don't.  The point is not that a person has to do things the way I do.  The point is that no matter if you like to can your own food or whether you buy it already canned or packaged at the grocery store, there are ways to have enough food on hand for emergencies. It is all about taking care of yourself.  In the end, nobody is going to come knocking at your door to deliver food and water during a crisis.  Think Katrina and Sandy.  And then get busy."},

The turkey I got weighed in at a little over 23 pounds.  A 23 pound turkey yields 12 pints of meat and 11 quarts of turkey broth.  I need to get at least another four turkeys that size - maybe six.  I use the canned turkey more than any other canned meat, and I was completely out of it.I've still got 10 lbs of frozen peas and 10 lbs. of frozen green beans to can.  But I think that will wait until tomorrow.  I'm slowly and reluctantly learning what my limitations are and after the last of the turkey comes out of the pressure canner, I do believe a short nap might be just the thing.  Although if this winter continues as it has been so far (yesterday morning the temperature was at six degrees below zero), naps may give way to hibernation.  I think the bears are smarter than we are.  They sleep the whole winter long."},

{"title": "A Monday Ramble", "date": "Monday, November 24, 2014", "text": "Today is grocery ordering day.  Yesterday I went through the weekly store ad that came in the mail and made out my list. Celery is on sale for 99 cents a bunch.  I ordered a dozen.  I have quite a bit of celery dehydrated.  It takes a long time to rehydrate so I use it in soups that simmer all day.  The plan is to cut the celery into about half inch pieces and can them in half pint jars.  I had done that a couple of years ago and liked the convenience of adding canned celery to casseroles, stew, etc.The store brand frozen vegetables are on sale in the two pound bags.  I ordered 10 lbs. of peas and 10 lbs. of cut green beans.  I'll can those in pint jars and that will bring those two vegetables back up to the amounts I like to have on hand on my pantry shelves.Now and then mistakes are made.  Two weeks ago I ordered both dry dog food and cat food.  They brought me a fairly large bag of dog food but no cat food.  Good thing I order before I am down to two weeks worth of food for the animals, so Kizzie the cat did not run out of food.  Kizzie running out of food is not a good thing.  She whines and fusses when her bowl is down to half full.  An empty dish would make life unbearable for both her and me!  Lily, however, now has enough dry food to probably last the rest of her natural life!  Guess that is a good thing.I don't often indulge myself, but a buy 1 - get 1 free sale on ice cream was just too good to pass up.  I ordered two old fashioned vanilla and will make a batch of chocolate sauce and a batch of butterscotch topping.  Ice cream is one of my favorite things, even in the middle of winter.There were rumors of snow in our forecast, but it looks like it bypassed us again.  Not that I'm complaining, mind you.  I look at the reports of those folks in New York, opening their doors only to find a wall of snow outside, and I find I have much to be thankful for. I have given up looking for exciting things to blog about.  Exciting just doesn't happen in my world.  I got rid of the drama in my life years ago.  But I can continue to write about the everyday happenings here in my little corner of the world.  And as this is more or less a record of what is going on in my life, as well as a place to remember the \"good old days,\" that's OK."},

{"title": "Dehydrated Potato Slices", "date": "Wednesday, November 19, 2014", "text": "So I had this 10 lb. sack of potatoes from my last grocery order.  Should I eat them or preserve them to add to my food storage.  I guess you know you are one of those crazy preppers when the decision is to preserve for later use.Peeled 10 lbs. of potatoes.  Sliced them on my mandolin slicer.  Blanched the slices for 3 minutes.  Arranged the potatoes on my dehydrator trays, set the temperature for 135 degrees.  Wound up with about a gallon of dried potato slices.My favorite way to use these potatoes is for scalloped potatoes.  Ahead of time I make up packets of sauce mix:Basic Scalloped Potato Sauce Mix1/3 C. + 2 Tbsp. powdered milk2 Tbsp. flour2 Tbsp. cornstarch1 Tbsp. dried onion1/8 tsp. pepperEach recipe goes into a small zip bag and lots of them are stored in a gallon freezer bag next to the bags of potato slices.To make scalloped potatoes, dump 3 cups of dried potato slices into a crock pot.  Add one packet of sauce mix, 3 cups hot water and 3 Tbsp. butter.  Stir it a bit, set the crock pot on High and let it cook all afternoon,  stirring once in a while to make sure all of the potato slices are covered with the sauce to rehydrate evenly.  I might add a little bit more onion or some parsley flakes or maybe a little garlic or anything else that sounds good to me at the time.About a half hour before serving I sometimes add a pint of my canned ham cubes or bacon bits.  I've also tossed in a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and let it melt, stirring it in.The original recipe called for baking the scalloped potato dish in the oven.  I found that sometimes the potato slices wouldn't rehydrate fully.  So after experimenting using the crock pot, I decided I like that method of cooking scalloped potatoes much better than the oven method.  The potatoes are tender and you would never know that they were dehydrated and not fresh.And now that I've made myself hungry writing this, I'm going to go get a batch of scalloped potatoes going for supper."},
{"title": "Once When We Were Free", "date": "Saturday, November 15, 2014", "text": "“Once When We Were Free”By Jon Rappoport\"We’re so much more sensible now. We don’t live our lives as much as we arrange them and organize them. B follows A. D follows C. We take our medicine and our shots because the doctor says so. We’re careful, because accidents happen. We don’t say what’s on our minds a lot of the time, because other people might pass that on, and who knows? We might get into trouble.But once upon a time, when we were young, we were free. We didn’t take any shots and when we got sick we recovered. We were stronger than kids are now. We didn’t ask for much protection and we weren’t given much, and we survived.There was no talk about the needs of the group. When we went to school, we weren’t told about ways we could help others. That was something we learned at home. We weren’t taught about The Planet. Instead, we learned to mind our own business, and it wasn’t considered a crime.When we played games, adults weren’t hovering or coaching every move we made. We found places to play on our own, and we figured it all out. There were winners and losers. There were no plastic trophies. We played one game, then another. We lost, we won. We competed. Losing wasn’t a tragedy.There were no childhood “conditions” like ADHD or Bipolar, and we certainly didn’t take any brain drugs. The idea of a kid going to a psychiatrist would have been absurd.People were who they were. They had lives. They had personalities. They had eccentricities, and we lived with that.There was far less whispering and gossip. There were fewer cliques. Kids didn’t display their possessions like signs of their identity. A kid who did was ignored, even shunned.Kids never acted like little adults. They didn’t dress like adults. They didn’t want to be fake adults.Our parents didn’t consult us about what we wanted. We weren’t part of the decision-making process. They didn’t need us for that.We weren’t “extra-special.” We weren’t delicate.No one asked us about our feelings. If they had, we would have been confused. Feelings? What’s that? We were alive. We knew it. We didn’t need anything else.We could spot liars a mile away. We could spot phonies from across town. We knew who the really crazy adults were, and we stayed away from them.We didn’t need gadgets and machines to be happy. We only needed a place to play. If you wanted a spot to be alone, you found one, and you read a book.There was no compulsion to “share.”School wasn’t some kind of social laboratory or baby-sitting service. We were there to learn, and if we worked hard, we did. Teachers knew how to teach. The textbooks were adequate. Whether the books were new or old didn’t matter.Kids weren’t taught how to be little victims.Sex was a private issue. You were taught about that at home or not at all. You certainly didn’t learn about it in school. That would have been ridiculous.Some of us remember being young, and now, we still have that North Star. We still don’t take our shots and medicines. We still don’t take every word a doctor says as coming from God. We still know losing isn’t a crime or an occasion for tragic theater.We still know how to be alone. We still think gossip and cliques are for morons. We still feel free. We still want to live, and we do.We still resent intrusion on our freedom, and we speak up and draw the line. We still like winning and competing. We still like achieving on our own.We can spot self-styled messiahs at a hundred yards.As kids, we lived in our imaginations, and we haven’t forgotten how. It’s part of who and what we are.We aren’t bored every twelve seconds. We can find things to do.We don’t need reassurances every day. We don’t need people hovering over us. We don’t need to whine and complain to get attention. We don’t need endless amounts of “support.”We don’t need politicians who lie to us constantly, who pretend we’re stupid. We don’t need ideology shoved own our throats. Our ideology is freedom. We know what it is and what it feels like, and we know no one gives it to us. It’s ours to begin with. We can throw it away, but then that’s on us.If two candidates are running for office, and we don’t like either one, we don’t vote. We don’t need to think about that very hard. It’s obvious. Two idiots, two criminals? Forget it. Walk away.We don’t fawn, we don’t get in other people’s way. We don’t think “children are the future.” Every generation is a new generation. It always has been. We don’t need to inject some special doctrine to pump up children. We remember what being a child is. That’s enough.When we were kids, there was no exaggerated sense of loyalty. We were independent. Now, we see what can be accomplished in the name of obligation, group-cohesion, and loyalty: crimes; imperial wars; destruction of natural rights.It didn’t take a village to raise a kid when we were young, and it doesn’t take one now. That’s all propaganda. It panders to people who are afraid to be what they are, who are afraid to stand up for themselves.We don’t feel it’s our duty to cure every ill in the world. But it goes a lot further than that. We can see what that kind of indoctrination creates. It creates the perception of endless numbers of helpless victims. And once that’s firmly entrenched, then magically, the endless parade of victims appears, ready-made. When some needs have been met, others are born. The lowest form of hustlers sell those needs from here to the sky and beyond. They make no distinction between people who really can use help and those who are just on the make.We didn’t grow up that way. We don’t fall for the con now.When we were kids, the number of friends we had didn’t matter. We didn’t keep score. Nobody kept track of the count. That would have been recognized in a second as a form of insanity.As kids, we didn’t admire people simply because other people admired them. That was an unknown standard.We were alive. That was enough. We were free. That was enough.It still is.When we were young, we had incredible dreams. We imagined the dreams and imagined accomplishing them. Some of us still do. Some of us still work in that direction. We haven’t given up the ghost just because the world is mad. The world needs to learn what we know. We don’t need to learn what the world has been brainwashed into believing.\"Borrowed from:http://www.nomorefakenews.com/"},

Zip-lock bags work well for this. Label and seal. Store on the pantry shelf. This is enough for 1 package of mix.To Prepare:2 tablespoons butter1 package of Chicken Rice Mix2-1/2 cups waterIn a 2-quart saucepan combine the butter, Rice Mix and water. Bring the mixture to a boil. Place a lid on the pot. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible flame. Simmer, covered until done or for about 20.Beef Rice Mix3/4 cup rice1 tablespoon dry onion1 tablespoon dry parsley1 tablespoon powdered beef bouillonCombine the rice and all of the other ingredients in a resealable plastic container.

Simmer, covered until done or for about 20 minutes.Sometimes I'll make up a packet of rice mix to eat as a side dish and other times I'll add a jar of canned beef or turkey and a half pint of vegetables for a one-dish meal.  A couple of slices of cornbread on the side makes for a pretty good meal.I suppose that if I were content to just fill my shelves and then sit back and admire all those lovely jars of food, I wouldn't spend so much time canning.  But I eat what I store.  It makes no sense to me to have buckets full of food that I don't eat on a regular basis.  So when I see that I'm running low on a particular food, I get busy and can or dehydrate or package some more.  The goal is to have one years worth of food put back.  I'm getting close to attaining that goal."},

{"title": "Soups Using Dehydrated Vegetables", "date": "Wednesday, October 15, 2014", "text": "Another thing I like to store are dehydrated vegetables.  When I could get vegetables in quantity from the Farmer's Market, I would can some and dehydrate the rest.  Sometimes when my local grocery has a sale on frozen vegetables I will stock up and dehydrate them as well.  I have a lot of canning jars, so I store the dried vegetables in them.  Light and moisture are the enemy of dehydrated food.  The canning jars keep out moisture and they are stored in the coolest, darkest room in my apartment.  I have had some stored for over five years with no problems.I like to make soup or stew using the dehydrated vegetables.  I found a couple of recipes for dried soup mixes, so I made up a bunch of them and stored them in freezer bags.  The recipes come from \"Making and Using Dried Foods\" by Phyllis Hobson.  The directions call for simmering the soup in a kettle on the stove, but I like to toss it all into a crock pot and let it simmer all day.  Sometimes the dried food won't completely rehydrate in a short period of time and by using the crock pot, I know that they will all be tender and delicious by supper time.  I've made a couple of minor changes from the original recipe.  It calls for dried chicken cubes in the Chicken Noodle Soup Mix, but I don't dehydrate meat, except for jerky.  I know that some do, but with the price of meat going through the roof, I don't want to take a chance on wasting it should it becoming rancid.  So I use my canned meat instead.Chicken Noodle Soup Mix1 pint canned chicken1/2 cup dried noodles1/4 cup chopped dried carrots1/4 cup chopped dried celery1/4 cup dried green peas1 tablespoon chopped dried onions2 tablespoons chicken-flavored bouillon granulesCombine all ingredients and mix well.  Store in canning jar or a zip lock freezer bag.To Use:  Add contents to 2 quarts boiling water.  Boil until vegetables are tender, about 1 hour.  (Or cook in crock pot until vegetables are tender.) Stir occasionally and add water as necessary.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.Vegetable Soup Mix4 teaspoons beef-flavored bouillon granules1/2 cup dried carrot slices1/4 cup dried celery slices1/2 cup dried green beans1/4 cup dried corn1/2 cup dried green peas(or 2 cups dried mixed vegetables)1/2 cup dried tomatoes1 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon pepperCombine all ingredients and store in canning jar or a zip lock freezer bag.To Use:  Add contents to 2 quarts boiling water.  Cover and simmer for 40 minutes.  (I add a pint of my home canned beef and cook in the crock pot until the vegetables are tender.)Sometimes I'll just grab a jar of canned meat and jars of whatever dried vegetables sound good to me at the time.  I'll dump the meat into the crockpot, add a handful of this and a handful of that, some of my canned chicken broth or water with a couple of bouillon cubes, and let it all cook all day.  The only problem with this method is that I forget how much the vegetables are reduced by volume in the drying process, and how much I will wind up with when they have all rehydrated.  It's usually more than I can eat, even within a couple of days.  That's when I freeze the leftovers for a quick, easy meal later.I don't like to have all the eggs in one basket.  I want some foods that are packaged or in cans from the grocery.  And some that I home can.  Dehydrating is just another option. I know that I could save myself time and effort by just buying the #10 cans of freeze dried vegetables.  Freeze dried rehydrate quicker than the dehydrated foods and I'm sure there are other advantages to freeze dried.  But price is an important consideration for me.  I'd rather dry fresh from the Farmer's Market (or better yet, from your own garden) or on sale frozen vegetables that cost less money than ordering freeze dried.  Works for me."},

Yoders' Bacon was mentioned in a comment.  So I decided to look up Yoders' to see how much it cost.  I looked at three different websites just long enough to see that I had better can my own bacon slices.  Geez, but that stuff is spendy!Anyway, it wasn't 2 minutes later when I looked at Drudge.  Right there at the top of the page where they have their ad was an ad for.....Yoders' Bacon.I then looked at WND.  Yep.  Multiple ads for.....Yoders' Bacon.Looked at two more websites.  Amazingly, both had ads for.....Yoders' Bacon.I'm not surprised to see ads for things I have searched for online.  Happens all the time.  I am surprised at how quickly the ads appear.Big Brother's name is Google, and he IS watching."},
{"title": "Canning Bacon and Sausage", "date": "Monday, October 13, 2014", "text": "I like to have a variety of foods in storage and having a selection of canned meats appeals to me.  While thinking about what kinds of meat to can, I decided that bacon or sausage are two I would like to have on hand.There are several YouTube videos out there showing how people can strips of bacon by wrapping them in parchment paper before putting them into jars.  I have never tried this, so I can't attest to the success or failure of this method.  I buy the boxes of bacon ends and pieces.  Usually there are some nice slices included and those I package and freeze for future use.  There are usually some good sized chunks of lean bacon and some of those I will freeze for later use in canning pork and beans.   The rest I slice into about one-inch pieces and fry them until lightly browned and then drain, saving the bacon grease, and pack the bacon bits into half pint jars.  Wipe the rims of the jars well, add a lid and ring and process in a pressure canner for 75 minutes.Bacon canned this way has lots of uses.  I like eggs scrambled with bacon pieces and cheese.  They can be used as bacon bits on a green salad.  They can be sprinkled on scalloped potatoes for extra flavor.  They can be used in one of those breakfast casseroles.  The possibilities are endless.  And the bacon grease keeps nearly forever in the fridge or freezer.  I use the grease in biscuits, cornbread, for frying potatoes, etc.  I consider the bacon grease a bonus.Sausage is canned basically the same way.  I brown it like you would hamburger for sloppy joes and then drain it.  It is packed into jars and pressure canned same as the bacon.  Sausage canned this way can be used anywhere one would use sausage crumbles.  I use it the same as the bacon bits and have added it to spaghetti sauce or tomato based casseroles.  It is really handy to have for biscuits and sausage gravy.  It makes a nice change of pace and just another variety of meat to have on hand.  I have heard of some who can sausage patties by browning them, packing them into wide mouth pint jars, covering with broth and processing in the pressure canner.  I have not tried this, but I think I might experiment with it and see how I like sausage canned that way.We hear people talk all the time about storing rice and beans.  I store rice and beans, too.  But a diet of rice and beans would get old in a hurry without a variety of additions to make them more palatable especially over a long period of time.  Canning bacon and sausage is just one way to make life a bit better in a lengthy shelter in place situation."},
{"title": "Quick and Easy Home Canned Meals", "date": "Sunday, October 12, 2014", "text": "I am not a gourmet cook.  I am a plain cook.  About once a week I fix meals that are favorites from my childhood - fried chicken, chicken and dumplings, beef slow roasted with potatoes, carrots and onions all in the same pot, pork chops stuffed with sage dressing, Swiss steak (assuming I can still afford round steak).The rest of the time I cook because a body needs fuel.  I have a lot of interests aside from cooking.  I sew, quilt, crochet, scrapbook, read, etc.  If I am in the middle of sewing together the pieces of a patchwork quilt, I don't want to take the time to cook a fancy meal.  If my kitchen table is covered with scrapbooking paper, photographs, glue, scissors, paper punches, and all the other supplies I use to make scrapbook pages or mini scrapbook albums, I want to quickly satisfy my hunger and continue cutting and gluing and creating.  You will never see photos of artfully arranged meals on this blog.  That just doesn't happen in my world.What does happen in my world is the opening of a jar, the dumping of the contents into a pot, the heating on the stove and the eating, all done with as little fuss and bother as possible.  I know that I can't be the only person on the face of the earth who hasn't either the time or the inclination to spend hours cooking, so here are some of the meals in a jar that are a staple of my pantry shelves.Chicken/Turkey SoupI buy turkey or chicken on sale.  The birds are cut up into pieces to fit into my stew pots, covered with water and boiled until the meat is falling off the bone tender.  Sometimes I will roast a turkey, have a meal or two and then use the rest for making soup, boiling the carcass to make broth.  When the meat is cool enough to handle, it is removed from the bones and cut into approximately one-inch pieces.  The jars are filled 1/3 full of meat pieces, adding cut up vegetables (potatoes, carrots, peas, green beans, celery - whatever you like)  to within one inch of the top of the jar.  Pour in broth to cover the vegetables.  Remove the air bubbles, wipe the rims, add a lid and ring.  Process in a pressure canner (meat and vegetables must be pressure canned), 75 minutes for pints and 90 minutes for quarts.I think I use this soup more than any other.  When I can it, I do not add salt or any other seasonings.  Nor do I add onions.  Instead I season the soup and add dehydrated onion when I heat it.  It can be eaten just as a soup with crackers or cornbread.  It can be thickened and spooned over biscuits as a stew.  It can be heated with the addition of dumplings.  Sometimes I toss in a little rice for turkey rice soup, or a little more rice for a turkey, vegetable and rice dish.  There are lots of possibilities.These are some of the other meals in a jar that I can on a regular basis:Vegetable SoupVegetable Beef SoupSplit Pea and Ham SoupHam and Bean SoupChiliBeef Stew Mix (The browned beef cubes and cut up vegetables are canned together.  Seasonings and thickening are added when heating for a meal.  This is especially good over biscuits.)I suppose I could save time by just buying soup, stew and chili at the grocery store.  But I would rather spend a few days canning these meals and have them ready in my pantry.  I know what has gone into them and they taste so much better than commercially canned soups.  I don't know if I save much money-wise, as I have to buy the ingredients.  If I could have a garden, the savings would be far better.   But to me, it is still worth it."},

Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their views, and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and of service to your people. Always give a word or sign of salute when meeting or passing a stranger if in a lonely place. Show respect to all people, but grovel to none. When you arise in the morning, give thanks for the light, for your life and strength. Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies in yourself. Touch not the poisonous firewater that makes wise ones turn to fools and robs them of their visions. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide. When your time comes to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song, and die like a hero going home.\"- TecumsehHope your weekend is just what you want it to be."},

But.....these are not normal conditions.In the fall of the year the city street maintenance crews are busy.  Over the summer cracks have appeared in the streets.  If left unattended, water will get into these cracks, freeze, expand and we will have potholes the size of Connecticut by the time spring arrives.  I completely understand why the cracks in the streets can not go unattended.Before these cracks can be filled in, the crews use a machine to cut the asphalt and enlarge the cracks to about 3 inches across.  According to one of the crew I was chatting with yesterday, this process makes it possible to completely fill in each crack, which they couldn't do if they didn't enlarge them.The machine they use for this job is LOUD.  Think chalk dragged across a chalkboard.  Times 5.  All day.  7 AM to 6 PM.  Did I mention it was LOUD?The sound defies closed windows.  It can be clearly heard over my music.  I have no ear plugs.  Cotton and balled up Kleenex fall out of my ears.  There is no escape.Today is day number three of the work on the street in front of my building.  The only thing I know for sure is that the crews never do this kind of work in the winter.So Dear Lord, it's about that snow....."},
{"title": "Celery and Apples", "date": "Tuesday, September 23, 2014", "text": "David wanted to know if I could use some celery.  Of course I could!  He and the kids raised celery in their garden this year.  I didn't know you could raise celery in Minnesota, but obviously, you can.  They had already used all they wanted.  He said he would drop it off at my apartment for me.Now when he said he had celery from his garden, I was thinking maybe a few stalks.  I was wrong.He said that next year he will thin it out some and with more room to grow, the stalks would probably be larger.  There were some pretty big stalks even without the thinning.I have it all cleaned and cut up.  Tomorrow morning I will blanch it and fill my dehydrator trays.  I plan to dry the leaves separately.  They are really good when crumbled and used like dry parsley.This past Saturday David and Staci took the kids to an apple orchard near their home.  Apple orchards around here are more than just orchards.  There was horseback riding for the girls and a farm animal petting zoo for the younger set, along with other kid-related activities. And then they went apple pickin'.  David brought me a big bag of apples.  I can't remember what variety they are, but he said they are a good all purpose apple.I was going to make applesauce, but these are such nice, firm apples that I think I will can apple slices instead.  The next time the kids are here, we will open a jar or two so they can see how good they taste.  They have already learned how to can tomatoes and salsa and pasta sauce and chili sauce and pickles by helping their Dad.  Maybe next year they would like to learn to can apples with their Grandma."},
{"title": "An Anomaly", "date": "Monday, September 22, 2014", "text": "I guess I must be an anomaly among those of my peer group - retired widows.  There are a lot of us.  But I am finding that very few look any farther ahead than maybe the day after tomorrow, literally.I needed to add to my food storage, so this morning I rode the bus to the grocery store.  I sat near a woman of my vintage that I see often on these trips.  During the course of conversation I asked if she ever shopped at Sam's Club.  She scoffed at the very idea.  She said that she lived alone and that she had no reason to ever buy in bulk.  She told me that she went to the grocery a couple of times each week to buy what she needed for a few days.  I asked what did she do if a bad storm was in the weather forecast.  She said that she would go to the closest convenience store for bread and cereal and milk.  I hope that works out for her.While waiting for the bus for the return trip home, I chatted with another widowed lady.  We were talking about the price of groceries and how quickly groceries are becoming more expensive.  She remarked  that even flour and sugar had gone up in price.  I mentioned that both Sam's and Walmart still had good prices on 25 lb. bags of flour.  \"What on earth would I do with that much flour?\" she asked me.  \"Well, you could bake bread with it,\" I said.  She said that she would eat homemade bread if someone gave her a loaf of it, but why go to all the trouble of making it when she could just buy it at the bakery or the grocery.Both of these ladies rode the same bus as I did going home, and I caught both glancing at my handy, dandy little old lady shopping cart that was loaded with several sacks of pet food, six large bags of frozen mixed vegetables and a sack full of more canning lids.It never ceases to amaze me that those like me, who are children of parents who lived through the Depression and the food rationing of WWII, failed to learn anything from those parents about putting food by for either emergencies or the cold winter months.  Preserving every bit of food possible was a way of life in my family.  If we didn't do the work summer and fall, we would be pretty hungry long about February.Those two ladies seem like very nice ladies.  But I think I will make sure that they and those like them never find out where I live."},
{"title": "Does Anyone Remember...", "date": "Saturday, September 20, 2014", "text": "life before television when kids played outside?  I don't know why I started thinking about this lately.  Perhaps it was the other day when I watched a kid about 10 years old come close to being run over by a truck because she was watching the screen on her phone instead of the traffic. I remember when a store bought jump rope was the cause for happiness.  It was so much better than the length of clothesline I used before that.  It had wooden handles.  The rope was thicker.  It didn't get all twisted around like clothesline rope did. It was fun.There were those who could jump rope where two people swung a  long length of rope between them and another one or two jumped the rope in the middle.  I never got the hang of it.  I got tired of being tripped up by the rope, so I stuck to a single jump rope.It has been years since I saw a set of jacks.For the youngsters who don't know what jacks are, 10 small metal star shaped pieces and a small rubber ball made up a set of jacks.  The object of the game was to toss the ball in the air and scoop up jacks before the ball bounced twice, starting with one jack at a time, progressing to two at a time until all ten were picked up at once.  My hands were small.  I don't think I ever made it beyond the eight-jack mark.  But many a lazy summer afternoon was spent sitting on the sidewalk with a friend, playing jacks.Nearly every neighbor kid I knew growing up wore a skate key on a piece of string around their neck.  And what is a skate key for, you might ask.  It is for turning the clamps that attached roller skates to your shoes.  We didn't have boots with wheels set into the soles.  We didn't have roller blades.  We had these.A strap around the ankle area held the heel of the skate onto your shoes.  The clamps tightened near the toes of your shoes.  This arrangement kept the skates in place.  Until the clamps worked loose.  And then if you didn't notice it right away, the toe part would fall off to one side and down you would go.  I spent the better part of my childhood with big scabs on my knees.  I loved to roller skate.Even though we didn't have a television or a cell phone or any other electronic gadget, and even though there were always chores to do, especially on Saturdays, I think I grew up in the best of times for a child.  There was a freedom in the life of a child that my grandchildren will never see.  A kid could fly down the sidewalk on roller skates or ride a bike as fast as the wind without having to be helmeted and padded to within an inch of their lives.  A kid could leave home on a summer morning and not return until evening without anyone calling the police.  Our police were all the Moms up and down the street who watched out for us.  They were there if we needed help or a sandwich or a band aid, but they let us play and just be kids.I find it somewhat sad that the freedom to be a kid is gone."},
{"title": "Old Values Revived", "date": "Friday, September 19, 2014", "text": "While sharing ice cream and conversation with my son yesterday, he was telling me about an interesting trend in the real estate market.  He and his wife have been thinking of selling their home and buying another with more room for their family.  He said that some of the newer houses they had looked at came with a ground floor \"Mother-In-Law\" apartment, specifically designed for use by aging parents who, like many elderly, have trouble negotiating the stairs in a traditional second floor or basement apartment.We hear quite often about the trend of adult children moving in with their parents during a financial crisis such as job loss or the inability of college graduates to secure employment in their chosen field.  But I have to admit I had not thought about  the reverse situation - of aging parents living with their adult children.  I had forgotten about occurrences within my own family.Years ago it was unthinkable for a family to shuttle Mom or Dad off to a home for the aged.  My Great-Grandfather, after the death of his wife, spent half the year with my Grandfather's family and the other half with his daughter's family.  One of my Dad's brothers stayed on the farm and cared for his widowed mother until her death.  He was over 50 years old before he married and left the farm.  He did this by choice, out of love for his mother and a sense of family duty. My other Grandmother lived for a time in an apartment in my parent's home.  I remember how I loved to be able to see her whenever I wanted and to be able to bring my young children to to spend time with her.  My brother, who was a young boy at the time, recalls hours spent with our Grandmother, many of them over games of checkers.  Some of his best memories are of time with Grandma.I understand the need for nursing homes.  Both of my parents lived in a nursing home in their last years due to medical issues that could not be taken care of in a home environment.  But for those older folks who are still able to care for themselves, this ground floor apartment trend is a good one, I think.  It offers privacy for both generations.  And it offers access to family and the opportunity to spend precious time with grandchildren - something that is becoming a rare thing in our too busy world.  It is reminiscent of the old values, where family cared for family and that is a good thing.  And I am all for reviving some of the old values and traditions.That being said, do not panic, my children.  I have no intention of moving in with any of you - yet."},

What Jessie Jane did not have then was the attention she craved.  Nor was she around people other than her owner.  She lived in her kennel and had puppies.  And when she was too old to breed any more, I received a call asking me to please give her a home.  She was the third Yorkie that this same kennel owner had entrusted to my care.She was shy.  She scared easily.  She didn't trust people because she had never seen more than one in her entire life.  So we went to work.We sat on the stoop outside my building so she could become accustomed to the sights and sounds of her new neighborhood.  Then we went for walks.  Short ones at first and then longer ones, to the park and along the river.  It didn't take long before she was greeting everyone she met.  She considered everyone her friend.We sat on the couch and snuggled.  She helped me in the kitchen, making sure that no piece of food dropped ever stayed on the floor for more than three seconds.  She discovered treats and developed a bouncing up and down, turning in circles dance to get one.  And she smiled.  She looked like a demented chipmunk when she smiled, but she smiled.She grumbled when I would not share my spaghetti with her.  If I made the mistake of setting a bag of kitchen trash next to my apartment door while I went to put on my shoes, it was a given that I would find her buried up to her back legs in the bag when I returned, her little stump of a tail wagging madly as she joyously explored the contents.  She was smart and naughty and willful and funny.  She made me laugh.  She was affectionate, pestering me until I picked her up and gave her some pets and belly rubs.

{"title": "Canning Butter", "date": "Wednesday, September 3, 2014", "text": "Let me say right off the bat that I am not telling anyone they should home can butter.  I'm just telling you what I do.  Use your own judgement.I have been putting off the home canning of butter.  Some time back I made the mistake of following the instructions of someone on YouTube who didn't know what they were talking about.  The experiment was a disaster.  I was a bit reluctant to try again, especially with the price of butter these days.Then I remembered that Jackie Clay, who writes a column for Backwoods Home Magazine, had posted about how she cans butter.  I trust her judgement as she has been doing this for many years.  She has a question and answer part to her column, and if someone asks about a canning method or recipe that is questionable, Jackie will tell that person if it is safe or not to home can, and why.Here is the method that Jackie uses to can her butter, in her words:\"To can butter, melt it in a saucepan over low heat. Heat it enough to simmer out any remaining buttermilk. Sterilize your wide mouth half pint jars in boiling water, holding them in simmering water until just before you will fill them so they are sterile and very hot. Simmer your butter for 10 minutes, very gently, to drive off any remaining moisture. Stir often to prevent solids from scorching. Remove jars from heat and invert to drain thoroughly. Then turn them over and carefully ladle the hot butter into the jars, leaving 1/2 inch of headspace. Wipe the rim of the jar, place a hot, previously-simmered lid on the jar and screw the ring down firmly tight. Process the jars in a boiling water bath canner for 60 minutes.You can keep the moisture from settling to the bottom of the jars by waiting until the jars have cooled some after processing, then shaking them gently to redistribute the moisture. Repeat this every 5 minutes or so as the jars cool completely. Carefully check your seals as the shaking could cause a seal to fail. Refrigerate any jar that doesn’t seal and use soon or reprocess the butter from the melting, onward, all over again with a new lid.  -Jackie\"I followed her instructions to the letter.  I started with 6 lbs. of butter that yielded 14 half-pint jars.  The butter tends to separate in the jars, but the gentle shaking of the jars while cooling fixed that problem.This butter will not be exactly like the butter was before canning.  It will be a little bit grainy the way butter is when it melts and hardens again.  But there is no difference in taste and it melts on toast or vegetables beautifully.  Some may not like the texture, but it doesn't bother me at all.  I would not hesitate to use this butter on a slice of bread, or anywhere else that calls for butter.I have another 6 lbs of butter in the fridge to can and then I may have to make a run to Sam's Club.  Butter at Sams is $2.75 a pound.  Butter at the grocery is getting close to $4.00 a pound.Yep.  I'll be canning a lot more of this."},

{"title": "My Son...", "date": "Saturday, August 30, 2014", "text": "left his home in Minnesota this morning.  He checked in via Facebook from the other side of Omaha this afternoon.  I pray that he has a safe trip and finds what he is looking for at his destination in Phoenix.Even though I want happiness and contentment and all good things for him, my heart hurts a little.I hear that excuse for not preparing often.  Usually from folks who have large homes.  I'm here to tell you that you do have room and here's why.I live in a 1-bedroom apartment that measures a little over 500 square feet - about half the size of your average 3-bedroom rambler. There have to be a lot of people like me living in similar conditions.  Now if you are one of those people who has to have the perfectly decorated living space then read no further.  This is not for you.  But if you are more interested in staying alive when things get really bad - and I have no doubt they will - then read on.My living room couch is pulled out about 8 or 9 inches from the wall.  Behind it are 2-liter soda bottles full of water.  I will be laying a board or heavy cardboard across the tops of those bottles in order to stack another row on top.  You can't tell that there is anything behind the couch.  Water bottles also live in a corner behind my TV stand.  More reside on a closet shelf.  Water is important.  You can live a while without food, but lack of water will kill you fairly quickly.  When you have no room for the large water barrels, find another solution.  This is mine.My bedroom holds two heavy duty shelving units, each four feet long and seven feet high.  These hold all of my home canned food.  There is another smaller shelving unit that fits behind my bedroom door that holds all of my dehydrated food plus extra canning jar rings.  My bedroom stays fairly dark and cool.  This is important for the food stored there.  Light and heat are the enemy of home canned foods.  Light and moisture are not friends to dehydrated food.  My bedroom will never make the pages of House Beautiful.  I don't care.  I will be able to eat tomorrow.I have two closets in my bedroom.  One is small but deep and that holds clothes and odds and ends in plastic tubs.  I got rid of the junk.  I don't need stuff.  I need space.  The other closet is a standard double door sized closet.  The top shelf holds more water bottles.  Because this is a rental unit, filling it with built-in shelves was not an option, so I bought several small, free standing, stackable shelves and set them against the back closet wall.  There is space on one side of the shelves for buckets of sugar and flour.  The shelves hold things like baking powder, peanut butter, powdered milk, etc.  Even though it is not really handy, there is room in front of the shelves to stack boxes containing rice, beans, pasta, etc., so I bought cardboard banker's boxes and they work well.  Yes, I have to move them to get to the shelves.  I can live with that.The one storage area that I can not use at present is under my bed.  My spring and mattress sit on a wooden box frame so I can't access that space under the bed without lifting up the spring and mattress.  Next year I will be ready to replace the bed.  At that time I plan to use the space underneath for storing toilet paper, pet food, kitty litter, etc.  Cases of store bought canned goods will also slide easily into that space.If a person does home canning, there are always empty canning jars to deal with.  I use my canned food almost daily and that rotates out the older food which is replaced with newer.  But what to do with the jars.  My cupboard space is extremely limited.  What is here holds dishes, pots and pans and the items I regularly use for baking and cooking  I bought three free standing units that are about six feet tall and 18 inches wide.  Each has two small cupboards with doors and three shelves.  These units hold everything from my cookbooks, spices, packages of jello, etc.  I make a lot of my own seasoning like taco and chili seasoning mixes, and those are in jars on the shelves along with other mixes like for scalloped potatoes or gravy.  Canisters for brown sugar, powdered sugar, coffee and flour are in those cupboards, handy when I need them.  When I run out of something, I just go to my closet pantry and grab whatever I need to replace it.  No running to the store.Back to the canning jars.  The only solution I have found is to neatly stack the jars in their original boxes.  I have space beside the free standing shelves in the kitchen and the jars are stacked there.  It may not be aesthetically pleasing, but they are neatly stacked according to size and they are clean.  I need the jars for my survival more than I need a picture perfect kitchen.There are lots of ideas for small space storage on the internet.  This is just some of what works for me in my situation.  I like to have things pretty, but I am way less concerned about house beautiful than I am about staying alive when disaster strikes.  There are those who think the stores will always be there, full of food.  We all saw a while back what happened when there was a glitch in the welfare system and EBT cards didn't work for a few hours.  How long do you suppose it would take, should those cards be cancelled altogether, for the riots to start and grocery shelves to be cleared.  If we don't remember the Katrina debacle, we should.  The pictures of people looking in dumpsters for food after Hurricane Sandy are still fresh in my mind.  So are the interviews of irate citizens complaining that the government wasn't there to take care of them.I'll be damned if I will be one of those people.  As long as I am able to care for myself, I will.  I will endure the glazed look that appears on faces when I mention food storage.  I will put up with those who ridicule my efforts, believing that nothing will ever change.  But in the end, I will survive.  And attain my goal.  Which is to live long enough to be a problem to my children.I think I am close to achieving that goal!"},

Somewhere around 2 AM I shut the computer off and settled down in my recliner.  Sometimes I sleep better there than in bed.  I was just starting to doze when I heard a sound that resembled a thud.  I remember thinking that some damn fool drunk had run his car into the corner of the building beneath my open window.  My nine pound early warning system, Lily the Yorkie, was peacefully snoozing in her kennel.  I knew there was nothing in the hallway to worry about or she would have been loudly protecting her food dish.  She can go from a sound asleep to standing stiff-legged barking like mad in about three seconds if anyone lingers outside my apartment door.  I listened for a minute or two for any other sounds, heard nothing, and then fell asleep.About 6 AM Lily wakes me.  She is loudly guarding her food.  Between barks I catch the sound of a sharp rapping on my door.  I ask who is there and a voice identifies himself as a police officer.  A look through the peephole confirms this.  His face is familiar to me so I ask him in.  He says they noticed my open window and wondered if I had heard any noises during the night.  I describe what I heard.  He wants to know if I heard anything that sounded like breaking glass and I reply that I did not.  He is particularly interested in the time of night I heard the sound.  He then explains to me that during the night someone broke into the bicycle shop beneath my apartment and stole a particularly expensive bike from the show window.  He apologizes for waking me at such an early hour,  asks me to call if I remember anything else, apologizes again and leaves.This is the second time this summer that something has occurred here that involved the police.  Earlier my neighbor's grandson had broken into the bar behind my building, had cut himself up in the process and had then raised all sorts of hell trying to get his drugged up self to his grandmother's apartment to hide.  And now this.  Even with a bar next door and another behind the building, it is a fairly quiet neighborhood.  There is the usual Saturday night whooping and hollering from the younger set who, after a few beers, don't seem to have the sense that God gave a goose.  There is an occasional fight but even those are few and far between.My slightly paranoid, tin foil hat wearing self has to wonder if this might not be a sign of things to come."},

{"title": "The Ugly Quilt", "date": "Thursday, August 21, 2014", "text": "While digging about in my closet I found, back in a corner, a box full of fabric fat quarters.  For the non-sewing folks, a fat quarter is a 1/4 yard piece of fabric that measures about 18 \" x 21 \",  and is usually sold for crafty projects or for quilt projects where a small amount of one color fabric is needed.At any rate, here was this box of fat quarters.  I suppose that I had a reason for collecting so many of them over the years, but whatever that reason was, it now escapes me.  Lots of things escape me these days.Being a frugal person (read \"cheap\") I can't just throw them out.  I have been sewing since age 12, and as someone who sews, throwing out good fabric, even if it is just scraps, is just wrong.  After digging a bit further into the depths of the closet, I came up with a bag of quilt batting.  And there was my \"Aha\" moment.  Rag Quilt.To make a rag quilt, fabric is cut into squares.  Squares of quilt batting are sandwiched between two layers of fabric.  An X is sewn, corners to corners, securing the batting within the fabric squares.  The sandwich squares are sewn together with the seams to the outside of the quilt top.  When completed, the seams are clipped with a scissor at about 1/4 inch intervals, creating a sort of fringe.  When the finished quilt is washed and then dried in a dryer, the seams fluff up and look sort of raggedy.  Thus the name Rag Quilt.Took me two days to cut the pieces, sew the X on each square and sew the squares together.  Clipping the seams took another evening.  I wasn't going for pretty.  The placement of the fabric squares was completely random.  I was going for quick and easy, for using up otherwise useless fabric, and especially going for warm.  Nothing like a hand made quilt to snuggle up with when the snow falls and the wind howls. Yes, I know.  It would be much more fun to have a honey to snuggle with, but that's not likely to happen here, so I will settle for a quilt.  Even an ugly one.I haven't run it through the washer and dryer as yet, but you get the idea.A few years ago I made six of these - one for each grandkid - for Christmas.  Those were both pretty and warm.  I'm thinking that maybe I should make a couple more of them from flannel.  But until then, I sort of like my Ugly Quilt.  It is kind of like falling in love with the runt of the litter.  The little ugly ones need to be loved, too."},
{"title": "Feminist Demands", "date": "Wednesday, August 20, 2014", "text": "I was scanning the headlines on one of the alternative news sources I read when I came across this one:Feminist Demands Free Tampons for AllThe article with a link to the original column can be found Here.And all I could think of was that we have finally reached the ultimate in expectations of government taking care of us from cradle to grave.  The argument was that women need these products for several days each month over the course of approximately 30 - 40 years.  Many poverty level women can't afford to buy tampons.  Some are selling their food stamps in order to get the money to purchase these items.  So naturally it follows that the government needs to supply women with tampons because they are a necessity.And with that, I shut off my computer and went for a long walk down by the river.  It was either that or sit there and wait for my head to explode.As I walked I thought about this new bit of stupidity.  I wonder what this columnist thinks women through the ages have done about dealing with this natural female cycle.  I mean long before the invention of feminine hygiene products.  Nowhere else have I seen that any woman ever in recorded history expected someone else to provide for these needs.  I expect that if anyone believes that taxpayers should pay for tampons, there is a whole list of other necessities those same people will believe should be free to them.  Perhaps each person should be given a lifetime supply of toilet paper.  Or food.  Everyone needs food to survive.  Oh, wait.  Government already has food covered for millions.  How about coffee.  I consider coffee a necessity, so shouldn't it be free?  Or as one of the people who left comments about this article said, \"I'll take my free beer now.\"Oh how my sweet little Grandmother would have scoffed at the notion of the government providing anything.  She and her daughters used clean strips of cloth that they washed and reused each month, as did most women of her era.  Her outhouse held the previous years Sears & Roebuck catalog.  If she wanted coffee, she sold eggs from the chickens she kept and butter she made from the cream that came from the few cows they milked, and she bought coffee.  She and her sons raised a couple of pigs each year and a steer for meat.  She butchered some of her chickens every fall and hatched out more each spring.  She raised vegetables in her garden.  The surrounding woods provided blueberries and wild raspberries and strawberries. The government should provide tampons?  I don't think so.  And those who do could stand to learn a thing or two about taking care of your own self from Grandma."},

David said he didn't know what to do with the sunflower seeds, should they wind up with many.  I suggested putting a bird feeder on the railing of their deck outside of the sliding glass door in their dining area.  He said he didn't want bird poop all over his deck.  I said he could power wash the deck in the spring.  It would be worth a little bird poop for all of the enjoyment the kids would get, especially Jacob who loves watching the birds.  He said he would put up a bird feeder.  You know you have lost the argument when it is three kids and Grandma you are up against.I think I might have to look for a copy of \"Birds of North America.\"  The kids will probably just run an Internet search to identify the different birds, but I always liked the book reference.  Who knows.  Maybe they will, too."},

One recipe will fit into a quart jar.  That works better for me storage-wise than does 3 gallons of liquid, and it works just as well.I need a better way to wring water out of the clothes.  I'm thinking that one of those yellow janitorial mob buckets with the attached piece that is used to wring water out of a mop might work.  I could probably use the bucket for washing and rinsing and the attachment for wringing.Now all I need is one of those wooden drying racks - the ones with a framework on each side with dowels running across.  I think I know where I can get both the bucket and the rack.  Seems to me it is worth a try, especially when stairs are my enemy.I love it when an experiment actually works."},

Last evening was relatively quiet for a 4th of July.  The main fireworks display at Valley Fair is a few miles away, and I could see some of it from my window, but had none of the crowds and traffic.  In fact, the town pretty much emptied out about dusk.Except next to my building.I had just curled up on the couch to read for a while, about 10 PM, when a series of small explosions got my attention.  The explosions were followed by laughter.  And more explosions.  And more laughter.  Of course I had to mutter the obligatory \"Darned kids!\"  Sounded like the noise was coming from the alley between my building and the one next door.  Finally I got up to take a look.Here in the middle of the alley were two boys about 15 years of age.  They had a bag of fireworks and were setting them off, one by one.  Some had a little bit of sparkly effect and others just went \"Boom.\"  The sound bounced off the walls of the buildings making sort of an echo.  They would set off something from their bag, and then laugh with delight.  Repeat.  Repeat.  They were having so much fun with their little fireworks stash that I couldn't get mad at them.  I watched them for a little while, smiling at their antics.  I figure there are a lot worse things 15 year old boys could be doing on a pleasant summer evening.  After about a half hour their supply ran out and off they went.I'm going to have to kick the canning into high gear.  I think I have more empty jars than full ones and I am running out of places to stack them.  I need more hamburger and turkey for sure.  And a couple of cases of Amish Coleslaw.  The recipe comes from Jackie Clay, and it is delicious.  I either drain it and mix with mayo for a regular coleslaw, or I use it as a relish.  Love the stuff.  Here's the recipe:1 - 1/2 cups vinegar2 cups sugar1/2 tsp. celery seed1/2 tsp. mustard seed2 tsp. salt1 large head cabbage1 cup diced celery1/2 cup diced onions2 cups shredded carrotsMix vinegar, sugar, and seasonings. Mix with vegetables. Stir very well. Pack into sterile jars and process in a water bath canner for 10 minutes.Note:  You can shred the cabbage if you like.  I chop it and the other vegetables fairly fine because I like to use this as a relish sometimes.  I have also tossed in a few chopped green peppers and adjusted the ingredients accordingly.I have goofed off long enough.  On to the fun stuff, like shampooing the carpet.  (Yuck) The cat will disappear for a couple of hours at the sound of the shampooer and the dogs will hide in their kennels, but I expect they will forgive me about suppertime."},
{"title": "It's a Start", "date": "Friday, July 4, 2014", "text": "So yesterday Youngest Daughter made a grocery store run for me.  Strawberries were on sale and she brought me 6 quarts.  Five of those are hulled, cut in half and in the freezer.  I am leaning toward making strawberry jam with them, but I think I will wait and see if they go on sale again before using them.  The other quart is in the fridge, minus a bowl I ate last evening.  I love fresh strawberries.Hamburger was on sale as well, and she brought me 18 lbs.  This morning I browned all of it, drained it and packed it into pint jars.  One pound of hamburger fills one narrow mouth pint jar.  When I first started canning hamburger I added liquid - either beef broth or water - to each jar, but I wasn't happy with the results.  It sort of reminded me of dog food and that's where most of it wound up.  But canning it without adding liquid gives me hamburger that looks and tastes like I had just cooked it.  All 18 jars are merrily bubbling away in my pressure canner.Note:  If you are thinking about starting to can your own food, and you are looking to buy a pressure canner, get the biggest one that you can.  I am told that the best brand is the All American.  The big advantage is that the All American doesn't need a rubber gasket where other brands do.  But for me, the price was prohibitive.The first pressure canner I bought when I started canning again about 4 years ago, was a 16-quart Presto, bought at Walmart for around $60.  It has been a workhorse and I have had no problems with it.  It holds 9 pint jars or 8 quart jars.  For Christmas last year, Oldest Son gave me a 22-quart Mirro that holds 18 pint jars or 8 quart jars, having a divider that makes it possible to stack two layers of pints.  When I have a large amount of food to can and am using pint jars, this cuts my time in half.  It is getting a workout, and so far, I really like this canner as well.Being housebound does have its advantages.  In the winter I rarely go out by choice.  This chubby old woman just doesn't ice skate as well as I used to, and the thought of slipping and sliding on ice covered sidewalks is not pleasant.  And the cold isn't much fun, either.  Add being housebound part of this spring and summer and I have the perfect opportunity to see just how much of my food storage I had used between Christmas and the present.  I had taken an inventory the first of the year, so I know what I had.  I know what I ran out of and what is running low.  And now I know how much of each item I need for one years worth, which is my goal.Tomorrow morning I will wash the jars of hamburger, label them with the date and add them to my shelves.  Every little bit is one step closer to having what I want to have put back.  Eighteen jars of hamburger may not seem like much, but it's a start."},

The stairs are the big problem right now.  Going down is easy.  Coming back up - not so much.  In any event, some decisions will be made soon.  And I will work on asking for help when necessary.  But I will still hate it that I have to do so.Getting old really ain't for sissies."},

These two geniuses are nose to nose.  One is hollering, \"You hit like a school girl.\"  The other responds, \"Don't you ever say that to me.\"  Round and round they go until before long both are on the ground, trying to beat the tar out of one another.  Their friends try to pull them apart, but give it up after a while and just let them go.  The whole time they are still yelling, \"You hit like a school girl,\" and \"Don't you ever say that to me.\"  Both are too drunk to do any real damage.About this time a cop car pulls up.  Two officers get out and survey the scene.  They stand and watch these mental giants for a minute and then wade in.  One scoops up \"You hit like a school girl.\"  The other grabs \"Don't you ever say that to me\" by the scruff of the neck.  Both combatants are given shiny new bracelets to wear and both are poured into the cop car.  Off they go to spend a fun filled night in the drunk tank.And who says my life isn't exciting!"},

My arthritic hip seems to have healed enough to allow me to get out and about again.  So I planned to catch the bus this morning and head for the grocery store.  Planned, that is, right up to the time I woke up this morning with mild stomach flu type symptoms.  Nothing serious, but just enough so I think it might be wise to stay put another day or so.Time was I would get all mad and upset because of a small set-back like this.  Not any more.   Things usually happen for a reason.  I'm supposed to stay home today.  So I will.  At least I still have my sense of humor.  I chuckled to myself when I browsed the news this morning and read about a stupid criminal in the Twin City area.  Seems he burglarized a home, stealing various articles and cash.  While there, he used the homeowner's computer to check his Facebook page.  And forgot to log off when finished.  Which led to his capture.  The story is here.So I think I will go make myself a nice cup of tea.  The last time I dehydrated apple slices, I saved all the peelings and dried them, too.  Did the same thing with the pulp left over from making and canning cranberry juice last fall.  When I run the dried apple peels and cranberry pulp through my little grinder and add a spoonful of honey, it makes for a wonderful soothing tea.

It has been a bit frustrating to be sidelined here at home while grocery prices continue to move skyward at an alarming rate.  I was glad that I had so much food canned and dehydrated, for it really helped to have it over the long miserable winter and then for the past few weeks when I couldn't get out.  But supplies are starting to run low.  I like to have lots of hamburger and turkey canned and I am now down to 8 pints of burger and 6 pints of turkey.  Turkey prices haven't gone up too much, but the price of hamburger has doubled in the past year.  Those two things are at the top of my grocery list.For the rest, I will just wait for the sales and stock up then, except for onions.  I love onions for cooking and I like to have lots dehydrated for that purpose.  A 5 lb. bag of onions, once dried, will easily fit into a quart sized freezer bag, which solves some of my storage problems.  I saw that Sam's Club has a 50 lb. bag of onions for about half the price per pound of the grocery's 5 lb. bags.  I may have to see if one of my kids is feeling strong enough to haul a bag up here for me!Time to get back at it.  I've sat long enough.  I'm really looking forward to seeing what the outside world looks like again.  With any kind of luck, that will be sometime this coming week.Life is good."},

It was a doozey of a storm.  Nearly constant lightning and accompanying thunder crashed and rumbled.  The rain continued, and finally eased up close to dawn.  I dozed for a while until the second wave hit.  This one wasn't as severe or as long in duration.  It is going on 10 AM now, and the rain is still falling, but the thunder and lightning have moved on.  I waited for the power to go out, but luckily that hasn't happened in my neighborhood.A little over an hour ago I turned on the scanner for my county.  Streets are flooded.  Water is boiling up out of the storm drains.  The main highway running southwest of here is closed in several places with water over the road.  County roads are flooded or washed out.  Several creeks criss-cross the area and most of them are over their banks.  And a mud slide has closed yet another road.  Even the levels of water in some of the lakes are threatening homes along the shores.The Department of Transportation has had to close so many streets and roads that they ran out of traffic cones and barriers.  My oldest son, who lives southwest of me posted on Facebook that anyone going to work where he works would do well to wear their bathing suit.  He works nights, and is sleeping now, but I'm sure he will call and tell me about it when he wakes up.I live about two city blocks from the Minnesota River.  I haven't heard whether the river is still within its banks.  The founding fathers of my town had the good sense to build on top of the hill that runs down to the river, so flood waters have never reached this far. I am astounded at the number of people who drive their cars around the barriers and into the water on the roads and then can't figure out why their cars stalled.  I can hear the frustration in the voices of those who have to rescue these fools.It is a really good day to stay inside where it is dry and warm.  My Kindle is fully charged up.  I was going to bake some bread this morning, but have decided to wait until the threat of power loss is over.  I have several projects to work on that, should the power go out, will not be affected.  And I am seriously considering building an ark."},

So I divided the last of the stew into bowls, crumbled up the last two biscuits over the stew and set the bowls on the floor.  I don't think either of them even tasted the food, for they pretty much inhaled it.  Good to the last drop.And then they both waddled off to their respective kennels, where they are still napping.  I didn't know Yorkies could waddle.  They can.I have either created monsters who will want all of my leftovers, or I have killed them off.  If I have killed them off, at least they will die happy.  If they live and want leftovers, great.  Dog food ain't cheap these days, either."},
{"title": "The End of an Era", "date": "Monday, June 16, 2014", "text": "When I was sixteen, getting my Driver's License was the most important thing in my life.  The day it arrived was cause for great celebrating on my part and cause for worry and dread on the part of my parents.My Dad taught me how to drive.  He started by taking me out on the frozen lakes in winter, showing me the various steps in forward and backward motion, how to shift and how to brake.  Then he turned me loose and let me practice out on the snow covered ice, where I couldn't do much damage.When I had my learner's permit, we traveled the gravel back roads running between the corn and soy bean fields.  When he felt that I could drive those roads safely, we graduated to the blacktop county roads and finally to the two lane state highways.From there it was on to town driving. This was a fairly small town with a population of maybe 10,000 people at that time.  He taught me to drive the residential streets and the busy downtown area.  I learned to parallel park.  I learned that if you pay attention you won't squash the kid who dashes out in the street in front of your car.  I learned that just because the law says you have the right-of-way at an intersection doesn't mean that the other driver knows this.When it was time to take Drivers Education classes, I was ready and passed with flying colors.But Dad wasn't done with me yet.  One warm summer morning Dad asked me if I wanted to go to Minneapolis with him...a distance of about 100 miles.  I loved road trips with Dad.  I was ready in two minutes flat.Road trips with Dad weren't just about the trip.  There was always a stop at some little cafe for coffee and maybe a slice of pie.  Then there was a stop at a roadside stand to buy whatever fruit was in season.  This time it was cherries.  We drove along, munching on red ripe cherries, spitting the pits out the windows.When we reached the outskirts of the city, Dad pulled over.  He told me it was my turn to drive.  \"But you are driving through downtown Minneapolis,\" I objected.  \"No, you are,\" he said.  So I did.Minneapolis was a scary place for a country girl to drive.  If the freeways had been built then, I don't remember them.  We took two lane state highways right into the heart of the city.  I was terrified.  If Dad shared my terror, he hid it well.  He sat in the passenger seat, looking out the window and enjoying the view.  He offered no advice.  He didn't tell me how to handle each situation that presented itself.  He just let me go.Years later I told him how scared I had been on that drive.  He just smiled and told me that he knew I could do it.  He said that if I could make it through the city just once, I would never have a fear of driving anywhere ever again.  He was right.And now I have come full circle.  My driver's license was due for renewal last week.  Although my arthritic hip is much improved, it has not improved enough to be able to go to the courthouse.  So I just let my license go and later I will get an ID card for when I need to prove who I am.I thought it would bother me to let go of my driver's license, but I am gratified to find out that it really doesn't.  After all, it has been at least 10 years since I owned anything to drive.  Physical limitations keep me from even thinking about long trips alone.  I manage just fine with the use of the local bus and of adult children who take me where I need to go now and then.  So in reality, nothing has changed.As my Dad aged, his memory and sense of direction seemed to fail him at times.  He would set out to drive somewhere, get turned around in his mind and wind up miles away from his destination.  Because of the severe Minnesota winters, we were always fearful that he would get lost and wind up frozen in a snowbank somewhere.I just told Youngest Son that even though I intend to live long enough to be a problem to my children, my continuing to drive long after I should stop is not a problem they will have to deal with.  And I believe I am OK with that."},

They wouldn't know about the following two photos.These are my dad and mother, with Dad's mother.  The pictures were taken during this week, 68 years ago.  My Grandmother Matheny stayed with my parents for a week or so after I was born, to help with their first born child.  Who better to help with a newborn baby than Grandma, who had raised nine children of her own.  The house in the background is in Blackduck, where Mom and Dad lived at the time.This picture is of Dad, taken in the winter of 1947, when he worked at the gas station in Blackduck.  Dad wasn't a mechanic, but pumped gas, checked oil, cleaned windshields and all the other things that gas station attendants used to do before self-service stations came into existence.  He also delivered gas and fuel oil in the area.This is my Mother's father, Andrew Paul, on the left, with his brother Walter in the center and sister Clara on the right.  The photo was taken in 1889, when Andrew was six years old.This is Andrew in 1910, when he worked as a depot agent for the railroad.  He is in the Depot in Blackduck, and he worked there until he retired in the mid-1940's.  In small towns like Blackduck, the Depot Agent sold tickets, loaded and unloaded baggage and was the telegraph operator.  I have always loved this photo of my Grandfather.So I spent the better part of the day sorting pictures and writing as many of the stories as I could remember.  The goal is to include the photos with the family tree I am working on.  Seeing pictures of ancestors makes them more than just names and dates, and the stories tell who they were.  My parent's generation is gone now, and my generation is thinning out faster than I care to think about.  It is important to me that none of these people totally fade away, but are remembered within my family."},

It would be fairly easy to sink into a bout of depression, so I work really, really hard to not let that happen.  When I need to get off my feet, I sit and crochet or sew and watch old movies.  My choices are Agatha Christie type mysteries or comedies.  Mostly mysteries, for I have always liked a good \"Who-Done-It.\"  My Kindle is full of old, out of copyright books gleaned from the Internet, and I have to say that I am enjoying reading more often than I usually do.   The books may be old, but the stories are timeless.It's the little things that help get me through.  Like the promise from Youngest Son that when he is in town this week, he will bring me a treat from Dairy Queen.  I still haven't forgiven Dairy Queen for moving from two blocks away to the other side of town.  Years ago I had a Cocker Spaniel.  I would take him to the Dairy Queen with me.  A regular sized chocolate cone for me and a baby sized vanilla cone for him.  Had to stop doing that, though, when he refused to move unless we were headed in the direction of the ice cream.  I loved that dog!  He was the same one who would turn his back on me and grumble when I wouldn't share my spaghetti with him.I wonder if dogs understand more than we give them credit for.  The past two weeks Jessie Jane has spent a great amount of time laying on the floor next to me with either her chin or a paw on my foot.  This is unusual behavior for her.  And Lily spends time bringing her toys - and she has a bunch of them - to lay next to me.  I have to be careful not to trip over piles of tennis balls and stuffed animals.  This is something she has never done before.  She will scatter them about in play, but never pile them up for me.I have sat long enough.  Off to clean the fridge.  I had better, for the last time I opened the door, I think something growled at me.  If you don't hear from me in a day or two, send in a rescue party!"},
{"title": "Today...", "date": "Saturday, June 7, 2014", "text": "was another birthday.  I'm using my sister's method of counting the years.  She says her 27th year was a good one, so she just celebrates that one over and over again.  Makes sense to me.  I am not fond of birthday parties.  For the grandkids, yes.  For me, no.  I do not like to be fussed over.  My family knows this.  So I had cards arrive in the mail, telephone calls and a visit from one of my daughters, who was at the same time running an errand for me.I spent a relaxing day.  This morning my landlord, responding to my email, showed up and replaced the faucet on my kitchen sink and fixed the pipe beneath it that had sprung a leak.  It is possible to have a nice chat with someone who is laying on their back with their head in a kitchen cupboard.  He left when finished, munching on chocolate chip cookies.Had a nice visit with my daughter.  I have three grandkids with June birthdays, and she picked up cards for me to give to them.  After I stuffed them with the appropriate amounts of cash and addressed the two to be mailed (one she took home for her son), she asked if I wanted to wait and mail them closer to the birth dates.  I replied that if she didn't take them with her, chances were excellent that by the time I need to mail them, I will have misplaced them.  I said that after I die and she and her siblings are cleaning out my apartment, they could count on finding at least five cards that I have put away for safekeeping, never to be seen again.  She mailed the cards.I spent the rest of the day crocheting and watching old movies from the late 1930's and early 1940's that I found on YouTube.  I love old movies.  Sometimes they are funny without meaning to be.  Like one I watched that had to do with trains.  The train wreck was so obviously a model train and the rain storm had to be the sprayer from a garden hose, all of which I'm sure was state of the art for the times.  I found a couple of old Charlie Chan movies that were fun, just for the silly jokes if nothing else.  Sometimes the news of the here and now gets to be too much, and a day of doing other things is necessary to maintain my sanity, what there is left of it.  Today was such a day, and was truly enjoyed.I topped off the day by treating myself to a pizza.  After eating my fill for supper, I put a couple of slices in the fridge for tomorrow and froze the rest for a quick meal later. I joke about counting the years, but truth be known, age doesn't bother me except for the fact that my body doesn't work as well as it once did.  I'm not surprised, though, for I spent many of my 68 years doing physically demanding work, either while on the farm or in the various jobs I have held over the years.  Sometimes I am surprised that I can still do as much as I can, what with the arthritis and all.  I think it is all in the attitude.  I can make a choice each morning, to let life get me down or to get up and get on with it.I've got a lot of living left to do, so I think I will continue to just get on with it."},
{"title": "A Day in the Life...", "date": "Friday, June 6, 2014", "text": "Summer is upon us with mild temperatures.  Soft breezes keep my little corner of the world comfortable without needing air conditioning as yet.  Healing is ever so slowly happening.  Not fast enough to suit me, but slow enough to teach me patience.  The stairs remain my mountain that I can not as yet scale, but I will in due time.  There are other small victories. A kitchen floor that was thoroughly scrubbed yesterday.  I really wonder how two small dogs, one lazy cat and one slow-moving old woman can create such a dirty floor  We must work at it, I guess.  Dust that had accumulated is gone and carpets have been vacuumed.  Not all at once, but done nonetheless. Yesterday afternoon I stirred up a double batch of chocolate chip cookies.  I chilled the dough overnight and will bake them when I finish this post.  Chocolate chip cookies are my favorite comfort food.  And it is fun to have a cookie jar full of them when kids or grandkids stop by.Being housebound has its advantages.  I have finished the afghan I was working on for my oldest granddaughter.  All that remains is to have her mother help me lay it out on my bed so I can make sure that all of the colored granny squares are in the correct positions that form the pattern.   It is one large afghan and is much easier to lay out and refold with help.  I have started another to keep my hands busy during the times I need to sit.I have spent some time looking online for ideas for meals that I can put together, freeze and then thaw and bake later.  And I may make up a few, but I'm not so sure that I want to rely on my freezer.  Winters here can give us heavy, wet snows or blizzards, both of which can knock out local power.  Summers favor us with thunder storms, straight line winds and the occasional tornado that can also knock out power.  I mostly use my freezer for extra bread or cookies and bars when I bake or for meat that is on sale, keeping it frozen until I have enough to can. Over the last couple of years I have dehydrated a vast amount of vegetables.  I use them when making soups or stews.  But I got to thinking that it might be a good idea to convert some of my soup and casserole recipes to use these dehydrated foods.  By putting the ingredients (dehydrated vegetables, seasonings, pasta, bouillon for flavor, etc.) into quart jars and sealing them with the jar sealer attachment for my Food Saver vacuum sealer, they could sit on a shelf until needed, and all I would need to do is add a pint of canned turkey or beef and water, toss it all into a crock pot or a slow oven, and Shazam.....easy peasy meal.  And, God forbid, should the time come when my family is hungry, it would be a great way to see that they are fed.  So as soon as I am completely mobile again, this is on my to-do list.So I am off to bake cookies.  I am reminded of a time when four small pairs of hands would sneak a handful or two of raw cookie dough before I could get the cookies into the oven.  I got to the point where I would stir up extra dough so I would have enough for the baked cookies.  Yes, I know.  We will all surely die if we eat anything that contains raw eggs. Me.....I'll risk it."},
{"title": "The Fat Ladies Club", "date": "Monday, June 2, 2014", "text": "Back in the late 50's and early 60's when most women didn't work outside the home, one of the farm wives in my parent's neighborhood decided she wanted to lose some weight.  And because misery loves company, she phoned her neighbors and suggested they get together once a month over coffee for the purpose of discussing diets and exercise.  My Dad, tongue in cheek, suggested they call themselves \"The Fat Ladies Club.\"  The name stuck.This group of 8 or 10 women started out with the best of intentions.  They talked calories, discussed the latest fads in diets and exercise programs.  This lasted for maybe two meetings.Minnesota farmers and their wives are incapable of drinking coffee if it is not accompanied by a dessert.  Usually cookies or cake or pie.  Soon the Fat Ladies Club felt the need for a \"little something\" to go with their coffee.  A pan of rhubarb crumble appeared at one meeting.  Strawberry shortcake was served at the next.  I came into our kitchen one day and found Mother whipping up one of her to die for refrigerator desserts that contained melted marshmallows, whipped cream and cherry pie filling, on a graham cracker crust.  I asked her what that was for.  She replied that it was for the Fat Ladies Club.  I made some smart remark about putting fat on the fat ladies, and then ducked and ran.The club lasted for a couple of years.  It was mostly a chance for these ladies to get out of the house for a little while and enjoy the gossip and the laughter of their friends.  They were hard working women.  They kept their homes in good running order, planted huge gardens, canned the produce from those gardens, raised their children, fed their families and the chickens and helped with the farm chores. I don't think any member of the Fat Ladies Club ever lost a pound.  But judging by the gales of laughter coming from our living room when the club met at our house, it was a roaring success."},

{"title": "The Bicycle Thieves", "date": "Saturday, May 24, 2014", "text": "So this morning I'm messing about on my computer with the channel for the Minneapolis Police Department on in the background, when I hear a call come in.  There are about half a dozen kids, approximate ages 12 - 16, who are stealing bicycles from a bicycle shop display in front of the store.  Each kid grabs a bike and stashes it down the outside stairwell of a building close by, and then goes back to steal another.  The kids are having a right good old time, laughing and swiping bikes.Unbeknownst to the kids, there is an old man who is a guard.  He is inside the shop, monitoring the outside activity that is showing up on the security cameras.  He can identify each kid, which bikes they stole and where the stolen bikes are.Police are on the way.  And I'm guessing that these little hoodlums won't be smiling shortly.But I am, for all I could think of was:\"Old age and cunning will triumph over youth and enthusiasm every time.\"So many times we hear of people who are successful on a grand scale...multiple homes, bags full of money, all the latest electronic gadgets, every toy known to man.  But they got nothin' on me.There is enough of an improvement in the condition of my hip so that this morning I was able to climb in and out of my tub/shower, all by myself, no assistance required.  No more sponge baths.  Woo Hoo!!My next mountain to be climbed is the stack of dirty dishes waiting patiently for me in my kitchen sink.  I'm betting that later on today, they will be washed, dried and put away.Sometimes it is not the huge successes that matter.  Sometimes the tiny successes mean more.  For me, at this time, I'll take the tiny ones, happily!"},
{"title": "Rethinking Preps", "date": "Thursday, May 22, 2014", "text": "When we think about being prepared, most will cite the upcoming collapse of our economy or the tyrannical direction our government is headed or the loss of our freedoms or the real possibility of the grid going down or a zombie apocalypse as reasons to prepare.  Well, maybe not the zombies so much.This past week or so I have found that although I prepare for whatever is looming on the horizon, I might be a little better off to look a bit closer to home, and plan accordingly.  I give you the following as an illustration of what can happen in day to day life, never mind the zombies.First, let me say that I tell you my little story not looking for sympathy, but to illustrate a point.  I don't feel sorry for myself and I don't want anyone else feeling sorry for me.  That isn't the point.  The point is that things beyond our control can happen and sometimes we miss the small stuff by looking only at the big picture.I am not recovering as quickly as I had hoped for from my arthritis flare-up.  Walking at this point is painful and difficult at best.  The stairs - not gonna happen.  Although I am very slowly getting better, most everything I do at this stage is in a seated position, for standing is also not much fun.I have had to call for help just once.  I was out of bread and unable to physically make any more myself, so my son-in-law, God love him, brought me some loaves and some lunch meat from the store.  He also hauled out my trash and brought up my mail.  I learned that it might be better to swallow a little pride and ask one of my neighbors if they would, in an emergency, help me with the trash and mail, in trade for some homemade bread or rolls when I am better.  And I learned that I not only need to store flour, yeast, etc. for baking bread, but I need to have several loaves, either in dough form or already baked, in the freezer.  The actual baking requires little walking or standing.  It's the stirring up and kneading that is difficult.Luckily, last year I canned several varieties of soup - split pea & ham, ham & bean, turkey vegetable, vegetable beef, and chili.  These have been a life saver for me, and I need to find more ideas for meals that can be home canned.  Standing next to the stove to cook from scratch just isn't going to happen right now, so anything that I can just heat up keeps me fed with the least amount of fuss and bother. I really need to become better organized.  For instance  I canned some homemade pork and beans.  They are really good.  At least I remember them as tasting really good.  They are on the top shelf of one of my shelving units where I store canned foods.  I can't reach them without climbing on my little step ladder.  Not gonna happen this week!  So I found that I need to have a variety of easy to heat up canned food in jars in a cupboard that is handy to my stove and microwave.  If movement is a problem, then things like jar meals need to be within easy reach.A few years ago, one of my daughters had been involved with a group that got together and made up freezer meals.  Everything needed was assembled and put into freezer bags.  She had given me a couple of them, and they were really good.  I think it might be a very good idea to find recipes for this kind of thing and make up a couple of weeks worth of meals, so all I would have to do is take out a bag, thaw the contents, dump into a casserole dish and bake.  As long as I am spending most of my days right now sitting on my backside, I might just as well sit in front of my computer and research this for when I am well again.  I have seen blogs where people do this, and now I just need to pay attention and take notes.I realize that there are other steps that can be taken to make life easier in a situation like mine.  But I found that feeding myself was the most wearing on me, so I am concentrating on making that aspect of life a little less trying.The whole point of this post is to say that sometimes things happen when we least expect it.  I didn't even entertain the possibility of being sidelined for so long a time.  And I wasn't ready for it.  There may be a next time, or I may get lucky and not have to deal with this kind of thing again.  Who knows.  But if there is a next time, at least I will be more ready to take care of myself than I was this time.  And if I can help someone else who might go through a similar experience, then I have done my job."},
{"title": "When You Are Six", "date": "Tuesday, May 20, 2014", "text": "When you are six, it doesn't take much to have a bad week.It starts when six year old boy and the neighbor girl, same age, decide to relieve themselves in the yard rather than take time to go inside to the bathroom.  Girl's daddy doesn't seem to possess a sense of humor.  Boy's daddy knows that the kids are only six years old and when you are six, peeing outside is fun.  Boy's daddy kinda wishes the kid would have found a bush to hide behind, though.  Six year old boy learns that there is less trouble involved if he just goes inside when nature calls.Then six year old boy comes home spouting a brand new word.  It is unfortunate that this particular word is not one that should be used in polite society.  Boy's daddy wants to know where he heard this particular word.  Six year old boy says that the neighbor boy said it to another kid.  Boy's daddy wants to know if six year old boy knows what this word means.  Six year old boy does not.  Boy's daddy explains that this word is not a nice word.  It is a word that nice people don't use.  He tells six year old boy that if he doesn't know what a word means, he shouldn't say it.  And if he does know what a word means and it is a word that is naughty, he shouldn't say it then, either.  Six year old boy learns a lesson about bad words.I really like the fact that my son didn't come all unglued when his son added a bad word to his vocabulary.  He patiently explained, without having to go into detail about the meaning of the word which the kid is probably too young to totally grasp, that there are words that are not nice and he would not like to hear those words spoken in their home, or away from it, for that matter. In these days of extreme political correctness and free speech zones, I am glad that my grandson is being taught right from wrong and not being taught that certain words are not allowed.  The kid, while growing up, is going to be learning lots and lots of new words - not all of them nice.  I believe that learning what is right and what is wrong will serve him much better than an outright banning of words.  And I am certain that if this same kid decides to spout off words he knows are wrong, there will be consequences.  Which makes a lot more sense to me than censoring speech or creating free speech zones.As for the peeing on the lawn thing, I'm pretty sure that when my grandson has grandchildren of his own, he will probably still be peeing outdoors now and then.  But by then he will have gained enough common sense to at least go find a tree to hide behind."},

{"title": "Your Own Paradise", "date": "Saturday, May 17, 2014", "text": "Earlier this week I posted about spending a quiet day, and mentioned that I had a beef stew bubbling on the back burner and that biscuits were about to go in the oven.  One of my regular readers and one I consider to be a friend, Jess over at \"Scratching to Escape,\" left the following comment:  \"A quiet day? With homemade stew and biscuits? Sounds like a small piece of paradise.\"By the way, if you aren't already reading Jess' blog, you are missing out.  He voices opinions, writes well about a variety of subjects and his stories of fiction that he posts now and then are gems.Anyway, his comment about my small piece of paradise got me to thinking.  For many years I was a restless person.  I was never quite satisfied with my life.  It wasn't so much about financial matters, for fortunes have never impressed me much.  It was more about that time-worn notion that the grass is always greener over there, just beyond that fence.  I felt that I just could never quite get to the greener grass.It took me well over 60 years to discover that it had nothing to do with green grass.  It had to do with my own shortcomings. I have never been one to covet my neighbor's belongings.  If the guy down the street drove a nicer car than I did, I didn't care.  If the next door neighbor had a big screen TV delivered, I was happy for him, but didn't rush out to buy one bigger and better.  If friends belonged to prestigious clubs or organizations, well good for them, but I wasn't interested.Most folks wouldn't think that living in a three room apartment in a city suburb could be even close to paradise.  For a long time, I didn't think so, either.  But in the past few years, I have come to realize that a person's personal paradise is what they make it.  It is where \"Home\" is.  It is where you can just be yourself.  Nobody needs to be impressed with your lifestyle if you are happy with it.  In my little apartment, I can do what I like.  I can run my pressure canner to help stock my shelves.  I can spend time making afghans for grandkids.  I can sew a quilt if I choose to.  I can read all night if I want. When I go outside, I am reminded that I live in a town and I would very much like to live in the country again.  But I refuse to dwell on that aspect of my life, or to let it spoil a perfectly good day.  Oh, there are times when I daydream about a cabin in the woods or on a lake, but now I can see those for what they are - pleasant daydreams.  That's not going to happen at this stage of my life, but it is alright to dream just a bit.Sometimes I can be pretty slow on the uptake.  It took me so very long to remember some advice I was given years ago.  I wish I had remembered sooner.\"Bloom where you're planted.\"I am so excited!  M. E. Masterson over at her blog, \"Adventures of Life!,\" just held a giveaway.  The drawing was for a beautiful beaded barrette, handmade by herself.  As a lover of all things handmade, I am thrilled to have won the drawing.  When it arrives, I will take pictures to post here.If you aren't a regular reader of \"Adventures of Life!\" you should be.  Many thanks to her for this lovely gift.Anybody stopping by to see me today will be greeted with my grin, which is sure to last all day!"},

{"title": "Monday Ramblings", "date": "Monday, May 12, 2014", "text": "I was checking the weather forecast this morning while planning my week.  Seems I might as well just tuck an umbrella under my arm and go out to do what needs to be done.  Cool and damp are the common words in the forecast.  No sense in complaining.  Other parts of the country are experiencing drought conditions, while here everything is turning green.  There is a small tree outside my front windows.  Tiny leaves are forming and soon it will be lush and green again, giving shade for me while I sit on the front steps enjoying the fresh air with Jessie Jane and Lily.  We like to sit there from time to time, watching the world go by.  Although there isn't much to watch during the daylight hours, when the streets are fairly quiet.  Sometimes the owners of the bicycle shop in my building will come out to chat and give Lily a pet or Jessie Jane an ear scratch.  There are some nice things about living in a town.Although fall is my favorite time of year, spring runs a close second.  The bitter cold and the drifts of snow are but a bad memory.  The lilac bushes in the next block are starting to form buds.  The lady who owns them lets me cut as many of the flowered branches as I want to bring home.  Lilacs are one of my favorite flowers, and for the short time they are in bloom, I have mason jars full all over my apartment.  I think that nearly every farmhouse in the state has lilac bushes.  They remind me of the ones by the old farmhouse where I grew up.  Those ranged in color from white to deep purple, and a huge bouquet always sat on the dining room table in the spring, giving the house a wonderful scent.I think it may be the sounds of the birds I like most.  During the winter, most have the common sense to flee south when the first snowflakes hit the ground, and those who aren't quite as smart spend the winter huddled in whatever shelters they can find.  But come springtime, they are all out and about and in full voice.  Some days when my windows are open, the sound of birdsong nearly fills my apartment.  This confounds Lily, who can't decide if the birds are friend or foe.  Fortunately, Kizzie the cat is way too lazy to be bothered with scaring them off.  I don't need any radio music going when I can listen to the birds sing.I have rambled on long enough.  Time to get a few odds and ends done this afternoon, for tomorrow it is back to my quest to restock my pantry shelves.  There is a good sale this week on celery and on mushrooms, both of which I like to dehydrate.  Whole chickens are on sale, too, and I like to have a few in my freezer.  Roast chicken is a favorite meal, and there is so much I can do with the leftovers.  One chicken can feed me suppers for several days.  I've almost given up on finding hamburger, or any beef, at a reasonable price.  I may just have to pay the price to get as much canned as I will need for the next year.  I just don't see prices falling any time soon - or at all, for that matter.I guess all we can do is continue on and do the best we can with what we have to work with."},
{"title": "What a lovely day...", "date": "Sunday, May 11, 2014", "text": "I had today!Those kids who couldn't be here called this morning to wish me a Happy Mother's Day.  One had to work and the other was spending the day with her grown-up son.  Oldest daughter had another commitment, but when she brought my vac to me last week, she gave me a Mother's Day present of a gift card good for four haircuts.David, Staci and the Grands took me out for lunch.  That was a real treat, as I rarely go out to eat.  The best part was sitting with my grandchildren and listening to them tell me all about what they have been doing.They wanted to take me to get my hair cut.  They said that way I wouldn't have to take the bus to get it done.  They said that the girls wanted to watch when I got all of my long hair cut off.  So off we went.The lady who cut my hair was so very nice.  She let my granddaughters stand right there by me so they could see.  I wanted to donate my hair to Locks of Love, so the beautician put my hair into two braids.  Boston and Maddie were astounded that the braids measured 18 inches long.  Their eyes were big as saucers when with a few snips of the scissors, the braids lay on the counter in front of me.  I've got to say that my head feels considerably lighter!Afterward the kids wanted their picture taken with Grandma, so we went outside for that.Then the beautician who cut my hair asked if my son would take a picture of me holding the braids.  So he did.It seems the shop wanted it for the part of their website about Locks of Love.  Boston and Maddie were impressed!!And then we headed for home.  The kids came upstairs so they could pet the cat and feed treats to the dogs, who were in ecstasy.  Kids and treats.  Their lives don't get much better than that.I am blessed with children who remember me on Mother's Day, even if they can't be with me.  I am truly one of the lucky ones.I received one more gift - a gift card for Kindle books from Amazon, so I believe I will browse and pick out some books to add to my collection.  And then I think it will be time for a nap.It was such a good day."},
{"title": "Mother", "date": "Friday, May 9, 2014", "text": "Eighteen years have passed since my mother died.  Whoever said that time heals all wounds obviously hadn't yet lost his mother.I wonder why it is that we sometimes develop an appreciation for our mothers when it is too late to tell them so.  I am so very grateful to her for her patience in teaching me all there was to know about keeping a home, for that is what she did. She married right after WWII, in an era where Dad's went off to work in the morning and Mom's stayed home and washed the clothes and scrubbed the floors and baked the cookies and cooked the meals.  She sewed our clothes and mended them when we were careless and put holes in them.  She saw to it that we went to church.  She made sure we understood the importance of family.  And she made sure that I learned the lessons well.When we are young, we tend to resent having to stay home to help with the Saturday house cleaning ritual (Just in case we get company on Sunday.), or to help with the canning of garden vegetables and cases of peaches (If we don't do this now, we won't eat this winter.), or to learn how to sew a dress (If you can sew, you will always have nice clothes to wear.).  We want to be with our friends instead of sitting on the back steps shelling a tub full of peas. And when we get to be young adults, we are way too busy and way too self-important to even think about the person who taught us the things that now make our lives better.  When money is tight and we refrain from buying a new blouse, but sew one for ourselves, it doesn't occur to us to thank the person who spent hours showing us how it was done.  When we have children of our own to feed, we don't think about the person who taught us to fry a chicken without burning the daylights out of it or how to roast a piece of beef without winding up with a chunk of shoe leather.It is now, when I am in the twilight of my life, that I think the most about the woman who raised me.  If she had not taken the time and had the patience (Lord only knows, she needed a basketful of patience with me.), I would not be enjoying this time of my life nearly as much as I do.  I wouldn't know how to do so many things that now occupy my time and that I enjoy.  I wouldn't have as great an appreciation for my family as I do.  And I wouldn't have the values that are important to me.I wish I had told her more often than I did.  I hope she knows that the rebellious girl-child she dealt with has come full circle, and has acquired an appreciation for all of the hard work it took to get me to this point.  And that even though I have, over the years, strayed far afield from my mother's teachings, I never forgot.  She taught me well.Thank you, Mom.  I love and miss you."},
{"title": "Storms", "date": "Thursday, May 8, 2014", "text": "Last evening I knew a storm was approaching even before I checked the weather radar.  My smallest Yorkie, Lily, was in full \"something is coming and I don't like it\" mode.  She paced the living room.  She kept an eye on the windows.  She pestered me in between pacing and watching.  And as soon as the first flash of lightning and the first roll of thunder occurred, she curled up in her kennel and went to sleep.  Sometimes I think she is more accurate in her predictions of approaching storms than is the weatherman.Up until recently, Jessie Jane would accompany her partner in crime in her pacing and watching and pestering.  But age seems to have caught up with my Jessie.  I'm not sure of her exact age, but it is around the 13 year mark.  She has adopted a \"whatever\" attitude and only gets excited when there is a treat in her immediate future.  Last night she stayed in her kennel, which seems to be her favorite place to be now, and watched Lily's frantic pacing from there.  It was kind of like \"Fine.  Whatever.  Wake me when it's over.\"The storm didn't last very long and produced just a little pea sized hail.  The sun is shining now, but more storms are headed this way in the afternoon and evening hours.  I had thought about making a grocery run today, but think I will wait until tomorrow when the storms will have passed. My daughter did an excellent job in choosing a vacuum cleaner for me.  I test drove it yesterday.  I thought that my bedroom carpet was pretty clean with the exception of a few little bits and pieces that find their way onto a rug, but when I went over the carpet, the new vac picked up enough cat hair to build a whole new cat.  My living room carpet will be cleaned this afternoon, and if the new carpet scrubber works half as well as the new vac, I will be happy.I sometimes wonder what it says about my personality that I am content to watch weather predicting dogs and am happy about the performance of a new vacuum cleaner.  Most would probably say that my life is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Now that warmer weather is here, my windows are open some to let in all that lovely spring air.  The down side is that I can more clearly hear the voices of some of the patrons of the bar next door.  It isn't a rowdy bar - more of a neighborhood place.  But I hear quite often the nearly hysterical laughter of some who seem to have a need to have a good time, no matter what.  And I hear the harsh words of arguments, usually fueled by too much to drink. I don't drink.  There was a time when I did.  A lot.  It was in my best interest to stop drinking altogether, for I didn't like that person very much.  The one who didn't know when to stop.  That being said, I have no problem with those who enjoy an adult beverage.  Or with those who like to go out on the town.  But in the past year or two, it seems that things have changed.  For the 17 years I have lived here, I have heard those voices, especially on the weekends.  And it seems to me that the voices that once were those of every day folks having a beer or two, laughing and joking and just enjoying an evening out with friends, now are almost frantic in their quest for a good time.  The laughter seems forced.  The fights are a nightly occurrence.  And instead of the friendly banter among friends, I hear a lot of hate and discontent.I thought perhaps it is because I have gotten old.  But I really don't think it is.  I thought maybe it was because I no longer drink, but that's not it, either.  People have changed.  Or at least, the attitudes of society have changed.  It is almost like people know, deep down inside, that bad things are coming, and they have a need to raise as much hell as possible while they still can.I hope I'm wrong."},
{"title": "Rattle, Clunk and Smoke", "date": "Wednesday, May 7, 2014", "text": "So I was in Suzy Homemaker mode.  Drug out the vacuum.  Started sucking up the debris on my bedroom carpet.  And I soon smelled smoke.Oh, crap.  Please don't anybody tell me that there is another fire in my building.  About that time I hear a noise that sounds like somebody is shaking a tin can full of marbles.  I look down and discover the smoke and noise is coming from the business end of my vacuum.Laid the vac handle down flat on the floor so the smoking part is in the air.  Don't really want to burn a hole in the carpet.  Unplugged the offending machine.  The smoke slowly drifted out the open window.  Took a look at the bottom of the vac and found metal and plastic bits and shavings.  This is not good.The vacuum belonged to Youngest Daughter before I got it several years ago.  It has had a workout.  It owes me nothing.  Sometimes a piece of equipment just isn't worth fixing.  This is one of those times.On to the next project.  Grabbed the carpet cleaning machine and headed for the living room.  Wanted to give the carpet a good cleaning before I get busy with other things.  I managed to get about three square feet of carpet cleaned when there was a whine, a clunk, and then the machine just died.  Checked the belt.  OK.  Made sure I hadn't tripped a breaker.  Nope.  Plugged into a different outlet.  Nothing.  Messed with the on-off switch.  It finally came to life, only to clunk two or three more times and die again.I am a fairly patient person.  Not completely patient, but fairly patient.  But by this time I had had enough.  Wrestled the carpet cleaner down the stairs and tossed it into the dumpster.  Came back in and made the same trip with the vacuum.  Came back inside and called my oldest daughter.  Asked her if she would go to the store, buy a vacuum cleaner and a carpet cleaner and bring them to me.  I knew that the boxes would never fit in my cart.  Trying to carry them on the bus was not an option.  She asked me if I needed them right then or would tomorrow be alright.  Tomorrow would be just fine.The vacuum cleaner in the box and the carpet cleaner in the box are sitting in my kitchen.  Tomorrow I will put them together.  And vacuum my carpets.  And shampoo my carpets.  I've been working hard to stick to a budget, and it has paid off.  Of course, it helped that I pretty much stayed home all winter.  When you don't go anywhere, you don't spend money.  So I could replace the worn out vac and carpet cleaner without ripping my finances to shreds.And tonight I will say a prayer, thanking the good Lord for giving me yet another daughter who is willing to come riding in on a white charger to save the day for her mother."},

{"title": "Minneapolis Protest", "date": "Thursday, May 1, 2014", "text": "I guess I'm just too dumb to understand the reasoning behind some political protests.  I understand why people protest, but sometimes the way they go about it makes little sense to me.For instance:  I was listening to the scanner website this afternoon while attending to a few household chores.  Apparently there is an immigration bill being debated in our federal legislature.  There was a protest staged in downtown Minneapolis concerning this proposed legislation.The police were scrambling to deal with several buses carrying protesters converging on the downtown area.  Downtown Minneapolis is a traffic hell under the best of conditions.  Then they were dealing with the protesters themselves, who were doing their level best to stop all traffic downtown, right at rush hour.  They had to block off streets and re-route traffic, while trying to keep the protesters under some sort of control.  It made for a nightmare of a mess.Now I can understand people protesting legislation that they don't agree with.  I believe that folks should be engaged in what is happening that affects their lives.  I will have to confess that I am not up to speed on the current immigration legislation being debated.  There is so much garbage being thrown at the people of the United States these days that keeping abreast of all of it is a full time job.But I'm willing to bet that those folks who, at 5:00 this afternoon, just wanted to get home to their families, have dinner with their kids, walk the dog or just relax with an adult beverage after a day at the office, but were delayed in a huge traffic snarl caused by several bus loads of people sitting down in the middle of the streets of downtown Minneapolis and thus preventing the working public from going home, are not going to be too sympathetic to the cause of these protesters.If you want support for your cause from the general public, I'm thinking that there are better ways to do it than to tick off those very people you want to help you.  Just saying......"},

{"title": "They Call The Wind Mariah", "date": "Tuesday, April 29, 2014", "text": "I've always liked that song.  It's kind of melancholy and lonely and sometimes, not often, but sometimes it fits my mood.It has been raining off and on since Sunday.  The wind sometimes howls down the streets and around the corners and then lets up for a while, like it is catching its breath for another hard blow.I wonder if the never ceasing sounds of wind can really drive a person over the edge.  My Dad thought so.  He claimed that someone he knew was driven mad by the constantly blowing winds in the Dakotas during the Great Depression.  It may have been the wind.  It may have been living with the hardships of that time.  I never knew for sure.  But Dad was convinced that the wind was the cause of the madness.But then my Dad had one or two other somewhat strange ideas.  I found it sort of hard to explain these ideas coming from a man who was so practical and grounded.  He had only an eighth grade education, which was normal for boys of his generation.  Born on a farm in 1911, he went to school in the one room schoolhouse near the farm where he grew up until he had completed the highest grade possible there.  Then he worked, either on the farm or hiring out to make money to help the family.  And he continued to work hard the rest of his life.  He wasn't given to flights of fancy.I called him when I first became interested in tracing my family history, to ask him some questions about his grandparents.  He told me what I wanted to know and then he said, \"Now, you be careful.  You know that _____ went crazy when she was working on that genealogy stuff.\"  I could never convince him that _____ suffered from dementia, and that the genealogy had nothing to do with it.  After that, when I would question him about this ancestor or that, he would always caution me to \"Be careful that you don't go crazy.\"I find it interesting, the little snippets of life that remain in our memories.  Whenever I take the time to research my family history, I smile to myself when I always recall Dad's words of warning about \"that genealogy stuff.\"And if this wind doesn't let up soon, I may be able to test his theory that the sound of the wind really can drive a person a bit mad!I think I now have some idea of what it took for my small in stature grandmother to make bread for her family of nine children.  She had to have stirred up and kneaded vast amounts of bread dough to feed that crew.  None of them were shy about their appetites.  But she did it on purpose.I did it because I am a dunderhead.I was happily measuring yeast into the warm water for the bread.  Thinking about God only knows what.  It wasn't about the task at hand.  And that is where my inner dunderhead took over, and I found I was spooning Tablespoons of yeast - not the teaspoons I should have been using.Duh!A quick calculation told me I would have to double the recipe to use the yeast already in the water.  I usually double the original recipe, so now I am making a quadruple batch of bread.  Yikes!Kneading bread dough that contains 22 cups of flour is not a job for the faint of heart.  Or the weak of muscle.  Took me 20 minutes over the normal ten.  Wore me down to a frazzle.  Dunderhead.On the up side, I don't have to bake for a while.  I have 4 large loaves, 3 dozen buns and two large pans of cinnamon rolls.I guess there are some advantages to being a dunderhead."},
{"title": "Productive Weekend", "date": "Monday, April 28, 2014", "text": "The soft spring rains were nice on Sunday, right up to the time the wind picked up and started to howl down the alley and around the corners of my building.  It's funny how even though the inside temperature remains constant, it feels colder when I can hear the whistle of the wind and the sound of the rain being blown against the window panes.  So I grabbed a flannel shirt and a heavy pair of socks to ward off the imaginary coolness of my apartment, and got busy.Sams Club has fresh chicken breast at a good price, so I bought several packages, cut the chicken into chunks and canned them.  27 pints of chicken are now on the shelves, making a total of 54 pints with what I had canned earlier.  Took the pieces of fat and scrap meat I had cut off the chicken before canning, boiled them up with a bit of seasoning and got 4 quarts of rich broth.  The cooked scraps are used for dog treats that make my two ankle biters jump for joy!  The chicken fat gives fried potatoes a wonderful flavor.  I had planned to buy hamburger to can, for I use that a lot, but their price was no better than the grocery store's, so I will wait for sales.Sam's carries the huge 6 lb. packages of frozen hash browns, so I got three.  They dehydrate down to less than half the bulk which frees up my freezer space.  I put the last bag on dehydrator trays this morning.  I really like having the dry hash browns on my pantry shelf.  Takes only about 15 minutes to rehydrate them in boiling water and they are ready to use.The price of butter is good - just a bit over $2 per pound, as opposed to $3.59 a pound at the grocery, so 24 pounds are in the freezer.  Yeast is really cheap in the vacuum sealed 2 lb. packages, and because I bake all of my own bread, I bought 8 lbs.  That should last me a very long time.I believe that it is necessary to my happiness and well being to have an occasional treat.  I bypassed the barrel o' cheese puffs (although I was tempted) and went for the frozen blueberries.  Sams sells a 3 lb. bag for $6.88.  It would be tough to find a pound of fresh at the grocery for the price.  I bought three bags.  One I will just eat.  I like them as an evening snack once in a while, about half thawed.  The other bags will be used for baking or desserts or blueberry pancakes.There was a lot more that my poor daughter huffed up the stairs for me.  The stairway I usually use is wide and gradual, with a landing half way up.  Had that stairway not been a crime scene that morning, she would have hauled the groceries to the landing where I would have loaded my cart and easily taken them the rest of the way.  As it was, we had to use the front stairs which are very steep and narrow.  She wouldn't let me try to carry anything up those awful stairs, but carted all of it herself.  Without complaint.  She has one knee that gives her trouble, and I'm pretty sure she had to go home and ice it down for a while.  How on earth I wound up with kids who help, even when it hurts, is beyond me.  I am so very grateful.With all of the bad things going on around us, with a government that seems to delight in making us dependent upon it and with the same government that seems hell-bent on destroying our Constitutional rights, I tend to become a bit anxious when I know that I am not as prepared to take care of myself as I would like.  So even something like this grocery haul eases my mind a bit.  I will continue to do whatever I can to be as prepared as possible for whatever new and worrisome cards are dealt us.  I don't know how others feel, but it seems to me that the downward slide is escalating.  I refuse to be one of those fighting for the last loaf of bread on the shelf."},

It is my opinion, wounds or not, the punk should be horse whipped just for the agony he has caused that poor old lady."},

A little while ago I heard one of the dispatchers announce that there was a father at the police station with his 15 year old son.  The father had discovered that his son had been buying drugs from another student at his school, and had promptly brought the son to the station to talk with police about who had sold the drugs.That had to be hard for a parent to do.  And young boys really don't like to rat out their peers, especially if those peers are the source for their drugs.All I know is what I heard in the police transmissions, but it sounded to me like the father was determined to put a stop to his son's drug use.  And in the process, he is giving his son a lesson in consequences for actions.With a parent who cares enough to do what this father is doing tonight, perhaps the boy has a fighting chance.  Too many parents, it seems, don't want to be bothered or make excuses when their children do something stupid.  I wish both the father and his son well, and commend them for what they are doing."},

I'm afraid I might step on one or the other.  They have such small bones that being stepped on could have disastrous results.  And if I should trip over them, I could easily do myself a mischief.  So I've been trying to break them of this habit, to no avail.Today I gave up on everything else I have done, trying to discourage them from being underfoot.  I just said, \"No.\"  I didn't yell. I didn't raise my voice in any way.  Just a firm \"No.\"To my complete amazement, they turned in unison, left the kitchen and entered their respective kennels in the living room.They really scare me sometimes."},

There was one jar of chicken breast in the fridge that hadn't properly sealed when I canned the chicken, so I turned that, along with a quart of turkey broth and some veggies and seasonings, into soup.  And then thought, \"What the heck,\" and tossed in a cup of rice to turn it into a nice chicken rice casserole.  Tastes really good even though it looks suspiciously like the dog food I make for my two little ankle biters.  Wound up with enough for supper tonight and a couple of containers to freeze for later.Also had a half a quart jar of home canned peaches that needed to be used, so I made a batch of peach muffins.  They were good as dessert last night and even better as breakfast this morning. This week's grocery advertisement has some pretty good sales going on, including ham.  The bad part is that the store will only allow one ham to be sold per coupon per purchase, and as I want at least three to can, I will be seeing more of my friendly neighborhood bus driver than I care to.  But then, strawberries are on sale this week, too.  My supply of strawberry jam has dwindled over the winter, so I can buy enough for two or three batches of jam and enough to freeze a few containers for later.  They will be really good over ice cream this summer.Looks like rain is headed my way today.  It is a good day to give these old arthritic bones a bit of a rest.  I'm working on finishing up the last of the crocheted granny squares for the afghan I'm making for oldest granddaughter.  That turned into a bigger project than originally planned, but it is for my granddaughter.  She is worth the extra time and effort.And later I will dive head first into an 1800's murder mystery.  I love those old mystery stories.  There are all sorts of twists and turns in the plot and the descriptions transport me back in time.  And that is a pretty good place to be on a rainy Sunday afternoon."},

Usually I treat myself to a meal out once a month about the time my check arrives.  I decided to skip that treat in favor of a few grocery items I had been craving.  Bananas.  Grapes - two varieties.  And my new love - bacon flavored crackers.  Yes, I know.  They aren't good for me.  I don't care.  They are good.  With cheese.  If they kill me, I will die happy.After the groceries were put away, Jessie Jane and I went for a walk down along the river.  I thought for sure it would overflow its banks this year, what with all of the snow we had, but although the water level is high, it has a ways to go before flooding.  I am always grateful that whoever planned this town had the good sense to build far enough up the hill above the river so the flood waters never reach us.And now I'm off to tackle the pile of laundry that kind of got away from me while I was a bit under the weather.  And I sometimes think the weather can bring on bouts of illness.  Especially if a person is cooped up for months at a time.  I know that all it took for me to get back to normal were a couple of warm, sunny days.Oh, yeah.  Peeps.  I bought Peeps.  Just because I could!"},

{"title": "Morning Musings", "date": "Friday, April 4, 2014", "text": "Woke up this morning a wee bit before 5 o'clock.  Went to the windows facing the street to see what kind of gifts Mother Nature had left.  It was still snowing lightly.  There appeared to be between 6 and 8 inches of snow, judging by what was piled on top of cars and on the roofs of the buildings.Looking at the snow reminded me of the last job I worked before retirement.  I liked the job itself, for I spent my day working with dogs.  But I liked it even better for the fact that it was located next door and I didn't have to try to start a freezing cold car, scrape ice and snow off the car windshield and windows or fight the morning commuter traffic.In the winter after a snowfall, I would go to work early, grab a shovel and clear the sidewalk of snow.  Some days it was an easy job of sweeping.  Other days like today, when the snow is wet and heavy and especially if it was deep, it was a job for a much younger person.  But you know how it is when you are pretending that you really aren't getting old.  You do it anyway and pay later.This morning I can admire the beauty of the snow by looking out my window.  Instead of being outside shoveling, I am still in my jammies, coffee cup in hand, thanking the good Lord that I don't have to do that any more.  I love retirement.Lily the Yorkie, the one who was so sick, has recovered nicely.  She is back to her bouncy self, barking at the snow removal equipment in the street below.  But since being sick she has, for reasons known only to her, decided that I can not be out of her line of vision.  If I go to the kitchen, she is right behind me.  If I am at my desk, she is standing next to my chair with her little paws on my leg.  If I am in my recliner reading, she is curled up at my feet.  I keep my bedroom door closed, for the other one, Jessie Jane, will sneak in and potty on the rug if given the opportunity.  Can't break her of that nasty habit.  So when I go to my bedroom and shut the door behind me, Lily stands outside the door and raises all sorts of a fuss.  She is needy.I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.  I do not like forced inactivity.  Yesterday I was still experiencing cold chills, but I had slept all that I possibly could.  So I wrapped myself in my fuzzy blanket, plopped myself down in front of my computer and dug into my genealogy program.  I still have lots of information to enter.  For some, the study of generations past is dry as dust.  For me, it is fun to learn about those ancestors of mine.  As I worked on transcribing past census records I found that one great-great-great aunt ran a hotel in a small Minnesota town.  Many were farmers.  One branch of the family moved from Minnesota to Washington and Oregon, where they held a variety of jobs.  And another spent her last years in an Alms House, which I found sad.  The entering of information into my program is tedious, but the detective work to find that information is fascinating.  I think that we are the sum total of those who came before us.  I want my children and grandchildren to know who they are.So I will take it easy over the weekend, doing what needs to be done but refraining from starting any big projects.  The local weatherman tells me that by Monday the sun will shine and the temperature will get into the mid-sixty degree range.  By that time I will either be well again or stark raving insane from inactivity.  I vote for well."},

{"title": "Think About the Pets", "date": "Saturday, March 29, 2014", "text": "I got to thinking the other day about how we are so accustomed to having the services we need only an email, text or phone call away.  But what would we do if this changed.In my case, it concerned the care of my dogs.  Twice a year I take them next door to my friend, the dog groomer.  They are given baths, hair cuts, the excess hair is removed from inside their ears and their nails are trimmed.One of my Yorkies, Jessie Jane, has weird nails.  The quick (the part inside the nail that has nerves and blood vessels) grows unnaturally long, so her nails can never be trimmed short.  Cutting into the quick causes pain and bleeding.  So as her nails grow, they curl sideways.  This doesn't seem to bother her or slow her down any.  Until yesterday.Jessie Jane was holding up one of her front paws when she came out of her kennel for her morning cookie.  So as soon as she ate her treat, I picked her up and checked her paw.  Sure enough.  One of her nails had gotten so long that it was poking the adjoining pad on her foot.Like most people, my first thought was to call the groomer and make an appointment to get Jessie's nails cut.  But then I got to thinking, what if I didn't have access to a groomer.  What would I do?I don't have a proper nail trimming tool, but I do have a small wire snipper.  So I got it out and carefully trimmed the offending nail as well as the rest of them on that foot.  It wasn't a professional looking job, but she could run without pain, and that was what I wanted.I am big on having a variety of foods on hand - store bought, home canned and dehydrated.  I have extra water stored.  I either have or plan on buying in the near future, alternative methods of cooking, heating at least one room of my apartment and light sources.  But, shame on me, aside from stocking up on food and water for them, I hadn't thought ahead for the care of my fuzzy buddies who share my life.So this weekend I will do the research to see what I should have on hand for their proper care.  And next week I will go to a pet supply store that I trust to have good quality merchandise, and buy a nail trimmer, a good quality clipper for hair cuts, and whatever other supplies I need.  There may come a time when I won't have a veterinarian three blocks away as I do now, so I need to think along the lines of what to have on hand should they become sick, as Lily was the past couple of weeks, or injured.Our pets give us so much.  They love us even when we are not lovable.  They are glad to see us even when we are cranky.  They only ask to be fed, have clean water and occasional pets, snuggles and belly rubs.  I will still take them to the vet when needed.  But if the time comes when that's not possible, I want to be able to do the very best for them that I can.  They deserve no less than that."},
{"title": "Sometimes No News is Good News", "date": "Friday, March 28, 2014", "text": "I think I need to stay away from news reports for a little while.  Both mainstream, although I pay little attention to it anyway, and the alternative news sources I read daily.  I think my brain is on overload.  And about to explode.The Democrats are sniping at the Republicans and the Republicans are taking pot shots at the Democrats.  Neither one is doing anything constructive.  But they are blowing enough hot air to bring on real global warming.There are Congressional Investigative Committees questioning various and assorted witnesses about many of the latest scandals.  The Congressmen thump their chests, pound their desks and make speeches designed to make the public think they actually care.  After which they stand in front of the news reporters and pontificate, throw stones at the other political party and express outrage.  But nothing changes.  Next week most people, whose attention span is similar to that of a gnat, will have forgotten all about that particular scandal and will be more interested in their favorite TV sitcom character or sports team than they are in the fact that everything they say or do is now recorded and stored.  To keep them safe. The king of America who lives in the White House continues to thumb his nose at the Constitution.  The pundits continue to offer up their opinions on panel discussions.  And promote their latest book.  Nobody dares call the President out on his lawlessness for fear of being labeled racist.  Or audited.  And nothing changes.Although once in a great while there is a glimmer of hope, as in the state of Georgia, where legislation was passed that contains pro-gun reforms.  But then there is my state of Minnesota, who is working to pass legislation to take guns away from those involved in domestic abuse.  Those promoting this bill say that abusers \"don't deserve to own a gun.\"  Now, I have no sympathy for abusers of any kind.  But my question is this:  Who will be the next group who \"don't deserve\" gun ownership?  Will it be the bloggers who write articles that question this country's leadership?  Will it be the veterans who, while in service of their country have seen things that now give them nightmares?  Will it be the person who has been under a doctor's care for depression?  Who is next?And then there is the Obamacare train wreck.  And don't forget the Russians who are busy rattling their sabers.I think I will, for a while, confine my reading to the blogs listed on the right.  Even though many of those folks address issues concerning the horrors going on around us and the major loss of our freedoms, they also provide helpful information on how we can survive this mess.  Some have offered good advice on various problems that have come up in my life.  Others show me tasty foods and how to prepare them.  Some take me on wonderful trips down memory lane or show me the beauty of nature in their corner of the world.  And still others just make me laugh.Yep.  I think that is the game plan for a while.  I will never bury my head in the sand, for I do need to be aware of what's coming at us.  And I will never be like so many who blithely skip through life, pretending that everything is just fine and of course, nothing bad could ever happen here.  But sometimes I just need to back off for a time.  Before I become totally overwhelmed.  And completely frustrated with government insanity.  Or at least until my head is no longer in danger of blowing up."},

Beat in 2 cups of flour until smooth.  Then stir in flour, one cup at a time.  Turn out on a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes.  (Don't cheat.  10 minutes.)  The dough should be fairly soft but not sticky, and should be smooth and satiny to the touch.Grease a large bowl.  Place dough in bowl, turning so all sides are coated.  Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in size.  Punch down.  Form 2 loaves and place in greased bread pans.  Let rise again until doubled in size.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes or until a deep golden brown.Turn bread out onto cooling racks.  Brush sides, top and bottom with melted butter.  Let cool completely.  (Except for the heel of one of the loaves.  Cut that off while the bread is still warm, slather it with butter, and enjoy!)I doubled the recipe and got four nice sized loaves.  Three went into the freezer and part of the fourth was for supper.That bread came out just as soft as any good bakery bread.  The crusts were soft as well.  Often homemade bread will be a bit dry the next day.  This stayed soft.So this morning I used the same recipe, doubling it, and made buns and cinnamon rolls.  As with the bread, I brushed the tops with melted butter as soon as they came out of the oven.  I froze most of them, but kept out enough for a couple of meals.  Both the buns and the cinnamon rolls are soft and delicious.I can see no reason to use any other white bread recipe.  I am just amazed at how good this bread is.  I'm going to experiment a little bit and see if I can't adapt the recipe for wheat bread.Thus endeth the bread making posts.  Amen."},

Grease cookie sheet.Cut butter into flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt in large bowl, using pastry blender, until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Stir in raisins and just enough buttermilk so dough leaves side of bowl.Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead 1 to 2 minutes or until smooth. Shape into round loaf, about 6 1/2 inches in diameter. Place on cookie sheet. Cut an X shape about 1/2 inch deep through loaf with floured knife.Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until golden brown. Brush with butter or margarine, softened, if desired.Legend has it that the X cut into the top serves to ward off evil spirits.  I cut in the X.  I'm taking no chances!I am not fond of buttermilk so I always use the lemon juice method substitution for baking.  I may have to see if I can find some powdered buttermilk to keep on hand.  Keeping fresh milk requires trips to the grocery, so I use powdered milk for everything except drinking.The Irish soda bread turned out great.  It is heavier than yeast bread - kind of a cross between bread and biscuit.  Or maybe like a crusty artisan bread.  At any rate, it works for toast in my little toaster oven, for sandwiches and for just plain eating with a meal.  Some add raisins to the recipe, but I wanted it for use in place of a yeast loaf.  I may try it with raisins the next time I make it.  Soda bread isn't something I would make on an every day basis, but it served my purpose for quick bread to last until I make regular yeast bread tomorrow morning.I love it when a plan comes together."},

And I would be kinda lost without her.After the fire in my building last summer, new smoke detectors were installed throughout the building.  I hate them.My apartment is laid out with the living room on one end, bedroom on the other, with the kitchen in between.  Because of the building codes, there is a smoke alarm in the kitchen and another in the bedroom.  There is about 4 feet of space between the two.  I know.  Makes no sense.  Building codes are a government invention and therefore don't have to make sense.The smoke alarm in the kitchen goes off whenever I open my oven door while said oven is in use.  It goes off when I fry potatoes for supper.  It goes off when I boil water.  It goes off whenever I use the stove at all.  This is annoying, both to me and my neighbors.  I finally reached my breaking point.  I ripped the thing from the ceiling.  Took out the battery.  Set the alarm on a shelf.  Capped off the wires on the ceiling and called it good.All was peaceful in my little apartment.  I could bake bread, cook supper and boil water for coffee without the ear-shattering screech from the alarm.  I still was protected by the smoke alarm in my bedroom and another in the hallway, right outside my kitchen door.  Life went back to being fairly pleasant.  It remained so for several weeks.And then, in the middle of the night, I was awakened by a BEEP and a feminine voice telling me, \"No battery.\"  I grumbled, rolled over and was nearly asleep again when BEEP, \"No battery\" again assaulted my ears.  Every half hour the smoke alarm informed me that it needed a battery.  Dawn was just breaking when I picked up the offending alarm, opened my closet door and stuffed the thing into a box and covered it with two bags full of yarn.  Closed the closet door.  Breathed a sigh of relief.  And then heard a distinct BEEP \"No battery.\"About that time I passed from annoyed right on to lunatic.  Pulled open the closet door.  Tossed the bags of yarn out of the way.  Grabbed the smoke alarm and headed for the living room.  I wrapped the alarm in a blanket.  I could still hear it, with the added feature that it set the dogs to barking whenever it went BEEP \"No battery,\" which it was doing every couple of minutes now.  Got a comforter from the closet and wrapped it around the alarm and the blanket.  BEEP \"No battery,\" bark, bark, bark.  Took the quilt I keep on the back of my couch, wrapped the whole works up in it and waited.Silence.So now I have this huge ball of blanket, comforter and quilt all rolled up around the alarm, living behind my recliner until I see my landlord again.  I can deal with that, as long as it doesn't go BEEP \"No battery.\"  My poor landlord has twice already tried to fix the problem, and obviously the smoke alarm is not to be denied.  I'm thinking maybe a bucket of water or possibly a well placed shotgun blast....."},

There was an apparent suicide in one hotel room and a murder in another.There were several arrests on outstanding warrants and the usual traffic tickets. There are skyways either two or three stories up from ground level that connect some buildings downtown, to make it easier for people to get from one place to another in the winter.  There was a fellow who was happily urinating here, there and everywhere in the skyway.  He was hauled to the nearest hospital for evaluation.There were several calls, in that hour's time, for assaults and complaints about drunks.But the last one I heard before I found some soothing music to listen to, took the cake.  A woman called from a bus stop in downtown Minneapolis.  She called 911 because she had a cockroach stuck in her ear.My sheltered life - its looking pretty darned good to me."},

Wasn't much of a stretch to decide that the place to be today is in my warm and snug apartment as opposed to navigating the icy sidewalks.  I can't say that I am surprised at the weather Mother Nature is sending our way.  March has a way of teasing us with warmth and sunshine only to do an about face and dump snow on us.  On the up side, when Spring finally does arrive, it is heavenly.  And our Autumn is glorious.  Gives me something to look forward to.After a relaxing lazy day of mostly reading, I spent my weekend attending to those chores that always need attention.  The laundry is done, the kitchen floor scrubbed to within an inch of it's life, the bathroom sparkling.  Well, maybe not sparkling, but as clean as a bathroom in an old building can be.I spent some time rearranging my two shelving units that hold my home canned goods.  After mostly living off those shelves this winter, I needed to see what I was running low on.  Within my line of vision are 21 cases of empty canning jars, both pint and quart size.  There are another 5 cases of half pint jars stacked elsewhere.  I get most of my vegetables from the Farmer's Market in late summer and fall, but I can start canning meat any time.  I seem to use a lot of hamburger and turkey, so those are on my shopping list.  A couple of years ago I canned some meatballs and they were delicious, so I want to do more of those.  I also seem to use the canned bacon and sausage often, so more jars of those are planned.So if the snow and ice ever goes away and I can go out without slipping and sliding, I will be busy."},

{"title": "Level-2 Lookalike Firearm", "date": "Saturday, March 8, 2014", "text": "I'm pretty sure by now most of you have read about the 10 year old boy in Ohio who was suspended from elementary school for three days for brandishing a \"level-2 lookalike firearm.\"  And what was this horrific weapon?It was the kid's hand, thumb upright and index finger extended.It is official.  The world around us has completely taken leave of it's senses.The longer we allow this stupidity to continue, the more we are losing our ability to defend ourselves.  I am not advocating shooting up the streets as if we lived in the Old West.  But when children are taught that any reference to guns is terribly wrong, we are creating a generation of wusses who will not only drink the Kool-aid but will passively line up for the privilege.Those who wish to see all firearms removed are strong advocates of calling 911 for help when the bad guys break into our homes.  Let me tell you a little story about how well that works.Close to six years ago, on a mild summer evening, I walked the two blocks to our local library.  When I returned about an hour later, I found my husband laying on our bed, and he wasn't breathing.  I grabbed the phone, called 911 and started CPR.  According to the clock in my bedroom, it took over 15 minutes for the first officers to arrive.I have nothing but good things to say about our police department.  They were kind and courteous.  They kept me informed about what the paramedics were doing to help my husband, and when it was obvious that all attempts to revive him had failed, they were gentle and kind in telling me.  In the following days, one of the officers made a point to check on me to see that I was doing alright.  One of these same officers rescued my dogs last summer when an apartment in my building caught fire.My point is this.  It took over 15 minutes to respond to a 911 call for a man who wasn't breathing.  I now live alone.  It wouldn't take much to kick in an apartment door.  How much damage do you suppose someone could do to my home and to me in 15 minutes time if I were deprived of the means to defend myself.When my kids were young, there were gun safety classes for those who wanted to hunt.  I don't know if those classes still exist.  If they don't, we should be teaching our children how to safely handle a firearm, taking them out to practice and seeing to it that they understand that a gun is a tool - for adding to the family's supply of meat - for defending our homes and our loved ones from those who want to hurt us or take from us what we have earned. If we don't find a way to stop the insanity of punishing children for any reference to guns, we might as well crawl into bed, pull the covers over our heads and wait to die.  These kids are the future defenders of our families and our nation.  I want my grandchildren to know how to defend themselves.  I don't want them to come to harm because help was too far away.  I want them to be the strong, capable individuals that I know they can be.  And I surely don't want them so conditioned to be afraid that they wet themselves when they see a gun."},

{"title": "Thoughts at 3:45 AM", "date": "Wednesday, March 5, 2014", "text": "Once in a while I will find myself awake in the wee hours of the morning, unable to fall asleep again.  Sometimes I will curl up with a book and read until I am tired again.  Other times I will make a cup of cocoa, sip it at my kitchen table and let my mind wander.  Many times that wandering takes me back in time.This morning I got to thinking about life in the late 1950's and early 1960's when I was lucky enough to be living in a big old farmhouse.  I suppose because a basket of dirty clothes awaits my attention later this morning, I got to thinking about how the task of washing and drying clothes has changed since then.After we moved to the farm, Dad replaced our old wringer washer with a new to us, improved automatic model.  This wonder of modern technology sat in our basement.  By the time I was about 12 years old, Mother's arthritis had progressed to where the basement stairs were becoming a problem for her and hauling a basket full of wet clothes out to the clothes line in the back yard was impossible.  A clothes dryer wasn't within our financial reach.  As the oldest child, laundry became my responsibility.At that time, most folks hung the wash out to dry in the spring, summer and fall.  Some continued this practice in the winter, letting clothes freeze-dry on the clothes lines.  Our back yard was always drifted full of snow, so lines were strung in the basement.  I was always grateful that I didn't have to stand outside in the freezing cold to hang up the wash.Most clothes dried wrinkled, which meant that ironing was necessary.  The steam iron may have been in existence then, but not at our house.  Mom's electric iron provided heat only.  The steam came from sprinkling the clothes.  Does anyone remember what this is?The soda bottle was filled with water.  The sprinkler part was wedged into the top of the bottle, and the salt shaker type holes allowed tiny drops of water to be sprinkled over each piece of clothing, which was then rolled up and placed in a heavy plastic bag.  By the next day, the water had made the clothes just damp enough to be able to iron out the wrinkles.  But woe be to the person who let the bag of damp clothes sit too long before ironing, for mildew would form inside the bag.  Don't ask me how I know this.There was another invention that made ironing day a bit easier.  Anybody ever seen these?The metal pants stretchers were inserted into the legs of a pair of pants and then were adjusted so the fabric fit tight over them.  After the pants dried, the stretchers were removed and it only took a bit of touch-up with the iron to get them looking good enough to meet Mother's exacting requirements.  I hated ironing.  I loved pants stretchers.Guess I won't be complaining much about tossing dirty clothes into the washers in my building, or about drying them in the dryers.  I have a little cart on wheels to haul laundry up and down the stairs to the laundry room in the basement.  I usually don't need to iron anything.  I don't have to use sprinkler bottles or pants stretchers.  Life is pretty darned good."},

I especially like this gravy mix because I can use it for several different dishes.  Sometimes I make just the gravy to have over mashed potatoes.  I use it to thicken chicken stew.  It works as a substitute for cream of whatever soup in casseroles.  There are probably other uses for it that I haven't experimented with as yet.When I stir up a batch of gravy mix, I usually quadruple the recipe and store it in jars or freezer bags.  It is just one of those mixes that is nice to have on hand."},

{"title": "Necessity.....", "date": "Wednesday, February 26, 2014", "text": "is the mother of invention, so I'm told.This winter has been a bugger.  About the time I think I will venture out, the temperature drops and the snow falls and the wind blows.  I just don't do cold well at all.  I admit it.  I am wimpy when it comes to frostbite.This past summer and fall I screwed up - sort of.  I concentrated on canning meat and Farmer's Market produce.  I also spent time building up my stock of dehydrated vegetables.  I'm glad I did, for I have been eating from those stores all winter.  But what I neglected were the foods that I need to purchase.  I thought that I could get those things over the winter.  We had such mild winters the past several years that I foolishly believed this winter would be no different.  Nope.   Didn't happen.So since I haven't been able to get out and about as I would like to, I decided to get creative.My dogs love treats.  I am nearly out of them.  I usually buy the little boxes of doggie treats.  I know that they will survive without treats, but the pooches give me so much enjoyment that it seems only fair to give some happiness back to them.  The recipe I have used before when I make treats calls for oatmeal and eggs, both of which I have been out of for a while.  This recipe requires neither.Peanut Butter Dog Treats2 Tablespoons Vegetable Oil1/2 Cup Peanut Butter1 Cup Water3 Cups FlourMix all ingredients together to form a dough.Roll out the dough and cut into long strips, then into the size of treat you want.Place the treats close to each other on a baking sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.I made a batch this morning.  The dogs love them.  And they don't cost as much as the store-bought treats.  Win - win.I am not a huge breakfast eater, but I do like a little something in the morning with my coffee.  Usually I make a couple of eggs with toast.  Or an occasional cookie or three.  But since I am out of eggs that wasn't going to happen, so I tried this recipe I found on katzcradul's YouTube channel.  She has lots of recipes and gardening and canning videos and common sense preparedness information.  The following is word for word.SAUSAGE-CHEESE BISCUITS1 pound bulk pork sausage2 cups all purpose flour (can use 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 white)5 tablespoons lard (or other solid fat)2 tablespoons baking powder1 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon baking soda1/2 teaspoon garlic powder1/2 teaspoon onion powder1 cup grated cheddar cheese - mild or sharp1 cup buttermilk (more or less to make a very sticky dough)Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cook sausage in skillet, breaking apart into little pieces, just until barely done. Drain and discard sausage grease. Chill flour and fat if possible. Stir dry ingredients together. Mix fat into flour until it resembles course cornmeal. Add cheese and sausage to flour. Stir in buttermilk, just until all of the dry ingredients are moistened. Drop by heaping tablespoons onto lined or greased baking sheet(s). Bake for approximately 15 minutes or until tops are slightly browned. Remove from oven. Place on a rack to cool, and prevent bottoms from getting soft. Eat immediately or store in an airtight container. Leftover biscuits must be refrigerated or frozen. Enjoy!I made me a batch this morning.  They are to die for.  I used bacon grease that I keep in my fridge and crumbled bulk sausage I had canned this past fall.  I didn't have buttermilk as I keep only powdered milk on hand, so I made some up and used that, and they turned out fine.Some say when life hands you lemons, make lemonade.  I have never been one to follow the crowd, so I make dog treats and sausage cheese biscuits instead.  And I think I remember a recipe from an old cookbook on cooking during wartime, when supplies were rationed, for a cake made without eggs.I think I'm on a roll!"},

Come to think of it, I may be right on target in that case."},

I made a huge mistake in underestimating the power of this storm.  I tend to forget that because I live in town, surrounded by two and three story buildings, that the effects of snow and wind are not always as obvious as they are out in open country.   Or in the residential areas.  This photo was posted on Facebook this morning by my children's aunt, after she had shoveled a path from her house to the street.  She lives a bit closer to the city than I do.This morning there is still a bit of wind, but much lighter than yesterday, and the sun is shining.  There is a small army of city workers out clearing the sidewalks, and the plow has made one pass down the street in front of my building.  I don't know how much snow we got, but the ledge outside my window, which is about 18 inches wide and runs the width of the building, has about a foot of snow on it.I long for violets and lilacs."},

Close to 1 AM they both went to bed for the night.  I looked out the window.  Snow was falling.  The wind was blowing.  The storm had arrived and all was well in their world.This morning it is still snowing.  The wind is still blowing, but not as strong as last night.  According to the Doppler Radar website, it looks like the storm will move on in another few hours, followed by sunshine.  The police scanner is fairly quiet.  My kids went to work early to beat the traffic, and reported no problems with the roads.  Oldest son, who lives SW of me, says the roads are bad in his area, but he made it home OK after his night job.  I heard a rumor that temps are supposed to be in the low 40's tomorrow.  I like it."},

Schooners were often seen and once at least we saw a square rigger come around the point. When the bay froze over it made a wonderful skating rink which was taken advantage of by most of the older children in town as well as many of the grown ups.\"My grandfather would have been 10 years old that winter.  I could only think how wonderful it must have been for him to witness those sailing ships, in and out of the harbor.  In another piece written by my grandfather, that I can't lay my hands on at the moment, he tells about the bay at Duluth freezing and about how much fun it was to ice skate around the big ships that were frozen into the ice in the harbor.I don't know as I would like to go back to live at that time, but seeing the sailing ships and the pleasure of ice skating in the harbor appeals to me.  Life was so much more simple then.  That appeals to me the most."},
{"title": "Pollyanna or Debbie Downer", "date": "Friday, February 14, 2014", "text": "Some people are Pollyanna types.  They skip through life, smiles on their faces, seeing nothing but good wherever they look.  Others are in the Debbie Downer category.  Everything is bad and we are all doomed.  I think I fit somewhere between the two.  I have lived long enough and am not naive enough to believe that life is all magic fairy dust and unicorns.  But I do know that there are still good people out there, doing the best that they can with what they have to work with. I also don't take everything I read about at face value.  I know that some conspiracy theories are just that - theories.  If I read an article on Drudge that would have many heading for the hills, I check out the sources.  I find out if it is true or just another rumor.  If I read a rant and it is believable, I check that out as well before forming my own opinion.  And if the source of that article or rant is a politician, I am especially diligent in finding the truth, for the politicians are few and far between who have the good of the people at heart.  I find that most have their own agenda which includes, above all else, winning the next election and holding onto power.That being said, I find that since the first of this year, I have had a strong feeling that things are a bit off-kilter.Merriam‑Webster Dictionary\\off -ˈkil-ter\\. : not perfectly balanced or even. : different from the ordinary, usual, or expected.It has nothing to do with politics.  I mean, the Democrats are blaming the Republicans for our troubles, and the Republicans are in turn, blaming the Democrats.  Business as usual in Washington.  I have gotten so I pay very little attention, for when all the posturing and bluster is over, nothing really changes.  Hasn't for years, except possibly they are more obnoxious.  That, and the fact that the word \"truth\" is pretty much foreign to them.  No, it's not that.The pundants, experts and talk radio hosts are full of dire predictions.  I have been leery of predictions since my old computer rolled over from 1999 to 2000 without a hiccup.  Those folks are expressing opinions, and if they have facts to back them up, I need to see those facts before I believe.  So, no.  It's not that.I think it is the little things.  Like the box of bacon ends and pieces I buy to can.  Was the same price for a long time and a month ago the price went up $1 a box.  Much of what I buy has drastically gone up in price lately. I think it has to do with seeing people at the grocery store buying staples in quantity the way I do.  There are still those who fill carts with chips and soda, but I see more with carts full of sale items. I think it is hearing people I know talk about their grown children moving back home because they just can't afford to live any other way. I think it is others I know of who have reputations of being people who are not afraid of hard work, but yet can't find a decent job.But most of all, it is that little nagging voice that tells me if I don't get off my duff and get done what I need to do, I will soon be in a world of hurt.  I have gotten lazy.  I have used the excuse of a hard winter.  I have used the excuse of arthritic joints to keep me inside doing the things I find pleasant and fun, and ignoring the tasks that aren't so much fun and that need doing but I keep putting off.So with that in mind, I am taking the weekend off to get busy.  I have a closet that is full to overflowing with stuff.  I don't need all that stuff, so out it goes...some to the trash and some to Goodwill (I am never, ever going to fit into those slacks I have been hanging onto, and where on earth did that sparkly jacket come from.  It is so not me.)  I have a list of the groceries I need to fill the shelves in my closet pantry.  The bus doesn't run on weekends, so Monday morning I need to begin ferrying food from the store shelves to my pantry.  I am getting low on some home canned food, like hamburger, chili and soups.  I have a stack of canning jars that is taller than I am, waiting to be filled.  Time to just do it.Sometimes I feel like I am waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I know I can't change anything that may happen.  I am convinced that all the petitions, emails and phone calls to congressmen have little if any effect.  So the other shoe will drop, no matter what.  What I can do is be ready for it."},
{"title": "Cutting Hair", "date": "Thursday, February 13, 2014", "text": "I was reading some of my favorite blogs the other day, when I noticed Rob of Rob in His Bunker had written about home haircuts.  I was reminded of the one and only time I gave my boys haircuts.  At the time we lived about 20 miles from the closest town.  When you are pinching pennies, you don't drive a 40 mile round trip just for a haircut.  And in the winter, it was a toss up as to whether the road past our house would be drifted in or not.  So home haircuts seemed like a good idea.My mother cut my hair the whole time I was growing up.  She cut my sister's hair.  She cut my aunt's hair.  She cut the neighbor's hair.  She didn't have a clipper.  She used a scissors.  How hard can it be, I thought.So I set my boys on chairs out in the yard.  Tied those big white flour sack dishtowels around their necks to keep hair clippings from falling down inside their shirts.  And I proceeded to cut.Well, that didn't look quite right, so I cut some more.That side was just a tiny bit longer than the other side, so I cut some more.Maybe if I take a little more off the back it will be OK.When I finally admitted defeat, both boys looked like a weed whacker had been at their heads.I loaded them into the car, drove the 40 mile round trip and got them professional haircuts.

{"title": "What Happened?", "date": "Tuesday, February 11, 2014", "text": "Most of the time I like to have something to listen to while going about the daily household chores.  If I am moving about between rooms, indoors and out, my choice is music.  But if I am working on something that requires me to be fairly stationary,  I like a good story for company.  I have downloaded dozens of audio comedy and mystery books and a whole passel of old time radio shows.  But I wanted something a bit different.  I came across a YouTube channel where the author had uploaded an audio version of the Little House on the Prairie books.  I had bought this series for my children when they were young, and I think I enjoyed reading them as much as the kids did.  So far I have listened to three of them, and am starting on the fourth.While listening to these stories written by the woman who lived them as a child, I am struck by the huge differences in the way people lived, then and now. Those people grew their own vegetables.  If they didn't, it would be a very long, cold winter without food.  Even those who lived in towns planted vegetable gardens.  The last time I rode the bus before the snow fell, I looked into all of the back yards I passed during that one hour ride, and I saw not even one garden spot.  My son is probably the only one in his neighborhood who raises vegetables.  In other cities, town councils punish those who have gardens in their yards instead of grass.  What happened?Those people abhorred the notion of being beholden to anyone.  If they didn't have the cash, they didn't buy, but made do with what they had.  Or they were more apt to trade work for the desired item.  You went to help your neighbor roof his barn, and he came and helped you dig your well.  It all worked out and nobody owed anybody anything.  Today, we whip out the plastic and buy what we want - not just what we need.  We wind up owing tens of thousands of dollars.  And it doesn't seem to phase us one bit, because we keep on doing it.  What happened?Those people took care of their own.  When someone came around with evil intent, if the family dog didn't chase him off, the homesteader did, usually with buckshot.  I just read about a man who caught someone in his home, trying to steal his possessions.  The homeowner pulled a gun and chased the burglar off.  The police arrested the homeowner for having a gun.  The burglar then sued the homeowner.  What happened?Those people had well mannered, well behaved children, for the most part.  Children were taught to respect their elders.  They were given chores to do and were expected to do them without complaint.  If they disobeyed their parents, the quickly learned that actions have consequences.  Children didn't need to be entertained.  They made their own fun.  The dipped their toes in the creek and hunted for minnows.  They fished from the banks of the river.  They went sliding down hills in wintertime, or skating across the surface of the frozen lake.  They built forts in the woods or just layed on their backs in the grass and watched the clouds float by.  They had all of nature for their playground.  Today, kids aren't happy unless they are plugged into something, be it computer games or music or anything that requires a remote.  And parents are quick to supply these diversions, for they act as babysitters.  Or if a child is active, they are quickly medicated.  What happened?I think I know what happened, but some days I just find it too sad to even think about and other days I become angry thinking about what we have lost.  I realize that the times I am talking about were well over 100 years ago.  And I know that there are still good people out there with those same old-fashioned values.  I just wish that there were more of us who cared about those values.  I think then, our modern world would be a much nicer place to live."},

{"title": "Learn Everything", "date": "Saturday, February 8, 2014", "text": "I have been reading for some time that schools are backing away from teaching cursive writing.  I happen to think that is a mistake.I am interested in genealogy.  I spend quite a bit of my time searching through census records for clues to my ancestors.  I can access records online from 1850 to 1940.  Once in a while I will find a census that is filled out using hand printed letters.  But nearly all were hand written - in cursive - by the census taker, who went door to door to gather the information.  The census tells me where my ancestors were living in a given year, how many of the children were living at home, which ones had married and started families of their own.  Many of the pages tell me if my ancestors owned their land, the state or country where they were born as well as their parent's origins, and what they were doing to make a living.  I would be totally wasting my time if I couldn't read the census pages.Another source of information for me are old letters that my parents saved over the years.  I found this postcard in my Grandmother's Bible.My father had sent it to her when he and his brother arrived in Helena, Montana - traveling from Minnesota - to look for work during the Depression.  He reports that both had found jobs picking potatoes, and that she shouldn't write to them because he didn't know how long they would be there.  If I couldn't read cursive, it would be gibberish to me and I wouldn't know what my father and his brother had done to earn money for the family.I found this letter among my Dad's things.  It was written to him by his mother, who was visiting her oldest daughter and her family.  This is the first page of a three-page letter.If I couldn't read cursive, I wouldn't know that Grandma had a sense of humor.  I was only 9 years old when she died, and I don't remember her humor.  She says that everybody there has colds except herself and Lois (her daughter).  She goes on to say that maybe they are too ornery to take on a cold or too slow to catch one.  Then she tells about seeing a bear come out of the woods at the edge of the yard and she speculates that had Lois' husband or son been there, they would have shot it.So much of the material that I transcribe to enter in my genealogy program is hand written in cursive.  I don't transcribe all of the letters or stories that I have found, but place them into binders.  I have no idea if any of my grandkids will develop an interest in family history.  But if they do, are they going to be able to read about their ancestors if the material hasn't been entered in a computer?Personally, I believe it is important to know who those people were who came before.  We are the sum of all of them, and if the grandkids don't learn the basics, how on earth are they going to know who or where they came from.  I hope they learn Everything that they can.  It would be a terrible shame if they were dumbed down so much that they have no clue about those who contributed to who they are now."},

No one knows for sure how old he was, since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape.He will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as:- Knowing when to come in out of the rain;- Why the early bird gets the worm;- Life isn't always fair;- And maybe it was my fault.Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend more than you can earn) and reliable strategies (adults, not children, are in charge).His health began to deteriorate rapidly when well-intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place. Reports of a 6-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch; and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition.Common Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the job that they themselves had failed to do in disciplining their unruly children.Common Sense lost the will to live as the churches became businesses; and criminals received better treatment than their victims.Common Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the burglar could sue you for assault.Common Sense finally gave up the will to live, after a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilled a little in her lap, and was promptly awarded a huge settlement.Common Sense was preceded in death,-by his parents, Truth and Trust,-by his wife, Discretion,-by his daughter, Responsibility,-and by his son, Reason.He is survived by his 5 stepbrothers;- I Know My Rights- I Want It Now-Someone Else Is To Blame- I'm A Victim- Pay me for Doing NothingNot many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone.\"I don't suppose there is any way to resurrect Common Sense from the dead.  We surely could use him now."},
{"title": "Overheard on the Bus", "date": "Thursday, February 6, 2014", "text": "Riding a bus is sometimes boring, except for the fact that most of the drivers come equipped with a good sense of humor.  So some days we trade jokes or laugh at the silliness around us.  Other days it is fun to just sit back and listen to the conversations around me.The other day, one conversation sort of peaked my interest.  Mostly because of the fact that, as you all know, I am deeply into preparing for any future problems.  There were two 30-something women sitting right behind me, talking, but not trying to keep from being overheard.  Yes, I eavesdropped.  So sue me.One of the women was talking about her sister.  She said she was getting worried about her.  She said that she had gone to her sister's house.  Apparently her sister has a basement full of shelves.  The shelves are full of canned goods and toilet paper and buckets of sugar and flour and oatmeal and all sorts of stuff.  She just couldn't understand what was wrong with her sister that would make her stockpile all that stuff.  She thought sister had become a hoarder.Her friend thought that maybe the sister just thought that the grocery prices would go up because of the drought in the western states and she was buying up stuff before that happened.And the first woman said.......are you ready?.........wait for it.........\"Oh, that won't ever happen here.  Nothing will change.  That's just crazy.\" I am so proud of myself.  I resisted the urge to turn around and slap some sense into that woman.  But I really, really wanted to.I'd be willing to bet that when things get bad, she will be knocking on her sister's door, begging for something to eat.  God help those people who refuse to believe that things can change, sometimes overnight.  I'm pretty sure that the people of London didn't think anything would change just before the German Luftwaffe started dropping bombs on them during WWII.  And neither did the residents of San Francisco minutes before the earthquake of 1906 turned most of that city into burning rubble.  Same goes for the people of Japan on March 11, 2011, when the earthquake and tsunami caused thousands of deaths and the resulting meltdowns at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, the effects of which are still ongoing.I just don't understand the apathy.  Minutes later, these same women were talking about some TV show they had watched.  They spoke of the characters in the show like they were neighbors and friends.  Sorta creeped me out.I have pretty much given up trying to get people I know to understand the importance of preparing.  So many watched that National Geographic series, \"Doomsday Preppers,\" and think that anyone who stores food and supplies is a nut job who has an underground bunker and runs around shooting up the woods on weekends.  Or, like that woman on the bus, thinks that anyone with preps is a hoarder.  So I will just continue to do what I feel I should do to make sure my family is taken care of should a crisis situation arise.....and keep praying that it doesn't happen.  Sometimes, that's all we can do."},
{"title": "Mix It Up", "date": "Wednesday, February 5, 2014", "text": "So this morning I'm sitting at my kitchen table, cup of steaming coffee within reach, writing yet another list.  This time it is for groceries.  And this time I hope I remember to stick the list in my pocket as opposed to leaving it in the middle of my kitchen table like I usually do.I probably make my grocery list a bit differently than many of you do.  I make a list of things that I know will fit into my handy-dandy-little-old-lady shopping cart.  I no longer own a car.  I have a driver's license and I know how to drive.  I just don't want the debt of a car loan or the expense of insurance, upkeep and fuel.  So my little cart and I take the bus. I am getting low on things like brown sugar and powdered sugar.  Bags of those sugars take up cart space.  They also take up shelf space in a very small apartment.  My son brings me a 25 lb. bag of sugar now and then, which I store in buckets.  A jar of molasses takes up less space than does a bag of brown sugar.  So if I want brown sugar, I simply mix a scant tablespoon of molasses into a cup of granulated sugar.  Presto!  Brown sugar.  I usually make enough to fill the canister I keep it in.  When that runs low, I just make more.  If I want powdered sugar, I dump granulated sugar into my blender and let it go until I have powdered sugar.  Easy, peasy.I am slowly learning to make my own convenience type foods from the basic supplies I keep on hand.  For example, I like to have Bisquick on hand.  Boxes of Bisquick take up space in my cart.  I usually have the ingredients on hand, and the ingredients can be used for many more things besides Bisquick, so they are worth the cart space.  I use this recipe:Utah Ready-Quick Mix9 cups flour1/2 cup baking powder4 tsp. salt1-3/4 cups shortening1-3/4 cups non-fat dry milkMix the dry ingredients well.  Cut in the shortening until it resembles cornmeal.  I use a hand mixer for this.  Store in a freezer bag or air-tight container.  Works in any recipe calling for Bisquick.  It is way cheaper to make than to buy and works just as well as the premade.By making my own mixes, I can cart the basic groceries home and branch out from there.  And it is kind of fun to see what I can make rather than buy. But then, it takes very little to keep me amused!"},
{"title": "Grandma's Buns", "date": "Tuesday, February 4, 2014", "text": "Quite some time ago I made the mistake of posting pictures of the results of a marathon bread baking session.  Youngest son thought the bread, buns and cinnamon rolls looked so good, that he has asked me to make buns for family gatherings ever since.  I don't mind at all.  I'm glad my family enjoys what I make for them.If you have read any of my posts lately, you know that my grandkids made their first loaf of homemade bread last week.  This evening my son called.  He said that the kids ate up that loaf, right down to the last crumb.  And then they decided, as long as they love the buns I bring for holidays, they wanted to learn how to make them, too.  So I made Son a deal.  I would post the recipe and instructions for Grandma's Buns if he would send me pictures.  He agreed.  I didn't tell him that I would post it anyway.  I just wanted to remind him to take pictures!This recipe is the one Mother used when I was growing up.  I think she probably got it from her mother.  It is just a basic recipe, but it holds memories for me of coming home from school, walking in the door and smelling the beautiful smell of these buns, fresh from the oven.  Of course you have to eat at least one right away.  With enough butter so it drips a little bit down your chin.  It's the law.  At least in my family.This recipe came to me as just a list of ingredients.  Mother assumed that because she taught me to bake, that I would know how to put it all together.  I have added instructions for the grandkids, so they can learn as I did.Grandma's Buns(Recipe can be cut in half, or make as is and freeze some.)2 packages dry yeast dissolved in 1/2 cup warm water(Note:  one package of yeast equals 2-1/4 teaspoons of bulk yeast)2 teaspoons salt1/2 cup lard (can use shortening)2 cups milk, scalded1/2 cup sugar2 well beaten eggs7-8 cups flourInstructions:Sprinkle the yeast into the warm water and stir slightly with a fork.  Let stand for 10 minutes.Pour the milk into a sauce pan.  Heat it over medium heat until tiny bubbles start to form around the edge - do not boil.  Remove from the heat and add the lard (or shortening), salt and sugar.  Stir just enough to dissolve the sugar and salt - let stand until lukewarm.  The heat of the milk will melt the lard. In a large bowl, combine the yeast and milk mixture.  Beat in about three cups of flour. Using a fork, beat the eggs in a small bowl and stir them into the flour mixture.  Continue adding flour, one cup at a time, mixing well after each addition, until a soft dough forms.  Turn out on a floured surface and knead until smooth and satiny.  Let rise in a greased bowl until double in volume.Punch the dough down.  Shape into balls the size of a large egg. (If you want hamburger buns, make them a little bigger.)  Place on a greased cookie sheet, leaving some space in between, and let rise.  Note:  My sheet pans are about 13\" x 16\".  I usually put four buns across and 6 down, making 24 buns per pan.Bake at 350 degrees for 25 - 30 minutes or until a deep golden brown on top.  Brush tops with butter while still hot.  Remove from cookie sheet to a wire rack and cover with a towel to let cool.  This keeps them from drying out.Mom taught me that the secret to making buns is to use enough flour so the dough isn't sticky, but not so much that it becomes a stiff dough.  It needs to remain a fairly soft dough.So there you go.  Have a good time baking.  This recipe makes world class cinnamon buns as well.  Maybe another day you can give that a try!Love, Grandma"},
{"title": "Coupons and Gardens", "date": "Tuesday, February 4, 2014", "text": "I have to admit that I am not big on coupons.  I am not one of those people who can fill a grocery cart to overflowing, whip out a wallet full of coupons and wind up paying $1.98 for the whole cart full.  I'm just not that organized.  Never have been.  Never will be.My local big box grocery sends out weekly sale sheets along with a coupon booklet a couple of times each month.  A year ago or less, I could find good deals on staples - flour, sugar, baking supplies, meat, vegetables, etc.  That's when I used coupons, even if it irritated me that the store set limits on the number of items a person could buy.  If I am stocking up, I want to buy 50 lbs. of hamburger or 30 pounds of carrots at a time - not two puny packages of meat or 3 lbs. of carrots.Anyway, I am finding now that most of the store coupons are for things like frozen pizza rolls, soda and  chips.  It is a rare day when I can find the basics on sale.  I thought it was just my paranoia kicking in, or that my tin foil hat was on crooked, but then I read this article.Guess I'm not alone at thinking that we are having processed and sugary foods pushed at us.  I feel for those who rely on store coupons to stretch the grocery budget.  They are getting crap for their trouble.I am not rabid about non-organic food.  I would prefer to eat organically grown produce and meat, but I am also sensible enough to know that in this world, that just is not possible.  For one thing, I can't afford to spend double and triple the price to buy all organic.  And for another, I have no place to grow my own.  So my best bet is to deal with the Farmer's Market vendors that I have dealt with in the past, and know from experience that they sell a quality product at a reasonable price.I would urge those folks who have the space, to grow whatever you can.  My son plants corn and tomatoes along side his house, rather than growing flowers in that space.  He has set up a small raised-bed garden in his back yard.  Not only does he raise vegetables for his family to eat fresh, but there is enough of a crop so he cans salsa and tomatoes and pickles.  From what he says, he may increase the garden space and is talking about buying a pressure canner.  Not only does he raise good food for his family, but the kids are learning about gardening.  And they help with the canning.These pictures are from last summer.Jacob and Maddie picked a wagon load of tomatoes.Boston and Maddie picked the last of the green beans.And they bring me pickles and cherry tomatoes, which I love.  They garden and I get to enjoy a taste of what they grow.  And the kids have learned another self-sustaining skill.  Everybody wins!"},
{"title": "New High School Principal", "date": "Monday, February 3, 2014", "text": "I ran across the following article written by Dennis Prager.  I know very little about the man.  I have seen a couple of YouTube videos of his speeches and have read a couple of his other articles.  Here is what Wikipedia has to say about him:\"Dennis Prager (born August 2, 1948) is an American nationally syndicated radio talk show host, syndicated columnist, author, and public speaker. He is noted for his conservative political and social views grounded in \"Judeo-Christian\" values. He holds that there is an \"American Trinity\" of essential principles, which he lists as E Pluribus Unum, In God We Trust, and Liberty.\"At a time when political correctness in our schools seems to be overtaking learning, I found this article, published several years ago, to be interesting.\"A Speech Every American High School Principal Should Give.By Dennis Prager.To the students and faculty of our high school:I am your new principal, and honored to be so. There is no greater calling than to teach young people. I would like to apprise you of some important changes coming to our school. I am making these changes because I am convinced that most of the ideas that have dominated public education in America have worked against you, against your teachers and against our country.First, this school will no longer honor race or ethnicity. I could not care less if your racial makeup is black, brown, red, yellow or white. I could not care less if your origins are African, Latin American, Asian or European, or if your ancestors arrived here on the Mayflower or on slave ships. The only identity I care about, the only one this school will recognize, is your individual identity — your character, your scholarship, your humanity. And the only national identity this school will care about is American.— This is an American public school, and American public schools were created to make better Americans. If you wish to affirm an ethnic, racial or religious identity through school, you will have to go elsewhere. We will end all ethnicity, race and non-American nationality-based celebrations. They undermine the motto of America, one of its three central values — e pluribus Unum, “from many, one.” And this school will be guided by America’s values. This includes all after-school clubs. I will not authorize clubs that divide students based on any identities. This includes race, language, religion, sexual orientation or whatever else may become in vogue in a society divided by political correctness.— Your clubs will be based on interests and passions, not blood, ethnic, racial or other physically defined ties. Those clubs just cultivate narcissism — an unhealthy preoccupation with the self — while the purpose of education is to get you to think beyond yourself. So we will have clubs that transport you to the wonders and glories of art, music, astronomy, languages you do not already speak, carpentry and more. If the only extracurricular activities you can imagine being interested in are those based on ethnic, racial or sexual identity, that means that little outside of yourself really interests you.Second, I am uninterested in whether English is your native language. My only interest in terms of language is that you leave this school speaking and writing English as fluently as possible. The English language has united America’s citizens for over 200 years, and it will unite us at this school. It is one of the indispensable reasons this country of immigrants has always come to be one country. And if you leave this school without excellent English language skills, I would be remiss in my duty to ensure that you will be prepared to successfully compete in the American job market. We will learn other languages here — it is deplorable that most Americans only speak English –but if you want classes taught in your native language rather than in English, this is not your school.Third, because I regard learning as a sacred endeavor, everything in this school will reflect learning’s elevated status. This means, among other things, that you and your teachers will dress accordingly. Many people in our society dress more formally for Hollywood events than for church or school. These people have their priorities backward. Therefore, there will be a formal dress code at this school.Fourth, no obscene language will be tolerated anywhere on this school’s property — whether in class, in the hallways or at athletic events. If you can’t speak without using the f-word, you can’t speak. By obscene language I mean the words banned by the Federal Communications Commission, plus epithets such as “Nigger,” even when used by one black student to address another black, or “bitch,” even when addressed by a girl to a girlfriend. It is my intent that by the time you leave this school, you will be among the few your age to instinctively distinguish between the elevated and the degraded, the holy and the obscene.Fifth, we will end all self-esteem programs. In this school, self-esteem will be attained in only one way — the way people attained it until decided otherwise a generation ago — by earning it. One immediate consequence is that there will be one valedictorian, not eight.Sixth, and last, I am reorienting the school toward academics and away from politics and propaganda. No more time will be devoted to scaring you about smoking and caffeine, or terrifying you about sexual harassment or global warming. No more semesters will be devoted to condom wearing and teaching you to regard sexual relations as only or primarily a health issue… There will be no more attempts to convince you that you are a victim because you are not white, or not male, or not heterosexual or not Christian. We will have failed if any one of you graduates this school and does not consider him or herself inordinately fortunate — to be alive and to be an American.Now, please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of our country. As many of you do not know the words, your teachers will hand them out to you.\"I know that I no longer have children in our school systems.  But I do have grandchildren in public schools, and I fear for what they are being taught.  Seems to me that our schools could greatly benefit from principals and teachers who were free to teach in the manner described in Dennis Prager's speech, rather than having to abide by the rules set down by government.And I think that the Pledge of Allegiance is a good place to start."},
{"title": "Dad's Apple Pie (for Stephen)", "date": "Sunday, February 2, 2014", "text": "I have often said that my Dad's apple pie was the best I have ever had.  Now, part of my love for that pie could be because it was my Dad who made it.  But for the most part, it is seriously good pie.  Stephen from \"Standing Outside Looking In\" left a request in the comment sections of one of my posts.  He said he would like the recipe for Dad's apple pie.  So here it is.This is the pie crust recipe that my family has used for well over 60 years.  Maybe longer.  It is the one I used when Mom first taught me how to make a pie and it is the one I still use.Crust:3 cups flour1 tsp. salt1 cup lard1 egg, slightly beaten1 Tbsp. vinegar3 Tbsp. waterStir the salt into the flour.  Cut in the lard until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.  Combine the egg, vinegar and water and stir into the flour mixture.  Makes enough for 2 two-crust pies.Dad's Apple Pie:6-7 tart apples (Dad just kept peeling and slicing apples until he had enough to fill a pie pan to nearly overflowing.  Don't skimp on the apples.)3/4 - 1 cup sugar2 Tbsp. flour1 tsp. cinnamondash nutmegdash saltStir the above ingredients to combine.  Pour over apples and stir just to coat them.  Fill a pie pan that holds the bottom crust.Dot the apples with about 2 Tbsp. butter and add the top crust, cut vents and sprinkle with a little sugar.Bake at 375 degrees for 50 - 60 minutes. It took me a while to find the recipe.  It was in my parent's old recipe box, and you don't just find a recipe quickly in there.  You have to wade through handwritten recipe cards and typewritten recipe cards.  Recipes were jotted down on the backs of envelopes, on pieces of folded notebook paper or just on scraps of whatever paper was handy at the time.  There are pieces of plastic cut from coconut or chocolate chip bags, and one from a Butterball Turkey bag.  Then there are the newspaper clippings.  Lots of those.  It is a time capsule of sorts.  One of the envelopes was dated 1973 and another sometime in the 1960's.It is sort of like looking at old photos of family and friends.  There is a recipe for something called a Campari Sandwich that I remember a neighbor girl making for a 4-H demonstration.  There is one for Christmas date cookies written by my Aunt Etta who departed this earth years ago.  There are several recipes from my Aunt Em, Mom's sister.  Everything she made was oh, so good. There is one recipe that Dad would never show me.  He said I could have it after he died, because he had given his word that he wouldn't share it with anyone.  That was a donut recipe using a donut maker.  Dad was a grain sampler, which means that he spent his days climbing into boxcars at the railroad yard and taking samples of wheat, oats and barley to be tested.  He would go for coffee with the other fellows on his crew to the local donut shop, where he pestered the owner for her recipe - for years.  She finally gave it to him the day she closed up shop and retired.One day when I am feeling ambitious, I need to type up all the recipes so I can find the one I need without going on a treasure hunt.  But I intend to leave the recipe box just as it is.  It just wouldn't be right if it was all neat and tidy.  The jumble is half the fun.Chocolate chip cookies are good for breakfast, right?  I mean, they contain eggs and grain, just like pancakes.  And I dunked them in a glass of milk, so there was dairy involved.  And I washed them down with a cup of coffee, just like any other breakfast.  So it should be OK to have three chocolate chip cookies for breakfast, right?I thought so."},
{"title": "Confession", "date": "Saturday, February 1, 2014", "text": "I have a confession to make.  My name is Vicki and I am a list maker.  I hang my head in shame.OK.  Ignore the hanging head part.  I have always been prone to making lists, but in my defense, it has been because I have never had a really good, razor sharp memory.  Which has probably kept me from being a world class liar.  I would have too hard a time remembering which lie I told to which person.  The truth, now that I can remember.But I digress.  I started thinking about list making this morning as I was busy writing yet another list.  Some of the bloggers I read have been talking about perusing seed catalogs and making their seed order lists.  I can't do that.  I used to, when I lived further north and had a huge garden every year.  Love those seed catalogs.  But now I live surrounded by concrete and asphalt.  Tomatoes and potatoes and carrots just don't grow well here in my parking lot.  So I look to the Farmer's Markets. A couple of weeks ago I took stock of my shelves of home canned goodies.  Made a list (yeah, I know) of what was left and what I would need to replace.  Did the same with my shelf full of dehydrated foods.  Using those lists as a guide, I figured out what I would need to buy at the Market this year.  Number One Son does Farmer's Market runs for me.  I'm kind of scared to show him my list for this year.  It is sort of lengthy.  Which translates into heavy boxes and bags of stuff that will need to be hauled up the stairs to my apartment.  So do I show him my list now so he has time to work out and build up his muscles for all of that heavy lifting, or do I wait until it is too late for him to back out.I think there is something in the air.  And not a good something.  I am not the only one who is ramping up the preps.  I see it on the blogs I read.  I see it in the comments to those blogs.  I read the alternative news sources and even once in a while on main stream news, where this uneasy feeling is being spoken of more often.  It isn't panic.  It is more like folks are feeling that whatever they need to do to take care of themselves, they had better not put it off any longer. So I make my lists.  And each time I can check something off those lists as done, it makes my future look a bit better.  Maybe being a confessed list maker isn't such a terrible thing after all."},

Or just to know how to make a treat of a loaf of homemade bread.  With lots of butter.  And homemade strawberry jam.Drat.  Now I'm hungry."},

If it looks like coffee and smells like coffee and isn't bitter, it's all good.I could go to my local grocery and buy coffee.  They have a large selection and a large price.  Dollar store coffee works just fine.  And it is on sale this week.  Six cans of the stuff will reside on my shelf tomorrow.  (After the temps warm up enough for me to stick my nose out!)  And as that won't leave a gaping hole in my budget, I probably will add another six cans the next time it goes on sale.  It is good to have rice and beans and all the other staples in food storage, but I firmly believe that in times of trouble, a person also needs some of the familiar comfort items, and coffee fills that bill for me.  (That and a goodly supply of chocolate.)I don't need to spend a ton of money on fancy coffee makers, either.  Years ago my Dad gave me this one.I don't know what the real name of this style of coffee pot is, but he always called it a \"drip-o-lator.\"  I wonder if that is even a word.  This coffee pot has been around at least as long as I have been, and that is a long time.  We are both showing our age.  I think my parents got it when they were first married in 1945.  Over the years I have had a series of Mr. Coffee type electric coffee makers.  And one by one, each has died.  This silly coffee pot will probably out last me.  And it makes better coffee than the fancy electric ones with their clocks and timers and buttons and digital numbers that always flash \"12:00\" because I can't seem to program them correctly.So now, if you will excuse me, my cup is empty and that is not a good thing."},

Our government officials in particular tend to tick me off.  Even though I never forget the threats to our freedoms and the threats to our way of life that we cherish and I continue to prepare, I choose to enjoy my life as much as possible.  Those words, \"Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness\" are as true today as they were when written.  And I believe in them."},

This is a heritage recipe, tested by time and the hands of mothers and grandmothers for over a hundred years. This secret family recipe is different from many standard white bread recipes in that it contains no milk, egg, or oil, and its very simplicity produces a bread of light but sturdy texture that yields loaves for perfectly sliced sandwich bread (the best sandwich bread you’ll ever taste! also makes excellent french toast!), plus the same dough can be used to create dinner rolls, cinnamon-swirl loaves, sweet rolls, crispies, and apple-strudel ladder loaf.Once you’ve grasped the concept of the standard Grandmother Bread recipe, you can create variations of your own–the possibilities are limitless!Two-loaf standard recipe3 cups warm water1 tablespoon yeast (1 packet)1 teaspoon salt1/4 cup sugar7 cups all-purpose flourOne-loaf standard recipe1 1/2 cups warm water1 teaspoon yeast1/2 teaspoon salt2 tablespoons sugar3 1/2 cups flourSee step by step instructions on How to Make Bread:In a large bowl, combine water, yeast, sugar, and salt. Let sit five minutes.Stir in first three cups of flour with a heavy spoon. Add the next cup of flour a little at a time as needed, stirring until dough becomes too stiff to continue stirring easily. Add a little more flour and begin kneading. The amount of flour is approximate–your mileage may vary! Continue adding flour and kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic.Let dough rise in a greased, covered bowl until doubled. (Usually, about an hour.) Uncover bowl; sprinkle in a little more flour and knead again before dividing in half. With floured hands, shape dough into loaves and place in two greased loaf pans. Tear off two pieces of waxed paper and grease with oil spray (to prevent it from sticking to the loaves as they rise) and cover loaf pans. Let rise till loaves are tall and beautiful! (About an hour, depending on the temperature in your kitchen.)Bake for 25 minutes in a preheated 350-degree oven.\"The only thing I don't do is use the waxed paper to cover the loaves while they raise.  A clean dish towel works fine for me.  And I will add that when tapping on the loaf produces a hollow sound, the bread is done.It does my heart good to see skills like bread baking passed down from one generation to the next.  I am grateful that my mother taught me as it is a skill that I use every week.  Today I can make my own bread and I don't have to brave the cold and the wind just to go to a store for a loaf.  And it just tastes so good.To my grandkids - let me know how your bread turns out.  I know it will be good.  Make sure Mom and Dad give each of you a slice with lots of butter while it is still warm.  And have fun!Love, Grandma"},

There comes a time, my friends, when people get tired of being plunged across the abyss of humiliation, where they experience the bleakness of nagging despair. There comes a time when people get tired of being pushed out of the glittering sunlight of life's July and left standing amid the piercing chill of an alpine November. There comes a time.”- Martin Luther King, Jr.I have to wonder, when will the time come when we as American citizens will get tired of the insanity coming from Washington.  How many more intrusions into our personal lives will we put up with?  How many more of our God given rights do we have to watch disappear?  What, exactly, has to happen before we say, \"Enough.\""},

I cleaned out the drawers in my desk.  It is amazing the stuff I found...stuff that I dropped into a drawer thinking I would find a home for it later but never did.  Does any sane person really need that many pens and pencils?  I doubt it!  I think I found enough of them to last the rest of my natural life.  And I found a bunch of other stuff that I had totally forgotten I had.  It was sort of like a treasure hunt without any treasure of real value.  Truth be told, it was more like an archaeological dig through a trash heap.I sorted through some old photos and genealogy notes that had accumulated but hadn't as yet been filed or entered into my genealogy program.  I love reading the old letters and stories that I have collected over the years.  They give me a peek into what life was like in the late 1800's and early 1900's.  One told about a pair of boots that were made at home, using wooden pegs to attach the soles.  When one child outgrew the boots, they were passed on to the next in line.  They were so well made that they went through half a dozen kids and never did completely wear out.Last fall when I turned 50 lbs of cranberries into juice and canned it, I had a quantity of what I call cranberry sludge left over from the process.  It is the skins and pulp that were left from straining the juice.  As I hate to waste anything, I had bagged it all up and tossed it into my freezer.  Last evening I got the bags out and laid them out to thaw.  Today I spread the sludge out on the fruit roll-up sheets for my dehydrators and dried it.  When it was crispy, I broke it up into small pieces and put it into quart jars.  Later I will run small batches of it through my little grinder and use the powder to flavor baked goods or mix with dried apple peels for a really good tea.It has taken me a lot of years to own up to my limitations.  Not all that long ago I would probably have been ranting and raving because I am sidelined for a time.  And would have been irritated because I can't do what I would like.  I guess that sometimes a person just has to accept what is.  And spend a day or two just puttering.  Actually, it was kind of fun."},

I have to say this for Dad.  He never lost his sense of humor.  When he still lived in his own home and I lived a couple of hundred miles away, he would make sure during our phone conversations that I knew about the apple pie cooling on his counter.  He knew how much I loved his apple pie.  For years I tried to get him to mail me a piece and for years he would tell me that he would, but he just couldn't fit it into the envelope.  Even after leaving his own home, he kept his sense of humor, joking with the nurses and aides and teasing with his older sister who lived in the same nursing home.So I think I will ignore Dad's advice and strive for that 90 year mark.  But I will follow his example and keep my sense of humor that has to laugh at the absurdities of the Universe tossing a monkey wrench into my best laid plans.  After all, it's not like I have a schedule.  If I get out to play this week or next week isn't important.  What is important is that I woke up this morning.  Even with aches and pains, I still woke up.  The stairs in my building may be a temporary problem, but I can still get around well enough to put a pot of soup on to simmer and bake a loaf of bread.  And a pan of brownies may be just the thing.Never give up.  And keep on smiling.  And chocolate makes everything better!"},

{"title": "Once Upon a Time...", "date": "Wednesday, December 18, 2013", "text": "there was a family who lived in the woods of northern Minnesota.  Their old farmhouse was drafty and starting to crumble.  This old house was heated with a potbellied wood stove in the kitchen area and a wood stove made from a barrel that sat in the basement.  It was the spring of the year, and the melting snow was seeping through cracks in the basement wall, leaving a couple of inches of water all over the floor.While the mom in this family was wringing her hands and worrying about patching the basement walls when there was no money for said patching, her daughter reminded her that life wasn't all that bad.While sitting at the table next to the potbellied stove, the mom heard a flap, flap, flapping sound coming down the stairs from the bedrooms above.  Slowly a pair of feet wearing swim fins appeared, followed by a bathing suit clad body.  Finally the head became visible, complete with swim cap, nose plugs and a snorkel.This apparition then said, \"Mom, could you go start a fire in the barrel stove?  I've invited my friends over for a pool party and I want the water in the basement to be warm.\"After the mom picked herself up off the floor and  wiped the tears of laughter from her eyes, she realized that most things can be made better with a good sense of humor.The mom seems to have forgotten that lately, and she is glad that this memory surfaced, for she needed to be reminded that the world will not end just because there is water in the basement.....or that the furnace doesn't work right. So yesterday the furnace man comes into my apartment.  Yep, the same guy who was looking for heating ducts in the attic that doesn't exist.  As he deposits black mud from his boots all over my kitchen floor and on the carpet in the other two rooms, (Where does he find this mud?  The ground is covered with clean, white snow.) he proudly tells me that he has found the problem with the heating system and my living room should now be warm.This morning it is 58 degrees in here.  That is a nice temperature if you are going for a walk along the river on a beautiful fall day.  It is not a nice temperature for an apartment in the winter.I think I will go make another pot of hot coffee, turn on my oven, open the oven door and sit in front of it until my toes thaw out.I may have to flay someone before the day is out.  And maybe borrow Number One Son's new hat!Grumble, dirty swear words, grumble some more!"},

{"title": "Then and Now", "date": "Monday, December 16, 2013", "text": "As I was reading some of the news articles this morning from both mainstream and alternative news sources, I got to thinking how different our lives are today from those of my paternal grandparents.  They homesteaded land in northern Minnesota in 1907.  They first put up a log cabin and later built a larger house, a barn and a few smaller outbuildings.  They raised nine children, all of whom grew into responsible adults. They didn't worry about their food being full of chemicals - they raised most of it themselves.They weren't concerned about meat being full of growth hormones and other chemicals, or about the animals being raised in the unhealthy environment of a factory farm.  They raised their own beef cattle, milk cows, hogs and chickens.  They butchered and processed their own meat animals and supplemented this with venison.They weren't terribly concerned with grocery prices for they traded milk, butter and eggs for the staples they couldn't raise themselves.  They scoured the woods and fields for edibles like wild plums and blueberries to add to their diet.None of the nine children were ever involved in a Knockout Game.  The very idea of hurting another person for no reason was abhorrent to them.Not one of their children took medication to control their behavior.  Their behavior was controlled by their parents.  Sometimes with a trip to the woodshed, if the offense was serious enough, and most times with extra chores to keep them too busy for mischief.Their education was not of the Common Core, government controlled variety, but of the basics that included reading, writing, math, and history.  Most of the nine children went through eighth grade in the little one room schoolhouse a quarter mile from their home.  The one their father helped to build.  Three of the girls went on to high school in the largest town about 20 miles away, where they earned teaching certificates.  All were able to use their education, along with common sense, to keep their families out of poverty.They never signed up for government welfare programs when they became available.  It was considered a sign of laziness to expect someone else to take care of your family.  They would have been shamed to do so.They didn't feel the need to provide entertainment for their offspring.  These kids made their own fun.  They went swimming in the lake near their farm.  They went fishing in the river.  In winter, they went sledding down the hill in the pasture or went ice skating on the frozen pond.  Most of their toys were homemade.  They made music and played games, both indoors on rainy days or outdoors on sunny ones.  Their mother had a hard time getting them to come inside for supper as opposed to kicking them outdoors to get a little exercise, as many do today.They taught their children what was important.  Good manners.  Respect for others.  Love for and duty to family.  Right from wrong.  A belief in God and the teachings of the Bible.  A work ethic second to none.These people weren't perfect.  Not by a long shot.  They messed up from time to time as we all do.  But they had a foundation for their lives that was solid and strong, so when things did not go well and they knew that they had strayed from what they had been taught, they got themselves back on track.  By their own bootstraps.I understand that times have changed since my parents were young.  One can no longer trade for grocery staples.  Raw milk has been outlawed, for the most part, gardens are not allowed in some cities, and God forbid that a person should live, work or raise a family without being told how by politicians.  The government seems determined to control all parts of our lives that they don't already.  So I am aware of the sad fact that the way of life that I long for is gone.  Isn't it amazing that my grandparents were able to raise their family and live a life, not of wealth and privilege, but one that was good and had meaning, using the Bible as a how-to guide along with the lessons learned from their parents, and not by government regulations.Sometimes I am convinced that we could use a bit more of the woodshed and a whole lot less of the feel-good politically correct.  And a bit of old-fashioned common sense thrown in for good measure wouldn't hurt, either."},
{"title": "Lid Test Results", "date": "Sunday, December 15, 2013", "text": "I just finished checking the jars of meat that I canned yesterday to make sure they had properly sealed.  I used equal numbers of the regular lids and Tattler lids.  The results are:Regular lids = 2 failuresTattler lids = zero failuresMeat is the easiest product to can as far as prep work goes.  Just cut into pieces, fill the jars, add lids and rings and process.  Meat is also the one product that gives me the most problems with seal failure.  I think that may be because during the canning process, the jars will vent out any air that is in them, and along with the air comes a bit of grease from the fat within the meat.  Some of the grease gets trapped between the lid and the rim of the jar, causing the lid to fail to seal.I will check the jars in a week or so to make sure they stayed sealed.  For now, I will be buying three or four boxes of the Tattler lids each time I go to the store, until I can save enough money to order a case or two.  Eventually, I would like to have enough of these lids for most of my jars.  And, boy howdy, that's a lot of jars!  When I ran out of shelf space last summer, my youngest son picked up two heavy duty shelving units for me.  Each is 6 ft. high, 4 ft. long and 2 ft. deep.  And now those puppies are both nearly full.I know that this sounds like an awful lot of canned food for just one person.  But home canned food will stay good in the jars for a very long time - years.  And I use it almost daily, rotating it out.  I figure that whatever I buy this year to can up is going to cost more next year.  And then there are the times when my kids will go shopping in Mom's canned goods section!  They know that they need to bring the empty jars back to be refilled.  And they are pretty good about doing that.The Tattler lids lived up to my expectations.  I love it when a plan comes together!"},

There are folks who are going through some horrible times (Mystic Mud) that make my problems look pretty tiny by comparison.  I'm pretty sure that if you are of a mind to remember this family in your prayers, it would be a good thing."},

Do you suppose that I could shut the darn thing off?  Not a chance.I finally set up my little mini step ladder, climbed up and tore it from the ceiling.  It must have a battery backup, for it continued to scream \"Fire!  Fire!\" long after I stuffed it under the pillows on my bed.I poured a cup of coffee and sat down to wait for the bread braid to finish baking.  And I started to giggle, thinking about how silly I must have looked, rushing about and trying to get the alarm to be quiet.  Sort of like an old Laurel and Hardy movie.I have a good landlord, and when I see him this weekend and tell him about my smoke alarm adventure, he will more than likely smile. He also knows that I use my oven often, for I bake my own bread every week as well as other baked goods and I use it for many of my meals, so I know that he will find a solution.I have often joked that dinner is done when the smoke alarm goes off, but I didn't think it would be a reality.  Sometimes the old thing that works should just be left alone."},

{"title": "Thanksgiving Thoughts", "date": "Thursday, November 28, 2013", "text": "So I  was sitting here today feeling a bit sorry for myself.  The creeping crud that I have been dealing with this month has kept me home bound.  I am feeling better than I did, but not well enough to go out.  My children and grandchildren are together eating turkey and talking and laughing and I am here.  Alone.  Poor me.And then I got to thinking about all that I have to be thankful for.I have a roof over my head and I can still afford to pay rent on it.  There is heat flowing out of the registers on my floors.  I have a bed with clean sheets and quilts to keep me warm at night, a pantry full of food and an oven in which to bake my bread.  I wonder how many are without those things today.I was blessed with four children who, with just a phone call, would be here and have been here in the past to help me if I need help.  I work at being as independent as possible, but it is a comfort to me to know that if things go all wonky in my life, they have my back.  I love them all, but I like them as well.  They have grown into adults that make me proud to be their mother.  Between them they have given me six grandchildren who are the lights of my life.I am thankful to have had parents who taught me so many things that have helped me over the years.  Mother taught me the practical things - how to cook and preserve food, how to sew and how to do all the daily chores that need to be done.  Dad instilled in me a work ethic second to none.  He worked hard all of his life and I never once heard him complain.  He also taught me the value of laughter, for if you can't laugh at yourself or the absurdities of the world around you, then life is nothing more than drudgery.My parents also raised me to have a strong faith in God.  There have been times in my life that this didn't seem too important to me, but it seems that the older I become, the more important it is to me to remember the teachings of my youth.  And more important, to do my best to live by them.I am thankful that I have reached a place in my life where I am relatively happy.  That wasn't always so.  I have been lucky to discover that my happiness lies within me and not with others.  I can decide each morning whether I am going to spend my day being happy or grumpy.  I vote, for the most part, for happy.  Oh, I still rant about the injustices in our world and will probably continue to do so, for some things just need to be said.  But that inner peace is what keeps me going, and I am thankful to God for it.So instead of wallowing in self pity, I have thawed out a chicken, stuffed it and it is roasting in my oven, filling my little apartment with delicious smells.  A small casserole made with squash I canned this fall is ready for the oven.  One of my daughters brought me a pail of ice cream a couple of days ago, and I will whip up a batch of chocolate sauce to go with it for dessert.  And I will think about my children and grandchildren who are together today as a family, and be thankful that they consider family important.And I will wish you all a blessed Thanksgiving Day."},

There are a few retailers, however, who refuse to give in to this insanity.  The article about it is here.Kudos to those stores who will not cave and will allow their employees to have the entire Thanksgiving Day to spend with their families.  Those are the businesses that will receive my money throughout the year and not just on one insane, greed driven day."},
{"title": "Long Hair", "date": "Friday, November 22, 2013", "text": "When I was a young girl, I wished for long hair.  Movie stars had long, luxurious, beautiful hair.  Television ads for shampoo featured models with long hair that could obviously be gorgeous just by using the right hair products.  Yep.  That was for me.My mother didn't think so.In her younger years, Mother had a talent for cutting hair.  The ladies in our neighborhood didn't go to a beauty shop but came to my mother for their haircuts.  So it was natural that she would cut my hair.  I think she just didn't have time to mess with a daughters' long, flowing tresses.  Once, when I threw a hissy fit about home haircuts, whining that other girls didn't have haircuts given them by their mothers, she loaded me into the car, hauled me to town and I got a haircut.  Not at a beauty shop, but at a barber.  I came out looking sort of like Alfalfa from the Little Rascals.I'm not sure I ever forgave her, but I never again complained about a home haircut, and I expect that was the desired result.Out of habit, I suppose, I have kept my hair fairly short most of my life.I'm sort of a no-frills kind of gal.  When a beautician asks me how I want my hair cut, my reply is usually, \"Wash and Wear.\"  I have no patience for fussing in front of a mirror to make sure every hair is in place.  So about four years ago I decided to just let my hair grow.  It is now about two inches above where my waist used to be.  And I now realize that Mom knew what she was talking about. I know this because nearly every morning I spend time brushing rats nests out of my hair.  I should braid it before going to bed at night to prevent this, but I can't seem to get the hang of it.I know this because if I don't tie my hair up before cooking, I wind up pulling long gray hairs from my food.I know this because I dragged the ends of my hair through the dishwater today, three times in as many minutes.And I especially know this because just the other day I had to untangle a cat from these long, flowing tresses.  Cat still has claws on all four feet.  It was not pretty.I will wait until spring and then off to the beautician I will go.  I will ask for a Wash and Wear style.  And I will donate these long, flowing tresses to \"Locks of Love,\" an organization that makes wigs from donated hair for cancer patients .I wish for many reasons that my mother were still alive.  But one of the best reasons is that she would get such a chuckle from hearing me tell her that she was, once again, right.We are totally without common sense.I just read an article that explains that peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist.  You can read about it here.Really?  Racist?  Give me a break.  Basically, the article states that the American tradition of PBJ sandwiches may offend those who do not eat sandwich bread because other cultures may eat different forms of bread such as pita.  So a PBJ sandwich is racist because it is all about \"white privilege,\" and  schools should be sensitive to the customs of those students whose birthplace was not America.I have an idea.  How about we teach American customs in American schools.  And while we are at it, why don't we insist that people of other nationalities who chose to become American citizens learn our customs and traditions and language.  I have nothing against those who come to our country seeking citizenship and a better life for themselves and their families.  Had I found myself in their position, I would probably have done the same.   We all want a better life for our loved ones.  But I am getting really tired of being told that I should consider American customs and traditions \"racist.\"So now, if you will excuse me, I think I will go fix myself a PBJ sandwich.  And I refuse to apologize for it."},

I have to pay just to walk through the door of the clinic, the fees for poking and prodding and X-Raying and the steep price of prescriptions, and stay with the tried and true remedy of rest, aspirin for aches and pains, and my apple-cranberry tea laced with honey.  Seems to be working."},

Please note that permission must also be obtained in writing from landowners before their fields may be entered.To avoid offending those not participating in celebrations, we request that laughter is moderate only and not loud enough to be considered a noise nuisance. Benches, stools and orthopaedic chairs are now available for collection by any shepherds planning or required to watch their flocks at night.While provision has also been made for remote monitoring of flocks by CCTV cameras from a centrally heated shepherd observation hut, all facility users are reminded that an emergency response plan must be submitted to account for known risks to the flocks.The angel of the Lord is additionally reminded that prior to shining his/her glory all around s/he must confirm that all shepherds are wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment to account for the harmful effects of UVA, UVB and the overwhelming effects of Glory.Following last year’s well publicised case, everyone is advised that EU legislation prohibits any comment with regard to the redness of any part of Mr. R. Reindeer. Further to this, exclusion of Mr. R. Reindeer from reindeer games will be considered discriminatory and disciplinary action will be taken against those found guilty of this offence.While it is acknowledged that gift-bearing is commonly practised in various parts of the world, particularly the Orient, everyone is reminded that the bearing of gifts is subject to Hospitality Guidelines and all gifts must be registered. This applies regardless of the individual, even royal personages.It is particularly noted that direct gifts of currency or gold are specifically precluded under provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Further, caution is advised regarding other common gifts, such as aromatic resins that may initiate allergic reactions.Finally, in the recent case of the infant found tucked up in a manger without any crib for a bed, Social Services have been advised and will be arriving shortly.Happy Holidays,The Risk Management TeamJust for the record.....I refuse to utter the words, \"Happy Holidays.\"  It's Christmas, dammit.  I don't get my knickers in a twist over all the ethnic holidays during the course of a year that have nothing to do with my ancestry.  So if \"Merry Christmas\" is found to be offensive, that's just too bad.Bah, humbug!"},
{"title": "Sauerkraut Taste Test", "date": "Tuesday, October 29, 2013", "text": "About three weeks ago I did a sauerkraut canning experiment.  I needed an alternative to the old-time tried and true method of fermenting sauerkraut in a crock and then canning it.  The recipe I used called for packing shredded cabbage in quart jars and adding a teaspoon each of canning salt and sugar to each jar and topping them off with boiling water.  Then the lids and rings are put on the jars loosely and they are left undisturbed for three days.  After that time any film that has developed on the sauerkraut is skimmed off, lids and rings are applied more tightly and the jars are run through a water bath canner for 20 minutes.  The directions say to let the jars sit for three weeks before using.The three weeks is up.  I opened a jar yesterday.  I found that it tasted good, but much more mild than store bought sauerkraut.  It doesn't have that pucker up quality of commercially canned sauerkraut.I buttered a casserole dish, drained the sauerkraut and dumped it in.  Then I topped it off with a pint of pork roast I had canned earlier and put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or so.  I have to say that it was pretty good.  It tastes more like a cross between regular cooked cabbage and sauerkraut.  I like cooked cabbage as a side vegetable dish, so I liked it.  I only made three quarts of the stuff, so I am going to leave the other two on the shelf for another month or so to see if there is any difference in the taste.I will probably experiment with other similar recipes to see if I can find one that is a bit more sour.  I know that I could just go to the store and buy a can or two, but I really like the idea of making my own.  I'm funny that way.  The more I can do for myself without running to the grocery, the better I like it.  This experiment hasn't turned out exactly as I would have liked, but it isn't a dismal failure, either.  Live and learn.  And keep on trying."},

DO NOT BOIL. Simmer 5 minutes, or until most berries burst.Pour berries and juice into damp jelly bag or a colander lined with four layers of clean cheesecloth. Let juice drip into a large bowl. DO NOT squeeze the bag.When you have extracted as much juice as possible from the pulp, return pulp to pot with 2 quarts water. Simmer 2 minutes.Pour this pulp and juice through jelly bag again to extract remaining juice.Place the 2 batches of juice in a large pot.Add sugar to suit your taste and 1 more quart water. Heat to dissolve sugar completely, but do not boil.Quickly pour into clean, hot jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace; seal.Process in boiling water bath for 15 minutes.Yields 6 to 7 quarts.Note:  I did not use cheesecloth as that is really time consuming and I had so many berries to process.  I used a strainer, which leaves a bit of pulp, but that doesn't bother me in the least.  The juice is for family consumption, not for entering at the fair.  It doesn't have to be perfectly clear to taste wonderful.I hate to see anything go to waste, so I am dehydrating the leftover cranberry pulp.  When dried, it can be ground into small bits and added as flavoring for muffins, quick breads or cookies.  I dehydrate the peels when I am canning apples, and when mixed with the cranberry bits and a little sweetener, they make a really lovely tea.I think I have just enough jars left to can up the butternut squash that Son brought me from the Farmer's Market.  And then I will give it a rest for a while.  Unless, of course, I find another really good sale..."},

The United States Supreme Court has ruled that school districts may not endorse, prefer, favor, promote or advance any religious beliefs....\"If you are so flipping sensitive that a bunch of elementary school children dressed up as ghosts, fairy princesses and comic super heroes offends you, then you need to do something about that thin skin of yours.  And I can't think of one good reason to change a long standing American tradition of celebrating Halloween.  These are just kids.  And the adults in charge seem to be bound and determined to suck the fun out of their lives. Kids are kids for a very short time.  How about just letting them be kids."},

And it is Apple Pickin' Time.  There are several pick-your-own orchards near my home, and this year my brother and his lovely wife plan to join however many family members can go with us this coming weekend.  It is one of my favorite outings of the year.Whenever I think about apple pickin' time, I think of the last apple excursion that my husband went on.  We were with my youngest son and his family.  Our granddaughter, Maddie, stuck pretty close to Poppa.  She was small and he was tall and Poppa could reach the best apples that were high in the tree.  Mike left us the following summer.  It warms my heart to remember how he remarked after we came home, that the day had been one of the best he could remember.I love the fall days that turn into such good memories."},

(I hate shopping.  I have never understood women who treat shopping as a form of recreation.)  You can get the colors and patterns you like in the fabric as opposed to whatever dreadful choices are on the racks at the stores.  And if you watch for fabric and pattern sales, home sewn clothing costs far less than buying ready made.I learned to sew well over 50 years ago.  There was a time when I sewed most of my own clothing as well as much of my children's.  I think I stopped while I was still in the working world, for time was at a premium.  Now I have all the time in the world.  I could use some new shirts and slacks for winter.  And a fall jacket.  Think I will go now and peruse the fabric store sale ads."},
{"title": "Going Home", "date": "Friday, September 13, 2013", "text": "While reading some of my favorite blogs this morning, I ran across a post about going home again.  The writer talked of visiting various places where she had lived only to find them all changed.  Other people now live there, houses have been remodeled and yards and gardens done over.  Most bore little resemblance to her memories of them.I get restless sometimes.  I wish I could move out of the city.  I wish I could go back to the north country I love.  Or to the drafty old farmhouse that I mostly grew up in.  But if I take a long, realistic look at things, I know in my heart of hearts that this will not happen.  The dubious joys of my \"golden years\" make it nearly impossible.I love the northern part of my state because my family roots are there.  I have such good memories of time spent as a child in the house my grandfather built for his large family.  I can see in my mind the kitchen with it's worn plank floor and wood burning stove and the ice box in the corner and the stool by the back door that held a bucket full of well water and a dipper for drinking.  I see the upright piano in the corner of the main room that my grandfather played, and although I never knew him or heard his music, I see him through the tales told me by my father.  I can visualize my grandmother sitting in the chair that was hers, reading or smiling at the shenanigans of her grown children and grandchildren.  I see her in the early morning, long black braid, only touched with gray even in her later years, down her back, stoking up the stove firebox to cook breakfast. I sometimes think about the farmhouse where I spent the better part of my youth.  I remember the warmth of the kitchen where it seems, in my memory, there was always something good baking in the oven.  I remember bedroom walls that were papered, for underneath was lath and plaster that couldn't be painted.  I recall warm summer nights spent sleeping on the screened front porch, and the storm clouds Dad and I watched from that same porch, rolling over the fields.  I think of the hours spent roaming the woods and fields behind the house and the dog that was always at my heels and the orchard and the garden. And the long row of peony bushes that were a riot of white and pink while in bloom.My grandparents house is no longer there.  A number of years ago it was donated to the local firefighters to burn as a practice drill.  The farmhouse is gone as well, torn down to make way for a new house built on the property.And then the realization comes to me that it is not the buildings that are important.  It is the memories of life in those buildings.  It is the laughter of my aunts and uncles and cousins when we all got together in the north.  It is following my uncle to the barn when he went to do the milking and playing with the latest batch of barn kittens.  It is the soft lap of my grandma and the absolute knowledge that she loved me.  It is my Dad's silly jokes and Mom's homemade bread.  It is the time and patience my parents put in to teach me so many things that have helped me over the years.  It is taking care of my baby brother when Mom couldn't, and loving every minute of it.  It is memory of a two-room country schoolhouse and bike rides down gravel roads and nearly burning my eyebrows off trying to smoke corn silk with the neighbor girl.I have heard it said that you can't go home again, and that is true.  But every now and then, when city life comes close to being unbearable to this country girl, I can go home.  For it is not the houses, but the people.  Most of them are gone now, but they still live in memory.  And I think that may be enough."},

Homemade beans and cornbread.  Simple comfort food.  And oh, so good.  Don't think I will have to give any of it a decent burial this time."},

The dog's owners, Ron, his wife Lisa, and their little boy Shane, were all very attached to Belker, and they were hoping for a miracle.I examined Belker and found he was dying of cancer. I told the family we couldn't do anything for Belker, and offered to perform the euthanasia procedure for the old dog in their home.As we made arrangements, Ron and Lisa told me they thought it would be good for six-year-old Shane to observe the procedure. They felt as though Shane might learn something from the experience.The next day, I felt the familiar catch in my throat as Belker's family surrounded him. Shane seemed so calm, petting the old dog for the last time, that I wondered if he understood what was going on. Within a few minutes, Belker slipped peacefully away.The little boy seemed to accept Belker's transition without any difficulty or confusion. We sat together for a while after Belker's death, wondering aloud about the sad fact that animal lives are shorter than human lives.Shane, who had been listening quietly, piped up, ''I know why.''Startled, we all turned to him. What came out of his mouth next stunned me. I'd never heard a more comforting explanation. It has changed the way I try and live.He said, ''People are born so that they can learn how to live a good life -- like loving everybody all the time and being nice, right?'' The six-year-old continued,''Well, dogs already know how to do that, so they don't have to stay as long.''Remember, if a dog was the teacher you would learn things like:When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride.Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure Ecstasy.Take naps.Stretch before rising.Run, romp, and play daily.Thrive on attention and let people touch you.Avoid biting when a simple growl will do.On warm days, stop to lie on your back on the grass.On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shady tree.When you're happy, dance around and wag your entire body.Delight in the simple joy of a long walk.Be loyal.Never pretend to be something you're not.If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it.When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by, and nuzzle them gently.ENJOY EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY DAY!"},

{"title": "Reasons to Prepare", "date": "Monday, August 26, 2013", "text": "I rarely, if ever, delve into current events or political opinions on this blog.  I don't completely understand politics or economics or global events.  I don't even pretend to. What I do know is this:I know that if a politician is speaking, chances are more than pretty good that he or she is lying to me.  Sincerely and with a straight face.I know that little by little my rights as an American citizen are being undermined by those who believe that the Constitution is just an old piece of paper.I know that the government thinks it is OK to spy on all of us.I know that \"Of the People, By the People and For the People\" no longer matters to anyone in power.And I know that very few people really care.  They are way too busy with their own lives and interests to see that the train is ready to jump the track.  And take all of us right along with it.I am into preparing for whatever does come down the pike.  I have no idea if war or economic collapse or civil unrest will make it necessary for me to live for a time on what I have put by, as well as feed any of my family that needs to be fed.  I just know that the world has gone mad and something will happen, probably sooner than later, that will make life a lot tougher for folks than it is right now.  As the child of depression era parents, I was taught that if I didn't stock up in the summertime, I would probably be pretty hungry in the middle of the winter.  So I stock up as much as I can.I don't have a retreat to go to like so many in the \"prepping\" world do, when things get bad.  I am a retired widow living on Social Security.  My husband was epileptic and diabetic.  He died from a heart attack 5 years ago.  Doctor and hospital visits, $1,400 ambulance rides that were a mile and a half long between our apartment and the local hospital and the price of the several medications he took made saving for retirement only a pipe dream.   I do not begrudge one dime spent on his health issues.  But there was nothing left over for retreats or bug-out vehicles or cases of freeze dried foods or many of the other things that modern day preppers find necessary.  My point is not that my life has been tough.  Many people have lives that have been much more challenging than mine.  My point is that even with challenges, whether it be limited income or chronic illness or anything else, it is possible to prepare for the future.  We just do the best we can with what we have to work with. I do worry some about those who ignore the signs that things are woefully wrong in our country.  I understand that it is much nicer to live in a world viewed through rose colored glasses, where everything is unicorns and sunshine.  Nobody likes to see the storm clouds on the horizon.  I just think that it is better to get ready for the storm than to pretend it isn't there.Others can do whatever they wish.  I can't seem to get anyone to really pay attention.  So I will just continue to do what I have been doing - pray and prepare as best I can."},

{"title": "To Cook or Not to Cook...", "date": "Saturday, August 24, 2013", "text": "I prefer Not to Cook.  It's not that I can't cook.  I can.  Very well, as a matter of fact.  I just do not enjoy the process.There are some YouTube channels hosted by some very good cooks.  I enjoy watching them from time to time.  And now and then I see a dish that I might try making for myself.  But not often.  I keep a pretty basic pantry.  A fixed income doesn't include specialty items.  And cooking for just one person isn't much fun, so I try to make it as simple as possible.I am a back to basics kind of cook as opposed to one of the gourmet variety.  I live in pork and beef and poultry country.  I have never seen leg of lamb in the meat department of my local grocery store.  I grew up on basic, good tasting simple and filling meals of meat, potatoes, vegetables and probably homemade pickles.  The closest thing to a gourmet dish that I remember from my childhood was when Dad's pancake batter got a little bit runny, resulting in very thin pancakes.  He plopped some strawberries on them, added whipped cream, rolled them up and convinced his children that they were eating \"high-classed crepes.\"I home can much of my own food.  I don't have a garden.  My apartment is surrounded by asphalt and concrete.  There are no community gardens in my area.  I thought about growing tomatoes and herbs in pots on the communal deck of my building, but others have tried this in the past and the pots were stolen within a couple of weeks of planting.What I do have is a son who is willing to go to the huge Farmer's Market in Minneapolis and bring me boxes of tomatoes, huge heads of cabbage, bags of carrots and boxes of potatoes, all grown locally.  What is even better, he is willing to huff all of that produce up the stairs to my apartment, along with the jars that I need to can it all.  God bless him.  I hope his back holds out!I can the usual suspects - corn, green beans, carrots, peas, potatoes, etc.  I also buy meat on sale and can that as well.  I am able to open a jar of mixed vegetables and another of canned turkey and dump them into a casserole dish.  Top it off with homemade biscuits, pop it in the oven, and - easy, peasy - dinner is served.  Or I take a jar of beef roast chunks and a jar of potato and carrot cubes, plop them in a pan, season and bake for a half hour and I have a meal.I have started canning a variety of soups as the basis for quick and easy lunches.  So far I have canned vegetable, chicken vegetable, ham and bean, split pea and ham, and chili.  A pint jar is just right to fill a soup bowl.I didn't start canning as part of the prepper movement.  I have done this most of my life.  In my family, the rule was, \"If you don't work, you don't eat.\"  And that included working hard summer and fall, preserving the garden produce and seasonal fruits.  Dad worked a job and Mom and I worked canning and preserving.  I grew up on home canned foods and I still like them far and away better than anything I buy in the store.  The added benefit is that I know what is in them, as opposed to the ingredient list on a can that includes items that I cannot pronounce.Some of my grown children think that I have gone off the deep end when it comes to the preservation of food.  They also believe that my tin foil hat is on a bit too tight.  That opinion notwithstanding, I continue to add home canned food to my shelves as often as is possible.  My goal is to have a one year supply of food put away.  I am nearly there.  Winters here in Minnesota can be very cold, very snowy, very icy and totally miserable.  Last winter I only had to venture out in the bitter weather three times for a grocery store run.  I hope to avoid trips to the store altogether this coming winter.  I do love winter, but only when viewed from the comfort of my rocking chair in front of my window, with a cup of steaming coffee or hot chocolate in hand and one of my crocheted afghans over my shoulders.  Add a cat in my lap and my dogs at my feet and I am one content lady."},
{"title": "Home Town Celebrations", "date": "Thursday, August 1, 2013", "text": "This week my town has its annual summer celebration.  Many towns across the country have them.  There are activities and contests for young and old, music in the bandstand, food booths and arts and crafts booths, a fireworks display Saturday night and a parade on Sunday afternoon.  And many of the local businesses have sidewalk sales going on.  Because I am more inclined to a hermit kind of lifestyle as opposed to being a social butterfly, I will probably skip the crowds.  I tend to gravitate more to the book sale at the library.  I probably will wander down to the park tomorrow and check out the crafty things for sale, for I always like most anything handmade.  And the fireworks display is just a block away on the river and I can see it from the deck on my building.  The kid in me loves the fireworks.The crowds of people coming and going to the various activities reminded me of the small town celebrations in years gone by.  The town where I grew up had the Kaffee Fest.  It was a big deal for us country kids who didn't get to town that often.  A couple of streets were blocked off and a small carnival complete with Merry-Go-Round, Ferris Wheel and Tilt-A-Whirl (my favorite) was set up there.  I always felt kind of sorry for the ponies going round and round with shrieking kids in the saddles.  A couple of churches had food booths that served hamburgers and fries or foot long hot dogs, and because we were in dairy country, there was a large \"all you can drink for a dime\" milk bar.  It was pretty small stuff compared to the countless entertainments going on here this weekend, but it was great fun for kids of my era.I remember hearing my parents talk about activities in the small town where they both grew up.  They talked of ice cream socials and outdoor band concerts on summer evenings.  They reminisced about pot luck picnics at the church and pageants put on by school children.  They told about tug-of-war contests and softball games and of hayrides in the fall of the year and sleigh rides in the winter.  But mostly they talked about the people who attended these gatherings that seemed to be more about friends and neighbors and families than about the entertainment. I think I would have enjoyed those times."},

{"title": "A Sense of Humor", "date": "Saturday, July 20, 2013", "text": "I sometimes think that the only way to get through this crazy life is to keep a sense of humor in good working order.  Both sides of my family were able to do that, and if I could have inherited just one thing, the sense of humor would have been what I would want.Dad's side of the family pretty much had a dry sense of humor.  Any of Dad's siblings could say something totally outrageous and keep a straight face until it dawned on you that your leg was being pulled.  They pulled silly little pranks on one another, even when they were full grown adults, like Uncle Bruce stealing a part of a slice of pie off Dad's plate when his back was turned.  They teased one another, but never in a vicious way.  Dad liked to remind his siblings that he was the last child born in that family, so he was sure that his parents had saved the best for last.They only got into trouble when the five boys got together and plotted some devilment, usually for Halloween.  At that time, indoor plumbing was rare, and everybody had outhouses.  The Matheny boys wouldn't tip over outhouses, as was the custom for boys to do on Halloween night.  They merely moved them over a foot or two so that the hole dug underneath wasn't where it was supposed to be, and if a person stood in the wrong spot, the outhouse might suddenly lean toward the direction of the now exposed hole.The prank that became legendary in the family involved a Model T Ford car.  There was a man who lived in town who had a new Model T.  He was proud of this car to the point of being a bit obnoxious in his bragging.  This was something that the Matheny boys just couldn't let pass.  They managed to get that car up on the roof of the man's garage, and there it sat when he came out to drive it in the morning.  Dad would barely acknowledge to me that he and his brothers had anything to do with this, saying, \"Somebody...I don't know just who...\" did this.  And he would never tell me just how they got the car on the roof.  It wasn't until just a couple of years ago when I was talking to my brother that he told me Dad had once told him that he and his brothers had sort of dismantled the car, hauled the parts up to the roof and put the car back together.  They went to an awful lot of work for a joke, but I think it was probably worth it!Dad's sense of humor stayed with him to the end.  He and his sister, Clarice, both resided in the same nursing home where Mom had lived.  Both were over the age of 90.  It seems that there was an exercise program for wheelchair bound residents, where they sat in their chairs and did arm and upper body exercises to keep up their strength.  Dad and his sister usually sat next to one another.  They would be dutifully doing their exercises when Dad would lean over and gently tap Clarice on the back of her head.  They would exercise some more and Clarice would reach over and lightly punch Dad on his shoulder.  After which he would retaliate, and so would she, until the staff member who was leading the group would say, \"Now you two Matheny kids just behave yourselves!\"  And they would, but only for a little while.Clarice and DadMy mother's only brother was the prankster in their family.  I have been told by cousins that he would wait until his parents had gone out of an evening, and then as soon as it got dark, he would conjure up a story or a creaking door or some crash-bang noises to scare his sisters.  He did this just to see if he could get them to run upstairs to their bedrooms, screaming all the way.  And it usually worked.  I think that must have been his revenge at being the only boy in a house full of girls.Another time Uncle Duane convinced some of his visiting cousins that it would be fun to go out at night and steal some muskmelons from a neighbor's garden.  He lead them all over town, through back yards and down alleys and got them thoroughly turned around in direction until they came to the muskmelon patch.  It wasn't until the cousins each had a good sized melon in hand that they realized they had just stolen melons from their own family garden.Mom and her sisters weren't big on playing jokes.  But when they all got together, there was always lots of talk and even more laughter.  I always enjoyed listening to them.This isn't a very good photo, but it is the only one I have of Grandma and all of the Paul siblings.Mom did, however, like to get one up on Dad every now and then.  This was a time when Fuller Brush and Kirby Vacuum Cleaner salesmen went door to door.  Dad went to work early in the morning, so he usually got home in the middle of the afternoon.  One afternoon he was greeted by Mom calling out as he came in the kitchen door that he should come into the living room, as there was a Kirby Vacuum Cleaner salesman there.  Mom later told me she knew how Dad would react and she wasn't disappointed.  He thought she was joking and called back to her that he didn't want to see any durned old salesman and that he had better hightail it out of there if he knew what was good for him.  And then he entered the living room and found himself face to face with the white-faced, wide-eyed salesman, vacuum in hand.  Dad told me later that he just sat there meekly through the whole demonstration.  He figured he owed the salesman that much for scaring him.I don't know how some folks can go through life all grouchy and cranky.  Life, after all, is full of absurdities, and if you can't sit back and just laugh at yourself and the world around you, then it seems to me that you are in for a long and miserable life.  I'd rather laugh."},
{"title": "About Mom", "date": "Friday, July 19, 2013", "text": "My mother's upbringing was very different from my father's.  Where Dad's family was just a bit rowdy, Mom's family was more reserved.  They say that opposites attract and I think in my parents' case, it was true.Mom was raised in Blackduck where her father was the depot agent for the railroad.  My grandfather's first wife had died the day after giving birth to their daughter, Dorothy.  A couple of years later he married my grandma, Gladys Morehouse.  Mother had one brother and four sisters besides Dorothy, the fifth sister being stillborn.  She was next to the youngest in age.Born in 1924, Mom grew up during the Great Depression.  The family was fortunate in that my grandfather had a job and was able to keep it during that time when so many were out of work, and was able provide for his family.  They lived a life typical for small town America with all of the children going to school and graduating from high school, where many other less fortunate children had to quit school and help out on family farms or look for other means to financially help their families.  Mom's family was not rich by any stretch of the imagination, but neither were they destitute.My mother's family was musically inclined.  All of the children except the youngest played the violin and some played piano.  Mother learned to play violin, cello, guitar and piano.  I was lucky to have been born first in my family, for I was able to hear Mom play all the instruments before the crippling in her hands made it impossible.  My sister may have heard her play, but my brother who is 15 years my junior, never did.In addition to my grandfather's work for the railroad, he was a lay minister.  To my knowledge he was never ordained, but he held church services in the nearby community of Nebish for many years.  My mother and her siblings, who all had good singing voices as well as a talent for playing instruments, went with him to provide the music for the services.  As a side note, my Grandfather Paul preached the funeral service for my Grandfather Matheny in October of 1936.Sometime in the early 1940's, the family, with the exception of the two oldest who had married, moved to St. Paul.  Mom's father had problems with his heart (I don't know what the actual diagnosis was.  At that time it was just referred to as \"heart trouble.\") and because of his employment with the railroad, the logical place for his treatment was the Northern Pacific Hospital in St. Paul.  It was there he passed on in October of 1947.  I was only 16 months old when my grandfather died, so I have very little in the way of memory of him.  I once asked my Dad what Grandpa Paul was like, and his description was that he was a stern but fair man.Mom and Dad were married in St. Paul in July of 1945.  Mom's father wanted her to wait until she was 21 years of age before marrying, so she honored his request by setting the wedding date for one week after her 21st birthday.  Mother was married to Dad for nearly 51 years.My mother was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis shortly after my birth in 1946.  It began with swelling and pain in her hands and eventually spread to her entire body.  I find it sad that so much of her life was defined by pain and doctors and hospitals, ending in a nursing home.  We were so blessed to have her in the small facility in her hometown, where she was known and loved by family and staff alike.  Mom and Dad had moved to an apartment within a block of the home, and after she could no longer live there, Dad was able to walk over and spend his days with her.Mom loved pretty things.  I remember watching her crochet beautiful doilies to adorn the backs of chairs or table tops.  She did fancy embroidery and taught me this skill.  Holidays were her favorite times.  She took a small tree branch, painted it white and attached red and pink paper hearts to the branches with gold thread, for a Valentine's Day centerpiece for our dining room table.  She did the same at Easter, using the egg shells that we had blown the insides out of and decorated.  She was always crafting something pretty out of practically nothing.  Christmas was her absolute favorite time of year, and there was hardly a surface in our home that wasn't adorned with pine bows, brightly colored glass ornaments and candles.  Even when she could no longer do the decorating herself and was in a wheelchair, I remember her sitting in the middle of the living room, directing the decorating of the room by the rest of us, like a queen on her throne.I didn't realize how far Mother's love of pretty extended until much later in my life.  The family had gathered for the celebration of some event - perhaps a special birthday or anniversary.  For special occasions she would often serve as part of the meal a shrimp salad that contained tiny pasta rings, baby shrimp, diced celery and sliced olives in a dressing.  I loved the stuff.  When someone offered to get a plate of food for Mom and asked if she wanted some shrimp salad, Mom replied no, that she did not like it.  When I asked her why she served it for occasions if she wouldn't eat it, she said that the only reason she had made that salad was because it looked pretty in the bowl.Over the years, the disease that ravaged her body slowly became worse.  She had surgeries to replace joints that had worn away and eventually had a permanent trach tube in her neck so she could breathe after bones in her neck disintegrated.  Where a cold is an annoyance to most of us, it often was the cause of another hospital stay for her.  Mom was a very religions person and I think it was her faith that kept her going when most would have given up.  After the surgery on her neck, the doctors told her to go home and get her affairs in order.  Twenty years later, she was still thumbing her nose at them.I am so grateful to her for all that she taught me.  How she had the patience to deal with a semi-rebellious tomboy of a daughter, I will never know.Mom died in April of 1996.  I felt great sadness, but also relief that she was no longer in pain.  I will always miss her."},

{"title": "About Dad", "date": "Wednesday, July 17, 2013", "text": "Dad grew up in a large, poor farm family.  He was the youngest of nine children.  As soon as the children were old enough, they worked, and my grandparents worked right along side them.  The boys fed the hogs and milked the cows.  They plowed the fields behind a team of horses.  They cut hay by hand and loaded it onto hay wagons with pitchforks and stored it in the barn.  In the winter they cut and split firewood to heat their house.  They cut blocks of ice from the lake, hauled it home on sleds pulled by horses and covered it with straw in the root cellar that was dug into a hill near the house, so they would have ice for the ice box to keep their food cool year round.  They couldn't go to the corner grocery and buy ice then, for there was no store within 10 miles, and no ice and no money even if there had been ice.  They had no refrigerator as that was a luxury.  Whatever they needed, they pretty much had to figure out a way to do it or get it themselves.When the girls were old enough, they took care of the younger children.  Their mother worked hard every day just to keep food on the table and keep her family clothed.  She washed clothes in a washtub, rubbing the dirt from them on a washboard.  She ironed the clothes with a flatiron that she heated on her wood burning kitchen stove.  I can't even imagine how many loaves of bread she had to make each week for a family of eleven people, and sometimes twelve, when my great-grandfather or one of her brothers was staying with them, as they did frequently.  The girls worked in the garden.  They picked wild raspberries and blueberries in the summer, along with whatever other wild fruits could be found.  They helped with the cooking and the cleaning and the canning of vegetables from the garden and the preserving of fruit and the making of jam and jelly and pickles.  They churned cream to make butter and gathered eggs from the chickens.  My Dad's oldest sister once remarked that she didn't have a childhood, because she was taking care of her baby brothers and sisters while she was growing up.  That was no easy task in itself, for there were two sets of twins in that family.When the boys were young men, it was in the middle of the Depression.  Money was scarce.  So some of them headed west to the Dakotas and Montana to work.  Dad and his brother Kenneth got jobs picking potatoes in Montana.  Dad told me that there was a machine that was pulled by a team of horses or mules.  That machine dug the potatoes out of the ground and deposited them on the surface.  He and Kenneth went behind, bent over and picked up the potatoes and tossed them into a large wagon.  It was a backbreaking job, but it provided money for the family.  Dad and some of his brothers rode a train to the Dakotas to work on wheat thrashing crews.  Riding in a passenger car was out of the question as there was no money for tickets, so they rode in empty boxcars.  There were huge machines that did the same job that a combine does today, but there was a lot more physical work involved.In the winter the boys would work in the woods.  They felled trees and loaded them on horse drawn wagons or sleds to be taken to the sawmill where they were cut into lumber.  Dad was working in one of these lumberjack camps when he hurt one of his arms.  The boss was going to send him home, but Dad convinced him that he could cook, so they kept him on.  He said that he had to learn how to cook in a real big hurry, as a room full of hungry lumberjacks could get mean really fast!  He must have figured it out because he was one of the best cooks I knew, next to Mother.Three of the girls became teachers to earn money for the family.  At that time a college education wasn't necessary.  All they needed was a teaching certificate.  Each of them taught in country schools until they married.Even though all of Dad's family worked hard, they still had time for fun.  In the summer they would go swimming in Twin lake close to their home.  There was a small river that ran about a mile from the house, and they would go fishing.  They would go to barn dances and house parties.  My grandfather had a good singing voice and he could play the piano, so he entertained his family in that way from time to time.  In the winter they would go sledding on the hill in the pasture across the driveway from the house.  They visited relatives and relatives came to visit them.  There was no television and I think it was after most of the kids had left home before they had a radio. My Dad and all of his siblings had wonderful senses of humor.  Dad has told lots of stories about the pranks they would play, and I will tell you about those later.My Dad had a work ethic second to none.  He worked in a filling station in Blackduck after he married Mom.  He drove a gas truck, delivering gas or fuel oil to farms in the area.  He drove a school bus for a time.  He and Mom moved to St. Paul and stayed with my Grandma Paul when it became clear that Dad just couldn't make a living in the North.  He worked for a time in a factory that made refrigerators and then found the job as a grain sampler in Willmar, where he worked until he retired.  Even when he took on extra work in order to take care of Mom when she needed so much medical care, I never once heard him complain. There was a day that Dad came to see me while I still lived on the Eddy farm.  I was hot and sweaty and dirty from working cleaning the hog barn.  And I was roundly complaining about being so dirty.  He just looked at me and said, \"There is no shame in being dirty from hard work.  The only shame is for being dirty from laziness.\"  Another time when I had a job that I really disliked, he told me that even if I was digging a ditch, I should dig the best ditch that I possibly could.  And that I should not do it to please a boss, but I should do it for the satisfaction of a job well done.I think that pretty much sums up my Dad."},
{"title": "Seamstress Extraordinaire", "date": "Tuesday, July 16, 2013", "text": "My Mother had a talent for sewing.  I am not sure where she learned to sew, for she never said, but I suspect that it might have been from her mother, although I have never heard it mentioned that Grandma sewed.  I just assume so, because at that time girls were taught homemaking skills.  Most folks, particularly those who lived on farms or in small towns where clothing stores were scarce, made most everything they wore.  This was in the Great Depression years and for many, there just wasn't money to spend on clothing.  It was much more economical to buy or barter for fabric and sew what one needed.Mom didn't make quilts, but turned her talent to sewing clothing.  I don't know what sewing machine she might have had in the early years of her marriage to Dad, but in the mid 1950's while we were living on the farm, I remember that Dad bought Mother a new Singer Sewing Machine.  That was an event in our household.  The sewing machine came in a wooden cabinet.  The lid opened up and the machine was lifted up into place.  The lid folded out so that it provided work space for holding fabric while it was being sewn.  I still have that machine, but during the years it sat in storage, it has rusted some.  I sure would like to get it refurbished, as it worked better than any machine I have had since.Mother and I were once looking at old photos.  She pointed to this one and told me that she had taken an old coat of hers, ripped the seams apart and used the fabric to make me this little coat and bonnet.  She remembered that it was sort of an aqua blue.She sewed these little dresses for me as well.I don't recall having any store bought outer clothing until I was well into high school.  Each summer Mother would buy fabric and patterns on sale and sew my school clothes.  One year when money was really scarce, Dad bought flour in cloth sacks that were printed fabric.  Mom washed the flour sacks and made skirts and blouses for me to wear to school.  At that time schools had a dress code and skirts were required for girls.  Below are some photos of the dresses she made for my sister and me.After we moved to the farm, my family became involved in 4-H.  Mom had taught me to sew, and she must have had the patience of Job to do it, as I would much rather have been out climbing trees or catching frogs or digging worms for fishing than sitting inside sewing.  But teach me, she did.  My 4-H projects each year were always sewing and gardening.  One of the requirements for the sewing project was to make an outfit, and then there was a \"fashion show\" where 4-H members modeled their creations.  Mom didn't sew a single stitch in the skirt and blouse that I made one year, even when I whined and cried that I couldn't do it right.  She watched me sew, told me just what to do and made me rip out seams and sew them again when I didn't listen.  That outfit won a blue ribbon at the fashion show and went on to win another at the State Fair.  I gave the ribbons to Mom because I figured that she had earned them much more than I had!This is a photo of Mom wearing one of the dresses she sewed for herself and Dad wearing a shirt she made for him.I have always been in awe of Mom's sewing skills.  What seemed to be easy for her were the things that I struggled to do.  I will always be grateful to Mom for having the patience to teach me a skill that I learned to love.  I have spent many happy hours at a sewing machine, and will probably continue to do so until I can't any more.  Thank you, Mom."},
{"title": "Parents", "date": "Monday, July 15, 2013", "text": "There is a blog that I found recently that is written by a man who writes well on a variety of topics that I find interesting.  He has been kind enough to comment on this blog, particularly expressing his good wishes after the fire in my building.  He is going through a difficult time right now, as his mother is deteriorating in both physical and mental health and decisions have to be made.  He remarked that he has come to the realization that he has only memories left.This caused me to think about my Dad.  I think of him often.  The last time I saw him, he was near death and didn't know who I was until I told him, nor did he recognize his grandson who was with me.  That memory is not what I want to keep in my mind and heart, for at that time he bore little resemblance to the man who raised me.The man I choose to remember is the one who came home with a new lawn mower and had me convinced that it was my birthday present that year, before giving me the softball glove that I had been hounding him to get for me. This same man who, when I took the family car for a drive at age 16 and ran it out of oil, frying the engine, didn't get angry and yell, but patiently explained the inner workings of engines and that checking the oil was a good thing and those red lights had meaning that I needed to pay attention to.  He then made sure that I knew how to check all the fluids in a car and how to change a tire, skills that have helped me since.This same man instilled in me the love of gardening.  He worked along side me, tilling and planting and weeding.  He sat with me in the middle of the tomato patch, salt shaker in hand and with me, ate tomatoes until we could eat no more.  He showed me the fun of trying new things, and each year that we had a garden, we tried some new plant that we had not grown before, just for the fun of seeing what would happen.This same man took me fishing, renting a boat for the day and using the old, temperamental motor that he kept in the trunk of his car all summer long.  He showed me how to choose tackle, how to bait a hook and taught me the patience needed to catch fish.  And in the process, he showed me the beauty of nature around me.This same man took me back of the grove of trees at our home in the country and into the field, set up targets and showed me how to use a gun.  He laughed at me when his old shotgun that I insisted I wanted to try set me back on my butt and he praised me when I hit the target.  Although I don't hunt, he showed me how to safely carry a gun, how to make sure there was nothing beyond a target that a bullet would damage and to make sure I knew exactly what I was aiming at before I fired.  He taught me how to cut up a deer and I have used that skill many times over the years, for sometimes, venison was all that we had to eat for meat.This same man kissed me goodbye every morning before he left for work, for the entire time I lived under his roof.  And when I no longer lived close to him and communicated by telephone, he never failed to end a conversation by saying, \"I sure love you, Sis.\"This same man worked sometimes three jobs at once to care for my mother who was so badly crippled with arthritis.  And the same man who cared for her at home for many years after his retirement until she required more specialized care than he could give.  When I once asked him how he could do this for all those years, he replied, \"I love your mother.\"  That was the only reason necessary for him.This is the man I remember, much more than the frail one in the nursing home.  I think I may have to take the time to write down more of my memories of him, for myself, for my children and for my grandchildren who didn't have the privilege of knowing him."},
{"title": "Easily Amused", "date": "Friday, July 12, 2013", "text": "I don't have to watch TV or go to the movies for my entertainment.  My neighborhood has four bars - one next door, one behind my building and two more in the next block.  On any given night, but especially on the weekend, I can sit in my rocking chair next to a window that looks down onto the street below and be entertained.One of the establishments just recently added one of those rolling bars that is set up like a regular bar with a bartender and bar stools, except it is outdoors and the patrons on the stools sit, drink and pedal like mad as if they were on a bicycle.  I don't know what the name of the contraption is, but it is the silliest looking thing.  It gets even more silly when the patron sitting in the back forgets where he is, slides off his stool and winds up sitting in the middle of the street watching his ride and his drink disappear around the corner.Not very long ago we had a hard rain that left a big puddle in the middle of the alley that is across from my window.  Folks use that alley to walk from one of the bars in the next block to the bar next door to my building.  As I was sitting in my rocking chair in front of my window enjoying the cool evening breeze, I noticed two men walking my way.  The walking part may be exaggerated.  They were more shuffling along, holding each other up, taking extreme care to avoid the rain puddles, right up to the point where they came to the aforementioned big puddle.  One man went to the right and the other to the left.  Now that each no longer had the other to hang onto for support, both started to weave and side-step and both tried really hard to maintain balance.....until both finally gave up and sat down - in the middle of the puddle.  The last I saw of them, they were happily splashing each other like a couple of kids in a bathtub.My all time favorite happened a couple of winters ago.  Snow had been falling steadily all day.  I like to watch the street below, with its old-fashioned looking street lights, turn Christmas card pretty with the snow.  A fellow came out of the bar next door, made his way across the street and started to clean the snow off a car.  He was meticulous about it, making sure the headlights and tail lights were clear of snow, getting the ice off of the windshield wipers and making sure that there was no snow on the hood, roof or any of the windows.  It took him a while, as there had been about a foot of snow on the car, and he was having a time for himself, trying not to slip and slide.  He had just finished, having done a really good job of it, when another fellow came along, looked at the first man, then at the car, shook the first man's hand, slapped him on the back, got into the car and drove away.  The fellow who had spent so much time removing snow from the car just stood and looked at the empty parking space for a time, then put his hands in his pockets and slowly walked away.  I wondered if he had forgotten that he had walked downtown and left his car home in his garage.I have always enjoyed people watching and my location makes it just that much more fun.  I guess I really am easily amused.It is hot here.  Not Texas or Oklahoma hot.  Or desert hot.  But hot for Minnesota.  But then we whine when temps go above 85 degrees.  We are heat wimps.And my air conditioning doesn't seem to be working all that well, due to the wiring that burned in the fire.  I won't complain, however.  I still have a home and it is a bit cooler in here than outside. My landlord's insurance people have been here.  One of them ran a finger over the top of my freezer in the kitchen, which I had already washed down, and another checked out the top of my kitchen table.  Did they really think that I would eat my meals on a table covered in gray smoke film for the four days that passed before they arrived?  My living room got the worst of the smoke, and the gray film on the walls and woodwork is thick enough to write my name in, but that was ignored.  Sigh.They declared my apartment in perfect condition so there will be nobody coming in to do any cleaning.  I had hoped to at least get my carpets done, but it isn't to be.  So I clean in the early mornings and after sundown in the evenings.  I am way too old and too fat to be climbing up and down washing walls during the heat of the day.  Which gives me a really good excuse to take a nap or read or sew or to do something else that is quiet and doesn't expend a lot of energy.  I can live with that!"},
{"title": "Fear", "date": "Monday, July 8, 2013", "text": "Fear is a strange thing.  I have found that over the years, I am one of those people who is pretty good in a crisis.  A friend is in a fearful situation and I can find the calming words to help.  A kid comes into the house with blood dripping and I know just what to do.  And I do it.  And when the crisis has passed and the fear is gone, only then will I quietly fall apart.I have also found that as I get older, my reaction to the fear in a crisis manifests itself in altogether different ways.  Time was that a few tears would dissolve away the fear, but now, my body betrays me.  This was brought home to me this past weekend.  I thought I was just fine, although my apartment building was on fire.  One of the other tenants was in hysterics and another seemed to deal with the fear by becoming angry.  I was calm.  I had escaped the smoke that had threatened to take away my ability to breathe and had survived to see my grandchildren grow up and I would probably achieve my goal of living long enough to be a problem to my children, although some of them might say that I have already attained that goal.  (I once told my youngest daughter that my goal in life was to live long enough to be a problem to my children.  She replied that my work here was done.  I love her sense of humor.)  And then, while I was standing with a police officer, discussing options should I be unable to return to my apartment, my legs began to shake, uncontrollably.  You remember those old Saturday morning cartoons where the hero is afraid and he stands there with his knees knocking?  Yep, I found that it really happens.I think that my children were a bit fearful as well.  Since the fire, they have been calling often, sometimes a couple of times a day.  Checking up on Mom.  Making sure that I am alright.  The daughter living closest to me brought fans to help remove the smoke smell, as well as my supper so I didn't have to worry about cooking anything.  She asked if I wanted to go home with her, but I declined even though I appreciated the offer.  They have all offered to come and help with the scrubbing and cleaning and I know that if I needed help with that, they would be here.  They have all done things like this for me in the past.I won't ask for help this time.  They all have kids to care for and jobs to deal with.  I am retired and have all the time in the world.  And I think that the physical work of getting my apartment back to normal is a good way to work through any lingering fear.  My legs no longer shake.  I am calm.  But my body is still reacting by waking me up a couple of times during the past two nights, telling me that I have to get out of bed and check to make sure all is well.  I expect this will go away after a time.  I have learned a lesson about fear.  It enters my being unannounced and unwelcomed.  The trick is to not allow fear to take control.  I  refuse to live a life in fear of what might happen, for that is probably worse than the actual event.  Now if I can just convince my aging body that all is well, I can get back to working at being a problem to my children!"},
{"title": "Fire", "date": "Saturday, July 6, 2013", "text": "How quickly a persons  life can change.  One minute I am washing a sink load of dishes and the next I am sitting across the street watching our local firemen fighting the fire in my  building.I first smelled the smoke.  I didn't think too much about it.  I live in a downtown apartment and all sorts of smells reach my windows from time to time.  But then I could see the smoke pouring out of the vents in my floors, so I ran into my bedroom to call 911 and get dressed.  By the time that was accomplished, the smoke was so thick that I couldn't find my dogs, who were at the other end of my apartment.  I could barely breathe and I had to leave them.  Once outside, a policeman was asking me about the other tenants, as some weren't responding to knocks at their doors.  When all of the people were accounted for, I told them that I'd had to leave without my Yorkies.  Bless them, they went upstairs, found the dogs and brought them down to me. Even before the smoke had cleared, there were firemen in my apartment looking for my cat, Kizzie.  They looked everywhere, as I have since, and so far she is nowhere to be found.  I don't know if she is really well hidden or if she got out of the building.  All I can do is keep looking. I am extremely fortunate that my apartment is still usable.  My daughter went to the store, bought box fans and brought them to me.  They are in my windows as I write, trying to get rid of the smoke smell.  I will have to wash everything down, but at least I still have walls to wash.  The poor lady in the apartment where the fire started has nothing. I have learned a couple of things from this experience.  I don't have a cell phone to keep family phone numbers handy, so I need to write them down and put them, along with my most important papers somewhere near the door of my apartment.  I need to make sure that there is enough cash included to get me through a few days.  I have put the dogs' harnesses on them so if I should ever again have to leave quickly, all I have to do is snap on the leashes and go.  And as soon as I finish washing the smoke from my walls, cupboards, etc., I will get all of my photos onto DVDs and give each of my children a copy.I thought I was prepared, but it only took one incident like this to point out to me that I had left my home with only my keys and the clothes I was wearing.  I had no phone numbers, no money and no pets.  I will have to do better than that.P.S.  About midnight, Kizzie the cat turned up.  I have no clue where in the apartment she had been hiding, but she is alive and well with no apparent problems from all of the smoke.  So all of us in my little Home Sweet Home are accounted for and are doing just fine.  Thank you, God."},

The rest of my evening will be taken up with some hand sewing on a quilt that I am working on, and I will most likely, between 8:00 PM and 9:30 PM be watching Masterpiece Mystery on PBS while I sew.So there you have it.  Now that you know what my schedule is, you can go spy on someone else.  Have a good day."},
{"title": "Breakfast From Food Storage", "date": "Saturday, June 29, 2013", "text": "I was in a hurry this morning.  I needed to finish a few things around the apartment before watching my granddaughters dance this afternoon via live feed from Nationals in Kansas City.  (Who am I kidding.  I am retired.  I don't have a schedule.  Just makes me sound important to pretend to have one.)  At any rate, I decided to go with quick and easy for breakfast, which turned out to be lunch as well.I buy very few convenience foods, so the ones I have are usually homemade.  Today I had a hankering for biscuits and sausage gravy.A few weeks ago I made some homemade Bisquick mix, so I used it to stir up a pan of biscuits.  They were good.  Not as good as my homemade from scratch biscuits, which are awesome, but good, none the less.  While the biscuits were baking, I got out a jar of homemade chicken gravy mix and got a couple cups of gravy heating on the stove.  When it had thickened, I added a half-pint jar of home canned crumbled sausage and let it simmer.  Some say that you should not can sausage that contains sage, but this sausage has sage in it, and it turned out really good.  In the time it took to bake the biscuits, breakfast was ready.I love my food storage.  It makes life so much easier for me.  I now go to the grocery only to replenish what I have used or if there is something on sale that week that I want to buy.  Last winter when the snow was falling and the sidewalks were full of ice, I only had to go out to the store a couple of times, and that was by choice and not by necessity.  Sometimes folks laugh at me when I am busy canning hamburger or tomato sauce or peaches.  They can't figure out why I bother.  After all, those things are on the store shelves, so why go to all that work.In the middle of winter when it is cold and windy, or in the summer when storms are predicted and people are standing in line to buy a loaf of bread or a gallon of milk, that is when I have the last laugh, because I am snug in my little apartment, happily doing whatever I want to do without having to run to the store.Here are the recipes for my homemade convenience foods.  I have gleaned these recipes from the internet and have no idea of their original source.Homemade Bisquick Mix9 cups sifted all-purpose flour1/3 cup double-acting baking powder1 tablespoon salt1 teaspoon cream of tartar1/4 cup sugar2 cups shortening which does not require refrigerationWhisk together the dry ingredients.  Cut in the shortening (I used a hand held electric mixer) until the mixture resembles cornmeal.  Store in an airtight container.To make biscuits, stir together 3 parts Mix and 1 part water.  If too sticky, add more mix.  If too dry, add more water.  Gently knead about 10 times.  Cut biscuits, place on baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned.Homemade Chicken Gravy MixMakes about 2 cups of mix.1-1/3 cups powdered milk3/4 cup flour3 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules1/4 teaspoon sage1/4 teaspoon onion powder1/4 teaspoon garlic powder1/8 teaspoon pepperMix well and store in an airtight container.To use, whisk together 1 part Mix with 2 parts water.  Stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly.Note:  I usually quadruple this recipe and store it in quart size canning jars.  I use it not only for gravy, but to thicken chicken stew or chicken pot pie, and often will use it in place of a can of cream soup in a casserole recipe.Food storage - Makes all the sense in the world to me."},

My son, daughter-in-law and their three children are in Kansas City for Boston and Maddie's dance competition at Nationals.  Incidentally, the kids thought it was really cool that they drove in four states on their way to Kansas City.  Anyway, David called to let me know what time Maddie and Boston would be dancing last evening and this morning.  Maddie was first last evening.  And this is where the dunderhead part comes in.Staci had left a link on Facebook so those interested could watch the girls dance on a live feed.  I found the site, got logged in and was really excited to watch my beautiful grandbaby dance.  I love to watch her dance.  She so clearly loves what she is doing.  But there was a monkey wrench thrown into the works.  This competition is so huge that there are three stages of performers going on at one time.  And the live feed that I had in front of me was not the stage where she was scheduled to dance.  I clicked on links, searched the entire website and finally found the feed for the stage where she was performing.....10 minutes after she and the two girls in her trio had completed their performance.  AAARRRGGGH!Here is Maddie in the center, with the other girls who form the trio, just before they went on stage.  I know that Maddie will forgive me for being a dunderhead and missing her dance, because she loves her Grandma.  Her Dad tells me that the girls did an awesome job.Boston's solo performance is scheduled for later this morning and I am ready.  I have bookmarked the page I need to open to see her dance, I have a fresh pot of coffee brewing and there are appropriate snacks at my elbow.  I'm not gonna miss this one!Good luck, girls.  Knock their socks off!"},
{"title": "Lazy", "date": "Tuesday, June 25, 2013", "text": "I have gotten lazy.  I freely admit it after reasoning this morning that there was no other word for my behavior.A couple of years ago I took the time to make my own dog food.  Then I got lazy and went back to buying the dry kind at the grocery.  Even the increase in the price of commercial dog food didn't deter me.  Until today.I have two Yorkies.  They need to be fed.  I am nearly out of dry dog food.  To get more food, I need to put on shoes along with the rest of my clothes and take the bus to the store.  I have arthritis, which has been a bit worse than usual this spring.  The kind of arthritis I have causes joints to ache and my feet and ankles to swell.  My back tends to go out more often than I do.  This isn't a complaint, just a statement of fact.  Lots of people are in far more pain with problems much worse than mine.  This morning I couldn't get my fat foot into my left shoe.  No way.  Wasn't going to happen.  That's when I decided that I had gotten lazy.As I sat grumbling about the fact that I just wasn't going to be going anywhere barefoot today I got to thinking that if I hadn't gotten so lazy and stopped making my own dog food, I wouldn't be sitting here grumbling about the fact that I couldn't go anywhere today.  After all, I am forever preaching about being prepared, and I am at least in the food department.  Time to put my money where my mouth is. I dug into my stores and got out a bag of rice.  Next I went to my canned goods shelves and got two quarts of home canned sliced carrots along with four pint jars of diced pork butt.  I had experimented with canning pork butt when it was on sale and was less than thrilled with the results, but I'll bet the dogs will love it.  I can't stand to waste anything.  Also grabbed a jar of turkey broth.  Dumped the broth and some water into a pot.  Added the rice and cooked it until it was done and fluffy.  I think the broth will add to the flavor and make the dogs happy.  When the rice had cooled down some I tossed it into a big bowl and added the carrots and pork.  Got in there with my hands and mixed the whole works together.  Hands are the very best kitchen tools ever made.By this time Lily and Jessie Jane were dancing around my feet.  They sure did like the smells coming from this big bowl.  Time to see if they liked the taste as well as the smells.  Put about a half a cup in each of two small bowls and set the bowls on the floor.  I'm not really sure if they ate the dog food or just inhaled it, but it was a rousing success.So now I have a couple of quart bags of dog food in the fridge for their meals in the next few days and another eight bags in the freezer.  I don't know why it took me so long to get back to making their food.  (Yes, I do.  I got lazy.)  It is much better for them than the stuff that I was buying.  I am not sure of the ages of my Yorkies as I got them when they were already older, but I am guessing they are between 10 and 12 years.  Maybe if I continue giving them good homemade food, I just might be able to enjoy them for many more years."},
{"title": "Good Morning...or Not", "date": "Saturday, June 1, 2013", "text": "So.....I wake up early this morning, not to the sounds of cute little birds singing outside my window, but to wave after wave of sirens going by.  I have no idea what is going on.  I can't see anything unusual from my windows, nor do I smell any smoke.  I guess that is a good thing.  I won't have to evacuate.The sounds of the sirens have awakened my little nine-pound bundle of energy named Lilly, the Yorkie.  She doesn't bark at sirens.  But she is awake and she wants the dog biscuit she gets upon my awakening each morning.  And she wants it now!  She has me well trained.  I tell her that in doggy years she is at the very least, a seventy year old woman who should be asleep at this hour, rather than yipping at my bedroom door.  She ignores me.  So to keep her from annoying my neighbors, I get up.On my way to the treat jar in the kitchen, I slip and slide in a pool of hair ball cat puke.  Thank you so very much, Kizzie the cat.  Kizzie has been leaving me similar gifts this week.  I know that this is fairly normal for a cat to hack up a hair ball now and then, but I really hope she is finished with this for a while.By the time I clean off the bottom of my foot and wipe up the mess on the floor, Lilly is in a frenzy of what I call the Yorkie Dance Team Cookie Dance.  Her sister, Jessie Jane, having been awakened by all the commotion, has joined in the dance.  The only good thing I can say is that Jessie does her Cookie Dance silently.  I don't think I have ever heard her bark.  I will never understand why they get so excited about a tiny bit of rock hard, foul smelling dog biscuit.  But they do.  Every morning.My little old lady pooches settle back down in their beds for a nap, which will last pretty much the whole morning.  Kizzie takes her place in the chair by the window to keep an eye on the world outside.  I am left here............. without a calming cigarette.The legislature in my state has decided to double the tax on cigarettes to help pay for a  fancy new football stadium.  And because I am ornery enough to refuse to contribute one thin dime towards a stadium being built for a bunch of over paid jocks that I will never see play in said stadium because I can't afford the price of a ticket, I will buy no more cigarettes.  I don't know which is worse - the withdrawl that I am going through or listening to the self-righteous non-smokers pontificate about how healthier I will be because I can't afford cigarettes any more.I don't know about you, but I am really tired of government \"helping\" me.  I have known for quite some time that quitting smoking was in my near future.  But I resent the hell out of government forcing me to quit by jacking up the price of a pack.  I think that this would have been much easier for me if I had the choice of making that decision on my own, in my own time.  I probably would have, left to my own choices in the matter, been much less grumpy.So....how is your day going so far?"},

{"title": "Scoundrels", "date": "Wednesday, May 29, 2013", "text": "I have been enjoying working on my family history these cool and rainy days when I really don't want to get wet unless it is by taking a nice hot shower.  I have been told, over the years, that I should not worry about going out in the rain because I most definitely am not made of sugar, and therefore will not melt, but all the same, walking in the rain is not a favorite pastime of mine.  So here at my computer I sit, delving into the lives of so many who have gone before me.I marvel at the strength of some of these people.  Those who, in the early 1600's, came to these shores by ship from Scotland and England, others who traveled by covered wagon from Indiana to Minnesota, and later, those who left the southern part of this state to make a home in the forests of northern Minnesota, at a time when roads were nearly nonexistent.  Their courage is amazing.Unlike many who seek their ancestors, I don't do it through rose colored glasses.  Most were fine, upstanding individuals who went on to raise families and have descendants of whom they would be proud.  But now and then I come upon a scoundrel, and it is fun for me to gather information about these folks.  Especially if said scoundrel belongs to a branch of my family that has become name proud and firmly believes that each and every member of this family would qualify for sainthood.  I can't help it.  My sense of humor gets in the way of that sort of pride.Another family researcher wrote about the sterling qualities of an ancestor who fought in the Civil War.  Granted, he fought in many major battles, many of which are written into books on that subject.  But this particular researcher neglected to mention that this same ancestor was busted down to Private and lost three months pay for being drunk on guard duty.Another ancestor was such a nasty drunk that he was forced to leave the village where he lived.  According to various court records, he had numerous altercations with neighbors and it seems that they got tired of dealing with him.  I am happy to report that that was the only instance I have found of a family member being ridden out of town on a rail.One branch of my family had an inclination to marry within the family.  I realize that a couple of hundred years ago the gene pool was pretty small and there may not have been all that many to choose from.  But many in this family seemed to prefer cousins.  I sometimes wonder why I wasn't born with one eye in the middle of my forehead and three ears.  But it seems that this inclination died out in later generations.There is no disrespect for these ancestors of mine.  But while looking for facts from the past I have found that many genealogists brag that their ancestors came over on the Mayflower, traveled west with Lewis and Clark, were heroic beyond belief in war time, or were sired by royalty.  My scoundrels tend to keep any bragging to a minimum.  They keep me grounded and make them more real to me as people who were human and had the faults of humanity.And they most definitely make things more interesting."},

{"title": "Who Will Take My Place", "date": "Thursday, May 23, 2013", "text": "Usually, of an evening, after my dishes are done, after the dogs have had their nightly snoogles and pets and the cat has had my undivided attention for a time, I will settle down to a few hours of relaxation.  I don't care to just sit, for that makes me a bit crazy, so I will sew or crochet or read others blogs or maybe a good book.  But lately I have felt the need to get back to working on my family history.  I have shamefully neglected it for quite some time and in an ill-conceived idea of combining two of my genealogy programs into one, I pretty much screwed up both of them yesterday, making it necessary to start again with the entering of information. Thankfully, I have an external hard drive that contains most of what I messed up, along with the files and photos stored in my computer, so the job isn't all that daunting.....just time consuming.  After I had grumbled a while about my lack of foresight as to what would happen when combining programs, and about the time it takes to enter everything the right way, I got to thinking that some of my ancestors have waited several centuries to be acknowledged.  I guess with that in mind, a few days of work on my part isn't all that important.I also found the following on my external hard drive.  I saved it a few years ago and had forgotten about it.  I thought I might share it, for it expresses how I feel about my family history.We Are The Chosen In each family there is one who seems called to find the ancestors.  To put flesh on their bones and make them live again, to tell the family story and to feel that somehow they know and approve.Doing genealogy is not a cold gathering of facts but, instead, breathing life into all who have gone before.We are the story tellers of the tribe.   All tribes have one.  We have been called, as it were, by our genes.  Those who have gone before cry out to us, \"Tell our story.\"  So, we do.In finding them, we somehow find ourselves.  How many graves have I stood before now and cried?  I have lost count.  How many times have I told the ancestors, \"You have a wonderful family; you would be proud of us.\"  How many times have I walked up to a grave and felt somehow there was love there for me?  I cannot say.It goes beyond just documenting facts.  It goes to who am I and why I do the things I do.  It goes to seeing a cemetery about to be lost forever to weeds and indifference and saying I can't let this happen.The bones here are bones of my bone and flesh of my flesh.  It goes to doing something about it.  It goes to pride in what our ancestors were able to accomplish, how they contributed to what we are today. It goes to respecting their hardships and losses, their never giving in or giving up, their resoluteness to go on and build a life for their family.  It goes to deep pride that the fathers fought and some died to make and keep us a Nation.  It goes to a deep and immense understanding that they were doing it for us.It is of equal pride and love that our mothers struggled to give us birth, without them we could not exist, and so we love each one, as far back as we can reach.  That we might be born who we are.  That we might remember them.  So we do. With love and caring and scribing each fact of their existence, because we are they and they are the sum of who we are.  So, as a scribe called, I tell the story of my family.It is up to that one called in the next generation to answer the call and take my place in the long line of family storytellers. That is why I do my family genealogy, and that is what calls those young and old to step up and restore the memory or greet those whom we had never known before.(Unknown Author)As each of my years fly on by, and indeed they do seem to fly these days, it becomes more important than ever to me to complete as much of this family research as I can.  I worry sometimes that none of my descendants will care enough to continue this journey after I am gone.  I hope and pray that at least one will be \"The Chosen.\""},
{"title": "Dance Recital 2013", "date": "Sunday, May 19, 2013", "text": "It's that time of year again for one of my most favorite things to do - attend my granddaughters dance recital.  This year, there were a couple of bonuses for me.The first was when David and Jacob picked me up about noon.  After we arrived at their home, Jacob and I had a great afternoon.  We helped his Dad plant corn in the garden.  Well, Jacob helped and Grandma did what she does best - supervise.  Jacob showed me how high he could go on his swing and how far he could fly when he jumped off.  He flies pretty well.  And he showed me how high his toy rocket could fly and how well he can catch a ball with his baseball glove.  We played some board games and I was trounced, and we read books and watched a little TV together.  It was a busy afternoon that I thoroughly enjoyed.  And in between all the activities that Jacob had for us, it was really nice to be able to sit with my son and just talk.  We don't get a chance to do that very often.Then, after a grilled chicken supper, it was on to the recital.  David was running a few minutes late, which is understandable when you are dealing with a slow Mom and an active 5 year old!  Unfortunately, about half-way to the school where the recital is held, we discovered that our tickets were sitting on the kitchen counter back at the house, which did us no good at all.  So after backtracking to retrieve the tickets, we still managed to arrived in time.The recital was wonderful.  Both of my beautiful granddaughters (Yes.  I am bragging.  Grandmas get to brag.  It says so in the bylaws.) are on competition teams, and this year I got to see some of the dances they performed at the various competitions.  I think that this recital featured more of the competition teams dances than had previous recitals.  Because I can't get to their competitions, this was extra special fun for me to see them dance these dances in person.  They were great!  I loved every second of it.  I am so proud of these two girls, who put their hearts and souls into their art, and it shows.A lot of credit has to go to Boston and Maddie's parents.  Not only do they run them back and forth for practice sessions and lessons at the Jete Dance Centre, but they spend many weekends at competitions with them. And Staci is with the girls backstage, helping with costume changes and hair styles for each number.  David always participates in the \"Daddy - Daughter Dance\" which is really fun to see. There is another bonus for me at recital time.  I get to see people that I rarely have the chance to see at other times.  Staci's parents were there and it is always good for me when I can see them.  This year, two of the girls Great-Aunts attended as well.  They were seated in a location too far away for conversation, but afterward Janet took her sister, Jeanine home, and then drove me home as well.  We all had time then for a nice chat.  I was so glad that they were able to be there.I just can't think of a better way to spend a Saturday, and I am making my reservation for next year.  Wouldn't miss it for anything!"},

But after about a half hour of music, I found that I really didn't mind the scrubbing and mucking out.  I found myself singing along with the music.  That is kind of scary because I can't carry a tune in a bucket.  I get that from my Dad.  My sister and I never fought about who got to sit next to Dad in church.  We fought about who had to sit next to him, because when the hymns were sung, he was always out of tune.  Which is kind of sad, because he loved to sing.  I can still remember him singing to me when I was just a itty bitty girl.  He loved old cowboy songs and many a night he would rock me to sleep to the tune of \"Red River Valley\" or some other old timey song.  Funny, I never noticed that he sang out of tune then.  But then, I was just a little girl who loved to have her Daddy sing her to sleep and not a judgemental teenager who found fault with her parents at every opportunity. Maybe that is the sad part, that when we grow older, we look for the bad and don't take the time to just enjoy the good, whether it is slightly out of tune or not."},

{"title": "Is It Spring Yet?", "date": "Wednesday, April 17, 2013", "text": "The calendar says it is, but looking outside, I'm not so sure.  I saw a couple of snowflakes drift past my window earlier, and it looks like there may be some more of that nasty white stuff headed this way.  Mother Nature has a mean streak!I can't complain too much.  Well, actually, I can, but it does no good, so why bother.  Yesterday was one of the nicest days I have seen in a while, so I took advantage of it and was out and about. My local grocery had whole boneless hams on sale, as well as sausage, so I got some of each and canned it up today.  I wound up with 11 pints of ham cubes, which will be really good in ham and scalloped potato dishes, and 26 half pints of sausage.  Sausage gravy over homemade biscuits, here I come.  Love the sausage mixed with scrambled eggs and topped with a little cheese, too.Tomorrow morning I'll remove the rings, wash the jars and label them.  Then onto the shelves they go until I get a craving for something delicious and homemade.The Cub Foods store here has been recently carrying products different from what was offered in the past, and yesterday I saw something new.  They had large packages of sliced pepperoni for cheap, and as I like to make my own pizzas, it looked like a good deal.  I found that the packages included some chunks from the ends of pepperoni sticks, but that was fine with me.  I've got 10 half pint jars of pepperoni on my shelf now.  I probably wouldn't have thought about canning pepperoni if it weren't for Jackie Clay at Backwoods Home Magazine online.  She and her husband homestead north of Duluth, and some time back she wrote about canning pepperoni and other sausages of that type.  Following her instructions, I found that it worked well.  Using this pepperoni along with the pizza sauce I canned last summer, I can have pizza whenever I want, without paying to have it delivered.Not much else going on here in my little apartment.  I thought about doing some serious spring cleaning, but so far it is in the planning stages.  I just can't get too excited about washing walls and cleaning cupboards until it is warm enough to have my windows open and have fresh air blowing through.  At the rate it is warming up here in Minnesota, we're looking at maybe July?\"Before our white brothers arrived to make us civilized men, we didn't have any kind of prison. Because of this, we had no delinquents. Without a prison, there can be no delinquents. We had no locks nor keys and therefore among us there were no thieves. When someone was so poor that he couldn't afford a horse, a tent or a blanket, he would, in that case, receive it all as a gift.We were too uncivilized to give great importance to private property. We didn't know any kind of money and consequently, the value of a human being was not determined by his wealth. We had no written laws laid down, no lawyers, no politicians, therefore we were not able to cheat and swindle one another.We were really in bad shape before the white men arrived and I don't know how to explain how we were able to manage without these fundamental things that (so they tell us) are so necessary for a civilized society.\"- John (Fire) Lame Deer, Sioux Lakota, 1903-1976We should be so civilized."},
{"title": "Noodle", "date": "Tuesday, November 27, 2012", "text": "(The following occurred right after I posted about taking a blogging break.  I need to post this now, rather than waiting until spring.)NoodleNoodle was a one-of-a-kind cat.  Not in his breed, which was everyday Tabby, but in his personality.  He was lively, mischievous and an all around pain in the whatever.  And I was silly in love with him.Noodle came to live with my son when he married Staci.  Sort of a package deal.  They also had Charlie the Beagle, who was kenneled during the day while they were at work, because he had a passion for chewing on cupboards.  Noodle spent his days harassing poor Charlie, who couldn't get to Noodle to teach him some manners.  Eventually it was decided that Noodle might be happier living with me.  Charlie would certainly be happier.I don't know for sure whether a cat has the capacity for revenge, but I would almost swear that Noodle did.  When I wouldn't share a pan of brownies with him, he stomped through the middle of them.When I banned him from my bedroom because he thought that chewing on my hair was lots of fun, he would sit outside the bedroom door and yowl at the top of his lungs - at 2:30 AM.  When I left the house without his permission, he made sure that he knocked my computer mouse off the desk and onto the floor.  (I finally got a wireless mouse and hid it in the desk drawer when not in use.)  He has been known to knock all sorts of things off onto the floor, but he was particularly fond of my mouse.My Yorkies loved Noodle.  The cat food dish is kept on top of my chest freezer in my kitchen.  This is to keep the dogs out of the cat food.  But Noodle didn't mind sharing.  He would flip pieces of the dry food out of his bowl and onto the floor.  As long as the dogs were there scarfing up the cat food, he would keep on flipping it to them.I have a pillow behind me on my computer chair for back support.  On top of that pillow was Noodle's favorite spot to sleep.  But only when I was sitting in the chair.  When I got to the point where I was in danger of sliding off the chair, I would reach behind me and scoot him off the chair and onto the floor.  That didn't bother Noodle in the least.  He just strolled under my chair and hopped back up on the side opposite of where he had been unseated.  Time and time again.  He could have played that game all day.I am not sure of Noodle's actual age, but he was no longer young.  For that reason I kept an eye on him.  The Sunday evening after Thanksgiving, I noticed that he was acting a bit odd.  He didn't try to jump into my chair, or any of his other sleeping spots, but would lay quietly on the floor next to me.  He yowled once or twice, and I put him on my recliner, his usual nap spot.  The next morning I couldn't find him.  He was usually waiting for me by his food bowl every morning.  I hunted for him and finally found him sleeping behind my TV stand in the living room.  As he was sleeping, I left him alone.  When he came out in the early afternoon, it was obvious he was in distress.  It was then I called David, who came right away and took him to a vet.  There was nothing to be done for him.Noodle lived with me for at least 8 years.  Maybe longer.  He was like a naughty little boy who, when he does something bad (but never really bad), you have to try really hard not to laugh while scolding him.I hope that Kitty Heaven has lots of things to knock onto floors and lots of dogs to harass.  And most of all, lots of pillows to snooze on."},

Not content with just rolls, I made another large batch of bread dough.....enough for two loaves and a pan of cinnamon rolls.  If I am going to make a mess, I might as well make it worthwhile.  All of it turned out really good.I miss having kids around to swipe hot rolls just out of the oven, slathering them with butter.  Or fighting over who gets the heel from a warm loaf of bread.  Eating the heel isn't quite as much fun if you can't beat a sibling to it."},
{"title": "Digital Books", "date": "Monday, November 12, 2012", "text": "I have been having a bit of fun lately, downloading digital books.  I found several websites that have free downloads of books where the copyrights have expired.  They are old books - many from the early 1900's, but they are interesting to me. I love the old cookbooks.  You need a bit of an imagination to figure out some of the instructions:  \"Take a cupful of flour and a spoon of fat...\"   \"Cook until it resembles cornmeal mush...\"   I particularly like this recipe for butterscotch:Butter Scotch1/2 Cupful of Molasses1/2 Cupful of Sugar1/2 Cupful of ButterBoil until it strings. Pour into buttered tin and when cold break into pieces. This is very nice when cooled on snow.I have downloaded novels and biographies and poetry as well as old cookbooks.  I don't have a Kindle as I just can't justify spending that much money, but I did download a free Kindle Reader that works well on my computer.  Some books I have in a text format.  They are all fun to read.  The only drawback is that it is sort of hard to curl up in a comfy chair to read from a computer that is not a laptop!I also have built up a library of audio books from some of these same websites.  My computer is located next to my kitchen.  I take a speaker, set it on a little table around the corner from my computer, and listen to books being read to me while I work in my kitchen.  Even though these books are old, they are still interesting and I don't have to go out and buy reading material.  Which is a good thing because for me, being without something to read is a disaster.Here are some of the websites where I found books:http://freekindlebooks.org/http://manybooks.net/http://www.gutenberg.org/The  free Kindle for PC came from Amazon.com.As a person who loves a good sale, I can testify that free is even better, especially when it comes to books.  And given the fact that space is very limited in my apartment, this works well for me.So go.....download a book.....turn off the TV.....and read something."},

{"title": "Simple Happiness", "date": "Thursday, November 8, 2012", "text": "One of the advantages of living a simple lifestyle is that it takes very little to make me happy.  My happiness doesn't come from the amount of money I have or the stuff I own.  It comes from the little things.Like today.  While at the grocery store I checked the price of hamburger.  The kind I usually buy was $2.59 a pound.  I put a 5 lb. package in my cart.  About 20 minutes later I was back at the meat counter looking for something I had forgotten, and found that the hamburger had been reduced to $1.29 a pound.  Today was the \"Sell By\" date.  So this time I put 30 lbs into my cart. After I got home, I browned it all and packed part of it into pint jars.  The third canner load is processing as I write.  Will finish canning the rest tomorrow morning.  I should wind up with at least 35 pints of hamburger.  That amounts to close to 70 meals for me, as I can generally get two meals out of one pint jar.Yep.....it's the little things.By the way.....if anyone is interested in canning hamburger, I have tried a couple of different methods.  The first hamburger I canned, I browned the meat, packed it into jars, added broth and canned it according to the directions for ground beef.  When I tried a jar of that hamburger, I wasn't at all happy with it.  It turned out with sort of the taste and consistency of dog food.  Which is what I will use that batch for.Then I read a post by Jackie Clay on the Backwoods Home blog.  She is a canning goddess and many of the methods and recipes I use successfully come from her blog.  (The link is in the sidebar.)  She said that the method she uses for hamburger is the same process I used, except she doesn't add any liquid to the jars.  I tried it and it worked like a charm.  The hamburger turns out just like it was cooked fresh.Another of those simple things that make me happy."},
{"title": "Back From Blogging Break", "date": "Monday, November 5, 2012", "text": "I have taken a bit of a break from blogging.  This fall I had fruit and produce coming at me from all directions.  It seemed that I no sooner was done with one batch when another would appear.I canned ten crates of peaches and eight of pears.  There were two batches of tomatoes, 150 lbs in each batch.  Then there was 200 lbs of potatoes and 30 lbs of carrots, not to mention a big box of cranberries and some huge cabbages and a dozen big green peppers.  Oh, and don't forget the apples.....at least 40 lbs of them.  God bless Duane who made a couple of extra trips with the fruit for me and both Duane and Becky for the trips to the Farmer's Market.  And most of all for huffing all of it up the stairs for me.  To say nothing of the cases of canning jars.  I never would have been able to do all of this had they not helped me so much.I lost track after a while of how many jars of fruit and produce I got out of all of that.  But I made peach and pear sauce and a little peach jam, about a dozen jars of canned cabbage, many quarts of potatoes and carrots combined, and many more jars of cubed potatoes.  There are jars of pasta sauce, pizza sauce and tomatoes with green peppers and onions and more of tomato juice.  And jars of homemade vegetable soup.I had wanted to try making cranberry juice, so I did that this year and it turned out great.  I think I had over 50 jars of juice.  Before I drank some of it! There was lots of pulp left after making the juice, so I ran that through my food mill and added an equal amount of cooked apples and some sugar to sweeten it a little.  Made really good cranberry applesauce.I dehydrated about two quarts of chopped cranberries to use in cranberry bread and muffins, and dried more apples.  I also dried some of the cabbage as it works really well in soup.  And dried cranberries and apple peels, ground into a powder, make a good, soothing tea.I still have lots of tomatoes that have been peeled and diced, in my freezer.  Some of that will be made into chili to can and the rest used for pasta sauce and tomato juice.So now I just need to concentrate on canning meat.  I have been hearing rumors that prices may go down some, so I hope to get some good sale buys.  I don't cook big meals the way I did when my family was home.  Now that I live alone, I really like being able to open a jar or two and have a good meal.I realize that some in my family think that I go way overboard on the canning and dehydrating.  But then I watched news stories last week about the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and saw the pictures of people standing in line for food and heard the stories of grocery stores either stripped bare or cash registers not working due to the lack of electricity.  And the pictures of people digging in dumpsters looking for food.  Now, here in the upper Midwest we don't get hurricanes.  What we get are straight line wind storms, rain storms with lots of thunder and lightning, tornadoes and blizzards, all of which can knock out electric service.If a tornado takes the building I live in, then I am out of luck.  But if not, I am ready.  Nobody in my family will have to stand in line and beg for food or go dumpster diving in order to eat.  That is a comfort to me, gives me peace of mind and is well worth all of the work that goes into preparing and canning food.And then I took a week and pretty much did nothing.  Life is good."},

{"title": "Old Folks Dictionary", "date": "Friday, July 13, 2012", "text": "I think someone should publish an old folks dictionary.  Fill it with terms that have meaning to nearly everyone over the age of fifty.  It would be a big help to grandchildren who have never heard of the terms and would make it easier for them to understand us.  For instance.....Sunday Afternoon Ride:  When Dad would pile us kids in the car and we would just take off for parts unknown, usually within a ten mile radius of home.  We would look at the crops or the beautiful fall leaves or maybe wind up at the river, looking for huge clam shells.  If we were really good, there might be a stop for ice cream.Going Visiting:  Sometimes a Sunday afternoon ride would end up at a friend or relatives house, where we would play with the kids and the grown-ups would visit.  There was usually lemonade and cake involved.Sunday Company:  That's when somebody else's Sunday afternoon ride wound up at our house.Visiting:  That's when friends or relatives sat on the front porch of a summer afternoon, and talked.  Not on cell phones.  No texting.  Nothing remotely computer related.  They talked.  As in have a conversation.  Which seems to be a dying art.Play Outside:  That's what we did, as kids, from morning to night.  Without parents hovering over us.  Without helmets and a ton of other gear to protect us.  We played ball or hide and seek or any number of outdoor games.  Nothing was pre-planned.  We didn't make play dates.  We just played, which is what kids are supposed to do.School Picnic:  That's when the entire neighborhood would gather at the two-room country school I attended.  Each family brought something good to eat for a potluck picnic.  The Dads would usually get up a softball game and the Moms would catch up on the neighborhood gossip.  And the kids ran around and played, which is what kids are supposed to do.Potluck:  Everybody brings a dish to share.  Usually a casserole or salad of some kind.  And a pie or cake or cookies.  Nobody worried about the number of calories or fat grams, or whether there was a balance of \"healthy\" food.  We just ate and enjoyed.Christmas Pageant:  That's when the school kids would put on a program  for the parents.  It wasn't a \"Holiday Pageant.\"  It was a Christmas Pageant, with usually a combination of Santa Claus, Angels and the Baby Jesus.  Nobody thought about it being politically incorrect.  Of course, at that time, Christmas was still Christmas.OK.  So when I write my Old Folks Dictionary, I suppose I had better change the title to Grumpy Old Folks Dictionary.  I tend to get a little grumpy when I see so many of the simple pleasures in life go by the wayside in favor of technology.  I am not such a Luddite that I can't see the distinct advantages to todays technology.  After all, this blog is written and published using a computer.  But I sometimes think that technology is taking over our lives.  Some of us go through withdrawl if we can't send or receive a text every few minutes.  Others can't live without their laptop.  We rarely have verbal, face to face conversations any more.  It is sort of sad, really.I will get off my soapbox now.And go for a walk:  That's when a person leaves the house, goes somewhere that doesn't require transportation, and enjoys seeing the green grass and trees, the flowers, the eagles that soar over the river, and breathes in fresh air.  And leaves the phone at home."},

{"title": "Grandma's Attic", "date": "Wednesday, June 13, 2012", "text": "My Grandma Paul's house in St. Paul had the most wonderful attic.  When I was just a little girl, she would let me play there on rainy days.  Any cloud that produced more than three drops of rain would send me running to find Grandma and beg her to let me go play in the attic.  She would smile, take me by the hand and lead me up the stairs.  She had an old, heavy flat iron that she would use to prop open the door so it wouldn't swing shut and trap me inside.The attic had a dusty, uneven wooden floor and a window in one end for light.  Some thought it was a sort of creepy, scary place, but I loved it.  The attic was filled with treasures that would keep me occupied for hours.  One end of the attic was out of bounds to me, I suppose because the things stored there weren't for little girls to play with and break.  But the end nearest the window was all mine.There were trunks filled with old clothes, shoes and hats that were perfect for playing dress-up.  There were toys from when my mother and aunts and uncle were children.  Wonderful wooden pull toys and building blocks and real china play dishes and wooden puzzles.  There were stuffed animals and I think I even remember a barnyard set complete with cows and chickens.The most wonderful things of all for me were the picture books.  I was, at that time, too young to have gone to school yet, and I couldn't read, but I spent hours looking at the books and making up stories to go with the pictures.  It was like being able to go someplace exciting in my mind.  I still feel that way when I read a good book today.....like I am transported someplace new, and if the book is an especially well written descriptive one, I can experience the sights and sounds and smells within the pages.  That must have had its beginnings with Grandma's picture books.It is a shame that houses aren't built with attics any more.  Attics are a wonderful place for a child's imagination to grow.  I wish I had been able to spend time in Grandma's attic when I was old enough to appreciate the family history stored there.  Sadly, Grandma and her wonderful attic were both gone by that time.  I did not descend from a wealthy family, so I rather doubt that any valuable antiques were in the attic.  But I remember seeing boxes of papers and books and pictures that probably would be of great interest to me now as I research my family tree.  Yet, I do have the memories of rainy day play in Grandma's attic, and those memories are priceless to me."},

{"title": "I Really Hate Housework", "date": "Monday, May 28, 2012", "text": "That statement would probably send my mother over the edge.  She was really big on making sure that dust bunnies never had a chance to reproduce under a bed and that every window was covered by snowy white starched curtains and that the glass sparkled.  Sometimes I think that if I had a quarter for every time as a kid, I scrubbed down the stairs at the farm, using an old toothbrush to get into the corners, I probably could have retired a year earlier than I did.OK.  You don't have to point out to me that this is an exaggeration.  I know it.  It is just that most times when I think about the farm, I see those stairs that I came to dislike with every fiber of my being.  Saturdays shouldn't have to be spent scrubbing things within an inch of their lives, just in case company might come over.  When you are a kid, Saturdays are for playing in the woods or a game of baseball or even a game of Monopoly with your sister.  Not for scrubbing.I very rarely have my TV on any more.  One of the reasons is that commercials make me crazy.  Show me just one woman who dances about her kitchen with unrestrained joy because her wine glasses sparkle from being washed in one particular kind of dish washing soap, and I will show you one seriously deranged lady.  I suppose that the Suzy Homemaker type of commercials are more rare these days.  Commercials for video games and every electronic gadget known to man have taken over.  But I can remember when I did watch TV years ago, there were women who crooned over a new refrigerator like it was a long lost lover and, in their high heels and frilly aprons, exclaimed over the kitchen floors so shiny you could see your face in them, or floated about their bathrooms, happily sniffing the air because their favorite cleaning product made the toilet smell good.  Odd.....I don't ever recall getting all blissfully teary-eyed over a sweet smelling potty.I think that if the truth be known, the only people who don't dislike housework are the ones who have cleaning ladies to do it for them.  The rest of us would probably rather be doing any number of other things.  Maybe I am just envious of those who don't have to bother with scrubbing floors or washing dishes or changing the linen on the beds.  That's more than likely it.OK. I am all done with this rant.  And I have taken a long enough break.  Time to get back to what brought this all on in the first place.....washing the walls and woodwork in my bedroom.Mother would be proud."},

{"title": "Turkey, Turkey Everywhere", "date": "Thursday, May 17, 2012", "text": "This is a 24 lb. turkey.My daughter and granddaughter were kind enough to go to the grocery for me a few weeks ago.  I had been there and had seen these turkeys on sale for 88 cents a pound, which is really cheap for our area.  But they were so big, I didn't think I could fit them into my handy, dandy little old lady shopping cart that I use to haul my groceries home.  The cart works really well for me, especially since I make use of the local circulator bus to go shopping.  And for that price, I wanted four turkeys.Right after they picked the birds up for me, (I think it nearly killed them off, hauling those big birds up the stairs to my apartment.  Two of them weighed in at about 20 lbs. and the other two at about 24 lbs.  I really appreciate that they did that for me.)  I canned three of them.  I cooked them, de-boned them, cut the meat into small pieces and canned it mostly in pint jars.  I forget just how many I got, but I think I have enough canned turkey to last me a good long time, which is good, because I use it a lot.  Makes great soup, stew, casseroles, macaroni salads and sandwiches.  Canned up the broth that it cooked in, too, because I really like using the broth in homemade soup or for gravy.Anyway, I had this one turkey left in the freezer.  So I hauled it out and set it in the sink in cold water to thaw.  Once it had thawed, I cut it up into pieces like you would a whole chicken, but with lots more swear words involved.  Cutting up a 24 lb. turkey is not for the faint of heart.  Into the stock pots it went.  Took all three of them.  Covered the meat with water and set them on the stove.I added some carrot, celery and onion chunks for flavor and let them simmer until the meat was fork tender.  Took the turkey pieces out, let them cool and took the meat off the bone.  Strained the broth and set in the fridge so the fat would harden on top.  Meat went into the fridge, too.The next morning I got the pressure canner going with the turkey breast meat in half-pint jars.  I have lots of pints already done, and really like the half-pint size for sandwiches or salads.  Just the right amount for one person.  Then I skimmed the hardened fat from the broth and put that in a small container to go back in the fridge.  Really makes fried potatoes taste good, and I use it for that as well as in homemade biscuits or dumplings. While the pressure canner was doing its thing, I peeled potatoes, carrots and onions and thawed out big bags of peas and corn.  I diced the fresh vegetables and mixed the whole works together.I filled jars about a third full of turkey pieces and topped that with the vegetables.  Into the canner those went.  With seasonings that I add when I heat it up for a meal, that's going to make some really good soup or stew.  Add some homemade biscuits or dumplings and you have a meal fit for a king.I think I may have gotten just a wee bit carried away with the vegetables.  I was sort of on a roll, so I just kept on peeling and chopping.So I jarred up the rest of the vegetables and canned them, too.This is what I ended up with for canned turkey, turkey vegetable soup and mixed vegetables at the end of two days of non-stop canning.16 half-pints of turkey breast25 pints of turkey soup20 pints and 24 half-pints of mixed vegetablesAnd at that point, I ran out of jars.  I still had about 12 cups of vegetables left, so I blanched them and onto the dehydrator trays they went, along with two pints that didn't seal.  The 7 quarts of turkey broth went into freezer bags and into the freezer.I'm thinking that I got a lot of mileage out of that one turkey.  I had been wanting to can up some jars of mixed vegetables, so that worked out OK as well.  Will really taste good next winter.  Or any time.Finding room to store it all in my tiny apartment, however, should be interesting.Noodle is particularly happy when I am canning, because that means that the box I keep my pressure canner in is then empty.Which means that he can crawl into the box and sleep.Or just hang out.Wouldn't it be nice if people were so easily pleased?"},

{"title": "Such a Noise", "date": "Saturday, May 12, 2012", "text": "Last evening I was sitting at my kitchen table working on a crafty project.  In the spring of the year, before the weather gets too hot, I like to keep my front windows open a bit.  Outside my living room window I suddenly heard an awful racket.  I knew that it was a bird, but the chirping sounds he was making were so loud that they startled me.When the noise continued for a few minutes, I finally went to see what kind of bird was sitting outside my window and to see if I could tell what he was yelling at.  I expected to see something the size of a crow, but there on the corner of the ledge outside the window sat an itty, bitty sparrow, yelling for all he was worth.  He would lean forward and sing like mad, sit back, take a few breaths and do it again.Finally a little female sparrow joined him on the ledge.  He was quiet for a time and then flew down to a branch in the little tree just outside my windows.  There he sat, yelling loudly again for a minute or two.  The little female finally joined him in the tree and the serenade stopped.Ah, spring.  Love is in the air, even for sparrows.And it seems to take very little to amuse me."},

{"title": "It's the Little Things", "date": "Thursday, May 10, 2012", "text": "I don't very often get down in the dumps.  I suppose if I took the time to dwell on all the unpleasant things that have happened over this lifetime, I could work up a pretty bad case of the blues.  I choose not to.  Those things are gone.  I remind myself from time to time to \"Look Forward.\"This has not always been the case.  There have been times when I have let past hurts and disappointments overwhelm my thoughts.  This was brought home to me a while back when one of my children told me that all I ever did was say negative things about my ex-husband, her father.  That hurt me so much that I started to cry.  Not because of what was said, but because of the fact that she was right.  And I hadn't realized it until it was pointed out to me.  And I felt awful about hurting my children with my negativity.From that day forward I made up my mind to do my best to banish that kind of negativity from my life.  I don't always succeed, but I do try my best.  And it has helped my whole outlook on life.There are still unpleasant things to deal with.  There always will be.  But I think that the trick is to deal with them and then move on.  I am finding more and more that it is the little things in life that make me the happiest.An excited phone call from my granddaughters telling me all about their latest dance competition.  That makes me happy.Spending a few days making a surprise gift for my grandson who graduates this year makes me happy.Looking at a huge bouquet of lilacs on my kitchen table, picked from a neighbors lilac bush, makes me happy.Watching Jessie Jane and Lily do their twirling, whirling Yorkie Dance Team dance in anticipation of a treat makes me laugh out loud.Sharing a couple of jars of homemade jam with a neighbor who was delighted to receive them because they reminded her of her days on the farm, makes me very happy.Looking through my old photos makes me happy.  Sometimes I feel sad, knowing that so many of the people I have loved are no longer here, but the good memories of when we were together overshadows the sadness.I am not a Pollyanna or a Little Miss Sunshine type of person.  Nor do I bury my head in the sand and pretend that everything is all love and sunshine.  I am realistic enough to know that there are bad things and bad people out there.  I know that the economy could go down the tubes in a heart beat.  I know that the damaged nuclear plant in Japan could collapse in another earthquake, doing horrible damage to the entire world.  I know that going outside my own door at night these days is not the wisest thing to do in my neighborhood.  I know that politicians wouldn't know the truth if it bit them in the butt.I can't change any of these things.  I can only change my attitude.  I can be aware, but not allow the negativity and the bad stuff to keep me from being a happy person.  So I find joy in the little things.  The last time I talked to my brother, he said that I sounded happier than I had in many years.  I think I will continue to look for the little things to make me smile.  It seems to be working."},
{"title": "Just Ain't the Same", "date": "Wednesday, May 9, 2012", "text": "I love the Dollar Store.  You have to watch what you buy, for lots of the merchandise is junk.  But now and then I find really good deals.  Coffee is one of them.  As I go through coffee by the gallon and because I am not a coffee snob, (If it looks like coffee and smells like coffee and sort of tastes like coffee, I'm happy.) I buy my coffee at the Dollar Store.  Food for my pets is cheaper there as well as some other things I use on a regular basis.So a few weeks ago I was browsing the shelves at my local Dollar Store and saw some canned ham.  My Dad used to buy a canned ham once in a while when I was a kid.  It was good.  He would slice it up and fry it to go with pancakes and eggs or for sandwiches.  So I bought one.  Nice to have on the shelf if I had a craving for ham.Today I decided to have ham and eggs for breakfast.  I opened the ham.  Didn't really look like the canned ham I remembered.  Popped it out of the tin.  Didn't smell like I remembered, either.  Started to slice it.  It was sort of like trying to slice canned Alpo.  So rather than waste it, I decided to try to make sandwich spread out of it.  I mushed it up, added some onion, pepper, a little sweet relish and mayo.  Mixed the whole works up.  Slathered on a slice of bread.  Took a bite.Dollar Store canned ham makes Spam look like fillet mignon.  My Yorkie, Jessie Jane, is the consummate trash hound.  Can't leave anything even vaguely resembling edible within her reach.  She can tunnel into a trash bag filled with garbage waiting to go out to the dumpster, quicker than you can blink.  Good thing she is short or nothing on the table or kitchen counters would be safe.  I dropped a little chunk of the meat (if that's what it was, minus the mayo, etc.) on the floor for her.  She wouldn't touch the stuff.  This is the same dog who would dine from the kitty litter box, given the opportunity!I guess I should have known better, but the memories of that canned ham meal my Dad would make were still strong, and hope does spring eternal.  But sometimes hopes are dashed.  It just ain't the same."},

You have a good heart, and I know you mean well, but do you realize how many beaches there are around here and how many starfish are dying on every beach every day. Surely such an industrious and kind hearted boy such as yourself could find something better to do with your time. Do you really think that what you are doing is going to make a difference?”The boy looked up at the man, and then he looked down at a starfish by his feet. He picked up the starfish, and as he gently tossed it back into the ocean, he said, “It makes a difference to that one.”"},
{"title": "Christmas Past", "date": "Saturday, December 24, 2011", "text": "I'm sitting here this evening remembering the Christmas seasons of my childhood.  In this world where most folks feel as though they must shop until they drop, it surprises me that I can recall very few gifts of Christmas past.  I remember mostly other things.I remember when I was very small, while my family lived in St. Paul with my Grandmother, my Dad would take Mother and me downtown to see the Christmas displays in the store windows.  They were a wonder.  There were scenes set up in the windows where Santa filled stockings or flew in his sleigh over the rooftops or the elves hammered and sawed in the North Pole workshop making toys.  These were mechanical moving pieces, as this was waaay before computers were used.  There were beautifully decorated Christmas trees and all sorts of wondrous things to see.  It was all magical to a child.When I was older, living in Willmar, Dad would pile the family into the car and take us on a drive around town to see all of the houses decorated with Christmas lights.  We always drove through a neighborhood that Dad called \"Pill Hill,\" because a number of doctors lived there and that neighborhood always had some of the best light displays.  I still enjoy seeing all the decorated houses this time of year.Sometime during the holidays we always made molasses taffy.  Dad would cook it up on the stove, pour it onto a buttered cookie sheet and set it out on the porch to cool, and then each of us would grab some and pull and pull and pull until it was just right.  We cut the taffy ropes into pieces and wrapped them in waxed paper.  Then if we were lucky, Dad would make his \"World Famous Peanut Brittle.\"  I swear that it was so much better tasting than any other.  I miss Dad and his peanut brittle especially now.Mom made tons of Christmas cookies - gingerbread men, red and white candy canes with real crushed peppermint candy sprinkled on top, date filled cookies and always, sugar cookie cut-outs decorated with red and green sugar.  She made divinity and old fashioned fudge, enlisting me to beat the fudge with a spoon until it was just right.  We made popcorn balls, wrapped them in colored cellophane and tied them with ribbon, for treats on Christmas Day with relatives.  And then there was the smell of baking bread as Mom made buns and cinnamon rolls for our dinner with aunts, uncles and cousins on Christmas Day.We always had a real Christmas tree, with the exception of that unfortunate year when Dad brought home this silver, shiny aluminum tree that looked like rolls of tin foil had exploded.  There was the smell of pine in the house, what with the tree and Mother's decorating every available space with pine boughs and shiny Christmas balls and red velvet ribbons.  The tree had some of the old large-sized lights and some lights made to look sort of like candles, but when they heated up a bit, liquid inside the glass tubes would bubble.  There were beautiful, shiny glass balls and tons of tinsel.  I think the tinsel was to mask some of the bare spots in the tree, but I loved it.Dad always read the Christmas story from the Bible before we opened gifts on Christmas Eve.  He and Mother wanted to be sure that we children understood just what it was that we were celebrating.  I sometimes feel that the reason for our Christmas season has been forgotten, what with news reports about how many of millions of dollars have been spent on holiday shopping, advertisements of some stores staying open for the entire 48 hours before Christmas in order to rake in more money, and the TV commercial that shows people dancing through a mall, shopping bags in hand!  I guess that the lesson that my parents wanted me to learn was, indeed, learned.  For it is the memories of family and love and and the shared moments that have nothing to do with gifts, that are uppermost in my mind this Christmas Eve.I pray that my grandchildren, when they reach my age, will remember less about whatever gadget or toy is under their Christmas trees and more about family being together and enjoying each others company.  David has taken his wife and children to spend Christmas Eve with his Grandmother, and I am so glad that he did.  I have many good memories of Christmas spent with her and I am happy that his children will also have those memories.  For no present can compare with the memories made with family.I wish you all a very Merry Christmas with the hope that you all make good and lasting memories with your families, and wish for nothing but good things for you throughout this coming year."},

I guess I am feeling a bit melancholy today.  Also a bit nostalgic.  It seems that so many of my father's family have gone on to their reward and there are so few of us left now.  I understand that this is the natural order of things, but that doesn't make it any easier.Good-bye Curt.  I treasure the memories."},

The search was on.  Turned the bedroom upside down.  No keys.  Shoveled various and assorted papers and, yes, junk off of my desk top.  No keys.  Did I drop them in the one of the desk drawers?  Nope.  Not there.  Checked cushions on the couch and chairs.  Nary a key was to be seen.  Nowhere in the living room did I find them.  Even checked the little doggie bed that Lily the Yorkie snoozes in.  She loves to find a scrap of paper or a ball of yarn or a quilt piece that is within her reach and haul it to her bed, where she hides it under a toy or her blanket.  Nothing there except three toys, a very old used bone, three pieces of kibble and a doggie treat she must have been saving for later.Next was the kitchen.  Not on top of the fridge (Good Lord - I really need to climb up on a chair and clean that!)  Not under the table.  Not behind the buffet.  Not in the freezer.  Nowhere.So I poured a cup of coffee and sat down.  There is no problem that can't be solved with a good cup of coffee.  Now, what did I do the day before yesterday, which was the last time I saw my keys.  I walked to the store three blocks away and bought dog food.  Had the keys when I got back.  Then I took the dogs out for some air.  Jesse walked and loved it.  Lily didn't.  Typical dog outing - walk one and carry the most stubborn one.  Unlocked my door with the keys.  Then I did a couple loads of laundry.That's it!Yep.  There they were.  Inside the pocket of the pants I put in the laundry basket that evening.Now I understand why ladies of my vintage wear their glasses on a chain around their necks.  It has come full circle.  I used to,  more years ago than I care to think about, have to wear mittens that were attached to a string, to keep from losing one.  Never lost two - always one.  Wonder if the string thing works for keys."},

{"title": "In Praise of Front Porches", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2011", "text": "Front porches seem to be a thing of the past.  I notice that many of the older homes in the town where I live do, indeed, have front porches.  Most in the newer developments do not.  There may be a small covered area by the front door, but not a real front porch.  A front porch, to be a really truly front porch, needs to cover the entire front of the house and perhaps extend around to one side.My Grandma Paul's house in St. Paul had a front porch across the front of her house and extending a little ways around one side.  I played there often as a child.  It was the one place I could play and pretty much stay out of trouble.  It was when I left the porch that bad things happened, like being enticed by neighbor kids, older than my four years, to sliding down a two by eight board that they had propped up on the fence.  Sliding down on my belly resulted in a visit to the hospital to have a large sliver of wood removed from the area of my waist.  Should have stayed on the porch.The first house my family lived in after moving to Willmar had a front porch.  The landlady who lived in the downstairs of the house allowed my sister and I to play on the porch.  One winter while we lived there, Willmar was blanketed by a huge snow storm.  My sister, who was not much older than a toddler at the time, walked off the edge of the porch into the deep snow and promptly disappeared from sight.  Good thing my Dad was right there to haul her out.  Should have stayed on the porch.The next house in Willmar where we lived had a kind of half front porch.  Wasn't much of a porch.  But then, it wasn't much of a house, being very small.  But in the summer there were vines growing up wire that Dad strung from the roof to the bottom of the porch rail, which made the front porch cool and kind of dark and a really good place to play on hot summer days.The best front porch of all the houses I lived in as a child was the front porch of the house on the farm.  It was a wonderful porch that extended all the way across the front of the house.  It was screened in to keep the bugs out.  Dad had dragged an old vinyl covered couch that folded down into a bed, out to the porch.  As a young kid I spent many a summer night sleeping on that old couch out on the porch.From the porch we could see across the fields and Dad and I would stand there, protected from the weather, and watch the black summer storm clouds roll across the sky.  I still like to watch the clouds on a stormy day.There was an old kitchen table and some chairs on the porch, and in the summer when we had weekend company, Mom would make pitchers of real lemonade and serve them with gingersnaps, out on the porch where it was cool and the breeze felt good out of the heat of the sun.I think that we need more front porches.  For with a good front porch comes the art of just sitting and watching the world go by.  Or watching clouds roll in.  Or just sitting.  And thinking.  And remembering.  And dreaming.  Which is always good for the soul."},

{"title": "Almost Done", "date": "Friday, October 28, 2011", "text": "I believe I am nearly at the end of my food preservation marathon using the goodies from the Farmer's Market.  I still had apples left to dehydrate and I finished those today.  This is just part of the 60 lbs. of apples.  I used about 10 pounds earlier - froze 4 quarts, made me a bowl of fried apples and a pan of apple crisp.  Tasted so good.  Sorry, but I didn't save any for you.  It was just too delicious.  Didn't even last long enough for a picture.I had already dried a couple of dehydrator loads of apples when this picture was taken.All total, I got 15 quarts of dried apple slices. I tried vac sealing them in bags, but they tended to break into small pieces, so I put them in quart jars as I wanted slices to use in pies, apple crisp and other apple desserts.  A few weeks ago I canned a bunch of applesauce and 7 quarts of apple pie filling.  I will probably do that again next year, but I really like the dried apples.  They are so versatile and take up much less space than the canned.When Duane and Becky brought me this last load of fruit and veggies they also brought me a surprise.  The Saturday that I had gone with them to the Farmer's Market I saw something that I really, really love.  Something that I hadn't had for a very long time.  Something that I used to buy from a farmer I knew when we lived up north.  But I had already come close to wrecking my budget so decided I had better not spend the money, although it was way less expensive than in the stores.  This was my surprise.Yep.  A half-gallon jar of real, honest-to-goodness, pure honey.  The last time I bought a tiny little bottle of honey at the grocery, I was dismayed to find that it didn't taste at all like the honey I remembered.  After reading the label, I knew why.  It was thinned out with corn syrup.  Yuck!  Not this stuff.  It is liquid gold.  That night I just had to make biscuits so I could have them with honey.  Last night I made cornbread for the same reason.  It is wonderful!  Thank you for such a nice surprise.So now all I have left to finish up is the rest of the 50 lb. box of potatoes.  Ten pounds went into the dehydrator this afternoon and there are about another 20 pounds waiting to be dried.  Then I think I am done for a while.  It seems like a lot of work, but it is well worth it, especially come winter time when I don't like going outdoors all that much, especially to grocery shop. While I was in the middle of all of this cooking and peeling and blanching and canning, I couldn't help but remember how much of this kind of thing I had done when I wasn't much older than Boston and Maddie.  By that time, Mother was losing the use of her hands.  The arthritis in her joints was just too painful for her to do the work involved.  So as the oldest child, I was the only one old enough to help her preserve food for the winter.  Back then it wasn't just a trendy thing to do as it seems to be now.  It was a way of life.  It was the way we made sure that the family would be fed until the garden produce was ready the next season.  I remember that I wasn't very happy about spending so much time in the kitchen doing pretty much what I have been doing here lately.  I wanted to be outside playing.  Or in my room reading a book.  Or any of a dozen other things.  Anything but peeling apples and canning green beans.  But I find now that I am grateful to my Mother for having taught me not only how to make things like jam and relish and canned vegetables, but for also teaching me the importance of doing it.  I remember once complaining about all of the work involved and asking her why we had to do so much in the late summer and fall of the year.  She told me that I should look around me.  There were ants hauling off food into their ant hills for the winter.  There were squirrels stashing away acorns for the winter.  The farmers had put hay in their barns to feed their livestock for the winter.  She said that if we wanted to eat through the winter, a little hard work now was the way to do it.  She was right."},
{"title": "Potatoes, Peas, Carrots & Onions", "date": "Tuesday, October 25, 2011", "text": "I had asked Duane to bring me more potatoes from the Farmer's Market.  I had bought 50 lbs. two weeks before, dehydrated some and canned the rest.  I really like the canned cubed potatoes for convenience, and as a bag of potatoes from the store will go bad before I use them all, it makes sense to have them in jars in the pantry where they will last a long time.This box of potatoes I wanted to can a little differently.  I am particularly fond of both beef and chicken stew over homemade biscuits.  So I wanted to can the vegetables together in the same jar for this use.  It is kind of my version of convenience food.  Open a jar of canned vegetables, another of canned beef or chicken cubes, toss in a little tomato and some homemade gravy mix and by the time the biscuits come out of the oven, the stew is ready.Before Duane and Becky left my place on Saturday, Duane asked me if I wanted him to go to the grocery and pick up the carrots, peas and onions that I planned to can along with the potatoes.  I figured that he and Becky had already done way more than enough for me, bringing me all the goodies from the Farmer's Market, so I said that I would take care of that Monday.  His reply was, \"Mom, would you rather spend Monday on the bus going to the store and hauling your groceries up the stairs by yourself, or would you rather have us do it so you can work on these vegetables!\"  And because I am not a completely stupid woman, I handed him my grocery list.I peeled and cubed some of the potatoes, peeled and sliced carrots and heated two large bags of frozen peas.  Then I layered the veggies in quart jars and processed them in my pressure canner.  I got 28 quarts of stew mix veggies, with a little bit of carrots and potatoes left over, which I bagged up and popped into the freezer.I had planned to add chunks of onion in each jar as well, but on thinking it over, decided that the onion would probably turn to mush in the pressure canner.  So I peeled the 10 lbs. of onions, sliced them thin, crying like a baby the whole time, and filled my dehydrators with the sliced onions.  This is what 10 lbs. of onions looks like in my big 9-quart stainless steel bowl.That amount of onions filled all seventeen dehydrator trays.I put them on the table in my bedroom and shut the door.  I like the smell of onions, but I am not too sure that my neighbors do, although I have done this many times without anybody complaining about the smell.  But an open window near the dehydrators and the closed door help to contain the onion odor.  I let the dehydrators run all afternoon and overnight, as I like the taste when the onions caramelize a bit while drying.This is what 10 lbs. of dehydrated onions looks like, in my 2-quart bowl.If I want raw onion in a dish, this is not going to work, but for any kind of cooking, I just toss in a handful and they rehydrate really well.I still have probably two-thirds of the 50 lb. box of potatoes left and I will dehydrate them later.  Right now there are 5 big bags of apples, right around 60 lbs. of them, waiting for me. I really do love the Farmer's Market!  Duane says that he won't take me there next year unless he has a pickup and a hand truck.  I wonder why he said that."},
{"title": "Cranberry Sauce", "date": "Sunday, October 23, 2011", "text": "Yesterday Duane and Becky went back to the Farmer's Market in St. Paul.  They brought me goodies.  Lots of them.One of the goodies was a box of cranberries.  I had seen the cranberries when I went with them two weeks ago, but didn't buy any then as I had already filled the trunk and back seat of Duane's car with produce.  When I first saw the box they brought me, it ran through my mind that it was awfully small.  But when I measured out the berries from the box, I found that it held the equivalent of 15 bags of cranberries from the grocery.  At less than half the price of store berries.  And they were beautiful berries.  There wasn't a bad one in the whole lot.So yesterday afternoon I made cranberry sauce.  Forty-two half pint jars of cranberry sauce.Duane and Becky were still at my place when the first batch came off the stove, ready to go into the jars, and after a taste test, they pronounced it wonderful.I think I will just sit here and admire these lovely jars for a while before moving on to the next project that involves 50 lbs. of potatoes, some carrots, peas and onions.Gotta love the Farmer's Market.  And those who are willing to shop and haul and carry for me.  Thank you."},

The grandkids made good use of the pool and managed to splash the grandparents as often as possible.  They swam and ran and played and enjoyed getting to know one another.  They are such fun to be with and watch.We sat and talked and remembered and compared notes and got caught up on what we had all been doing.  Everyone contributed to the evening meal and if anyone went away hungry, it was their own fault as there was food enough for an army.The day wouldn't have been complete without our children insisting that we have a picture taken, so we gave in and let them.  I'm glad that they did.  It is nice to look at it and remember such a fun day.As I think back, it is hard for me to believe that so many years have passed since we were children.  And yet, here we are, with a whole boat load of grandchildren between us.  As a family, we have been blessed.  Thank you, my children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and my brother and sister, for making this a truly memorable day."},
{"title": "Garden Update", "date": "Saturday, July 23, 2011", "text": "David emailed me some more pictures of his garden this past week.  It seems that although we have been complaining about the heat, his plants love it.  So much so that the radishes were becoming overgrown with other plants and had to be pulled.He said that the wind had sort of flattened some of the tomatoes, but they are doing well in their new tomato cages.  I still have dibs on some cherry tomatoes!The corn along side the back of the house - that same corn that I said would never grow in that spot - has made a liar out of me.  I'm thinking that if you listen really closely, you can probably hear it grow - it has grown that fast.  It hasn't set on ears yet, but I expect at the rate it is growing, it will soon.And then there is the gratuitous cute grandkid picture!  Can't leave that one out.I think the kids are enjoying the garden as much as their dad is.  And I am glad to see David's family growing some of their own food.  It is so much better than store-bought.  I hope his garden gives them as much pleasure and mine did for so many years."},
{"title": "Gardens", "date": "Friday, July 8, 2011", "text": "Last evening David called and told me to check my email.  He had sent me pictures of his gardening efforts.  I think they look pretty darned good.He has sweet corn growing along side the fence in back of his house.  When he planted corn there last year, I laughed at him because I thought the corn would never amount to anything in that location.  I wound up eating some crow, as he had enough to use in canning salsa, as many meals of corn on the cob as his family wanted and he even had enough to freeze.This spring he put in this raised bed garden in his back yard.  I am impressed at how well everything is growing.  He has a couple of different kinds of tomatoes, some potatoes, onions, peppers and strawberries along with some other things that I can't remember.  I have dibs on some cherry tomatoes.  There is very little on this earth better tasting than homegrown tomatoes.There are some YouTube channels that I follow, having to do with food preservation and gardening.  One of these has videos by a lady in Virginia, who posts a wealth of information.  One of her videos is about her raised bed garden.  (See her video Here.)  I had not heard about this trend until David told me what he was doing.  Since then I have found that this seems to be a growing trend.  When David told me about all of the plants he has in his garden, he remarked that maybe he had crammed too much in the space, but it seems that this isn't a problem.  He was able to get much more in that space than if everything was planted in rows.  Makes sense to me.I wonder why more people don't have back yard gardens any more.  I have seen only one vegetable garden in my neighborhood.  With rising prices at the grocery stores, it seems to me that growing your own produce is a really good idea.  I remember as a young girl, looking across all of the back yards in my block, there was not one yard that didn't have a garden.  The only problem with having a garden is that it spoils a person.  Store-bought vegetables just never taste as good as those that are home grown.And if you don't have a back yard garden, you miss the opportunity of having great memories in later years.  Like sitting in the middle of the tomato patch with your Dad, salt shaker in hand, eating tomatoes off the vine until you just couldn't eat any more.  Memories like that!"},

I'm not so sure that anyone but me will remember violets, but they might remember the two black bear cubs that wandered out onto the trail ahead of us.  We watched them for a time while they explored the world that was new to them, and then they scampered off into the woods.  The kids were young enough so that they wanted to get out of the car and go pet them, but Uncle Bruce said that their mama, although we never saw her, was close by, and she wouldn't be very happy to have anyone close to her cubs.I think that sometime soon, after the river that is now busy flooding the walkway along it, goes back inside its banks, Jessie, Lily and I will have to go for a stroll along it and see if we can find some spring flowers."},
{"title": "Some Days Are Better Than Others", "date": "Wednesday, March 30, 2011", "text": "There are times when I am totally ashamed of myself.  I had a bad day yesterday.  Arthritis is not fun.  It hurts.  Some days it hurts more than other days.  I found myself irritated because I couldn't do some of the things I wanted to do.  I also found myself in the middle of a pity party.  Shame on me.My brother understands what this is all about.  Arthritis is our family inheritance.  How he keeps on keeping on, working in a physically demanding job, is beyond me.  I admire his strength and courage.So in the middle of my mental whining (Whining out loud around here doesn't mean a thing.  The dogs ignore me and the cats could care less!) and feeling sorry for myself, I thought about my brother.  And then I thought about my mother, who was in a wheelchair and in a nursing home at a much younger age than I am now because of this disease.  I was able to get out of bed yesterday morning.  Mother could only get out of bed if someone lifted her.  I was able to take a shower alone, get dressed alone, fix my coffee and my meals without help and my hands still worked well enough to do some sewing.  Mother was unable to do any of these things.  What she would have given to have been able to function without help, I can only guess.Today, on the other hand, is one of my Better Days.  I have been busy doing some of the household chores that were left undone yesterday.  I have been up and down the stairs in my building a couple of times without much of a problem.  I am back to normal, whatever normal is.  But I am left with a sense of shame at letting yesterday's trials get me down.  I try really hard not to do that.  Most of the time I succeed.  And when I don't, I think of those who are much worse off than I am.It is sort of like the person who complained he had no shoes right up until he met a man who had no feet.I think I need to concentrate more on what I do have, and be grateful for it."},
{"title": "Food Obsession", "date": "Sunday, March 27, 2011", "text": "Yes, I have developed an obsession with food.  Not so much the eating of it, although I will fight you to the death if you try to deprive me of my chocolate, but of the preserving of it.  Although I owe nobody any explanations of the way I choose to live, I feel as though I need to address this issue.  Mostly to give my children an understanding of what their mother is about.  Especially since some of them think I have stepped off the edge of reality.When I was a young girl, my family had a large garden.  Every summer and fall we spent hours and hours in the kitchen canning and freezing the produce from this garden.  Money was tight.  Mother was ill most of her life.  She couldn't work outside of our home to provide extra family income.  Preserving garden produce insured that we would eat over the winter.Later, when my children were young, I had a huge garden.  I canned and froze as much as possible, for money was very tight then as well.  Some of my children still remember the jars of food;  fruit, jam and jelly, pickles and relishes, meat and vegetables, that filled the basement shelves.  We may have been poor, but there was always enough to eat.Things have changed.  I now live alone and have nobody to feed but myself.  I am not rich, but neither am I poor.  What I am is a widow living on a fixed income.  Every month that passes, my income is stretched thinner and thinner.  I am fortunate that I don't need a vehicle and the expense that goes along with it.  But other expenses like medical and groceries and rent, keep going up.  My income does not.So I decided to change my lifestyle a bit to compensate.  I rarely eat out.  Twice a month I go out for breakfast with my oldest son.  We have been doing this for the last few years, and although I enjoy our breakfasts at a restaurant, it is more about the company.  But I get my fix of restaurant food at those times and it is enough.  I bake most of my own bread.  I can bake at least four loaves for the price of one loaf of store-bought bread.  I scoured the internet and found recipes for things like brownie mix, baking mix, cornbread mix, hamburger helper mix and stuffing mix.  These I can make for much, much less than I can buy them, and they taste good.  I buy bulk seasonings and spices and make things like taco mix, spaghetti sauce mix, onion soup mix and chicken coating mix.  All for very much less than the commercial equivalents.  And I have the added advantage of knowing what is in them as opposed to foods with unpronounceable chemicals included.I don't have a garden as I did in the past.  Living in a city apartment makes that impossible.  Stuff just doesn't grow well in an asphalt parking lot!  So I buy fresh and frozen vegetables at the grocery store when they are on sale.  These can be either canned or dehydrated.  The canned vegetables I can use as a side dish with a meal or in casseroles and other dishes (I love creamed peas on toast.) and the dehydrated vegetables work really well in soups and stews.  If left frozen, they develop freezer burn long before I could use them up.  There is a Farmer's Market here and I hope to be able to buy tomatoes and other fresh produce there over the summer.  So much better than supermarket fare.When meat is on sale, I buy as much as I can afford, freeze what I will use within a month and pressure can the rest.  I am not really good at meal planning.  It is more like deciding about 3 PM what would taste good for supper.  Yesterday I defrosted a pork chop, baked it in the oven along with potatoes and carrots that I had canned together just for that purpose.  The potatoes and carrots browned nicely in the oven and it was really good tasting.  Another day I opened a jar of chicken, another of peas and carrots, tossed them together with macaroni, dehydrated onion and mayo, and had a chicken macaroni salad for supper, along with a slice of homemade bread.  This is one reason that I can food.  I tend to get busy doing other things and forget about meals until I start to get hungry.  It is nice to be able to open a jar or two and supper is served.Contrary to popular opinion, I have not, nor do I intend to join a survivalist group.  Not my thing.  Granted, I would prefer living in a country setting and having a garden and all of the things that go along with country living, but at this stage of my life I am realistic enough to know that this isn't going to happen.  I am more into preparedness.  Life has a way of blindsiding us from time to time.  I am pretty sure that people in Japan weren't aware when they went to work in the morning that their lives would drastically change by late afternoon.  Not that I think that we will suffer an earthquake, and a tsunami is unlikely to cover Minnesota any time soon, but things beyond our control can and do happen.  I just believe in being as prepared as I can be. There are things that the hard-core preparedness people do that I don't.  I have no guns or ammunition stockpiled.  I haven't invested in a solar oven or propane camp stove.  I haven't converted savings into precious metals.  There are many of these things that just aren't practical for me to do or that I would be comfortable with doing.  But the one thing I can do to be prepared for the unexpected is to have food canned and dehydrated.  At present, I have probably 4 to 5 months worth of food put by.  My goal is a years worth.  I realize that at my present weight and girth, chances are I probably won't starve to death any time soon.  But I don't want to be one of those elderly people we hear about who have to choose between paying for the medications they need to keep them alive and buying food to eat.I also don't want to have to ask for help, although there are times when a little help is greatly appreciated.  Being as self-sufficient as possible is particularly important to me.  It keeps me out of the nursing home.  It makes me feel as though I have some self-worth when I can take care of myself.  And by preserving food for future use, I can insure that I won't have to ask any of my family for help with the groceries, with the possible exception of hauling them up the stairs to my apartment.I also really like the part where I don't have to rush to the store to stock up on essentials just before a snow storm.  I remember doing that in the past and fighting crowds of people doing the same thing.  I only go to the store now to buy the sale items or to replenish my kitchen pantry when I use the last bottle of ketchup or jar of mayo or need a dozen eggs.  I have everything I need to get through any storm or other unforeseen disaster.So you all can stop worrying that Mom has gone over the edge or that her mind is going because she preserves food.  There is a method in this madness.  Now, if I begin to have meaningful conversations with Elvis, then you can worry."},
{"title": "2 AM Musings", "date": "Friday, March 25, 2011", "text": "One should never fall asleep around suppertime and wake up after 9 PM.  It really wrecks going to bed at a decent hour.And to make it worse, strange thoughts float around in one's head at 2 AM.  Well, to be perfectly honest, strange thoughts aren't really all that unusual for me, but I digress.I was wondering, at 2 AM, why my parent's generation was so terribly worried about what people would think.  Like the time when my Mother's doctor prescribed a shot of brandy at night to help her sleep.  Mother made Dad get the brandy from the druggist rather than the liquor store, even though he paid twice the price at the drug store for brandy in a prescription bottle, because she was afraid of what people would say if they saw him coming out of the liquor store.As a kid, I went through a stage where I wore mostly jeans and my Dad's old flannel shirts.  I lived in the country.  I played in the woods.  I grubbed around in the garden.  I did yard work.  I sat up in apple trees and read books.  I liked jeans and old comfy flannel shirts.  But Mother was always after me to change clothes because what would people say if we got company and they saw me dressed like that.My 4-H softball team practiced on Sunday afternoons.  I loved playing softball.  I was a pretty fair shortstop.  But Mother was worried about what people would say if they knew that I was playing ball on Sunday, which was a day of rest.I always wondered who \"They\" were.  Who were these people who were just waiting for my family to do something out of the ordinary so they could say whatever it was that they were going to say.  I probably, in retrospect, shouldn't have posed this question to Mom, for, as I recall, it got me a week of living in my bedroom and a month of Wednesday night Prayer Meeting at the church, no doubt to pray for the state of my rebellious soul.  I think that having a daughter who was, at that time, a bit of a free spirit, must have been a trial for her.Odd, the things one remembers at 2 AM."},
{"title": "Beef Sticks", "date": "Saturday, March 5, 2011", "text": "A couple of weeks ago I made beef sticks out of hamburger.  I have this handy dandy little gizmo that came with the first dehydrator I bought.  You stuff it full of seasoned hamburger, squeeze the trigger and out pops beef sticks.David had told me that his kids really like beef sticks, so I tried a 3 lb. chub of hamburger in my dehydrator.  A few days after David picked up the package and took it home, I asked whether the kids liked the homemade beef sticks.  He allowed as they must, because the package was nearly empty.So Wednesday of this week he dropped off 6 lbs of hamburger.  Last evening I mixed the spices in and refrigerated it overnite.  Hamburger goes through the gizmo better if it is cold, and the spices need time to meld with the meat.This morning I made beef sticks.  Six lbs of hamburger will fill nearly seven dehydrator trays.  The old towels under the dehydrator are to catch any grease that seeps out of the bottom.  I learned about doing that with the first batch I made.After about 12 hours, I had beef sticks.I love my gadgets."},
{"title": "A Month of Sundays", "date": "Wednesday, March 2, 2011", "text": "While doing my little stint at the computer this morning, I realized that it has been a month of Sundays since I last blogged.  Well, OK.  Maybe not quite that long.  But it has been a while.I tend to get sidetracked.  A lot.  Especially if I have a new toy to play with.  I have been dehydrating veggies.  Cub had a sale on frozen veggies, which work really well in the dehydrator.  Just open the bags, spread them on the trays and let them dry.  I tried some shredded cabbage, too.  I like cabbage in soup, and that worked really well.  I also dried 10 lbs. of onions.  I use lots of dry onions, and they turned out great.  The other day, I opened a jar of canned chicken broth and a jar of chicken, dumped them into the crock pot, tossed in a handful of each of the dried veggies and let it all cook.  All of the veggies rehydrated really well and that was some seriously good chicken veggie soup.I also tried drying a variety of fruit.  The strawberries turned out OK as did the mandarin oranges.  The oranges are a good snack.  But I wasn't thrilled with any of the other fruit, so I probably won't be drying much of that.  Maybe enough to chop up and use in muffins or quick breads.  I haven't tried apples yet.  They might turn out fine.  We shall see.I have another new kitchen toy that I have been playing with.  When I got my new dehydrator, at the same time I got a jar sealer attachment for my Foodsaver.  That is the neatest little gadget since the invention of the bread slicer.  I wasn't happy with using plastic bags for storing my dried stuff.  Little creepy crawlers can get into Ziploc bags.  I know this because I had to toss out a bag of wheat flour that I had in a plastic bag.  So I put all of my extra dry stuff into glass jars and vac sealed them.  When I use the veggies, I just pop the lid, take out the amount I want to use, and reseal the jar.  Cool.  The dollar store had brown sugar for a buck a bag, so I bought some and sealed that in quart jars and stashed it in the pantry.  It stays soft and I don't wind up with brown sugar rocks.  I love it!Then there was the sale at Joann's.  Flannel for $2.50 a yard.  That's less than half of the normal price.  I am in need of blankets.  I am not fond of blankets from the local big box stores.  I really like quilts.  Especially warm, snugly handmade quilts.  So I bought enough flannel for three new quilts.  These are not fancy, but are more utilitarian.  There were lots of little kid prints and not much of a selection of other styles, so I went for bright and happy as opposed to beautiful.This orange quilt top is done and the other two are in various stages of completion.  I expect that winter will be nearly over by the time I get the backs and batting put together with the tops, but that is OK.  I will be all snugly warm when next winter comes blowing in on us.So that's what I have been up to for my Month of Sundays.  Pretty tame stuff compared to your lives, but it works for me."},
{"title": "New Play Toy", "date": "Friday, February 11, 2011", "text": "I just love kitchen gadgets.  My kitchen is small  and without much storage space, so I am selective about the gadgets I buy.  But I just couldn't resist this one.Meet my new Nesco Dehydrator.I have been looking at this one online for quite some time.  But the only store in my area that carried them in stock and not just for online ordering was Fleet Farm.  I don't do credit cards any more, so ordering online is a hassle.  I can't get there by bus.  So Wednesday this week, David picked me up and took me to Fleet Farm.  I had so much fun. I found my dehydrator, extra trays for it, plastic mesh sheets that fit on the trays to keep tiny pieces of food from dropping into the lower trays, plus another gadget that plugs into my Food Saver for sealing dehydrated foods in glass canning jars.  I was in heaven!I have a dehydrator that is several years old, and I have used it to dry onions, but not much else, as it had no temperature control on it.  It had a tendency to cook as it dried, and that made for less than perfect dried foods.   The new dehydrator has the temperature control which will make it much easier for me to dry all the foods I want to dehydrate.  I tested it with some frozen vegetables that I had bought on sale a couple of weeks ago.This is what you get from one pound bags of peas, cauliflower and two bags of broccoli.  The cauliflower turns white again when rehydrated in water.  I cook very few big meat and potato meals for myself, but prefer soups, stews, casseroles and the like.  So now, rather than having freezer space taken up with bags of veggies, or cupboard space crowded with cans of veggies, I have the dried veggies that take up much less space.  I can just toss a handful of whatever combinations I want into a pot of soup simmering on the stove.  Or rehydrate them in water to add to a casserole.  I love it.I am off tomorrow to do a little grocery shopping, and will get a variety of fruits to dry as well as more frozen veggies.  I love dried fruit, but don't like the prices of the prepared stuff, or the additives in them to give them a longer shelf life.  And the home dried fruit tastes so much better.  David requested some beef sticks that can be made with ground beef and spices, so I will make those next week as well.  I think I like the beef sticks as much as his kids do.Thank you, David, for taking time from your busy schedule to run me over to Fleet Farm.  It was nice to be able to spend time with you.  I really love it when we have time to just talk.  And I am having so much fun with my new play toy!"},

{"title": "\"Slow Down, You Move Too Fast\"", "date": "Thursday, February 3, 2011", "text": "Simon and Garfunkel had it right with those lyrics in their song. Why is it that we feel the need to move so fast?  I think, speaking only for myself, it is due to years of this learned behavior.  It began with my mother, who was a bit of a perfectionist.  Dust bunnies hopped away in terror.  Dishes didn't dare sit dirty in the sink for more than 10 minutes after a meal.  We washed clothes on Monday and ironed them on Tuesday, etc., etc., etc.  I remember watching my Dad mow the lawn at the farm, on nearly a dead run behind the lawn mower. I understand the need to keep my living space free from dirt.  I mostly do that.  But I find myself rushing about to get things done.  I don't know why I do this when I now have all the time in the world to get things done.  The dust bunny police are not going to knock on my door.  I answer to nobody but myself.  So why, in the name of good common sense, should I rush about like a chicken with no head!  There is no good reason that I can think of.We live in a fast-paced world.  It seems to me that so many people try to cram so many things into one 24-hour day.  I did the same when I was still in the work force.  I still have trouble slowing down, and if per chance I take a day and do nothing, I blog about it, because it is so unusual.  That's kind of sad.I believe that the world would be a much better place if we had more rocking chairs on more front porches, and if we used them.  To sit.  And rock.  And cuddle with a kid.  And remember the good things.  And hum a long remembered song.  And sip a good cup of coffee or glass of homemade tangy lemonade.  And watch the world go by.  And take time out of busy lives to smell a few roses.  And enjoy a sunset.I think my rocking chair is calling my name."},
{"title": "Grandma's Laundry", "date": "Tuesday, February 1, 2011", "text": "I have been known to whine about doing my laundry.  I whine about it a lot.  Anyone who knows me also knows that laundry is not my most favorite job in the world.  Did I mention that I don't like laundry?I was thinking about my Grandma Matheny the other day.  Her first child was born in 1898.  By 1906 she had six children, including two sets of twins.  She did lots of laundry.When I wash clothes, I pop them into the washer, go drink a cup of coffee while they wash, toss them into the dryer and drink another couple of cups while the machine does the work.  Not Grandma.  She took buckets outside to the water pump in the yard, hand pumped them full of water and hauled the buckets into the house.  I'm thinking that she made more than just a few trips carrying buckets of water.  Then she heated the water on her wood burning cook stove and filled a wash tub with the hot water. I don't know for sure what Grandma used for laundry soap.  I make my own laundry soap.  I do this because I want to, not because I have to, and because commercial laundry detergents make my skin itch.  And because I can get six months worth of homemade laundry soap for the price of one small bottle of commercial laundry soap.  And because my handmade soap gets my clothes really clean and fresh.  But if Grandma didn't make her own soap, she used a large bar of harsh soap and cut or grated flakes off of it to wash her clothes.  Soap flakes and soap powder weren't invented until the mid 1900's.  And store-bought laundry soap would have been expensive.  She didn't have money for luxuries like laundry soap from a store.When my clothes go into the washer, an agitator swooshes them around in the soapy water and gets them clean.  I'm pretty sure that Grandma's house didn't have electricity until later years when her children were nearly grown.  So Grandma did the agitating of clothes by rubbing them on a washboard.  She had nine children.  In 1906 she had two sets of twins under the age of four plus two older children.  That's a whole lot of cloth diapers and overalls over those years to scrub on a washboard.  To say nothing of the dirty farm clothes and children's play clothes.  Those kids got dirty.  They didn't sit in a clean environment playing video games or watching television or playing computer games.  They played outdoors.  In the woods.  In the dirt.  They worked outdoors as well, in the garden or helping with farm chores. When my clothes have finished washing, they go into the dryer.  Grandma's clothes went in a basket and were hauled outside to the clothesline where they were hung up to dry.  I don't know how she managed to dry clothes in the winter.  Some hung clothes outside to freeze-dry and some hung clothes in the house to dry.  Either way, it was a whole lot more work than tossing them into a dryer.When my clothes are dry, I fold them or hang them on hangars and put them away.  I don't own anything any more that needs to be ironed.  My ironing board stays in the closet until I need to press fabric for a quilt.  But Grandma didn't know about perma-press.  The clothes for her family were made of cotton, wool and other organic fabrics.  They came off the clothesline wrinkled.  I expect that this didn't matter for work clothes and play clothes, but the dresses she made for herself and her daughters and the shirts that the boys wore to school or church all had to be ironed.  When I want to press a quilt top, I just plug my iron into the outlet, let it heat up and in minutes, the job is done.  Grandma heated heavy flatirons on the top of her wood stove and with these she ironed clothes.  For eleven people.  Sometimes twelve, if my Great-grandfather was staying with them as he did sometimes. And she did all of this along with the routine cleaning and cooking required to take care of such a large family.I am such a wimp in comparison.  I do believe that I can not whine ever again about doing my little dab of laundry.  Or whine about any of the other daily chores that I do.  I don't have to haul water or scrub clothes on a washboard or haul heavy baskets to a clothesline or iron with heavy flatirons.  I have it pretty darned good.  The superwomen of today have nothing on my Grandma."},
{"title": "Brothers Are a Good Thing", "date": "Monday, January 24, 2011", "text": "When I was a young girl, I wished for a brother.  I had a sister already, and that was good, but I always wanted a brother.  I envied my friends who had brothers.  I always thought that a brother would be just the neatest thing.  When I was 15 years old, I finally got my wish.When that brother was about three years old, I lived in a small rented house.  The landlord was a crabby old man, who refused to turn on the heat, even though the weather was unseasonably cold for the spring of the year and we were sick from living in such cold, damp quarters.  When he caught me trying to heat the kitchen using the oven, he yelled at me.  My brother was with me when that happened.  My mother told me later that my brother went around with rocks in his pockets for days afterward.  When Mom asked him about the rocks, he said that he was going to throw them at the mean man who yelled at his sister.  Even then, he was watching out for me.On Saturday afternoon, that same brother and his lovely wife came to see me.  Kelly was in the area for his job, and Jackie had driven down to spend the weekend with him.  Kelly is away from home a lot.  Their time together is limited.  That they would choose to spend some of that precious time with me just blows me away.We sat at my kitchen table and drank coffee (lots of coffee) and ate cookies and we talked.  We got caught up on our various kids and grandkids and how everybody was doing.  We exchanged cute grandkid stories.  We talked of our parents and of times past.  We remembered aunts, uncles and cousins and told those stories as well.  Jackie, bless her heart, listened to all of it, uncomplaining.  She is a gem.Time always goes by way too fast when I am with my brother, and although several hours had passed, too soon it was time for them to go.  Saying goodbye is always hard to do, but knowing that we will do this again whenever we can, makes it easier."},
{"title": "Aunt Em", "date": "Friday, January 21, 2011", "text": "My Aunt Em was probably my most favorite aunt.  This was, I think, because there were only 10 years separating us in age and because she was the only one of my aunts who lived close to me while I was growing up.  But more than that, she loved me unconditionally. Em had graduated from High School in St. Paul, where she had lived with my Grandmother.  But when she married Ronnie, she moved to his farm near Svea, just a few miles from my family's home.  We spent holidays with Ronnie and Em and their family the whole time I was growing up.  There were kids birthday parties and Sunday picnics at the lake and other times when Mom and her sister just got together to talk over a cup of coffee.  Em and her family were a huge part of my life.I won't dwell on her death, for that is too painful for me.  I will tell you about the blue octopus she made for me, that lived on my bed until I was out of school and had a home of my own.  She is the one who gave me a jar of her homemade dill pickles, complete with a big red bow on top, for Christmas one year because I always hounded her for her homemade pickles when we were at her house.  She is the one who took care of me when my mother was ill.  She is the aunt who was always there when I needed her.Her sense of humor was second to none.  She could make me laugh no matter how grumpy I was.  She told stories, mostly on herself, like about the time she used her big pressure cooker to cook up a big batch of vegetable soup that she canned every fall.  She set the lid on the cooker, thinking that it was set so that it wouldn't seal, but the lid slipped, sealed and pressure built up, eventually blowing the lid off.  She wasn't hurt, but she spent the next couple of hours cleaning vegetable soup off of the stove, the floor, the cupboards, the walls, the ceiling.....My family traditionally spent Christmas Day with Ronnie and Em's family, while I still lived at home.  The funny thing is, I remember very little about the Christmas presents, other than the octopus and pickles.  What I remember most is sharing a good meal and how much fun it was when we all got together.  There was laughter and love and good-natured teasing and all of the things that are present when people who love one another are in each other's company.She was one in a million."},

{"title": "Dad's Cars", "date": "Monday, January 17, 2011", "text": "When I was growing up, my Dad usually had two cars.  One was the family car that we drove to town for groceries and other shopping and drove to church on Sundays, and the other was what he called his work car.  That one he drove to his job as a Grain Sampler in Willmar.I never cared much one way or the other about the family car.  But, Oh how I loved his work cars.  The ones he had when I was old enough to drive were an early 1950's  faded blue Plymouth and a gray Studebaker, also early 1950's vintage.  These were not spiffy classic cars.  These were dirty, rusty and disreputable looking cars.  They smelled of grain dust and oil.  They were parked away from the house as they were always leaking some sort of fluid from underneath.  The only thing he asked from his work cars was that they should run well enough to get him to work and back home again. Whenever I could wheedle Dad's car keys from him, I drove one of his work cars.  They were great.  I could go places with friends and not worry about the car.  I could put a ding in the side of one, and if I covered up the new scratch or dent with a little mud, nobody could tell it from the dents already adorning the car.  Don't ask me how I know this.  I think that driving these old cars was reverse snobbery, in a way.  The kids at school had their highly polished, fancy painted, souped up Hot Rods.  I had Dad's old work car.  This appealed to my sense of humor.This was the last of Dad's work cars that I remember.Unfortunately for me, I no longer lived at home when he had this car, but I remember that it was at least as disreputable as his previous work cars.  It might have been worth living at home yet just to have been able to drive it.Dad told me once that he would sometimes take my sister to school in this car, and that she would have him drop her off a block or so away from their destination so none of her friends would see her in the car.  I expect that I, on the other hand, would have been more likely to pull right up to the front door, or park it in the first row of the parking lot.I've always been ornery that way."},
{"title": "Wrinkles", "date": "Friday, January 14, 2011", "text": "I don't have cable TV.  I don't watch enough TV to justify paying the high fees.  I have an antenna.  It works well enough so that if I do want to watch TV, I have the choice of between 8 and 10 channels.  More than enough for me.  Most of the time.This past weekend I was in my living room doing some hand sewing on a quilt.  Decided to watch a little TV while I worked.  This was a mistake.Aside from the Public Broadcasting channels, there were mostly a variety of infomercials on.  At least half of these were for creams and lotions that, should I immediately call to order because operators were indeed standing by, holding their breath waiting for me to pick up the phone, credit card in hand, would take away every wrinkle that ever thought about appearing on my face.I have a news flash for those people.  I am perfectly content with my wrinkled face.  The crow's feet around my eyes and the deep lines on either side of my mouth show that my sense of humor is alive and well and that throughout my life, I have laughed much more than frowned.  The rest of the lines and wrinkles give this face character.  They show that I have lived, not just existed.  When I see someone of my vintage whose face is perfectly smooth, I rather feel a bit sorry for them.  How can you lead a full life and not have it show in your face?My Grandma Matheny had one of those faces that showed that she had lived.  She was a true pioneer in the northern Minnesota woods, moving to that area with her family when most roads were logging roads or trails.  Train travel was new to that part of the state and the railroad lines didn't reach as far north as she lived in the log house built by my Grandfather.  She raised her nine children there, without inside plumbing and without the modern conveniences that we are convinced we could never live without.  Grandma's face was lined with wrinkles.  I thought she was beautiful.Grandma with Clarice, Shirley and one of Shirley's childrenSometimes when I was just a little girl, I would sit on my Grandma's lap.  Once in a while I would sit on her lap while she sat on the heavy, cast iron oven door of her wood-burning kitchen range, waiting for the room to heat in the early morning, just as my Dad had done when he was a little boy.  I remembering reaching up and touching her wrinkled face.  It was soft as silk.  Her smile deepened those wrinkles, and she was all the more beautiful to me.  I guess that along with that wrinkled face came the unconditional love that a Grandma has for her grandchild.What I wouldn't give to see that wrinkled face again."},
{"title": "What Were They Thinking", "date": "Thursday, January 13, 2011", "text": "I love going through old pictures.  Many times they lead me for a stroll down Memory Lane. Sometimes I will run across a picture that puzzles me.  One in which you wonder what those people were thinking about when the picture was taken.Like this one.This one was taken in 1960, sometime around Christmas.  The little doo-dad on the coffee table was a decoration that Mom set out only at Christmas time.  The candles on the bottom were lit and the heat from them made the angels above move round and round.  Mom and Dad are in the living room of the house on the farm.  But what on earth could they have been thinking about to have such sober looks on their faces!That's more like it."},
{"title": "On Happiness", "date": "Wednesday, January 12, 2011", "text": "One of the blogs that I read daily had a post recently about happiness and the fact that each of us is responsible for our own state of mind.  It stated that others can not make us happy.  We and we alone have the ability to choose whether to live in a state of happiness or in a state of misery.Everyone has people in their lives who could drag us down if we allowed them to.  And each of us has circumstances, whether it be financial problems, work related aggravations, living situations or a myriad of other things in life, that could make us unhappy.  Even our long, cold, gray winters can bring us down.  But only if we let them.The suggestion was made that we make a list of ten things that make us happy, and whenever we start to feel down in the dumps, take out that list and read it.  Focus on those things that make us truly happy.  Although I have never actually written down this list, this is a method I have used in the last few years to ward off depression.  Whenever I feel myself headed toward a pity party, I think about things more pleasant.  So here is my list of happy things.1.  Fall leaves make me happy.  I love that time of year.  The hot, muggy summer days are gone, the air is crisp but not freezing cold, and the colors of the leaves are spectacular.  I love being outside this time of year just to drink it all in and enjoy.2.  Flowers make me happy.  Flowers are one of God's best creations.  I love lilacs in the spring and daisies in the summer.  I love the rich colors of chrysanthemums in the fall.  My walks in the warm months of the year are made so much better when I see a yard full of flowers.  Or when I bring home cut flowers from the store.  They always brighten my day.3.  Soft spring rains make me happy.  Spring rains wash away all of the dirty, dreary leftovers of winter.  They bring on the beautiful green leaves and grass of summer.  They make the world smell fresh and clean.4.  Big brown puppy eyes make me happy.  Dogs are so trusting.  They love you unconditionally.  They want to be with you, even when you are grumpy.  And even if you just went out to get the mail, they act like they are so glad to see you when you come back.5.  Phone calls make me happy.  I'm not talking about those calls where someone wants to sell me something.  Or those bad news calls that we have all received.  I am talking about the ones where my adult child says that they just called to see how I am.  Or those calls where a grandchild has something exciting to tell me about.  Or when a friend or relative calls just because they missed me.  Those are the phone calls that make me happy.6.  The smell of homemade bread baking in the oven makes me happy.  It is not just the promise of the yummy goodness that will be ready to eat soon, but it is also the memories of the smell of bread fresh from the oven when I got home from school, as a child.7.  Memories make me happy.  We all have good memories and bad memories.  The bad ones I have taken out, looked at them and then packed them away on a shelf in the back of the closet of my mind.  Those things that caused the bad memories cannot be changed, only learned from, and they are not worth dwelling on.  But the good memories live in my mind, right in front, where I can take them out, remember good times or people who are well loved or places that made me happy.  Good memories can bring sunshine to the darkest day.8.  Making things makes me happy.  It doesn't matter if it is a quilt that I make, or a batch of chocolate chip cookies or a really good supper.  I get as much pleasure crocheting a granny square for my work-in-progress afghan as I do from making a loaf of bread.  I come by this honestly.  My mother was creative.  She sewed and made crafty things when I was young.  It is her influence that causes me to be happy while \"doing something,\" no matter what it is.9.  Woods and water make me happy.  There is a feeling of peacefulness that goes along with a walk in the woods or along a shore.  The smell of pine trees, the sounds of bird's songs and the gentle lapping of water on a shore make for a serene soul.  Whenever I have been unhappy or distressed, a walk in nature has most times brought me back to a place of happiness.10.  I have saved the best for last.  My children and grandchildren make me the happiest of all.  Whether we are spending time together on a family picnic or on a holiday or special occasion, or whether I am just looking at their pictures that I keep in my bedroom, or talking with them on the phone, my family never ceases to make me happy.  They are my best thing and I love them will all of my heart. I can guarantee that if I were unhappy, reading my list of happy things would turn the most dreary time into one of complete joy.  It works."},
{"title": "How to Survive Winter", "date": "Tuesday, January 11, 2011", "text": "I have finally figured it out.  I now know how to survive a Minnesota winter.  I stay indoors.I don't recall disliking winter when I was a child.  I remember the fun of building snow forts.  And snowmen.  And making snow angels.  And ice skating.  And sledding.Going sledding at my Grandma Matheny's house near Blackduck was exciting.  The cousins would take sleds and toboggans to the hill in the cow pasture across from the house.  This hill was full of rocks and tree stumps.  The person who was steering the sled had better be good at it, or we would hit a rock or stump and go flying off into the snow. One year when I was about 8 or 9 years old, my Christmas present was a pair of ice skates.  Five blocks from our house in Willmar was an outdoor ice skating rink.  I spent many hours there skating.....pretending I was an Olympic skating star.  Truth be known, I never did get the hang of skating backwards or doing the fancy steps and jumps, but Oh, how I loved to skate.When my family lived on the farm, sometimes in the winter my Dad and Uncle Ronnie would pack up us kids on a Sunday afternoon and head for the lake.  They would shovel off an area so we could ice skate.  Or they would drive the car around on the ice and snow, towing us on skis or sleds.  I'm pretty sure that the towing part would be frowned upon today, what with all the concern with safety issues.  But we sure had fun.  And afterward, there was always hot chocolate and cookies at either our house or at Ronnie and Em's.I guess I really don't hate winter.  I love to sit in my rocking chair by the window with a cup of tea or coffee and watch the snow fall.  I love the way the snow makes everything look so beautiful.  But after years of clearing snow off of sidewalks with a shovel and years of slippy sliding on the ice, walking or driving, I much prefer to watch winter from the comfort of my living room.Works for me."},
{"title": "The Great Canning Marathon", "date": "Monday, January 10, 2011", "text": "So, when I shopped for groceries I found ham and beef roast on sale.  Brought home a ham and two roasts.  Cut the meat from the ham bone and cubed it.  Cut both roasts into cubes and browned the cubes in the oven.  Stuffed the whole shebang into pint jars and canned them.Canned meat isn't pretty.  Jars of canned peaches are pretty.  Jelly in jars is pretty.  Meat is not.  But it doesn't have to look pretty to go into a ham and scalloped potato dish or into a country beef stew or homemade vegetable beef soup, which is where these jars of meat will wind up.  I think I need to can more ham and beef the next time there is a sale.I had a little ham left over.....not enough to fill a pint jar.  So into my pantry I went and dug out a bag of dry split peas and a couple jars of carrots.  Dumped them into a stock pot along with the broth that I had boiled the ham bone in, the leftover ham and the meat from the ham bone, threw in a handful of dried onion and a little pepper.  Tossed in a pint of celery that I had canned a while back, just for fun.  Brought the soup to a boil and then let it simmer on the back burner all day.  This is seriously good split pea soup.  Had a bowl for supper and canned the rest.This soup separates during canning, but combines again when heated and stirred.Then I decided to try something just for fun.  I had found a recipe for canning French Fries.  I already can potatoes.  I do this because I can get a pretty good price on a large bag of potatoes as opposed to the smaller bags.  Trouble is, I can't eat even a small bag before they go bad.  Canning them solves this problem and I can have canned potatoes boiled, mashed or fried.  Works like a charm.  I love French Fries.  So I decided to try this recipe.I just peeled and cut them lengthwise into fries, packed them in wide mouth pint jars so they would be easier to take out of the jar, covered them with boiling water and ran them through my pressure canner.  I only had four empty wide mouth pint jars for the French Fries, so I filled enough small mouth jars with cubed potatoes to fill the canner.Of course I had to give the fries a taste test, so the next day I opened a jar.  These only take a couple of inches of oil to fry, so I heated the oil, dumped the drained fries into the pot and let them brown.I really can't tell the difference between these canned French Fries and those I have made with raw potatoes.  They are yummy.  I may have to can up a few more jars of these.And with that, the great canning marathon came to an end.It gives me a sense of accomplishment to see these jars of meat, soup and potatoes on the pantry shelves and knowing that if I get a hankering for beef stew and biscuits, I don't have to run to the grocery store for the ingredients.  Grab a few jars off the pantry shelves and before long, dinner is served."},

{"title": "It's the Police", "date": "Wednesday, January 5, 2011", "text": "Yesterday morning my phone rang.  It was someone downstairs using the intercom to get into my building.  He said he was the police.Now why is it that when you hear it is the police at your door, your heart stops momentarily and you get a sinking feeling in your stomach.  You wonder what it was that you did wrong.  Must be some leftover guilt from being raised by parents who believed that anything that wasn't church related was wrong.  After all, I haven't robbed any banks lately.  I don't own a car, so there are no outstanding traffic tickets.  I'm too old and too tired to get myself into too much trouble these days.  So why is a policeman calling me wanting to get into my building?As I live alone, I make it a practice not to buzz anyone in that I don't know.  So I went downstairs and after checking his identification, I let the officer in.  Turns out, he was a very nice young man who just wanted to know if I had a phone number for my landlord.  This officer's job is to work with apartment building owners in my area, for the purpose of reducing drug traffic and crime.I am fortunate to live in a building where this isn't a problem as far as tenants go.  It wasn't always so.  When Mike and I first moved here 15 years ago, we had a neighbor down the hall from us who was a drug dealer.  There were a parade of his customers knocking on his door day and night.  Later on there was, how shall I put this, a lady of ill repute living here, with another parade of men knocking on her door.  There was an assortment of people who couldn't seem to live together without fighting, and the police were called regularly to referee.  We continued to live here only because the rent was so reasonable and we were allowed to have our pets.So my landlord first fired the guy who managed the building as this man was only concerned with collecting rent and turned a blind eye to everything else.  Then my landlord set about to clean out the building.  He remodeled the apartments and took care to check references when renting an apartment.  He installed a security system.  I now have good neighbors and no longer worry about who is wandering the halls.It is nice to know that the local law enforcement is working to help landlords in my area when it comes to crime.  Makes me feel a little more safe and secure.  I gave the nice young man a couple of ginger cookies that were cooling on the kitchen table.  And thanked him for watching out for the residents of this area.So the next time a policeman knocks on my door, I may not jump to the conclusion that it is a bad thing."},

As sometimes happens, these blog posts send me on my own stroll along memory lane.My Mom could cook.  Which isn't surprising, because her mother was a fantastic cook.  But when Mom became too crippled with arthritis to work in the kitchen any more, Dad took over the cooking duties.  And he was Mom's equal when it came to putting together a good, tasty meal.  I once asked him where he learned to cook.  He told me that he had been, when he was young, working in a logging camp in northern Minnesota.  He said that he had hurt one of his arms and couldn't do the hard, physical work required when working in the woods, so rather than go home and lose the income that was much needed in his family, he started cooking for the logging crew.  He said that if someone didn't know how to cook, they would learn really fast in that situation.  A gang of hungry loggers is not a pretty sight.Next to his apple pie, the dish that I loved the most was Dad's chicken and dumplings.  I have been known to show up on Dad's doorstep, chicken in hand, begging him to make chicken and dumplings for me.  Dad didn't make dumplings from scratch.  I tried a couple of times to make dumplings from scratch, but they always turned out hard like white hockey pucks.  Dad used Bisquick to make his dumplings.  They were always light and fluffy and wonderful.  Dad's chicken and dumplings were my all time best comfort food.So last night, after having chicken and dumplings on my mind all day, I decided to make some.  I didn't have any chicken in my freezer, so I headed to my pantry.  I opened a quart jar of turkey broth and added a pint of canned chicken and a half pint jar of canned celery, along with dried onion and seasonings.  While this heated on the stove, I made the dumpling dough from my homemade biscuit mix that I keep on hand.  It is a good substitute for Bisquick.  This was dropped by spoonfuls into the chicken mixture and cooked until the dumplings were done.  I decided to go whole hog and add a vegetable, so I melted a little butter in a pan, added a bit of brown sugar and a pint of home canned carrots.  A meal fit for a king.I would have taken a picture of this lovely plate of comfort food, but it just didn't last long enough."},
{"title": "Yesterday Was Thanksgiving", "date": "Friday, November 26, 2010", "text": "And I have so much to be thankful for.First and foremost, I am thankful for grown children who, along with their spouses and significant others, are willing to take the time and trouble to spend this holiday with me.  It was such a nice day.  Good food and good conversation.  Throw into the mix the grandchildren, and they day couldn't have been any better.  These are the same grown children who are always there for me.  Last week I couldn't get to the store and one of them picked up what I needed and delivered it to me.  I needed a ride to David's for Thanksgiving, and immediately there was an answer to my email, telling me that she would pick me up.  Another calls me to tell me about his children's good school report cards and sends me pictures sharing what they have been doing.  Still another shows up every two weeks to take me shopping and hauls heavy bags of groceries up the stairs for me, until his knuckles are dragging on the ground from the weight of them.  And they do things like this for me often.  I wonder if they know how much this means to me, how much this eases my mind and how grateful I am that I have adult children who care enough to be there for me.  Makes my life so much easier and much better than it would be without them.I am thankful that I am able to live alone in my own home.  I was thinking about my mother and how when she was my age, she had already been living in a nursing home for a number of years due to her health.  Now at my age, there are occasionally times when my body lets me down and doesn't function the way I would like it to.  But this has never been serious enough to even consider other living arrangements.  I can still do what I need to do for myself on a daily basis.  Sometimes it just takes a little longer.  But that is OK.  I am in no big rush.I am thankful for the little apartment that I call home.  Now some would question being thankful for a tiny apartment in the middle of a city, especially when I have been known to whine about wishing I could live in the country.  But when the truth is known, I am very thankful that I don't need to mow a lawn in the summer or shovel snow in the winter.  I have a landlord who lets me paint the walls any color I want to as opposed to the standard apartment white.  He thinks my dogs are cute.  He fixes things.  Right away.  When I was unemployed for a time, he worked with me on the rent rather than having me put out on the street as many others would have done.  He is a prince among landlords.  My apartment is cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  It is home.  I like it.I am thankful that I still pretty much have my mental capacities intact.  Alzheimer's disease has been known to occur in my family history.  I don't waste time worrying that I will be afflicted with this disease, but it is something to watch for.  My own little gauge of memory loss is passwords.  I have a number of things on my computer that require passwords.  I still remember all of them.  When the time comes when I don't, then I will think about worrying.  But not until then.  Oh, I have the memory loss that is typical of those of my vintage.  I will put something away for safekeeping and then have to hunt for it later.  I make lists of things I need to remember, like what I need to buy at the grocery store.  I write appointments and birthdays on my calendar so I won't forget them.  But I really do remember most things.  At least those things that are best remembered.There are so many other things that I am thankful for.  I am thankful that my mother taught me to cook and bake bread and sew, for these things give me pleasure.  I am thankful that my dad had the patience to teach me how to fix things and use tools.  This came in handy not too long ago when I tore apart my sewing machine, put it back together, and it worked again.  I am thankful for a loving extended family.  Although we don't get to see one another often, just to know that they are there and that they love me as I do them, is enough.  I wonder if my brother knows how much it means to me when he says, \"I love you, Sister.\"  And I am thankful for the ability, whether learned or inherited, to see the beauty around me even in a city, to be able to enjoy a simple life without the stress and complications that so many live with, and to be in general, a happy and contented person.For these things, and so much more, I am truly thankful."},

{"title": "The Power of the Internet", "date": "Thursday, November 11, 2010", "text": "For the last couple of days I have been following the drama on my favorite blog, \"Chickens in the Road\" (see sidebar for link).  This blog is written by a single mom who moved with her three children to a remote farm in the middle of West Virginia.  Her name is Suzanne McMinn.  As you know, many of the recipes I use came from her or contributors to her blog.  But it isn't all about just recipes.  It is about life in rural West Virginia, about her children, about her assorted animals.  I can, here in the city, read about a life I would much prefer.  And because the writer has such a delicious sense of humor, I feel good reading her blog, no matter how depressing my day has been.  She makes me laugh.  Out loud.But Suzanne's blog is more than just a daily diary.  She is an accomplished writer and photographer.  As one who loves taking pictures, I understand how much work goes into getting just one good photo.  Suzanne's photos are phenomenal.  She has much more patience with photography than I do.  She does not sell her work with the exception of producing a yearly calendar, and her photos are used only on her blog.Enter the bad guy.  His name is Dave Belanger.  He owns Countryside Publications which publishes four magazines geared toward farm life.  It was in the latest edition of one of those magazines that one of Suzanne's photos appeared.  In both printed and online editions.  Without her knowledge.  Without her approval.  Without credit to the photographer.  Without compensation to the photographer.  They stole the photo from her blog.  This is not a mom and pop operation.  Countryside Publications is a 5 million dollar business.  I'm pretty sure that Mr. Belanger understands something about copyrights.  I understand about copyrights, and I am just a retired grandma.Now enter the followers of the \"Chickens in the Road\" blog.  We are many.  We were outraged that Mr. Belanger refused to acknowledge wrongdoing, that he not only was rude when Suzanne called him to protest the use of her photo, but had the brass to hang up on her.  When he finally decided to talk with Suzanne, then would have been the time to be a man, step up to the plate, admit he was wrong, apologize, promise never to steal again, and put a check in the mail.  He did not.  He blamed an editor who, he said, got the photo while browsing the internet looking for a cover photo for the magazine.  (Now that is scary.  I wonder how many others have been stolen from by these people.  How many of the photos you all post on Facebook or I post on my blog will wind up being used for purposes other than those for which they were intended.)  Suzanne said that had they requested the use of the photo in question, she would have let them use it - free of charge - with only credit and a link to her blog appearing with the photo.  So we made phone calls to Mr. Belanger's office.  And we sent emails as well, expressing our outrage.  A few calls were made to the Better Business Bureau complaining about the unethical practices of this company.  The story was picked up by other bloggers and appeared on Facebook pages.  There was talk among \"Chickens in the Road\" followers about putting together a list of the advertisers in Countryside Publications and starting an email campaign to inform these companies about the lack of ethics of said  photo thieves.This morning we saw the power of the Internet.  Suzanne reported on her blog that Mr. Belanger had called her, apologized and had mailed her a check for the full amount she requested.  It seems that he had read the blog with the many comments that were not favorable to him or to his company, which included the intention of some to cancel subscriptions.  He also saw in one of the posts that Suzanne fully intended to sue him and his company for unauthorized use of her photo.  It wasn't about the money, but about just plain honesty and integrity.  And the fact that it seems to be a common thought that in a David and Goliath situation like this one, the Goliaths of the world seem to think that the Davids don't possess the courage or resources to fight them.  Or they believe that it is OK to steal from a blog.  Or from any resource maintained by the \"little guys\" of the world.  It isn't.  Stealing is stealing.I do believe that this time, again, David won the skirmish."},
{"title": "I Have Lots of Help", "date": "Monday, November 8, 2010", "text": "My cats are really helpful.  Don't know what I would do without them.Fat Cat  Kizzie is a huge help to me. She helps me clean out dresser drawers.  She is really good at it.  Sometimes after she cleans them out for me, she takes a nap inside the empty drawer.  This time she didn't get the drawer open quite far enough for that, though.  Guess I should be happy that she can reach only the bottom one.Kiley is really good at holding down my bed so it doesn't float away.  She stays at her post, uncomplaining, day and night.  Must work.  The bed hasn't floated off into space yet.  Good job, Kiley.And then there is Noodle.  He has taken it upon himself to see to it that I don't drown in the shower.  He does this by perching on the ledge above the bathtub like a vulture.  It is a bit disconcerting, really.  I haven't showered alone for years.  Well, with the exception of the times when he has first gotten himself locked in a closet.  Noodle is sneaky.  Open a closet door, he is there.  I don't always see him before shutting the door.  After being awakened several times about 3 AM to let him out of the closet, I have learned to check on his whereabouts before going to bed.  But as a lifeguard, he is tops.Keep up the good work, guys.  You make my life interesting."},
{"title": "Typical Week", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2010", "text": "I received a phone call from one of my kids the other day.  When I asked what he had been doing, he replied that he had gone to work, come home, slept, gone to work.........  I replied that his life was just as exciting as mine.  I hadn't done much either.And then this morning I started thinking about my week.  It was typical of most of my weeks.  It wasn't Woo Hoo exciting.  That's OK with me.  Let others live with Woo Hoo exciting.  That usually includes drama and stress, both of which I am quite happy to live without.  But to say that I hadn't done much was not exactly true.I go for walks.  Every day unless the weather is really ugly.  Jessie usually goes with me.  We walk in my neighborhood.  We walk in the park.  We walk down along the river.  We see all sorts of interesting things and people.  Jessie likes the people.  She thinks each one should pay attention to her.  Sometimes they do and sometimes not.  But when they do, we have interesting conversations, like the one with the guy we met in the park who has a beautiful white Great Dane.  The Great Dane is totally deaf.  It was amazing to watch how she kept an eye on her owner who has taught her hand signals, and how she responds to those signals like most dogs respond to voice commands.  Even with her disability, she is one really happy dog.I did a couple of loads of laundry.  For most people, doing laundry involves throwing clothes into their washer and then into their dryer.  For me, it means hauling clothes down the stairs from the second floor down to the first floor, outside around the building, and down the stairs to the basement.  Then back up the basement stairs, outside to the door to the apartments, and up the stairs to the second floor.  Then I do that a couple more times.  For fourteen years I have been trying to get my landlord to put in an elevator.  He just laughs at me.  I don't know why.  So when I can't put off doing laundry any longer, I do the stair thing, grumbling under my breath the whole time.  But in reality, I know that this is good exercise for me.  Chances are really good that climbing the stairs won't kill me off.  I am still in relatively decent shape for the shape I'm in.  And when I see some of the older folks riding their scooters around town, I consider myself pretty lucky to be able to climb stairs at all.  But I still grumble.I had a day of baking.  I had made up a batch of brownie mix and wanted to test it to see if it was worth making more later.  It is worth it.  They turned out really well, so I won't be buying any more brownie mixes at the store.  I can make my own.  I also tried a new recipe for oatmeal cookies.  After a taste to make sure they were good, they went into the freezer.  Then it was on to the bread.  I can't remember the last time I bought bread at the store.  I have a recipe for \"Grandmother Bread\" that is really good.  It is a recipe that doesn't need milk or eggs, and I can make it even if I am out of those ingredients.  So two loaves of white bread went into the freezer.  I also tried a recipe for wheat bread with herbs.  That is a basic wheat bread and I added some Italian herbs to it.  It is to die for.  I kept out part of a loaf for my supper, and into the freezer the rest went.  So did two pans of cinnamon rolls.  I package each individual roll in a baggie, so I can have a cinnamon roll for breakfast any time I want.  Heaven.The last time I went grocery shopping, I bought a big bag of onions.  So one day this past week I dug out my dehydrator and dried a load of onions.  It is easy to do.  I just peel and slice the onions about a quarter of an inch thick and fill the dehydrator trays, plug the dehydrator in and forget about it until the onions are crispy.  I used the dried onions to make a batch of dry onion soup mix.  I have a small beef roast in the freezer, and tomorrow I will put it in the crock pot, topped with the homemade onion soup mix.  I just love testing these homemade alternatives to store bought.  I haven't been disappointed in the results as yet.I started another blog this past week.  This one is for the Matheny-Olmstead side of my family.  It is listed in the side bar.  I had a request for photos and information recently, and thought this was the best solution, rather than emailing.  I made the mistake of complaining to David when he called me a couple of days ago, that blogging took so much time.  He wanted to know what I was complaining about.....I have all the time in the world.  He is right.  I do.  And I like it.The dogs were getting low on food, so another day I made dog food.  I usually use hamburger, but didn't want to take a bus ride to the store just for meat, so I opened a couple of jars of home canned chicken, added a jar of carrots from the pantry, some frozen, cooked green beans and some rice cooked in home canned chicken broth.  Stirred it all up, bagged in zip bags and froze it.  It really worked slick to have the meat, broth and carrots all canned so I didn't have to spend the better part of the day cooking.  I just found a blog with a video on canning hamburger, and I may do that next week.  I really liked being able to grab jars from my pantry.  Makes the job so much easier.Which left plenty of time for this.These little hexagon flowers are addicting.  I now have enough of the colored flowers for a quilt top and am putting the light colored borders around each of them.  Today I will raid my fabric stash for green fabric to use to connect each of the flowers.  This quilt top is going together much faster than I thought it would.  I listen to audio books while I sew.  I found a website where I can download audio books, and although they are not the latest novels to come out, and they are old enough to be in the public domain, they are still fun to listen to.  This week I have heard a couple of Sherlock Holmes books, one that was a comedy and another mystery set in the 1920's. So I guess that to say that I hadn't done much this past week wasn't entirely accurate.  My life may not be as exciting as the lives of those who are busy with their jobs, busy with outside activities, involved in stress and drama, but it isn't just vegging in front of a TV, either.  In fact, it is just the way I had hoped for many years that it would be.  And I like it this way."},

{"title": "Stuffing in a Bag", "date": "Sunday, October 17, 2010", "text": "Lately I have gotten into making my own convenience foods at home.  This is partly due to the price of the store bought foods and partly due to the fact that I like the idea of knowing what I am eating.  I usually have the ingredients on hand, so there is no extra bus trip to the store.  The added bonus is that these convenience foods taste better than packaged.The one I like most is \"Stuffing in a Bag.\"  I found it on the \"Chickens In The Road\" blog, which is one of my favorite places to find recipes.  I tried a couple other recipes for this Stove Top Stuffing-like mix.  Some of the other recipes called for mixing vast amounts of dry bread crumbs with the seasonings, storing it all in a large air-tight container, and then dipping out the correct amount for each serving.  I found that the seasonings tend to be unevenly distributed with that method.  But this recipe calls for making the recipe in individual servings which allows for the right amount of seasonings in each bag.  And it is really good.  Jeri stopped by the other evening while I was eating supper, which included this stuffing, and when she tasted it, she said that she thought it tasted better than the store bought stuffing.Here is the recipe:Stuffing in a Bag3 cups bread cubes (I make my own with homemade bread, but you can use purchased bread cubes.)1/2 Tbsp. dried parsley2 Tbsp. dried onion or 1 Tbsp. powdered onion (I like the dried onion best)2 Tbsp. dried celery or 1 Tbsp. celery salt  (Cub has dried celery, cheap.)1 tsp. thyme1/2 tsp. pepper1/2 tsp. sage or poultry seasoning1-1/2 tsp. powdered bouillon (I have used chicken or beef bouillon with equally good results.)DirectionsCombine everything in a zip lock bag.  Seal and store in a cool place.Directions for cooking:Bring 1-1/2 cups water and 1/4 cup butter to boil in a saucepan. Stir in contents of bag; cover. Remove from heat. Let stand for 5 min. Fluff with fork.Or you can place the contents of the bag in a microwave-safe bowl, Add the water and stir, and then cut the butter over the top and microwave for 7 minutes.  Fluff with a fork.I like this stuffing baked over skinless, boneless chicken breast or tenders.  Just bake the chicken, and cover with the cooked stuffing for the last 10 minutes of baking.  Add a veggie or salad, and it makes a quick, delicious meal.I have collected a number of these do-it-yourself mix recipes, and am having fun trying them out.  I like the idea of spending mere pennies for something that tastes better than the equivalent in stores.  Appeals to my simple lifestyle and my sense of cheap!  I think I will try my recipe for Onion Soup Mix next."},
{"title": "An Afternoon at the Apple Orchard", "date": "Thursday, October 14, 2010", "text": "Last Sunday felt more like a summer day than a fall one.  Not your typical Minnesota fall day, but a good day for a trip to the apple orchard.David, Staci and the kids came by my place.  The kids always like to see my resident furballs, so after some serious doggie and kitty petting, we headed out to the orchard to pick apples.According to Boston, Maddie and Jacob, it is against the law to pick apples before having pony rides, so that was first on the agenda.Then we got on the wagon pulled by a tractor, much to Jacob's delight, and headed out to the orchard. I was so busy picking apples with Boston and Maddie helping me fill two big bags, that I forgot to take pictures.  But I did get this one of the girls enjoying the fruits of their labor.We weren't very far away from the main buildings at the orchard, so we just took a leisurely walk back, where we found that trail through the woods that I showed you in the last post.After stopping for a late lunch, we headed back home.  It had been a truly wonderful day.  I always so enjoy spending time with my kids and grandkids, and there was the added bonus of apples.  Fresh off the tree.  Doesn't get much better than this.So now it was time to do something with all of those apples.  I have recently gotten back to canning much of my own food, as I did years ago.  So that is what I did with most of the apples.  There is apple pie filling, applesauce and apple jam.  I'm thinking that they will taste really good over the winter.I still have these left over...so today I am making apple muffins, a couple of loaves of apple bread and whatever other recipes I can find to use them up.I would show you the apple crisp I made, but it didn't last long enough to photograph."},

{"title": "Church Supper Dog Food", "date": "Wednesday, October 6, 2010", "text": "I have already owned up to spoiling my dogs.  But sometimes a pet has earned the right to be a wee bit spoiled.  Both of mine spent the first seven years of their lives living in kennels with wire mesh runs, and having litters of puppies.  So if I spoil them, it is OK.  They earned it.  The spoiling includes making homemade dog food for them.Now, there is a method to my madness.  When I first got Jessie, she wouldn't eat anything that I gave her.  I tried several brands of dry dog food.  She wouldn't touch any of it.  Then came the various and assorted brands of canned food.  When I finally found one that she would reluctantly eat, it made her sick.  That nasty stuff is tough to clean out of carpeting.So finally in desperation, I called her previous owner and asked what she fed her dogs.  I mean, Jessie is just little and it doesn't take long for a little dog to lose weight and become dehydrated.  It wasn't looking good.  Turns out they were raised on homemade dog food, which consists mostly of chicken breast, vegetables and rice.  So I adapted her recipe to use less expensive meat, which lately has been hamburger that has been on sale.  Worked like a charm.  Now she is getting just a little bit tubby, so I have to cut back some.  Lily dives right in and loves it, too.  Problem solved.When I make this concoction, I make a whole pot load at once, package it into sandwich bags and freeze it.  I can do two or three months worth this way.  Turns out, it is a whole lot cheaper than processed dog food and, according to my vet, is better for them.  The last time I was in the middle of mixing this stuff up, consisting of browned hamburger, rice, green beans and sliced carrots, my landlord stopped by to fix  a faucet that was leaking.  He stood in the kitchen talking with me for a time, and then finally asked me what I was making.  He said that it smelled pretty good.  When I told him that it was dog food, he just laughed.  He said that he thought I was mixing up a huge hot dish for a church supper.I guess he wasn't that far off the mark.  Throw in a couple of cans of cream of mushroom soup, a few handfuls of french fried onions on top, and I could probably get away with it.  I'm guessing that I won't be asked to bring a hot dish to any of our family get-togethers any time soon."},
{"title": "Homemade Doggie Treats", "date": "Monday, October 4, 2010", "text": "I will be the first to admit that I spoil my dogs.  Can't help it.  I am just wired that way.We have fallen into a routine, the dogs and me.  First thing in the morning, they are given a treat.  This is to keep them out from under my feet while I fill their food bowls.  Then, about 7:00 or 7:30 in the evening, they seek me out for some serious play time on the floor.  Ears are scratched and bellies are rubbed.  Theirs.....not mine.  They chase the toys I toss for them and run around in circles and have a good old time.  When all of us have had enough playing, they get another doggie treat, and then they pretty much settle down for the night.So last evening when I was getting their biscuit treat for them, I read the ingredients in the stuff I was feeding them.  Scared me half to death.  There were 41 ingredients listed on the back of the package.  I recognized only a half a dozen of them, and the rest I had no clue what they were, and could pronounce only about half of those.  Now, I understand that a dog will eat week old road kill if given the opportunity.  Or just about any other rotten thing that they can find. But road kill can't possibly be as bad for them as what is in those biscuits.So I went through my recipes, and sure enough, I found one for doggie biscuits.  Five ingredients.  Had them all in my cupboard.  So I stirred up a batch.  Cut them out with a little bone-shaped cookie cutter.  Baked them in the oven.  Didn't take much time at all.  Aren't they cute?Jessie and Lily love them.  And I can pronounce the name of every ingredient."},

{"title": "Salsa and Tomatoes", "date": "Tuesday, September 21, 2010", "text": "A couple of weeks ago, David called me to ask a couple of questions about the process of home canning foods.  He had, in the spring, planted a small garden.  Frankly, when I saw it, I didn't give much hope for it producing much.  It was located along the side of his house and didn't receive much direct sunlight.  But he enjoyed it and the kids did, too, so who was I to rain on their parade, as it were.Much to my surprise, that little garden lived up to their expectations.  His family ate their fill of sweet corn and tomatoes, all grown in their little garden.  He had enough produce left over to can this salsa.......and these tomatoes.I am impressed.  I thought that home canning was done only by those of my vintage.  For us, it had been a way of life and a necessity in order to feed our families.  My generation and my parents' generation grew large gardens and canned enough produce to last the winter.  I remember canning both chicken and venison, making jelly and pickles, and canning a variety of fruit.  The taste was far superior to that of store bought, and without the added ingredients whose names I can not even begin to pronounce.Not all of the old way of doing things were good.  But this one is, and I am glad to see it being carried on."},

{"title": "On Getting Old", "date": "Friday, September 17, 2010", "text": "I love to read blogs.  I tend to read those about quilting and crafty things as well as genealogy related blogs, because they are interests of mine.  But I also enjoy some of the personal blogs, where I get a peek into the lives of interesting people.I have noticed a bit of a trend lately, of folks bemoaning the fact that they are aging.  Some complain about gray hair and others about the lack of hair altogether.  Others list a litany of minor aches and pains, and still others obsess over a wrinkle or two.  As I am pretty content with my Baby Boomer - Senior Citizen status, I find this puzzling.  Then I was reminded of an article that I had saved quite some time ago.  I can't give credit, for I have long since forgotten where I found it, but I would like to share it with you, as it pretty well describes my attitude toward growing old.On Getting Old - Author Unknown\"The other day a young person asked me how I felt about being old. I was taken aback, for I do not think of myself as old. Upon seeing my reaction, she was immediately embarrassed, but I explained that it was an interesting question, and I would ponder it, and let her know. Old Age, I decided, is a gift. I am now, probably for the first time in my life, the person I have always wanted to be. Oh, not my body! I sometimes despair over my body, the wrinkles, the baggy eyes, and the sagging butt. And often I am taken aback by that old person that lives in my mirror (who looks like my father/mother!), but I don’t agonize over those things for long. I would never trade my amazing friends, my wonderful life, my loving family for less gray hair or a flatter belly. As I’ve aged, I’ve become more kind to myself, and less critical of myself. I’ve become my own friend.I don’t chide myself for eating that extra cookie, or for not making my bed, or for buying that silly cement gecko that I didn’t need, but looks so avante garde on my patio. I am entitled to a treat, to be messy, to be extravagant. I have seen too many dear friends leave this world too soon; before they understood the great freedom that comes with aging. And Whose business is it if I choose to read or play on the computer until 4 AM and sleep until noon? I will dance with myself to those wonderful tunes of the 40 & 50’s, and if I, at the same time, wish to weep over a lost love … I will.I will walk the beach in a swim suit that is stretched over a bulging body, and will dive into the waves with abandon if I choose to, despite the pitying glances from the jet set. They, too, will get old. I know I am sometimes forgetful. But there again, some of life is just as well forgotten. And I eventually remember the important things. Sure, over the years my heart has been broken. How can your heart not break when you lose a loved one, or when a child suffers, or even when somebody’s beloved pet gets hit by a car? But broken hearts are what give us strength and understanding and compassion. A heart never broken is pristine and sterile and will never know the joy of being imperfect.I am so blessed to have lived long enough to have my hair turning gray, and to have my youthful laughs be forever etched into deep grooves on my face. So many have never laughed, and so many have died before their hair could turn silver. As you get older, it is easier to be positive. You care less about what other people think. I don’t question myself anymore. I’ve even earned the right to be wrong. So, to answer your question, I like being old. It has set me free. I like the person I have become. I am not going to live forever, but while I am still here, I will not waste time lamenting what could have been, or worrying about what will be. And I shall eat dessert every single day. (If I feel like it). \"Amen."},
{"title": "The Scrabble Players", "date": "Thursday, September 16, 2010", "text": "I wonder how many folks can say that a board game evokes warm and fuzzy memories.  Well, this one does it for me.My parents retired to the area of their childhood homes in northern Minnesota.  That was good for them.  They had relatives living there as well as friends from when they were kids.  It is such a beautiful area with lakes and forest.  I often long to be there again.The not so good thing for me was that I live about 250 miles south of that lovely country.  Oh, I went for visits from time to time, but not nearly as often as I would have liked.  The responsibilities of paying the rent and keeping food on the table prevented more trips to what I still consider paradise.So I called them.  A lot.  If I couldn't see them as often as I would have liked, hearing their voices was the next best thing.  Mom had health issues that made talking on the phone difficult for her, so I mostly talked to my Dad.  He would tell me all about what had been going on in their lives and I would give him reports about their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. About half the time when I asked Dad what they were doing, he would reply that he and Mom were playing Scrabble.  I would always ask him who was winning.  He would always reply that Mom was winning, and then he would add, \"But she cheats.\"  And she would then hotly deny it.  I don't think either of them ever cheated at anything in their entire lives.Mom has been gone now for fourteen years and Dad for nearly six.  Their Scrabble game has a place of honor in my little apartment.  Whenever I look at it, I smile, thinking of the many hours they wiled away playing the game and of the teasing way Dad always blamed his losses on Mom's cheating.I miss them."},
{"title": "A Good Day For Baking", "date": "Wednesday, September 15, 2010", "text": "I woke up early this morning to the sound of rain falling and thunder rumbling.  I had thought about making a run to Target for a few things, but waiting for a bus in the rain is not high on my list of fun things to do.  I have been told on occasion that because I am not made of sugar, I will not melt in the rain.  But still, decided to postpone that little excursion. Seemed like a good day to do some baking.  I had stocked up on bananas as I had a craving for banana bread.  When I bake, I usually make enough to put some by in the freezer.  This notion comes from my Mom.  Whenever she did any baking, she always made enough to stock the freezer.  Her reasoning was that if she did this, she would always have baked goodies on hand if company came to call.  My reasoning is that if I bake a lot at one time, I only have to clean up the mess once.  Makes sense to me.I tried a new banana bread recipe.  It comes from the \"Chickens in the Road\" blog that I read every day.  The link is in my list of blogs I follow.  The lady who writes it lives on a remote farm in West Virginia, and I love reading about her life there.  Makes me wish I could do the same thing here in Minnesota, and reminds me of a time when I did.  She has some awesome recipes for down home cooking and baking, and I find myself using those recipes more and more often.  I have never been disappointed in the results.So this morning I took this........and turned it into this.One of these loaves will not make it to the freezer.  Didn't even survive in one piece long enough for a picture.  It is probably the best tasting banana bread I have ever made.  A couple of slices and a cup of coffee made a good breakfast.  And should any of my kids decide to stop by, I think there might just be a loaf in my freezer with your name on it."},

After she ran down a little bit, and after telling me that she loves me, Maddie handed the phone to her sister.Boston just started Third Grade, and she told me all about her class and her teacher and friends and that she really likes school this year, too.  When she finished, I told her that I love her, and she replied that she loves me more.Jacob won't start pre-school until October, but he couldn't be left out of the ritual First Day of School picture taking session.I am so happy that the kids love school and hope that they keep that level of enthusiasm as they grow older.  But mostly, I am happy that they share that enthusiasm with their Grandma."},

We are heading to urgent care.\"The email was sent to Staci, who was at work but already knew what had happened, and he added a copy to me because he knows I always want pictures.  However, if I had seen this email before hearing about what happened, I may have been a bit concerned.  After all, it isn't every day that one receives an email with a picture of one's grandson's bloody noggin.It seems that a falling object (I think it was a candle holder) had landed with a thud on top of Jacob's head, resulting in those holes in his scalp.  When I asked if Jacob had needed stitches, David told me that they don't use stitches for something like this any more.  I guess that it has been so many years since I needed anything stitched up that I didn't know this.  It seems that a dab of surgical glue took care of it.  And from what I understand, a stop at Dairy Queen on the way back home is the best healing medicine of all."},

It didn't take long for her tooth to fall out.I got a phone call from Maddie the evening after she lost her tooth.  She had all sorts of things to tell me about the visit from the Tooth Fairy.  Not only did she leave the usual money for Maddie's tooth, but there was a treat of a package of gum as well.  But the really neat thing was the letter she left just for Maddie.  As I listened to her read that letter to me, I couldn't help but think it was a pretty special Tooth Fairy who would make the loss of a first tooth such a memorable occasion for an equally special girl."},
{"title": "Guilty Little Secret", "date": "Wednesday, August 4, 2010", "text": "It is hot outside.  Hot and humid.  Sticky.  Icky.  I don't like hot and humid.  My body rebels.  I get cranky.  So it is better for everyone concerned if I just stay inside as much as possible and enjoy my air conditioning.  That is OK with me.  I have lots to keep me busy.  Chores that I have been putting off while the weather was pleasant and I was enjoying being outdoors.  Things like cleaning out the refrigerator.  I put that one off a little too long.  It looked like someone's science experiment gone horribly wrong in there.  But it is done.  One of the closets has been cleaned out, as well as some dresser drawers that have been waiting for my attention.  Several other small projects are done as well.Now don't get the idea that I have suddenly turned into Susie Homemaker.  Not so.  These chores have been done when I needed a break from this.These are hexagons.  Lots of them.  Each is hand basted over a paper hexagon to hold it's shape.Then each one is hand sewn to another to make these little flowers.All of them will be hand sewn to background hexagons to eventually make a Grandmother's Flower Garden quilt.  I have always wanted to make one of these quilts.  Never before had the time.  But what with the heat and humidity outside and knowing that I wouldn't be venturing out much until it cools down some, this seemed to be a good time to start one.  Don't look for it to be finished any time soon, as once the top is finished and the batting and backing are in place, it will be hand quilted.  I suppose I could machine quilt it, but I want it to look old fashioned and machine quilting just doesn't accomplish that.Now, the most comfortable place in my apartment for me to sit and work on these quilt pieces seems to be at my computer desk.  The chair is comfy and the light is good.  Gives me a nice work surface.  Because I watch very little television, I searched around and found a website for online radio.  One of my choices was a category entitled \"Old Time Radio.\"  Which led to my guilty little secret.I am hooked on old time radio detective and mystery stories.  Those from the 1940's and 1950's.  They come from a time when families gathered around the radio in the evenings to listen to their favorite serials.  I remember as a little girl, listening to many of these stories.  My family didn't own a television until the early 1960's.  So radio was a big part of our lives.  Oh, I listened to lots of early rock and roll, much to the chagrin of my parents, but it was the stories I loved.  Stories like \"The Green Hornet,\" \"Dragnet,\" \"Phillip Marlow, Private Detective,\" \"Mysterious Traveler.\"  They are obviously dated and sometimes hokey, but they are fun to listen to.  Now and then I will find comedies like \"George Burns and Gracie Allen\" or \"Jack Benny\" or \"Fibber McGee and Molly.\"  They are still funny, even after all these years.  The other evening I even listened to Orson Wells' \"War of the Worlds.\"So there it is.  My guilty little secret.  I guess I could eliminate the guilty part, as I don't really feel too guilty about enjoying these stories that remind me so much of a time when life was so much more simple than it is now.  I sort of like that part."},

After talking for a time, he asked if I had checked my email today.  I hadn't.  He told me that he had emailed me a picture of Jacob that was taken last Friday.  The stick in his hands used to hold a Dilly Bar.  Most of the Dilly Bar can be seen on Jacob.  But it sure looks like he enjoyed it.A couple of hours later, I got another phone call from David.  He told me to check my email again.  He had just sent me pictures of Jacob with a salamander.  David added a deck to the back of his house earlier this summer, and was doing some landscaping around it.  While digging holes to plant some bushes, he found a couple of salamanders.  Thinking that the kids might like to see them, he put them in a bucket.  Looks like Jacob is having a pretty good time with his little friend.  I gotta admit that my mind wanders off in strange directions now and then.  While looking at these pictures, all I could think of was a line from an old Bugs Bunny - Daffy Duck cartoon, where the Abominable Snowman says, \"I will name him George, and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him.\"  Perhaps I will completely grow up one day, but not today.Good luck to you, George the salamander.My grandson Chris has his own car now.  This came in really handy for me yesterday.  I have been having some minor problems with my back and neck.  The term, \"A pain in the neck\" has become personal.  I realize that I can be a pain in the neck, and have been from time to time.  Probably will be again.  Consider yourselves warned.  However, this particular pain in the neck and back made it impossible for me to lift or carry anything.  And I needed groceries.  I was nearly out of dog food and cat food.  Without them, things could get ugly.  The pantry was getting pretty bare as well and I needed help.So Chris picked me up Saturday afternoon.  Took me to Cub.  Pushed the cart and lifted heavy stuff off of shelves for me.  And if that wasn't enough, he hauled them all up the stairs for me when he brought me home.  Nary a complaint.  Was still smiling after all of that.Yep, a grandson with a car is a good thing.  Especially when that grandson doesn't mind helping out his Grandma.  Thanks, Chris."},

Barney the Cocker Spaniel comes to mind.  When I refused to share my meal with him, he would turn his back to me and grumble.  Seriously.  Other dogs over the years have expressed their displeasure in various ways.  But my Yorkies do it best, hands down.  They win.  They are good at it.Early last evening I decided that Lily was in desperate need of a bath.  Yorkies have beards.  Beards collect food.  As she dives head first into her food bowl each day, her beard had collected enough to feed a family of four.  So into the kitchen sink she went.  Lots of nice aloe vera doggie shampoo.  Pretty smelling conditioner to keep her skin from drying out.  Should have made her feel better.  A nice warm bath makes me feel better.  Didn't quite work out that way.Lily was in a snit.Noun 1. snit - a state of agitated irritation; \"he was in a snit\"annoyance, botheration, irritation, vexation - the psychological state of being irritated or annoyedYep.  It was a snit alright.  Stayed as far away from me as she could get.  Wouldn't take a toy when offered.  Wouldn't chase a ball.  Just kept her head turned away from me a lot.The snit quickly turned into a pout.pout 1. To exhibit displeasure or disappointment; sulk.Stalked across the living room, crawled into her little doggie bed, gave me the Evil Eye and stayed there the rest of the evening.  The girl knows how to pout.  No amount of sweet talk or cajoling would move her.  Even the well loved chicken strip treats wouldn't budge her.  So I went to bed, leaving her to think up ways to speed up my entrance through the gates of Hell.And this morning she was right back diving head first into her food bowl, begging for a treat after, barking to keep the bad trucks on the street outside away from me and in general, back to her same hyper, saucy self.I love Yorkies."},
{"title": "Picking Blueberries", "date": "Saturday, July 17, 2010", "text": "Jackie posted on Facebook today about how she and Cody had picked blueberries, and her blueberry pie was about ready to come out of the oven.  This prompted an exchange about blueberry picking and gardens.  Brought back memories of the many hours we had spent picking blueberries when we lived up north.  Liz chimed in with a story about Jim eating too many blueberries when he was just a little tad.  They worked as nature's laxative while Aunt Etta and Curt were babysitting him.  I'm thinking that the story was probably repeated for years after, as are most stories that we would like to forget!All the talk about blueberries prodded my memory for a story that Dad told me years ago about his family picking blueberries.  I may have written about this before, but indulge me.  The more of my memory cells that go by the wayside, the more I am apt to repeat myself.  Get used to it.  It's not likely to get any better.Dad talked of picking blueberries in what he called the \"blueberry bog.\"  I have never seen a blueberry bog.  I've just picked berries in patches in the woods.  According to Dad, the bogs were somewhere up around Big Falls and the land was covered in blueberry bushes.Dad said that our Grandpa would hitch a team of horses to a hay wagon.  Then he and the biggest of the boys would load a cast iron cook stove on the wagon, along with boxes of canning jars, canning kettles, berry picking buckets and whatever else they needed for several days of berry picking.  And off the whole family would go to the blueberry bog.When they reached their destination, they would gather wood to keep the cook stove going, and then grab their pails and head out to pick berries.  Dad told me that the berries were so thick that sometimes they would use a tool that looked like a big scoop with a handle like a sugar scoop, but with times like a fork.  They would rake the bushes with this scoop and then dump the berries from the scoop into a pail.  He said it was lots quicker than picking by hand.  This photo I found online most resembles his description of the blueberry scoop he used.Most of the kids would pick blueberries.  Grandma and a couple of the older girls would clean them, pack them into jars and can them on top of the wood stove.  They kept this up, picking berries during the day and sleeping either on the hay wagon or under it at night, until Grandma decided that she had canned enough blueberries to last until blueberry season the following year.  Dad said that it usually took several days to get enough berries to satisfy Grandma.  With nine children in the family, it took a whole lot of berries.I remember when I was where I could pick blueberries, I always thought that I processed a lot of berries.  But for me it was so much easier than for Grandma.  Most times I would just clean the blueberries, pack them into freezer bags and pop them into the freezer.  I canned some for sauce and made jam from some, but there was no canning berries enough to feed eleven people, using a wood stove sitting on a hay wagon out in the middle of a blueberry bog.  Grandma was amazing."},
{"title": "Good Old Freezer - Rest in Peace", "date": "Friday, July 16, 2010", "text": "It was a good old freezer.  Not too big.  Fit nicely into the kitchen of my rather small apartment.  Gave me over 15 years of faithful service.  Kept frozen gallons of ice cream, many pounds of meat purchased on sale, countless loaves of homemade bread and bags of veggies.  It made the trip from Missouri where it first came to live with me, to Minnesota, without a whimper.And then it hiccuped.Just a small thing.  A couple of days ago I was reading blogs that I follow when my computer screen went black - just for a second or two.  Not enough to even shut down the computer.  I thought it was just a little glitch in the electricity in our town or in my building.  I live in an old building in an old town.  Little glitches happen now and then.  Nothing to worry about.Then yesterday, another two second screen black-out.  Now I was beginning to wonder what was going on.  Checked connections and outlets and discovered that the outlet where the freezer was plugged in, was not working.  Hit the reset button and it still wasn't working.  Went to the breaker box, reset the circuit breaker and Ta-Daa - everything worked.  I am so smart!Well, not all that smart.  While pulling the freezer away from the wall to check the motor to see if dust bunnies were raising large families in it, I found that the side of the freezer where the motor is, was hot.  Not warm.  Hot!  Fry an egg hot.  Probably should have checked that first.   Upon opening the freezer door, I discovered a lake in the bottom and bags of thawed food.  Yep.  I was staring into the face of a dead freezer.  Lucky for me, it was a nearly empty dead freezer.  And even luckier, I found out it was dead before it burst into flames.Enter my youngest son, riding his white charger.  He had planned to take me to Sams Club so I could stock up on food for the freezer.  He even said that he would haul it all up the stairs to my apartment for me.  I don't do stairs too well any more.  Especially while burdened down with bags and boxes of frozen food.  (Ask my oldest son about this.  He has been my pack mule on many occasions - huffing groceries up my stairs.  Without complaint.  Bless him.)  I called youngest son and told him about the demise of my freezer and that I would have to postpone our food buying excursion.  An hour later, my phone rang.  It was said son on said charger.  He had found a new freezer for me, just the right size for one person living alone, and at a price that would fit into a fixed income lifestyle.  Not only that, but there was free delivery involved as well as free disposal of the now dead old freezer.  He would take care of the details for me and let me know when delivery would take place.So good-bye old friend.  You have served me well.  And thank God for adult children who ride in on their white chargers to save the day."},
{"title": "Murders in Our Family", "date": "Sunday, July 11, 2010", "text": "Usually, genealogy research consists of finding names, dates, places, census records, cemetery records and the like.  Pretty tame stuff.  But now and then something will pop up that is a total surprise.  The two murders within our family was one of those surprises.By way of background information, my grandmother on my Dad's side of my family was Rachel Alzora \"Allie\" Olmstead.  Her father was Alonzo Olmstead.  Alonzo had a sister, Elizabeth Olmstead who married, in 1866, Joshua Lee Foster.  Elizabeth and Joshua had four daughters, the third of these being Electra Annie (Fannie) Foster and the fourth, Cora May Foster.  The family lived in Jackson County, Indiana.(Left to right:  Elizabeth Olmstead Foster, Cora May and Electra Annie Foster, Joshua Lee Foster)In 1889, Electra Annie married Clinton B. Jordan.  Mr. Jordan was a man of questionable reputation, and according to the newspaper accounts of the time, was known for being quarrelsome and in general, a disagreeable man.  Electra and Clinton's four year marriage was marked by many arguments and possibly violence.  In November of 1893, Electra had had enough of Clinton's abuse, and she left him to return to the home of her parents.  Her younger sister Cora, 17 years of age, was also living with her parents at that time.It seems that after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation with his wife, Clinton Jordan made threats heard by others that if his wife would not live with him, then she would die with him.  This was quoted in one of the several newspaper accounts of the murder. The following is a transcript of the newspaper article that best describes what happened on November 27, 1893. \"MURDER RAMPANTFive Persons Killed in Jackson County.A Jealous Husband Kills His Wife, His Sister[-in-Law], His Father-in-Law, Mother-in-Law, and Then Pointed the Pistol at Himself.Seven miles east of Seymour, in Jackson county, was the scene of a wholesale slaughter on Sunday night.Clinton Jordan married a daughter of Joshua Foster, a prosperous farmer of Jackson county, four years ago.  The couple did not get along very well, frequent quarrels and a separation of a week or ten days ago resulting.Jordan met his father-in-law on Sunday and went home with him.  Soon after his arrival at the home of Jordan's wife a quarrel ensued and the angry husband was ordered from the house.  He refused to go and opened fire on the family.  The first shot, which was intended for the father-in-law, missed him, but struck Miss Cora Foster, aged 17, causing her death in a few minutes.  The second shot struck Mr. Foster in the temple, knocking him down.  He was able to rise and ran to the home of his son-in-law, Wm. Powell, where he died, after suffering terribly for a few hours.  The third shot struck Mrs. Foster, the wife's mother, in the neck, from the effects of which she died in a few hours.  Jordan then turned his attention to his wife, who was trying to defend her mother, but he made short work of her with a knife and pistol.  After viewing his bloody work the desperado opened his vest and fired a shot into his body that killed him instantly.  His clothing took fire and the body was horribly burned.Jordan resided at Seymour, and has not born a good reputation as a quiet, peaceable citizen.  It is conceded that had Jordan not succeeded in killing himself the people down there would have made quick work of him.J. N. Foster, who resides near Petersville, we understand, is a son of the murdered old people.  The murder has created intense excitement in all parts of the state.\"[Note:  The J. N. Foster mentioned should have been F. M. (Frank Marion) Foster, son of Joshua Lee Foster and his first wife, Jane Bedel.]The second murder in our family was that of Frank Elliott Morehouse, brother of my Grandmother, Gladys Morehouse Paul. (Frank Elliott Morehouse)I don't recall ever hearing anyone in our family mention his death.  It wasn't until I had been researching my Morehouse ancestors for a number of years that Dad gave me, along with some other family papers, the transcripts of the first two newspaper articles concerning the death of my Grandmother's brother.  Another cousin found the remaining accounts of Frank Morehouse's murder, and was kind enough to share them with me.  The newspaper articles below are arranged in the order that they were published.From the Sanish, North Dakota newspaper (date unknown)\"FRANK MOREHOUSEAnother sad death occurred at Frank Katcer home northeast of here Saturday afternoon.  Frank Morehouse had been in Sanish Friday and went to Van Hook on the train Saturday morning and started to walk to the home of his parents.  He stopped at Frank Katcer's, being sick and wanting to rest.Left alone in the house, no one knows what followed, but when a shot was heard in the house people rushed in, finding him dead on the floor.  A big rifle was on the floor and a bullet hole near his left temple and another near the back of his head.  The Coroner and the State's Attorney were called and said it was an accidental shooting.  The funeral will be at the house and burial to be made at Amanda today.\"From the Stanley Sun newspaper - Thursday, February 24, 1916\"F. MOREHOUSE MURDEREDFrank E. Morehouse, one of the prominent young farmers living 25 miles south of Stanley, was found dead last Saturday, February 19.  The Coroner's jury found that he had been murdered.He had been shot through the head twice by a 38-5- high power rifle.  The bullets entered his head just back of his ear and came out of the top of his head.  The top of his head was blown open.  The rifle was found lying on the floor beside the body.It appeared as though the murderer, whoever it was, laid the gun near the body to make it look like suicide.So far they have no clue as who did the awful deed.  The murdered man was 24 years old and was to have been married in three weeks.Shortly before his death it is stated that he had quite a sum of money on his person but when the body was found the money was gone.The young man leaves a father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. Chester A. Morehouse, who live south of Stanley, and several brothers.\"The Grand Forks Daily Herald - February 25, 1916\"VAN HOOK FARMER COMMITS SUICIDE BY SHOOTING SELFVan Hook, N.D., Feb. 24  - Frank Morehouse, a farmer living eight miles north of town, committed suicide by shooting himself behind the right ear this afternoon.  The deed was done at the home of Frank Kaczor who lives four miles north of town.  Mr. Morehouse had been in town the day before after medicine and started to walk home, but became quite sick and stopped at Frank Kaczor’s home to spend the night.  About 12 o’clock he became despondent and at 4 a.m. he was found dead with the gun beside him.Mr. Morehouse was a single man 25 years of age.  He was a farmer and well thought of in his neighborhood.\"Aberdeen Daily News - March 6, 1916\"MYSTERY SURROUNDS DEATHCause of Killing of Frank Morehouse in North Dakota UnknownSanish, N.D., March 6 – In the case of Frank Morehouse, who was found dead in the house of Frank Kayzer, who lives five miles northeast of Sanish, Saturday afternoon, February 19, a mystery remains uncovered.Morehouse arrived at the Kayzer home about 10 o’clock Friday night, complaining of being very ill.  Dr. Blatherwick was summoned from Van Hook by ‘phone and found the young man’s temperature 101, and gave him some medicine.On Saturday afternoon, about 2 o’clock, Mrs. Barron, who lives across from the Kayzer home, heard a shot and, rushing over to the Kayzer house, found Morehouse lying in a pool of blood and a rifle alongside of him.The bullet had entered back of the right ear, coming out of the left temple, killing him instantly.A coroner’s jury was empaneled, who brought in a verdict of accidental death.  On Tuesday another jury was called and the verdict was foul play.  Sheriff Slaughter and deputies are at work on the case and it is probable that new developments will be brought to light shortly.Frank Morehouse bore a good reputation in Sanish, was not a drinking man and was engaged to be married shortly to a prominent Van Hook young lady.\"The Aberdeen Sunday American - December 29, 1916\"HELD FOR MURDERStanley, N.D., Man Faces Charge 10 Months After CrimeStanley, N.D., Dec 28 – Special – The murder of Frank Morehouse in his homestead shack near Van Hook, this county, last February, is laid at the door of Frank Kaczor, just arrested at the insistence of county officials after a long extended inquiry into the crime.At the preliminary examination held in this city, Kaczor was bound over to the district court for trial, first degree murder being charged.C.A.

Perhaps a trip to the local courthouse or historical society in that part of North Dakota might reveal more information, and that is a trip I would like to make sometime.  Letters, emails to newspapers, and internet searches have brought little or no results and I would like to find out if anyone was ever convicted of this murder.I have always loved a good mystery and to uncover one within my family is amazing to me.  I guess you never know what you will find when you start digging around the roots of your family tree."},
{"title": "Surprises", "date": "Friday, July 2, 2010", "text": "There are surprises that are not so good.  Those surprises are like...\"Surprise!  You screwed up your taxes and owe.....\" or \"Surprise!  The city is working on the water lines and is shutting off the water for the rest of the day.\"  just about the time you started two weeks worth of laundry, or \"Surprise!  Your rent is increasing again this year.\"  Those kind of surprises I can easily live without.But yesterday I had a surprise that I will take any old time.  In the middle of the afternoon my phone rang.  It was my brother.  We chatted for just a minute and then he said that if I would come downstairs and open the door, we could chat in person.  He was standing in the parking lot of my building!After letting him in, I made a pot of coffee.  In our family, coffee is one of the necessities of life.  When I was growing up, I rarely remember seeing my Mother at home when she didn't have a cup of coffee within easy reach.  And when I would go to Blackduck to see my Dad, my first question for him was always, \"You got the coffee pot on?\"  He always did.  There were times when my parents would ask me to drive them places, usually if the trip was a great distance from their home.  They both were good for about an hour of driving, and then I would have to find a place to pull over so Dad could get out his thermos and they could have their coffee.  Dad always said that he was \"getting coffee hungry.\"Kelly and I sat at my kitchen table drinking our coffee and talking of many things.  He was in the area to take some tests that would take him up the next rung of the ladder at his job.  Although I am still not sure exactly what a \"Boilermaker\" does, I can tell that he works hard.  It is not the job for the lazy or the  faint of heart.  I do know that he earns every penny he makes.  He tells me about working high in the air like a steel worker or in an enclosed area where he has to wear a gas mask because of acid fumes.  I couldn't do it.  It would scare me to death.  Or kill me off.  Or both.We laughingly tell each other about our various aches and pains, just like a couple of old farts!  I have reached the official \"old fart\" stage, but he isn't quite there..........yet!  We can complain to each other like this because we understand each other.  We both know what arthritis feels like, and we don't like it.  And once in a while it just feels good to bitch a little bit.  And we know that the other one gets it.  The funny part is, even though our bodies seem to be unraveling a bit, we still feel like kids, inside.  Well, maybe not kids, but young.  I don't know about him, but there are times when I look in my bathroom mirror in the morning and wonder who that old woman is.  The one who is staring back at me.  How did she get into my bathroom.  She bears no resemblance to the person who lives inside of me.We talk about our families, what they have been doing and how they are all getting along.  We marvel at the fact that between us we have thirteen grandchildren.  You throw my sister's grandkids into the mix, and that's a whole lot of grandkids among we three siblings.  When we were young, I never in the world would have thought that one day I would be sitting drinking coffee with my brother and be bragging on our various and assorted grandkids!  Of course, when I was still young, I never considered the possibility that we would ever be old enough to have grandkids.  It is amazing how that happens.  Sort of sneaked up on us while we weren't looking.When I am with my brother, our conversation usually turns toward our parents.  Kelly says that once in a while he will see something old - a piece of machinery or a tool - and not know what it is.  He says that it always crosses his mind that he will ask Dad, because Dad will know.  I find that when I am entering information into my genealogy program, I think that I will have to ask Mom or Dad about an aunt or uncle, cousin or grandparent, because they will know.  It hurts us that we can't.  So we talk of the good times and the funny things that happened over the years.  Laughing is easier than crying.  Goodness, but I miss them.All too soon Kelly has to leave.  He has a meeting to attend and I understand that.  I just hate to see him go.  But I am so very glad that he wanted to spend time with me and was able to spend a couple of hours over coffee and conversation.  Some surprises are really good surprises, and this was one of them.  I love you, brother."},

{"title": "On Retirement", "date": "Sunday, June 27, 2010", "text": "It has been a month since I left the world of the working masses and entered this new phase of my life.....Retirement.  I have to say that it is proving to be an interesting time of my life.  There are some things that I miss, but mostly there are things I am learning.I have learned that I can stay up until two in the morning watching movies and it is OK.  Probably not the most exciting thing in anyone's life, considering that my choices are movies like \"Snow White,\" \"Peter Pan,\" and \"Cinderella.\"  None of those movies where men chase each other around in cars, trucks or on motorcycles, shooting at one another.  Or movies where things blow up a lot.  Nope.  Not for me.  Watching \"Snow White\" reminds me of when I was a little girl and my Dad took me to a theater to see this Disney classic.  I remember how scary it was, watching Snow White run through the creepy forest and how I laughed at the antics of the Seven Dwarfs.  I think part of the memory is the fact that I got to spend time with my Dad.  Mom wouldn't go.  She held the belief that movies were sinful.  I wasn't allowed to go to movies when I got a little older.  Perhaps this is why I love these old movies.  Teen-age rebellion run amok.  I still can't watch \"Bambi,\" tho.  I cry when Bambi's mom gets killed.I have learned that I don't need to feel guilty if I don't do the daily chores immediately upon getting out of bed in the morning.  Previously, on the weekends especially, I felt the need to do things right away because I only had a certain number of hours before going back to work.  This morning, for example, while enjoying my morning coffee, I spent a little over an hour going through some quilting blogs that I like to read.  Which led to perusing a folder of quilt patterns that I have saved on my computer, looking for just the right pattern to use to make a quilt out of some delicious fabric I bought a short time ago, which led to drawing out the pattern on graph paper...........you see how it goes.  Now, the earth didn't stop rotating because I didn't wash the dishes first thing.  Oh, they did get washed, the kitchen floor did get mopped and my bed is made, but I didn't feel guilty for leaving those chores go for a time.  Letting go of that guilty feeling has taken practice.  I am getting pretty good at it.I have learned that I now have time to take absolute delight in the simple pleasures that life has to offer.  Before retirement, there was never enough time.  For anything.  At least it seemed that way to me.  I don't ever recall a time that I wasn't working, whether it was on the farm or at a job.  But now, things have changed.  When I go for a walk I have time to enjoy my surroundings.  There is an old historical house about a block away with the prettiest lawn and flowers, along with benches for the public to rest on and take in the beauty around them.  In the fourteen years that I have lived here, I had never had the time to stop there and enjoy on my walks with my dogs.  Now it is a regular stop for us.  Sometimes while doing something in my apartment, I will look down to find two pairs of eyes staring at me.  You know the ones I am talking about.  Those big, brown puppy eyes.  Now, instead of finding something to keep them busy and out from under foot, I find that I can take the time to flop down on the living room floor and pet and play.  There is real pleasure in having Jessie sit beside me, lean into me and smile that little demented chipmunk smile of hers when I give her the attention that she needs.  The same goes for Lilly, who is too wound up to just sit, but who will bring her toys to me so I can toss them for her so she can go pick them up and hide them again.  We are working on the \"fetch and bring back\" thing, but if hiding them makes her happy, so be it.  I find that I can spend a day baking bread or sitting at my sewing machine, and truly enjoy the simple things that make me happy and content.I find that I do miss seeing other people on a regular basis, but not so much.  I have never needed to be around large groups of people, unless they were members of my family.  I think I take after my Grandma Paul in that respect.  I remember that she wasn't very comfortable in crowds and that she was happiest when the people surrounding her were her family.  I don't feel the need to go out and spend time with acquaintances, but thoroughly enjoy the occasional days when I see my family.  Like the times when one or the other of my children will call and ask if I would like to go to breakfast or lunch, or when one of them just drops by to see me for a little while.  These times warm my heart and take care of any need I feel to get out and about and see people.  I also love going to dance recitals or hockey games or any of the activities that my grandchildren are involved in.  And the family get-togethers that we occasionally have are really high on my list of things I love to do.  Even the phone calls I get where the grown-up child or grandchild on the other end says that they just wanted to see how I am or tell me about what they have been doing, make my day.  I do miss seeing Starla, as we spent three years in each other's company and many hours talking about everything under the sun.  But I stop in to see her once or twice a week and she calls me regularly to let me know what is going on in the shop, like yesterday when she called to tell me that she was doing a happy dance because one of the most difficult dogs we worked on (scratching, biting, growling, nasty dog) was now going to another groomer.  We thought we should send that poor groomer a sympathy card, but refrained.  So I guess, all in all, I see enough people and talk to enough people so that I don't really miss it all that much.Old habits are hard to break.  I still find myself usually up at the crack of dawn, sitting in my rocking chair, coffee cup in hand, watching the sunrise.  But now I have the time to watch.  I find myself sticking to some routines, such as immediately feeding the animals and giving them fresh water first thing in the morning.  They get cranky if I don't.  Especially the fat cats!  I still do the hated and despised laundry early on Sunday mornings, as this is the best time to do it while everyone else in the building is still asleep and I have the laundry room to myself.  I still fix myself a couple of eggs and toast for breakfast most mornings, as I did before going off to work.  As my father before me did most of his adult life.  Routine like this is good.  Keeps me from getting lazy or into the habit of sleeping late, which I probably couldn't do anyway.  A lifetime of getting up early in the morning has wrecked any hope of being one of those people who can sleep until the crack of noon.  More power to them - sometimes wish I could.Perhaps at a later date I will decide to do some different things.  Maybe take a couple of classes at the quilt shop in my neighborhood, or take a road trip, just for the fun of it.  But for now, I think that this retirement thing is probably one of the best decisions I have ever made.  The stress level is non-existent and having time - real time and not just a couple of hours on a weekend - to do the things that I love, is priceless.  I do believe that it is working out just fine.And now I think the pooches and I will go for a little walk down by the river and see what we can see.  Life is grand."},
{"title": "Comfort Food", "date": "Saturday, June 26, 2010", "text": "I rarely sit around feeling sorry for myself.  Let's face it.  I have very little in my life to feel sorry about.But this week I indulged in a short period of time wallowing in self-pity due to a summer cold.  One of those nasty colds that just hangs on.....and on......and on.  Makes me wish, just a little bit, that I still drank.  Could have drowned it in brandy or some other suitable alcoholic beverage touted as a cure-all for the common cold.  But alas, it was not to be.  Just waited it out and sniffled a lot.As feeling sorry for myself wasn't working real well, I decided to do something to make myself feel better - at least make my state of mind feel better.Comfort Food!  Great idea.  I would bake some bread.  I was down to my last loaf anyway, and hadn't been able to work up enough ambition for a trip to the grocery for more. There is something therapeutic about smacking (kneading) bread dough.  Gets out the aggression.  Gets your mind off of your problems.  Great upper arm exercise.  So I stirred and beat and kneaded and shaped.  Got a little bit carried away.  But I now have my freezer stocked.  And it worked.  Forgot all about my cold.I think I will go have a cinnamon roll now."},
{"title": "Fish Fry", "date": "Saturday, June 26, 2010", "text": "A few weeks ago Kelly called me.  He said that he and Jackie had a bunch of fish in their freezer and asked if we would like to get together for a fish fry.  When I talked to David, his response was that he was always up for a fish fry.  He and Kelly worked out the details.Last Saturday we met at David and Staci's home.  Duane picked me up and we were glad that we had left early, for about 10 miles from the turn-off on I-94, we encountered traffic moving at a snail's pace, slowed by road construction.  Took an hour to go that 10 miles, and at one point we saw a guy walking along the shoulder of the highway.  He seemed to be making better time than we were.It was a perfect summer day.  Lots of blue sky and white, fluffy clouds.  I love the new deck.  It adds so much to David and Staci's house.  And it makes a really neat platform for watching the grandkids swim in their pool.  The girls swam and dove and splashed and played and Jacob sat in his little floaty boat and pulled himself round and round the pool's edge.  Staci said that she was glad that Jacob actually likes to wear his pint-sized life vest.  Makes life much easier and he has so much fun in the pool.David got into the act, getting into the pool to retrieve toys,  I think he had nearly as much fun as the kids did!And then there was the fish.  Real honest to goodness northern Minnesota fish, from a real Minnesota lake and not from a box at a supermarket.  David made foil packets of fish topped with peppers, onions and spices and cooked them on the grill along with packets of cubed potatoes with garlic and rosemary.  Wonderful!  Kelly and Jackie also brought a variety of fruit including my personal favorite, blueberries.  Duane brought a really good watermelon - you just can't have a picnic without watermelon - and my contribution was a double batch of chocolate chip cookies.  It just doesn't get much better than this.  One of these days I will remember to take pictures of the food, but this day everything looked so good that taking pictures was the last thing on my mind.  Let me at that fish!We relaxed on the deck, talking and laughing and watching the kids play.  There were memories revisited and current topics discussed.  My family is so well informed and although now and then opinions differ, they are able to talk of these things without rancor.  I love listening to these conversations.It was getting on to evening when it was time to head home, and after ice cream and root beer floats, Duane and I started back south.  I always hate to leave, but the time spent with my family is time well spent.  It had been such a good day.  Kelly and Jackie.....if you ever find yourselves with an excess amount of fish, give us a call.  I'm thinking that we can find a way to help you out with that!"},
{"title": "They Dance", "date": "Tuesday, June 15, 2010", "text": "My Granddaughters dance.  And they do it well.  Last Saturday they had their annual dance recital and this Grandma was privileged to be there to watch them dance.Last year was my introduction to dance recitals.  I had spent a Saturday afternoon watching the girls dance, and was impressed at how well they did, remembering all of the moves and dance steps.  Even when I had a working memory, I doubt that I could have remembered everything that they were required to do.This year's dance recital was amazing.  Boston and Maddie's groups performed three dances as well as the closing number and the Daddy-Daughter dance.  I noticed right off how much both of the girls had improved in their dancing from last year.  Some of the girls in each group would glance around from time to time to make sure they were doing the dance steps right.  Not my granddaughters.  Eyes forward, smiles on their faces, performing each dance flawlessly.  I am so proud of both of them.  Their Dad tells me that both of them just love to dance, and it shows.  The hours spent on dance class and practice have surely paid off.  They are so much fun to watch.It warms a Mom's heart to watch her son dance with his daughters.  Even though David said that he was a bit nervous about his performance, it went off with out a hitch.  To see that so many Dads took the time out of busy schedules to attend the practices and learn the steps for this dance and to see so many little girls enjoying dancing with their Daddies gives me a double dose of the warm fuzzies.Staci deserves a round of applause for all of the work she does behind the scenes.  She helps the girls with their costumes, does their hair and makeup and, as was the case last Saturday, stayed on for the second show that Boston was in, thus spending nearly an entire day on just this one recital.  Boston is on the competition dance team for her age group, so Staci has been spending time at the various competitions as well. The taking of photos or video during the performance was not allowed, so afterward we all met in the lobby of the school where the recital was held, and we were able to get a few photos of our dancers.  Staci's parents were there to share the pride I felt in our granddaughters and they enjoyed the day as much as I did.Boston and Maddie, keep on dancing.  You are a joy."},
{"title": "My Guardian Protector", "date": "Tuesday, June 1, 2010", "text": "Everyone should have someone who protects them.  Meet my Guardian Protector.  Her name is Lily.It is not really accurate to call Lily a \"rescue dog.\"  It is true that she lived all of her seven years with a breeder of Yorkies.  Same place I got Jessie Jane.  However, she was not abused or neglected.  She was well fed, well cared for, had regular veterinary care and had play dates with other female Yorkies..  She had three litters of puppies.  The lady who owned her does not breed her dogs indiscriminately nor does she pump out as many puppies as possible to sell at pet shops, but is careful of how many litters they have and sells puppies only after meeting the prospective buyers.  Lily has not had a litter for over two years.She does, however, need to learn behaviors that a pet of her age who was adopted as a puppy has and she does not.  She needs to be a little better with where she can potty and where she can not.  Now that I am home with her every day, she is getting better at going outside when she needs to.  This involves many trips up and down the stairs from my apartment, but, hey.  I need the exercise.  At least that's what I keep telling myself!  (Grumble, grumble.)She needs to learn to walk with her harness and leash.  Jessie got it right away.  Jessie and I go for walks all over town.  Lily, on the other hand, mostly goes for a \"carry.\"  This past weekend I spent lots of time outdoors with her and she is starting to get the idea.  Yesterday afternoon she walked to the end of my block and back without having to be carried.  Baby steps.  Time and patience. I think she is getting it.She needs to be socialized with people.  The only person she saw before coming to live with me, was her owner.  She is shy with people other than me.  I am thinking that when we get the walking on a leash thing down and she is able to go for walks with Jessie and me, she will get better at being around people.  Jessie is a good teacher.  She just loves everybody.Now, about this protection thing.  Lily seems to think that I need to be protected.  And she does it well.  Ready and on the alert.I live in an apartment downtown.  Early in the mornings on weekdays, there is a parade of delivery trucks and garbage trucks that make their way on the street in front of my home and in the alley alongside.  After nearly 14 years of living here, I just don't hear them any more.  They are just background noise that I blank out and ignore.  Not Lily.  I think she firmly believes that it is her job to make sure that no truck ever gets close enough to me to do harm.  She stares at whatever window the offending sound is coming through, stiff legged, ears standing up, tail straight in the air.  And she barks.  And barks.  And barks some more.  She puts her whole self, all nine pounds of her, into keeping that truck away.  Must work.  No truck has gotten to me yet.Now, I am a sucker for cute.  Especially when it comes to babies or animals.  Will get to me every time.  And as long as Lily's bark is small enough so that she doesn't disturb the neighbors (I asked and they can't hear her), I find it kind of cute that she is so protective.  However, last night we went right on past cute to annoying.  On the hallway wall right across from my apartment door hangs a smoke alarm.  Normally I am happy to have it there.  Smoke in the hall, I will know about it.  However, the battery must be low, as yesterday the alarm began chirping at regular intervals - about 30 seconds apart.  I didn't have a battery to fit it, and the local convenience store didn't either.  Nor did the neighbors I talked to.  As there is probably a fire code law for disabling a smoke alarm in a common area of an apartment building, I decided to leave it alone.  It didn't bother me.  It did bother Lily.I am now retired.  Which means that I didn't have to get up this morning to go to work.  Which also means that I don't have to go to bed the same time the chickens do, but can stay up late with the big folks if I want to.  Which I did last night.  I found a funny movie to watch on my computer, so I watched it while I sat and cut out pieces for a quilt.  Then I found another one and watched that, too.  2:00 AM I finally was tired enough to go to bed.  No problem.  That is, until Lily decided that this chirping sound outside the door was a threat.She barked.  She growled.  She stalked stiff legged back and forth in front of the door.  She sat on the floor by my bed and protected me from the chirping monster that would surely attack at any moment.  I took her to bed with me hoping that she would calm down.  Nothing doing.  I put her in her kennel.  That didn't work either.  Put the kennel as far away from the chirping monster as I could.  Nope.  She was having none of that.  She didn't calm down until about 5:30 this morning when I gave up all hope of sleep, got up, made coffee and turned on the TV to listen to the news.  Lily took a nap.I truly hope that my landlord arrives soon to fix the chirping monster.  If he doesn't - doggie Valium?  Sounds like a plan."},

{"title": "Lunch With Family", "date": "Saturday, April 17, 2010", "text": "I hang my head in shame.  I really do.  I have been a slacker when it comes to blog entries.  I offer no excuses.  A few words from family members like, \"So, Mom.  I checked your blog and saw that there haven't been any new posts.  How come?\" and \"I've been looking for new pictures, but I haven't seen them yet.\" etc., have prompted me to, as my father has been known to say, get the lead out of my britches and get going.  I finally downloaded the photos from my camera and here they are.A while back, Kelly was working in the area, and David thought it would be fun for us to get together on a Sunday for lunch at his house.   We did, and it was.Jackie came down from Bemidji and I was so glad she was able to join us.  Jeri and Chris picked me up for the ride to David and Staci's house.  Chris drove, and even though I just couldn't resist a little bit of teasing of a new driver, I must say that he did a good job of getting us there in one piece.  Duane came in from Gaylord and said he couldn't miss the opportunity to see Kelly and Jackie.David fixed grilled ham and cheese and Reuben sandwiches to go with the salad that Jeri brought.  I think next time I will have to bring twice as many chocolate chip cookies, as they disappeared in a flash.  Good food and good conversation seem to be a hallmark of our family get-togethers and that day was no exception.  It is so good to catch up on what everyone has been doing.  Just spending time with my family warms my heart.  There is nothing better than a house full of brothers and sisters, children and grandchildren.  I truly hope that we can do more of this come summertime.In six weeks I will have no excuses for not keeping up on blog entries.  Right after Memorial Day I will be officially retired.  I finally will have the time to spend taking pictures, blogging about them, taking the dogs for long walks, working on projects that have been sitting on closet shelves for a long time, spending time on my computer searching genealogy websites for those long lost black sheep in my family that tickle me so when I find them, and in general, enjoying my life.  I think I will like this.  Life is good."},
{"title": "Christmas 2009", "date": "Sunday, January 10, 2010", "text": "As you all know, I usually accompany a blog entry with photos of whatever I am writing about.  That's not gonna happen here.  Even though we all had a good time, when I looked at all of the pictures I had taken, you all had looks on your faces like you had just been awakened at 3 AM by a wrong number phone call.  Grumpy!  I know that there were smiles and even some outright laughter.  I was there.  I saw and heard them.  But I failed to capture them with my camera.  So here is my account of Christmas 2009 - minus the photos.It has long been our custom to meet as a family over the Christmas holiday, and this year was no exception.  Jill and Joe hosted the Christmas Day event this year and we were treated to a lovely brunch.  I must get the recipe for the egg dish that Jill served, as it was delicious.  I must also get her recipe for a cookie that is like a peanut butter cookie surrounding a Reece's bite-sized candy.  Wonderful!  I wonder if my grown children realize how much I enjoy seeing them all gathered around a table, sharing a meal.Duane and Kathy weren't able to join us this year, and we missed seeing them.  Mother Nature didn't co-operate this year, and she had dumped a good amount of snow on us, plus sleet and some freezing rain.  The streets in town were alright for travel as were the freeways, but the country roads they needed to use to get here were just plain ugly.  When Duane called to tell me that they wouldn't be able to make it, he told me that the trip on Christmas Eve from Kathy's daughter's house in the next town, back to Duane and Kathy's apartment, had taken over twice as long as it normally did, including coming within a hair's breadth from being run off the road by an oncoming snowplow on a curve.  Although I wished that they could join us, I was relieved that they didn't try to travel on roads that bad.After our meal, the kids were anxious to see what treasures were inside the wrapped packages under the tree.  They did a fine job of finding out and seemed to be happy with their gifts.  It is always fun for me to watch them open their presents.  It so reminds me of when my own children were young and could cover a living room floor with ribbon and bits of wrapping paper faster than one would think humanly possible!We sat over coffee and visited for a time.  Boston and Maddie played tennis on the Wii game and Jacob tried to get into the act with a hand held control that wasn't connected to the game.  We didn't tell him, and he had a good time playing with his sisters.  Zach treated me to a demonstration of what he had learned so far with his guitar lessons.  He is doing well with his guitar.  I am glad that some musical ability has been passed down to his generation, for it has skipped me entirely.  I really loved watching and listening to him.Early in the afternoon I went home, and shortly thereafter got a phone call from Jeri.  Her kids would be home soon from visiting their father, and would I like to have supper with her, Jon and the kids.  Of course I would!  So I enjoyed a really good ham supper with them.  I need to get her recipe, as well, for a creamy salad she served with the meal that has sort of a mocha tasting base and is Chris's favorite, I am told.  That's one of the fun things about this season - adding to my recipe box the new recipes that my kids come up with.After supper, Chris and Nicki, who had been pestering us to open presents early, finally opened them and soon their floor was littered with wrapping paper and ribbon.  Even though they are both now teenagers, I still delight in the expressions on their faces when they see what is inside their packages.  I think both were pleased with their gifts.  Pooh, the Goldendoodle, pretty much stayed out of their way, but spent lots of time showing me what a really neat chew bone she had, and leaning against me to have her ears scratched.  Soon after, Jeri took me home as the temperature was dropping and before long the slush on the streets would turn to ice.As I often do, once I got home and got comfy in robe and slippers, I reflected on how much I had enjoyed the day.  I do believe that my kids get it.  It isn't about the presents.  It is all about family.  Whether it is a Christmas brunch or dinner, or a picnic at the lake, it is the times we all get together as a family that are important.  Just lately, as I was emailing back and forth with a dearly loved cousin, we were talking about how it seems that the older we get, the faster time seems to fly by.  The fact that some of this fleeting time is spent in the company of my children and grandchildren is so very dear to me.  I am so grateful that we all live close enough to one another that we are able to take the time from busy schedules to gather together now and then.  I wonder, sometimes, if my family knows that they are the one constant source of joy in my life, and how much they are loved."},
{"title": "Road Trip", "date": "Friday, December 11, 2009", "text": "I love a road trip.  Always have.  But road trips for me have been nonexistent since I no longer own a car.  That is, right up until I discovered a local car rental agency that would deliver a car right to my doorstep.  I had promised Emily that I would go up north to see her after Edan was born.  There was no way I was going to break that promise.  Emily, Edan and her husband, Eric, would be going back to Hawaii shortly after Edan's birth, and this would be my only opportunity to see that beautiful baby in person.  So I ordered the car and planned to leave last Friday morning.Thursday evening my phone rang.  It was David.  He wondered if I should be driving that far by myself.  I found myself laughing at him, and I reminded him that I was a big girl now, fully capable of taking care of myself.  I promised to call him and let him know that I had made the trip to Bemidji just fine, and that if the weather turned bad, I would pull over and not try to drive through a snowstorm.  Even though I laughed at him, it warmed my heart to know that this son of mine loves me enough to worry about me.I left for the Great White North on Friday morning.  As I dislike freeway driving, I took some less traveled roads out of the city, enjoying looking at the scenery rather than miles of tail lights.  I won't tell David that at one point I missed a turn and wound up backtracking about 20 miles.  There were a few snow flurries on the way, but the roads were dry and it was a good trip.I arrived in Bemidji in the afternoon, and Jackie welcomed me with a hug.  Kelly wasn't home as he was out of town taking some classes for his job.  Jackie and I drank coffee and talked until it was time to start supper.  She fixed BBQ ribs that were to die for, and soon family began arriving.  Emily, Eric and Edan were there; Randi, Rick and their two little girls Tabitha and Nicole; Ashley, Jason and their son, Griffon; Dustin, Trish and their daughter Dezi; and Jackie's son Cody.  There is not much that is better than a house full of family.  There was lots of talk, even more laughter, and kids everywhere.  Nicole and Tabitha were calling me \"Grandma\" and insisted on sitting next to me at supper.  Dezi entertained us with \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\" followed by a sweeping bow from the waist to the applause of her audience.  She must have learned that bow at her daycare, as her parents were surprised to see it.  Baby Edan is a love.  I got to do some serious baby snuggling.  Although he weighed over 8 pounds at birth, he seemed so very tiny.  He is such a good baby and slept through all the commotion.  I hope his mother will keep me supplied with pictures as he grows, because it will be a long time before I get to see him and his parents again.  I had not seen Griffon in person before - only in pictures, so I got a double dose of baby snuggling.  This \"Great-Auntie\" thing is wonderful.  He was so good, and is into a fun stage of smiling and giggling at anyone who talks to him.  He is such a sweetheart.After everyone took their tired children and headed to their homes, Jackie and I sat and talked for a while until I could keep my eyes open no longer.  Jackie has the ability to make me feel so welcome and so very much at home.  I wonder if she knows how much I love having her as my sister.  She went out of her way to give me a truly wonderful evening with family, and I am grateful.Saturday morning I feasted on homemade cinnamon rolls, and after a few cups of coffee to get me going, Jackie and I decided to go do a little Christmas shopping.  I found one gift I had been looking for, and she bought a few grandkid presents.  We had a nice lunch at a local restaurant and then headed back home.  Dusty, Dezi, Ashley, Jason and Griffon came by to see me and it was fun to talk with them.  Kelly came home in the afternoon, and Dezi was jumping up and down yelling, \"Grandpa, Grandpa!\"  Kelly said that you can't get a better homecoming greeting than that.  Later over coffee we had some good brother-sister talk.  We don't get to do that often because of the distance that separates our homes, so I cherish the times we do have together.After a great home cooked breakfast Sunday morning there was more good family conversation.  Jackie's son Brent stopped by and I was happy to be able to meet all of her family on this trip.  He has just moved back to the Bemidji area and was telling us about his new job, which sounds exciting.  It involves catering trucks and has all the potential for being a huge success.  Dusty and Dezi came by later in the morning and I was glad to see them again before heading back home early in the afternoon.I had been joking that I was praying for a blizzard so that I wouldn't have to leave quite so soon.  I think that was partly joke and partly wishful thinking.  I love living close to my family here in the Cities, but I so love the north country and my family there.  I wonder if Jackie and her children realize how much it means to me to be so fully accepted as a member of their family.  I guess that, upon reflection, I have the best of both worlds.  I can see my children and grandchildren fairly often here, and I can go to a place I love and see more family.  I think I will have to do this road trip thing more often."},
{"title": "I Am Thankful", "date": "Saturday, November 28, 2009", "text": "Thanksgiving is a time to reflect on our blessings and those things we are thankful for. My blessings were all together at David and Staci's home on Thanksgiving Day. How I love these times when my family is all gathered in one place to spend time with each other.David is a wonderful cook, and a brave one. He tried out several new recipes for our Thanksgiving dinner, and all turned out well. I had never tasted turkey roasted on the grill. He said that he marinated it in an apple juice brine overnight before grilling. It was soooo good. Jon won the debate as to whether the accompanying side dish was \"dressing\" or \"stuffing.\" It seems that it is only \"stuffing\" when it has been stuffed into the bird before roasting. Makes sense to me. As is our custom, each brought something to share for our meal, and we feasted like kings on the traditional Thanksgiving fare.It was such fun for me to watch my grown children working together in the kitchen preparing our meal. There was much talk and more laughter with good natured teasing thrown in for good measure. I was reprimanded for snitching a piece of turkey, but I thought I should make sure it was fit for everyone to eat. The grandchildren hovered, waiting for it all to be ready to eat, and Jacob came carrying his bib. He was more than ready. Charlie circled the kitchen, making sure that if a crumb dropped on the floor, he was on it. It was his job to keep the floor clean, and he did it well, right up until the time he was banished from the kitchen.I brought Jessie with me as I wanted to start getting her used to being with people. She did well, did not leave any puddles on the floor, got along well with Charlie, and the grandkids had fun playing with her.After pie and coffee later in the afternoon, it was time to head on home. When I got home I downloaded the pictures I had taken from my camera onto my computer. Looking through them, I thought about how very much I have to be thankful for. And most of what I am thankful for was gathered together for a truly nice Thanksgiving Day."},
{"title": "Meet Jessie Jane", "date": "Sunday, November 22, 2009", "text": "A couple of weeks ago I learned that the lady Starla and I know who breeds Yorkies was retiring one of her females and wanted a good home for her.  What happened next should not surprise anyone who knows me well.  Starla drove out to the farm and picked her up for me.  She is 7 years old, but has the energy of a much younger dog.  I wasn't thrilled with her name (Tiffany), and she isn't a princess kind of dog to go with that name, so we named her Jessie.  Starla started calling her Jessie James, but when I pointed out that she is a girl and not a boy, the name was changed to Jessie Jane!I hadn't planned on taking her to work with me, but Starla said I might as well bring her so she could get used to being around other dogs and people.  With a breeder dog who isn't around people other than her owner, socializing is important.  So I took her to work one day last week.  Apparently she loved being there, as the next morning, while I was putting my shoes on, getting ready to leave for work, she came to me dragging her harness and leash.  Yep.  Cute will win every time.So we now have a shop dog who lives with me.  Starla calls her our \"Wal-Mart Greeter\" as she will come out of her kennel to greet anyone who comes in the door with a dog.  She doesn't know what doggie treats are for, which is probably just as well, and she didn't know what toys were for either, until I gave her the one she has in the photos.  Wherever she goes, the toy goes.  Jessie gets along with the cats just fine unless one of them tries to play with her toy.  Then watch out!I know of several people who have successfully litter box trained their Yorkies, and as I am not overly fond of early morning walks in the snow, we are working on that.  First I put newspaper in the litter box, but she just shredded it.  Hand a grand time.  Little bits of newspaper from one end of the apartment to the other.  So then I tried cat litter.  She got the idea and was using the box until the cats found it.  That was the end of that.  So now I will try litter especially made for dogs.  Should work just fine, and I won't have to trudge through the snow every morning and evening over the winter.  Works for me.I find that I am really enjoying having Jessie live with me.  She is pretty good company, doesn't bark unless a cat steals her toy and she makes me smile.  That is worth it."},
{"title": "Flying Lessons", "date": "Sunday, November 15, 2009", "text": "I have grandchildren doing all sorts of fun things, but this is a new one.  Zachary had his first flying lesson!His Mom tells me that she had seen on the Flying Cloud Airport website that they offered flying lessons for kids.  She said she mentioned it to Zach and he said he would like to do it.  So a week or so ago, he took his first lesson.  I wondered if he had flown with his Dad, who is a pilot, but Jill said he went with an instructor.  The plane he was in was a Cessna 172, and he learned how to ascend and turn.  He also logged his first half-hour in his pilot log.Jill tells me that he loved it, he wasn't at all scared, and he wants to get his pilot's license.  So he will be taking more lessons next summer.I have been hooked on flying since my Dad took me for a ride in Bemidji in one of those planes with the pontoons that take off from the lake.  I was about Zach's age when we did that, and I don't know if those airplane rides are even there any more, but I loved it.  Jill knows how much I love flying, so she and Joe gave me a plane ride for my birthday one summer.  I was impressed at what a good pilot Joe is, and I was having so much fun that I forgot to take pictures!So I'm thinking that when Zach gets his pilot's license, maybe - just maybe - there might be another plane ride in it for me."},
{"title": "Pumpkin Season", "date": "Thursday, October 29, 2009", "text": "The leaves are falling, the days are getting shorter and it is pumpkin carving season.David and Staci went with their kids and Grandma and Poppa to the pumpkin patch to pick out their Halloween pumpkins.  Looks like they had a fine time selecting just the right ones.And Zach has his Jack-o-lanterns all ready for Halloween.  His mom says that he designed the big scary one and the two smaller scared ones himself.I remember that my Dad always devoted one corner of his garden on the farm for growing pumpkins.  We would keep an eye on them over the summer to see if any of them would grow big enough for Jack-o-lanterns.  As Halloween approached, Libby and I would stake our claims on the biggest pumpkins for carving.  The smaller ones were brought in from the garden, cooked and canned for pumpkin pies, pumpkin bars, and all the other delicious things made from pumpkin.  It always seemed to me that the home grown and home canned pumpkin produced pies that tasted better than when using store bought canned pumpkin.When I had children of my own, I followed Dad's practice of growing a patch of pumpkins in my garden.  Over the winter, I would go through the seed catalogs and order seeds that promised to produce huge pumpkins.  They never quite lived up to the expectations, but we had some pretty respectable sized Jack-o-lanterns at Halloween time.  I so enjoyed carving pumpkins with my kids, seeing the scary faces their imaginations came up with.  When the Jack-o-lanterns all had candles in them, and their scary faces glowed in the night, it was time to roast the pumpkin seeds.  A friend of mine had given me the recipe, which is nothing more than tossing the seeds in melted butter, placing them in a single layer on a cookie sheet, sprinkling them with salt, and roasting them in a slow oven for an hour.  A couple of times we experimented with using seasoned salt or garlic salt, but we seemed to like the seeds with plain salt the best.Some say that fall is a depressing time of year because it means that lazy days at the lake, family picnics, boat rides and all of the other summertime activities are over.  I just don't see it that way.  Although this year I could have used a little less rain and a little more sunshine.  When my family lived in the northern part of the state, we would often in the fall of the year pile into the car to go for a ride and look at the beautiful fall colors.  A favorite drive of mine was the Turtle River Lake road.  Sections of that road wound through forests of bright orange and red trees, while other parts showed us yellow and gold leaves.  I never seem to get enough of the beauty of nature.Fall was also a time to rake the fallen leaves from the yard.  Rather than bagging them up in huge plastic leaf bags, we raked them into piles on the driveway and burned them.  I still miss the smell of leaf smoke in the air.  Last year David's kids helped him rake leaves, and it was good to see that kids still enjoy jumping into a pile of leaves, as I did as a child.I love this time of year."},
{"title": "She's a Teenager !", "date": "Saturday, October 10, 2009", "text": "A few weeks ago Jeri told me that Nicki was having a birthday party to celebrate her 13th birthday, at their house, with several 12 and 13 year old girls attending.  The weather was still warm, and the plan was for the girls to sleep in a large tent in the back yard.  I told Jeri that she was a brave woman, but it sounded like lots of fun for Nicki and her friends.  By the looks of the pictures Jeri took, it seems that the party was a huge success.During the evening a friend and neighbor of Jon and Jeri dropped by, and he offered to take the kids wake surfing the next morning.  In spite of being up most of the night doing whatever it is that teenage girls do at a sleepover (From what I am told, sleep was not involved!) the girls were up and ready to go out on the lake bright and early.  Chris joined the party, and they all went out to wake surf, with varying degrees of success.  Looks to me like they really had fun.Where has the time gone?  When Chris and Nicki were born, Mike and I were living in Branson, Missouri.  It tugged at my heartstrings to know that Chris was growing and I was not there to watch him do it.  So when Nicki was born, I told Mike to start packing.  We were going home.  Best move I ever made.  But it just doesn't seem like 13 years have passed since I held my first baby granddaughter in my arms.  There have been four more grandchildren born since that time, and I am so very lucky to be able to be close to all of them.Happy Birthday, Nicki ! ! !Love,Grandma"},
{"title": "Of Cinnamon Rolls and Peanut Brittle", "date": "Sunday, September 20, 2009", "text": "David made cinnamon rolls this morning, using my recipe.  I got my recipe from my Mom, who would, when I was a small girl, make them and time it so they came out of the oven about the time I got home from school.  There is nothing quite like walking into a kitchen that is filled with the aroma of baking bread.  I haven't made these for a long time, but I think I may need to bake some again.Most times with recipes I got from Mom, there was just a list of ingredients and she just assumed I knew how to put it all together.  So I have added instructions the way I do it.  Good luck!Cinnamon RollsDissolve 1 package dry yeast in 1/2 cup warm water.Heat 1/2 cup milk to nearly scalding, remove from heat and add 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup shortening and 1 teaspoon salt, stirring to dissolve.Cool milk to lukewarm and stir in yeast mixture.Add 1 cup flour, beating well.Add 1 egg, beating well.Add 2 1/2 - 3 cups flour, one cup at a time, mixing well after each addition.Turn dough out onto floured surface and knead until smooth.At this point, Mom's recipe says to let dough rise in a greased bowl until double in size, but I have always skipped that part.Take half of the dough and roll it into a rectangle about the size of a large cake pan.  Spread butter over the dough, sprinkle with either white or brown sugar and then with cinnamon.  I have never had amounts for these - just went by what looked right.Roll the dough the long way and pinch the seam so it holds together.Slice into about 1 inch pieces and arrange in a greased cake pan.Cover with a towel and let rise until it looks right (at least doubled in size - probably more) and bake at 350 degrees until golden brown on top.  Brush tops with melted butter.While still warm, drizzle with a glaze made by beating together 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon milk and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.Do the same with the other half of the dough.  Mom always made one pan to eat and another for the freezer.  They are wonderful!As long as I am giving you the above recipe, I thought I would add a few more that maybe my children will remember.  The next one is for buns - the ones I used to make for family gatherings.  It is the same recipe Mom used and it makes mountains of them.  The recipe can be cut in half, but I always made lots and froze them.  I have been making these since I was about 12 years old, right around the time that Mom's hands became so crippled that she couldn't do this any more.  This recipe is just a list of ingredients, and is made the same way as the cinnamon rolls.  These taste better than any bakery buns I have ever had.  Maybe that's because my Mom made them!Buns4 packages dry yeast dissolved in 1/2 cup warm water2 teaspoons salt1/2 cup melted shortening2 cups milk, scalded1/2 cup sugar2 well beaten eggs7-8 cups flourShape into balls the size of an egg.  Place on a greased cookie sheet and let rise.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25 - 30 minutes or until golden brown on top.  Brush tops with butter while still hot.  Remove from cookie sheet and cover with a towel to let cool.  This keeps them from drying out.I think all of my children remember \"Grandpa's World Famous Peanut Brittle.\"  My Dad would make this every year about Christmas time.  He didn't use a candy thermometer - just watched it to see when it looked right.  Sometimes he wouldn't watch too closely, and he would heat it to nearly scorching.  Now if I did that, it probably wouldn't be fit to eat.  But his peanut brittle always was better than anyone else's.  Here is the recipe, straight from his recipe card.Peanut Brittle2 cups sugar1 cup white syrup2 cups raw Spanish peanuts2 tablespoons butter2 teaspoons baking soda1 teaspoon vanillaBring 1/2 cup of water to a boil, then add 2 cups sugar, and 1 cup of white syrup, stir until dissolved and boil until it will spin a thread.  Now add 2 cups raw Spanish peanuts and cook slowly over a low fire until it turns a golden brown.  Take from fire and add 2 tablespoons butter, 2 teaspoons soda and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Stir quickly.  Spread on two large cookie sheets that have been well buttered.  Place in a cold area to cool.These are the best sugar cookies ever, and they don't have to be rolled out and cut into shapes.  They just melt in your mouth.  I think Mom got this recipe from Aunt Etta, but I'm not positive on that.  It has been in her recipe box for many years, and because they taste so good, I often will make them at Christmas time, sprinkled with colored sugar, rather than the traditional rolled cookies.  Mix them like you would any other cookie recipe. Mom's Sugar Cookies2 cups sugar2 cups butter2 eggs1 teaspoon vanilla4 cups flour2 teaspoons soda1 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon cream of tartarChill dough and then roll into balls about the size of a walnut.  Butter the bottom of a glass, dip it into a small bowl of sugar, and press the cookie balls flat.  Bake at 350 degrees until the edges of the cookies turn a light brown.The last recipe I'm adding today is the one that Mom made for every family occasion, where there would be a lot of people.  It makes enough to serve 20 - 25, but can be cut in half for family use.  I always thought she made this because it tasted so good, but a number of years ago, at a family get-together for an anniversary or birthday or something similar, somebody asked Mom if they could bring her a plate of this shrimp salad.  She replied that she didn't want any because she didn't like it.  When asked why she made it for family doings if she didn't like it, she replied that she made it because it looked pretty in the bowl!  Now that was my mother - wanting things to look pretty.Shrimp Salad4 cups uncooked macaroni rings1/2 cup sliced stuffed olives2 cups diced celery1/2 cup canned baby peas2 cups cooked baby shrimp1 tablespoon chopped onion1-1/2 cup mayoBoil macaroni rings, drain and cool.  Add rest of ingredients and blend well.My mother's recipe box is an interesting piece of Matheny family history.  There are recipes from relatives, some neatly written on recipe cards and others written on scraps of paper, on the backs of envelopes and still others clipped from newspapers.  Many of the recipes I remember from my childhood, when my mother stayed at home and cooked and baked as mothers of that era did.  Later when Mother became more ill, I remember Dad doing much of the cooking, and he was at least Mother's equal in the kitchen.  A while back, my brother stayed with me for a day or two, and he remarked that I cooked just like my Dad - everything on high heat.  Perhaps that's because I had heard Dad say that only cowards cook on \"low.\"I am a firm believer in learning new things. Keeps my mind active. Keeps the cobwebs from taking over. This past week I learned about Wake Surfing.Jeri stopped by one day while I was at work to download some photos of Chris and Nicki from her camera onto my computer. When I got home that evening and looked at the photos, I had to email her and ask about what the kids were doing. I knew about water skiing and I knew about surfing, but I had never heard about wake surfing. I don't get out much.It seems that in wake surfing, a surfboard is used, but it is shorter than a surfboard used to ride the ocean waves. The person doing the surfing is towed behind a boat like in water skiing, only he or she rides the waves of the wake behind the boat. A friend and neighbor of Jon and Jeri has all the equipment for wake surfing, so he took the kids out on the lake to give it a try. I'd say they did pretty well at it. Looks to me like they were having lots of fun.   My grandson, Chris, works at the Speedway on the weekends during the summer racing season. A couple of weeks ago there was a party for all of the workers, and as a part of that, anyone who wanted to drive one of the race cars could do so.Yep. That's Chris. Driving that car. Looking good. He came in second in the second race. He won't let me talk about the first race. But he did tell me that at one point, the car ahead of him lost a wheel. I'm thinking that it took some pretty fancy driving to keep his car from crashing.Way to go, Chris!!!"},
{"title": "Playing With Grandkids", "date": "Sunday, September 13, 2009", "text": "A couple of days ago David called me and asked if I had any plans for the weekend.  I replied that I had a fun filled weekend planned after working at my job Saturday morning, washing puppies - things like doing the hated and despised laundry, the mopping of floors and perhaps a little cleaning here and there.  Really important stuff.  So he asked if I would like to spend a little time with my grandkids.  Hmmm.....tough choice.  Laundry or grandkids.  I vote for grandkids! David, Staci and the kids picked me up late in the afternoon on Saturday.  We went to a really nice park just a couple of blocks from my apartment.  The kids had a grand time swinging on the swings, showing me how they could go hand over hand on the monkey bars, climbing all over the castle and sliding down the slides.  I had a grand time watching them and taking pictures.  The girls took turns going round and round on the tire swing, just as fast as their Dad could push them, and showed me how high they could go on the regular swings.  Jacob was just everywhere doing everything.  I expect that the kids could have kept this up for a couple more hours, but as the adults were pretty much worn out, we headed to a local restaurant for dinner. Over dinner Boston and Maddie had all sorts of things to tell me - about school and riding their bikes and a play date where Boston went swimming in a hot tub. Maddie cleaned up her bowl of macaroni and cheese right down to the last macaroni, and Boston beat me five games of tic tac toe out of seven. And I was really trying to win. I also learned that Jacob can throw a french fry much farther than I would have thought possible for a child his age!After everyone had eaten their fill, we went back to my apartment for a little while because the kids wanted to see my cats. Now the cats are used to having only me to deal with, and they tolerate me as I am the one who feeds them, so they weren't overjoyed with having their territory invaded. But nobody got scratched or bitten and there was some serious kitty petting going on, so all in all, the kids were happy. When the kids had enough of the cats, and the cats had enough of the kids, it was time to take three tired children home. I got some pretty good hugs and kisses from all three and even some \"Bye Grandma. I love you, Grandma.\"Sometimes I get tired. Sometimes it seems as though all I do is work, whether it be at my job or at home. But then, along comes a day like Saturday when I can spend time with my kids and grandkids, watching them play, listening to them tell me about all the things they do, getting hugs and kisses from them, and suddenly I am no longer tired. Days like this are what makes my life totally worthwhile."},
{"title": "First Day of School", "date": "Wednesday, September 9, 2009", "text": "Last evening my phone rang. It was David, asking me if I was busy and telling me that a couple of girls wanted to talk to Grandma. I am never, ever too busy to talk to grandchildren. I love it when they call to tell me all about what they have been doing. Maddie started Kindergarten last week. When I asked her how she liked school, she said that she liked it a lot. I asked her what she had done in school that day, and she replied that she did recess and lunch - you know, the important stuff - along with Art. She said that day had been \"Yellow Day,\" and she wore her yellow shirt and a yellow barrette and pony in her hair and brought yellow flowers that Dad picked in their yard. And tomorrow was \"Green Day,\" and she was going to wear her green shirt. All in all, I'd say that Kindergarten was a huge success.When I asked Boston, who started Second Grade, how she was liking school this year, she replied that She Loves It! She likes her teacher and has made some new friends already, and had friends from last year in her class and she Just Loves It! I hope that her enthusiasm for school continues. Zach started Fourth Grade this year. Seems like just the day before yesterday that he, too, was starting Kindergarten. He has grown up so fast. Zach says that Fourth Grade is when kids finally get some respect!Chris and Nicki wouldn't let their Mom take any first day of school pictures this year. Seems that they are too old for that sort of thing. So just so they don't feel left out, here is a first day of school picture of them taken several years ago. I'm not sure what grades they were in, but I like this picture. Now this picture taking on the first day of school is not a new thing. It has been going on for a number of years. This picture was taken some 50 years ago. My sister and I were ready to start our first day at Sunnyside School, the two room country school we attended after we moved to the farm. There were three kids in my class. I would love to tell you that I walked five miles to and from school, through the blowing snow, uphill both ways, but I can't. The school was a mile and a half from our house, and I only walked on really nice, sunny days, and only if I wanted to. What a wimp.I wonder what my grandchildren, who attend large, modern city schools would have thought of the little school with four grades in each of the two rooms. That school is gone now, merged with the larger schools in the area. I consider myself lucky to have had the experience of attending that little country school."},
{"title": "Another Family Picnic", "date": "Friday, August 28, 2009", "text": "Family picnics seem to be becoming sort of a family tradition with me and my children and grandchildren.  We got together for picnics a couple of times last year, and again this summer.  I truly hope that this tradition continues.  These times are fun and relaxing, away from the daily grind of our everyday lives.  I'm thinking that they are probably more relaxing for me than for those with small children to chase and keep track of, but everyone seemed to enjoy the time spent as a family.We met last Saturday at a park that has picnic tables and a swimming beach.  The picnic area was shaded by large oak trees, and we sat in the shade and visited. Jacob had a hard time negotiating all of the acorns on the ground.The kids swam and played in the sand, making sand castles that Jacob destroyed as only Jacob can. I believe I saw him belly-flop onto one of them. Jeri told me that when she and her kids were at this same park earlier this summer, the water out by the swimming area markers was over her head. It has been so dry this summer that the water was only just a little over knee-high on the tallest grandchild. But they still had fun playing and splashing.Later in the afternoon we all drove to Jon and Jeri's house close by on Prior Lake, where Jon took us all for a ride in his pontoon. It is a beautiful boat with room for everybody. After a tour of the lake, he anchored in a bay and the kids, as well as some of the older, grown-up kids, dived and jumped off the boat to splash and swim. The younger ones don't do much swimming, but mostly jumping and splashing, climbing back on the boat to jump and splash some more. Some of the younger ones were trying out their diving skills, and I would hear a loud slapping sound, followed by a spray of water. Each time I would hear Jon say, \"Keep your head down.\" I think they sort of got the hang of it after a while. It was a gorgeous, sunny summer day...perfect for an afternoon on the lake.   On towards suppertime, we headed back to the house, where David fired up the grill and cooked hamburgers for all while we set out the rest of the food that everyone had brought. If anyone went home hungry, it was their own fault. Seems we had enough food for a small army - potato salad, fruit salad, veggies with dip and a wonderful chocolate cake that Jill made that had cherries baked into it, topped with whipped cream. Kissed my diet good-bye, I did. Even Pooh, the Golden Doodle, got into the act, cruising under the tables looking for food the kids might have dropped. I think she made out pretty well!After supper we sat and talked for a time, and the kids got a game of \"fetch the tennis ball\" going with Pooh. Both the kids and the dog have boundless energy. I'm guessing that the kids slept pretty well that night, after a day of swimming and jumping and splashing and running and fresh air and sunshine. After hugs all around, it was time for me to go home. I downloaded the pictures I had taken from my camera, and looking through them, reflected on what a really nice day I had with my family. Often, when talking to people my age and older, I hear complaints from them that they never spend time with their grown children and grandchildren. Everyone is too busy for them, they say. I feel truly blessed that every now and then, mine will take the time and effort to spend a day like this with me."},
{"title": "Griffon David Puffe", "date": "Saturday, August 22, 2009", "text": "When I met Ashley, she was due to give birth at any moment.  That was one reason I was so pleased that she would take the time and trouble to drive all that way meet with us at our family get-together up north.  I do remember what the last stages of pregnancy are like, and I don't know about her, but I was ready to do just about anything to to get that whole birthing business over with and be able to see my feet again, or to be able to stand without my back hurting, or any of the other fun things that go along with pregnancy.  So I really appreciated the effort on her part to join us that weekend. Well, here he is.  Griffon David Puffe.  Weighing in at 7 lbs. 13 oz. and 20 3/4 inches long, born on August 17, 2009.  I do believe he is a keeper!I'm thinking here that Grandpa Kelly sort of likes him as well!!!I am so grateful to Jackie for emailing me these pictures, as it will be a while before I can get back north again to see him in person. You done good, Ashley.I love surprises in my email, and this morning I received a really nice surprise.  Jackie emailed me some pictures she had taken when we had all met a few weeks ago.  I was kind of bummed as the pictures I had taken just didn't turn out very well, so I was really happy to get these and be able to share them with you.This is a much better picture of Dustin and Emily than the one I took.  I have so few pictures of my niece and nephew, and now I have this one, and it means so much to me.  Thank you, Jackie.  I also like the next one of Kelly, Emily, Dustin and David eating lunch on the deck.  We all had such a good time that day.Here we have the two youngest members of the family who, left to their own devices, could probably find all sorts of things to get into! They had so much fun playing together.   Kelly and I spent some time looking at pictures on David's laptop. What memories there are within those pictures. And it was a good way to catch up on what has been happening within the family. I know that I can be a real pain in the whatever to my kids, pestering them for pictures so much, but being able to walk down Memory Lane with my brother is one reason that pictures are so important to me. My memory is not what I would like it to be. I seem to have misplaced entire decades within my memory, and seeing the family pictures serves to remind me of things long since forgotten.Rarely do I like to have my picture taken. I would much rather be in back of the camera than in front of it. But I like this picture, because it reminds me of a really good day with family - happy and relaxed. I hope we can have more of these times together soon."},
{"title": "Turn Nicki Loose With a Camera", "date": "Tuesday, August 18, 2009", "text": "Over the weekend I was fiddling with my new camera, trying to get it set up so I could try it out.  I was a bit overwhelmed by all the different settings that I am still learning, but what stumped me was the fact that I needed to do some programming in order to start taking pictures.  Now, give me a computer and I will fearlessly forge ahead until I can get it to do what I want it to do.  But the camera is a whole new ballgame.  So yesterday, fearing that I would mess it up, I called Jeri. who is really good at figuring out things like cameras.  She came over and within minutes had it up and running for me.  Seems all I would have had to do was set the time and date.  DUH!!!While Jeri was here, she downloaded some pictures from her camera.  Nicki had taken these pictures while we were up north a couple of weeks ago.  Here is what happens when you turn Nicki loose with a camera, and add two younger cousins.  I love it!"},
{"title": "Just For the Fun of It", "date": "Sunday, August 9, 2009", "text": "Sometimes ya just gotta do something for the pure fun of it.  Hence, this post.David dropped by my apartment the other day, as he does now and then, to download the latest batch of his pictures onto my computer for me.  Among the pictures were these.  It seems that David was entertaining Jacob by taking pictures of the two of them.  Here are the results.  Which I will post as soon as I finish giggling.  How fun is this!!!Poor Charlie did not have as fun a weekend at the lake as did the rest of us.  By the time David and Staci got to our destination, it was obvious that something was wrong with him.  He was just not acting like his usually happy self.  At first he would yip in pain now and then, with no cause that we could see,  Then later, he seemed to be in pain when bumped or jostled.  He slept with me Friday night, and literally screamed when he jumped down off the bed in the morning.  He occasionally limped, but there was no one thing we could put a finger on as the source of his discomfort.My first thought was arthritis, as I see those same symptoms every now and then in the older dogs that come into the grooming shop where I work.  I was dead wrong.David and Staci told me that he cried often on their way home, so after calling their Vet, David took him to the doggie Emergency Room.  These photos were taken while he was there.  Turns out the poor little guy had a herniated disc in his spine near his neck.  No wonder he was crying in pain.  David said the Vet prescribed some good doggie drugs to relax his muscles and kill the pain, and I hear he is recovering nicely.  I was so relieved to hear that.   After all, Charlie is my Grand-Puppy!When I first started blogging, it was with the idea of sharing the digital scrapbook pages I make and sharing stories of days gone by, of family and of the events in our lives. And for a time, that worked out pretty well. But things have changed, as they often do. I find that with my work schedule added to the fact that I now live alone and do all of the daily chores myself, there just isn't time to put into digital scrapbooking. It has become a chore rather than a joy. Oh, I still enjoy sitting at my computer and putting together the scrapbook pages, but I have other things that I like to do in my spare time as well. I have a quilt that has sat in a box in pieces for months and I want to finish it for my bedroom. I bought some yarn a while back to see if I remembered how to crochet an afghan for my living room. I have a whopping six granny squares done, and they, too, reside in a box in the closet. So it is time to move on and do some things other than digital scrapbook.This blog will contain the stories as did the old one, as some of my family members have expressed a desire to read what I write, and it will also contain pictures - just not in scrapbook form. With any kind of luck, this will enable me to keep up with what is going on in our lives and also share some of the stories of the past. It is the scrapbook pages that take so much of my time. Perhaps now, all of those fabric pieces will actually become a quilt!The first weekend in August, some of my family met for a get-together up north. I had a grand time. I was able to spend time with some of my grown children and their children. There was time to get to know my grandkids a little better. I found that Maddie Mae will talk a blue streak when she has overcome her shyness. Early one morning, I learned from her all I ever want to know about \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\" Seems that is one of her favorite movies, and I got a running play-by-play about what was happening on the screen. Delightful.One evening, we had a bonfire, toasted marshmallows and made Smores. Boston burns the heck out of marshmallows, which is just the way I like them. Zach takes his time and makes them toasty brown on the outside, which is also just the way I like them. They did a good job of keeping Grandma supplied with toasted marshmallows.Boston gathered a whole sack full of pine cones for me. I brought them home, baked them in a low-heat oven for an hour to kill any creepy crawlers that might be in them, and they now reside in a basket in my living room, a nice reminder of a lovely weekend and of the granddaughter who gathered them for me.Jacob makes me tired. He is so busy and everything is done at a dead run. I just love sitting back and watching to see what he will do next. He can go from a world class tantrum to smiling and happy with astounding speed. He is a joy.I love being with Zach. He will, out of the blue, come up to me and give me a hug. Hugs are good, especially when given by grandsons. He told me about the fish he caught and threw back to give them a chance to grow up. He has a sense of humor second to none, and I really like hearing what he will come up with next.It was so fun to have Nicki along on this trip. Her sense of humor tickles my funny bone. She traveled in the back seat of the van, and remarked that we didn't need to worry about her as she was just part of the luggage back there. She is so good with the younger kids and did a great job of keeping them entertained. Seems like just yesterday she was a little kid herself, but she has grown into nearly a young lady, and even though I love her, I like her as well.On Saturday Kelly and some of his family came to spend the day with us. I always love it when I can see my brother. We have a bond that has weathered time, and even though we don't see each other very often, the times that we do are very special for me. We talk of times past, of our parents and our families. It is good to do that from time to time. We had a potluck lunch with more food than could be eaten at a couple of meals. Kelly reminded me of a time when Dad lived in an apartment complex where the residents got together for a potluck meal every so often. Now, Dad was not known as a spendthrift. I believe the word \"cheap\" would apply. At any rate, his idea of a contribution to the dinners, where others brought casseroles, cakes, pies, salads and other goodies, was a jar of olives. And if the jar remained unopened, he took it home and brought it the next time. This has resulted in a standing family joke about who will bring the olives.Jackie was there with Kelly, and I was so glad to see her. She is such a sweet lady, more of a sister than a sister-in-law. She is fun to be with and I so enjoy her company. Her daughter, Ashley, came later in the afternoon because Jackie said she wanted to meet all of us. That took some effort on her part, as she is due to have her baby any minute now. She reminded me of her mother, and I like her very much.I was also happy to meet Dustin and his daughter, Desiree (am not sure of the spelling), who is nearly two years old. How fortunate I am to have another nephew and grand-niece. Dustin reminds me of his dad - not so much in looks, but in his way of talking and his sense of humor. He races at the Bemidji Speedway, and I asked him about that. Apparently he is not having the best racing season this year, because his answer was, \"You had to ask about that, didn't you!\" But then he showed me some pictures of his car, which is really cool. When he got ready to leave, he gave me a hug, and that made me feel like I really did have another member of my family. I hope I can spend more time with them again soon.Desiree is a little doll-baby. She is just so cute, and once she got over being shy around so many new people, she and Jacob had a good old time, running and playing together. When they started dancing, we found that Desiree can \"shake her booty\" with the best of them. She adores her grandma, and it was fun to watch them together.Emily was there as well, and she is the reason for this reunion of sorts. Some of us have been chatting with her on Facebook, and when she told me that she was coming home from Hawaii for a time while her husband was off for the military, and to have her baby here in Minnesota, I knew that we just had to get together. It had been way too long since I had seen her. Thanks to my kids who organized this outing, I was able to see her and hug her and spend some time with her. It is fun to chat online, but nothing compares to seeing her in person. I am so excited for her having this baby, and the ultrasound pictures she brought with show that it is a boy. I am so happy for her and her husband. I am planning a trip north in November after my grand-nephew is born. I mean, after all, how many times is one lucky enough to have grand-nieces and nephews! As I am an early riser, I had some alone time as well. I was able to take my morning coffee outside and sit and look at the lake, the towering pines and listen to the loons call. Now that is my idea of heaven. Jill took this photo that reminds me of the quiet and beauty of the lake. I often wish aloud that I could live again in the north country, for that has always seemed like home to me. I am not a city girl, but a country girl at heart. But I know that this is just not practical, and I am getting to the age where practical will probably win over wanting to live among the pines again. But, oh, how lovely it was to be there again with my family. Life is good."}
