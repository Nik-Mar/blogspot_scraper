{"title": "Virtual Math Class: Main Lesson", "date": "Thursday, October 1, 2020", "text": "TweetThanks for the excellent feedback on part 1 of this series which was all about virtual math class warm up!  I love reading all your messages on Instagram and Facebook about how you are using these ideas! Even when you are teaching remotely, it is important to include a warm up to reinforce important concepts, build community and work on positive mathematical mindset.  Today we are going to talk more about main lesson.  During \"distance learning\" or when you have to teach virtually in a fully remote or hybrid model, main lesson serves the same purpose it does when you teach in person.  Main lesson is the time for kids to dig into new to them content and practice new ideas.  It is a time for teachers to help connect the dots on students' strategies and help them build their new understanding on top of their old understanding by helping them connect what they know to what they are learning.  Here are some things to keep in mind when you are teaching new content in a virtual math class.Keep it Short!You are going to have less instructional time this year, there is no way around it.  That means you can't do everything in your math program!  You have to know what topics give you the most bang for your buck.  -Our math program (Bridges) put out a pretty complete set of program recommendations about what to skip if time is an issue and what is most important.  I have heard of several other math programs that have done something similar.  It is a good place to start to check out your math program.-Your district or school might also have made some recommendations about what topics are most important from a curriculum standpoint.  If this has happened it is a great place to start.  If it hasn't happened, it is a great thing to do with a group of colleagues because when doing work like this two heads are always better than one!-If you need more guidance getting started with this check out the content focus documents from Achieve the Core or the high leverage concepts from All Learner's Network. Choose Problems WiselyYou have narrowed down your curriculum to the big ideas for your grade level.  Now it is time to teach new concepts.... ready to lecture over Zoom?  No!  There is a better way.-Start with a problem in context.  Providing a problem in the context of a story gives kids an opportunity to use what they already know to solve a new problem.  Start with a problem and see what THEY can do.  Provide or suggest a virtual manipulative if you think it might support their understanding.-Have kids share their solutions and strategies.-Your job is to connect kids' strategies to each other and to help them figure out which strategy is most efficient.  -By letting kids share strategies you support their fluency and flexibility and help them understand how what they are learning today connects to what they  have learned before.Guided PracticeYou have posed a problem or 2, allowed kids to solve, discuss and connect.  Now it is time to assign some practice.  - Continue to be selective!  Kids do not need 20 practice problems!- Try a gradual release.  Give one more problem, have kids show you or submit their answer to you and then leave the call once you have seen it/reviewed it.  Provide support to those who need it who are still on the call.- Need to do one more with support?  If kids are still on the call stick around for one more problem if they need it.Have a plan for Small GroupsOne small group just happened!  By providing kids with a gradual release from Zoom, you already have had one opportunity to work with a small group.  Now it is time to think about what other opportunities fit into your digital life for meeting with small groups.  Office hours?  Scheduled calls with small groups?  Use Tech WiselyDoing a main lesson virtual math lesson like this and covering new content online means you have to have a commanding understanding of different technology.  Many teachers have been learning new technology at lightning speed and many of you now possess the skills to do all these things in your virtual classes.  If you don't know how to do some of these things, I find the easiest way to learn is often to Google it.  I usually can find articles and videos and learn a new tech trick in just a few minutes by just searching for what I want to learn how to do.  More Help!Stop spending your evenings and weekends scouring Pinterest for ready-to-go math activities!

{"title": "Five Fabulous and Free Warm  Up Activities for Virtual Math Lessons K-6", "date": "Tuesday, September 29, 2020", "text": "TweetI have written in the past about how we structure math class and today I want to share with you the first in a series of posts about how we structure virtual math classes.  Over the past 6 months, we have played around with the structure of our virtual lessons and have landed on a digital version of what we do in class.  First thing is first and that is the warm-up!Why a Warm UpI like doing a warm up in a virtual math lesson for some of the same reasons I like doing them in person.  It is a great way to get everyone excited about learning math, it gives us a chance to review important concepts, and it is a perfect opportunity to talk about mathematical mindset.  It can be a chance to do a whole group number talk, engage kids in a low floor high ceiling task or introduce a game that will be part of our math menu or choice board later.  It is also a great way to honor virtual learners who arrive for class on time by having something ready for them to get started on. How Long?Virtual math classes seem to vary in time more than traditional ones.  In general they tend to be shorter so I try to keep the warm up portion to 10 minutes or less.Best Warm Up Activities? Here are the activities I have been able to do live over Zoom or Google Hangouts that my kids have loved the most.  Esti-MysteriesThis has been the overall favorite of my students during distance learning.  You download the powerpoint presentation and hit present.  The slides include a visual model and clues to help them narrow down their estimation.  They practice important skills related to estimation as well as other grade level appropriate vocabulary as the clues help them narrow down their estimation.  They also fit nicely into a 10 minute or less time span and get kids excited to show up on time. Which One Doesn't BelongThe premise is simple but the results are amazing.  Four images put together and you think about which one doesn't belong.  The best part of this type of activity is that there is really not a wrong answer and there are many right answers.  It is also good practice at looking at things from different perspectives.  By the time we are done with one of these my students have usually found reasons why each number, shape or picture in the set does not belong. 3 Act Math My students had actually already done most of these when we switched to distance learning.  They continued to be super popular to do from home, but you need to be pretty good at using the share screen feature to make it successful which by now many teachers are.  These start by seeing a picture or video clip and asking kids what they notice followed by an estimation and thinking about what other information would be useful.  Additional information is provided in act 2 which leads to a narrowed down estimate or an exact calculation.  Act 3 reveals the answer by showing the rest of the video clip or picture.  Number TalksStarting a virtual math lesson with a whole group number talk is a great way to build flexibility and fluency with calculation.  It is a great time to review important concepts and help kids work on how to listen and share.  The pair-share part of number talks kind of gets lost online so I keep our number talks even shorter than usual, typically no more than 3 problems.  That seems to be enough for kids to try out other classmates' strategies without taking more than 10 minutes.  If you have a problem string that is longer than that, it will usually work over 2 days better than trying to get it all in at once.Mindset VideosOfficial research and my own classroom research has shown me how important math mindset is and when you are in a virtual world I would argue that it is even more important than ever.  These videos are short, sweet a bit corney and pretty engaging for kids.  A quick video and a group chat about it followed by the teacher pointing out when she sees kids demonstrating the desirable mindset qualities found in the video during the main lesson that day is a great way to reinforce the importance of a positive mindset and help kids believe they can learn anything. Stay tuned for 3 more posts in this series about structuring virtual math classes for distance learning! Next up is main lesson followed by math menu or math choice boards then one final post that summarizes the structure of an online math class! Something to help with virtual teaching! “I don’t have time to plan and prep all the math lessons to differentiate for every student.” <--Raise your hand if you’ve thought that a time or two! We’ve been there. And we’ve got something that will help make this not only possible, but easy and affordable. Learn more here!"},
{"title": "The ABC's of Hybrid Teaching", "date": "Sunday, September 27, 2020", "text": "TweetWe are three weeks into a hybrid teaching model and oh my goodness I am exhausted.   You might have noticed I have been MIA from the blog since I went back to work but today I was just processing all the things and this blog post is the result of that.  I still have a lot to share about differentiating instruction, math menus, meeting kids where they are and teaching online but right now I am in survival mode!  Without further ado, here are the ABC's of hybrid teaching! Acne: wearing a mask all day led me to having the skin of a middle schooler. I now have a skin care routine like a proper middle aged lady.(thanks Grove for delivering Burt's bees to my door!)Breath mints: mask wearing leads to being hyper aware of your own breath smells. Everyone now keeps mints in their desks/backpacksConfusing: Our kids come in 2 cohorts and keeping track of what I have done or said with each group is still a challenge I am working on conquering. Dry: Extra hand washing and sanitizing leads to sandpaper hands for kids and teachers!  Rooms without a sink are especially prone.Extraordinary: in a short amount of time my colleagues have relearned everything they thought they knew about teaching and a providing quality instruction in new and interesting ways. Frustrating: just when we think we have it figured out, the guidance changes, the structure changes or our own children's school changes plans leading us to scramble for childcare. Gawky: like an awkward middle school student my new roles and responsibilities feel a bit unnatural.Hot: wearing a mask/face shield/goggles all day then the weather feels like summer is no joke.Illogical: there are some regulations and requirements that make no sense. Neighboring school districts have different plans that lead to childcare nightmares for teacher parents.Jaded: the rapid pace that things change and time wasted planning things that never come to fruition has added 10 years of jadedness in 6 short weeks.  I'm afraid of becoming the \"I used to walk uphill to school both ways\" person!Kaput: how I feel by 2 pm every single day.Lonely: it's great to be back seeing some faces but I miss seeing all the faces and all the hugs and community building activities we used to be able to partake in.  Kids who are not in the same cohort never get to hang out together and I get limited contact with other teachers. Masks: we have to wear a mask in the building at all times unless we are alone in a room. We are never alone in a room. Nauseating: we are cleaning more frequently with stronger smelling chemicals while breathing in our exhaled air it's a combination that leaves me feeling nauseous at least a few hours each day. Obliging; teachers, kids and families have worked together to create the best of the situation we are in. Passwords: I spend an embarrassing amount of time resetting passwords and emailing parents and students with their passwords.  Passwords might be my least favorite word in the English language right now. Quiet: less kids, more spread out and no one really in the hallways along with a ban on singing indoors has led to an almost unnatural quiet in the building. Rewarding: when all is said and done setting those smiling faces eyes folks my heart with joy.Stumps: we have taken teaching outside on stump circles that our amazing PTA volunteers delivered to school. Tenacious: teachers and kids have really demonstrated this quality during this challenging time.Unique: we are living history right now and we have to remember that this isn't forever.Valiant: I have always said teachers can do anything and the obstacles my colleagues have conquered this year demonstrate this very well. WildX-hausting: I'm kind of glad my car ride is a little longer this year.  I am so mentally and physically exhausted at the end of each day I rely on the drive home for partial recovery. Year-long: We might not be in hybrid forever, we might be fully remote, in person or in a different version of hybrid but we know for sure that this school year is going to be anything but normal! Zoom: We spend Wednesday mornings on Zoom with kids while no students are in the building.  We spend Wednesday afternoons on Zoom with other people in our building.  Our students who are not at school send us Google Hangout messages or try to do video calls while we are in school with their classmates.  It's a wild world and Zoom is part of our lives for now. For all my fellow teachers who are living this nightmare reality right now, I'm with you.  I see you, I know how hard you are working, I know we will make it to the other side.  I know someday we can tell new teachers our stories and I know we will come out in the end better than ever."},
{"title": "Ten Games to Play with 10 Frame Playing Cards FREE Printable Booklet for Families", "date": "Friday, July 24, 2020", "text": "TweetIf you have ever read my blog before, you probably already know how much I love 10 frames!  One of my favorite tools are 10 frame playing cards.  I have created 10 frame playing card sets with penguins, pumpkins, santas, hearts, school buses and plants. When kids are ready, I level them up and use double 10 frames as well.  Why do I have so many different 10 frame playing cards?  The reason is that there are so many different ways to use them and they are a great tool to help kids develop numeracy and additive reasoning.  The other reason is that changing the pictures on the cards can make a game feel brand new and seasonally fun yet doesn't require a bunch of re-teaching on how to play the game.  The third reason is that most of these games can easily be leveled up and down making it so kids can play multiple times over multiple years and still get good practice from the games.My own kids and my students love 10 frame cards because they love card games.  I have long been a fan of using these at school and at home with my own kids but this spring when folks had to do more school work at home, I wanted families to be able to play these games together.  My students had already played most of these games at school and I knew I could easily make more 10 frame playing card decks to send home with each family and I had teacher directions written for these games, I did not have an easy and parent friendly set of directions.  To solve this problem, I created this little printable book that includes 10 different games kids and families can play with 10 frame cards.  When you print double sided, it only takes 3 pieces of paper to make each booklet.  All games include a picture and parent friendly directions.  This booklet features the cards from my penguin 10 frame set but would work with any set of 10 frame playing cards.  If you would like to grab this to use with your own children or to send home with families this year, I am offering the booklet as a freebie in my TPT store.  If you need 10 frame playing cards to go with it you can choose from the penguin ones featured in the book, pumpkins, santas, hearts, school buses or plants.Looking for more to help you out with teaching during these crazy times?  For a super limited time, I have partnered with a bunch of amazing math teachers to offer a spring themed bundle of resources.  A great way to save time and money and grab what you need to finish out the school year strong!

{"title": "Math TV Shows for Kids", "date": "Thursday, July 23, 2020", "text": "TweetIn my area, we have about 4 weeks before teachers are back at school and about 5 weeks before kids go back.  Things are very much still up in the air about what we will be doing for in person/online instruction.  It looks likely that we will be doing a hybrid model of in person and online learning.  I am certain kids will have more time at home than usual and teachers will have more on their plate than ever. I know that this often means more screen time for kids especially kids whose parents are at work or working from home.  I know parents are doing their best, but sometimes they need an hour to do a work call uninterrupted or have 5 minutes peace! Today I want to share with you our favorite math TV shows for when you just need the kids engaged in learning independently.  These are also great shows to recommend to parents of your students for when they have just had enough! Number BlocksThis show recently popped up on my kids' recommended list on Netflix.  Since then, I have seen parents and teachers posting about it on Facebook several times!  In the name of blog research, my kids and I spent an hour on a rainy afternoon checking out a few episodes.  It is definitely a show that is to young for my kids but they were still engaged enough to watch several episodes.  It is a great option for kids 2-5.  It does a particularly good job introducing the idea of decomposing numbers.  They have quite a few episodes available on Netflix and they also have a very active Youtube channel.  Here is one of the videos from their Youtube channel that shows kids how to build the number blocks with playdoh.  Peg + CatThis was a favorite of my kids' when they were in preschool and kindergarten.  It used to be on Netflix but doesn't seem to be currently.  Luckily there are full episodes available on Youtube and on PBS kids.  This one is great for pre-k up through grade 1!  CyberchaseThis one is the best choice for bigger kids!  There are lots of episodes, it was a show on years ago that then was canceled and then started up again!  It tackles all kinds of math topics and is super engaging for kids.  Great for grades 1-4! This is another one from PBS kids that is also available on Youtube. This one definitely saved my sanity during quarantine this spring!  My 3 kids could all watch it together and all get something out of it.  Monster Math SquadThis one is another one that is new to my family.  It is available on Netflix and Youtube and is another show aimed at preschool and early elementary.  Despite being to old for the target audience, my kids agreed to watch an episode for the purposes of this article.  My older 2 pronounced it as terrible and only stuck around for one 12 minute episode.  My youngest who just finished Kindergarten said it was okay but wanted to watch more so I think she enjoyed it but likes to be just like her big brothers.  If  you have kids at several ages I would start with Number Blocks instead of Monster Math Squad. Leap Frog Number LandThis one was around when my kids were smaller but they were such big fans of Peg + Cat they never really got into this one.  It works on early number concepts like counting and writing numbers to 10.  Another option for the preschool to Kindergarten crowd.  Available on Netflix with some clips available on Youtube.  Team UmizoomiThis one rounds out the crowd of math shows aimed at the preschool crowd!  It is from Nick Jr and is available on Amazon prime video.  It is a good option for those who already have Prime Video and preschool aged kids!Odd SquadAnother great show for the bigger kids!  This one has a detective spin and explores elementary math concepts.  Also available on PBS kids and Youtube! We discovered it recently and it has been my kids' got to show in recent weeks! An excellent option for elementary age kids!What would you add to the list?  Feel free to leave your favorite in the comments below or head over to our Facebook page and leave your thoughts there!Want to work on differentiating instruction this year?  Join our FREE Facebook group here for discussions about all things differentiated!"},

{"title": "BIG Changes! ", "date": "Thursday, July 16, 2020", "text": "TweetSo I know we are in the middle of a pandemic and we have all made some big changes in recent months like helping our students learn from home and homeschooling our own children but I am in the middle of another huge change. My beloved elementary school that I have spent the last 14 years of my career in closed at the end of this past school year.  It was something that was planned last fall due to declining enrollment and consolidation but it was a tough pill to swallow then when schools shut down in March, none of us knew that our last day was our last day.I spent a week at the end of June cleaning out my classroom, going through lots of memories and possessions that have accumulated over the past 14 years.  When I started at this school, I had a small room with one table, a second grader sized desk with my computer on it, a filing cabinet full of other people's old files and a huge bookshelf filled with leveled readers.  Because of declining enrollment and the wonders of time, I have a HUGE classroom filled with all kinds of things, some of which I use every day and many that I do not.  Add to that my impressive collection of math literature and some of the professional development books I have read (I confess to also having a coffee table at home full of these!) I had a lot of things to go through.  I will be following almost all the students and some staff members up the road a few miles to a larger school where I will be working with more teachers and many more students.  Because this school is getting a large influx of kids all at once, they are creating several more classrooms which means my space will be a tiny room (it's not a closet because it has a window into the hallway!) that I will be sharing with a literacy specialist.  This meant I had to a DRAMATIC downsizing of my possessions.  I really pared things down to the things I use every day, the math literature books I look forward to reading to kids the most, the professional development books that I am always lending to other teachers and the math manipulatives, games and cards that give me the most bang for my buck.Starting sometime this week, I will be going into the new school to get things set up and will be sharing with you some of my favorite things (aka the things I kept!).  If you have a small budget, are just getting started or are looking to downsize, these posts will be must reads for you!I also have been working on lots of posts and a free ebook on math boxes.  I haven't shared much here on the blog about math boxes because there is so much to say and I have never been able to put a post together that says all the things but they are something we have been using every day over the past 5 years and they really saved us during the switch to online learning.  They are also a personal possession of kids and are used by one student so they are something that will work well for this crazy school year we have coming at us.  I have so much to say and share that I am working on a free ebook called Getting Started with Math Boxes.  I REALLY want this ready to share with teachers and parents during the back to school season but you know real life gets in the way sometimes. I am working on it in the in between hours when my kids are occupied or sleeping but after 4+ months home together 24/7 I get less time to work on my projects than I would like!  I also just announced that my first book, the Complete Multiplication Workbook is ready for pre-sale and anyone who orders it before August 3rd will get a free copy of my very popular Multiplication Fact Deck and Activity Set.  You can check out all the details in this post! It has been 14 years since I have changed schools and I am doing it during a pandemic.  Nothing like lots of change at once!  I know there are not really pandemic experts out there yet but I bet some of you have a lot of advice for teachings changing schools.  I would love it if you could share some of that advice in the comment section below!"},

I recently spent some time making updates to these posts and noticed that I don't have one dedicated to subitizing.  Since there are some fabulous subitizing videos on You Tube now, I thought I would share with you a few of my favorites!What is Subitizing? Subitizing is the ability to instantly recognize quantities.  It is an important early math skill and a must master for kids in K and grade 1.  The ability to subitize can further be broken into perceptual subitizing which is the ability to instantly recognize small quantities and conceptual subitizing which is when you decompose the image into smaller parts and add what you see together in your head. We love using videos as a great way to practice this skill along with number talks, a few apps and our Movin' it math cards.Start Out With Subitizing Quantities to 5If your kiddos are new to subitizing, start with one of these!  Many of these can be done with perceptual subitizing which just a touch of conceptual subitizing required.  Work on subitizing to 5 first and move up when kids are ready!Some have answers included (after a few seconds for students to answer first) and others are open answer (it never confirms the right answer).  We usually start with the original version and try the open answer as students are ready.  Subitize to 10!Lots to choose from here!  A note on pronunciation:  There seems to be 2 different ways folks pronounce subitize.  I say it [soob-itizing] but some folks say it a little different! Do you have a favorite subitizing song?Are you a parent of a kiddo in grades 3-5?You might want to check out this recent announcement from my Facebook page!After a lot of hard work behind the scenes for the past several months, I'm so excited to finally announce that I have my first published print book coming out in just a few weeks, the Complete Multiplication Workbook.  Multiplication is a must-know skill and builds the foundation for future math success.  The Complete Multiplication Workbooks is the one-stop guide for making sure kids have a strong foundation in multiplication.  I would love you to support my first print workbook!  You can pre-order your copy here!More sneak peaks inside coming in the next few weeks!"},

{"title": "1, 2, 3, Animals!", "date": "Friday, May 15, 2020", "text": "TweetEverytime I take one of my kids for a well child visit with their pediatrician I get asked about reading with my kids at home.  Even since they were small babies this question has been asked.  I love this question because it reminds parents to read to their kids but I wish they asked another important question as well......What are you doing to work on your baby/toddlers early math development?How often do you practice counting objects with your child?Are you working on subitizing with your child?  Do you know what subitizing is?I might have given the pediatrician a lecture or two about the importance of asking math type of questions during a well child visit a time or two but I am not sure it did much good!I think all parents know they SHOULD be reading to their kids but I am not sure enough parents know about early math opportunities for their babies and toddlers.  There are many counting books out there that they might be reading but they tend to focus on just one skill which is rote counting.  Rote counting is important don't get me wrong but it is probably the least exciting of the early math skills!I have been on the hunt for the PERFECT counting book to give to folks at baby showers because books are one of my favorite baby shower gifts.  Recently a math blogger friend, Bethany Lake wrote a counting book that sets itself apart from other counting books.Looks kind of like other counting books on the cover with its cute graphics and easy to read font but when you look inside you see something different.This is a counting book with layers.  There is the story and the counting (both forward and backward to 10) but then there is more.  Bethany starts the book with a full page letter to parents.  In that letter she outlines some important early math skills in easy to read parent friendly language.  It gives parents ideas about what they can do while reading the book (and after!) to increase their kids interest, engagement and how they interact with the math in the text and pictures. The story itself is super cute (written in rhymes which I always love!), and provides the opportunity to count forward and backward within 10.  Many early counting books miss the opportunity to practice backward counting but I think it should be there from day 1!The book ends with other visual models kids can use for subitizing.  Showing parents all these in one book is brilliant!  They will see them there and by seeing them over and over again in this book, they will start seeing them and pointing them out to their child in everyday life as well. 1, 2, 3, Animals! is a great counting book for toddlers and would make an excellent baby shower gift!"},
{"title": "Teaching and Homeschooling: Our Current Schedule ", "date": "Wednesday, March 18, 2020", "text": "TweetI hope everyone is staying healthy and taking care of themselves during these uncertain times.  My school made the decision to close yesterday.  My own children are also out of school for now.  My husband has to continue to work. The expectations for teachers for this week is that we will be in our buildings Thursday and Friday preparing materials for the buses to deliver to students on Monday.  After that, our buildings will be only open to a select group of staff for the following week.  We are providing kids with 2 weeks of review materials, both paper/pencil and some online options.  We are sending devices home with kids in grades 3-6.  Not all of our students have internet.  We have sent/will be sending home some of the things I discusses in last week's post.  I also sent a reminder to parents about our school wide math blog which is a great way to curate online resources for your students. I will dive more into how we are supporting our students online and with hard goods later this week.  Today I want to share with you our current work from home/homeschooling schedule.  This is going to be what we try to follow on days that I am working from home.  When I have to go into school, this schedule will have to look a little different.Morning Block 6:30-8:30ish-Morning snuggles, breakfast, get dressed, brush teeth, feed pets, morning chores and free play.Community Meeting 8:45-9-We are using our dining room table as out all together work area.  We listen to the weather, make a schedule for the day and talk about what activities each person really wants to do that day.Seat Work 9-10ish-Each kid (I have 3) has a personal work space set up in a different room in the house.  I start with the oldest and go over work for the day and then meet with each kid at the dining room table to help them get started and make sure they know the expectations.  Then I walk around checking in with each kid as needed.  I use the time after I meet with each kid while they are working independently to answer emails and do whatever needs to be done for \"work\" at that point. At this point they are working on a combination of things their teachers have posted, some math worksheets, writing letters to grandparents, independent reading and working on a few independent math games/activities with dice, cards and number puzzles.Recess 10-10:45ish-We have a lot of outdoor space and plenty of opportunities for recess.  I get myself outside with the kids and we all do whatever we want.  We live in the woods and have a pond and a swing set so there is plenty of free play opportunities.  I have been using the time to push kids on swings and rake up the millions of leaves and sticks that are currently covering the lawn.Device Learning 10:45-11:30-My kids are using a variety of websites that they already use at school combined with a few websites that we use at my school that my kids are already familiar with.  At this time we have not introduced any new learning sites but there are many offering free services at this time.Lunch 11:30-12-Time to eat!Family Hike 12-1-We live in the woods on a dirt road and next to a large farm so out outdoor walking opportunities are just about endless.  We are counteracting some of the additional screen time with some intentional family exercise.  We own excellent outdoor clothing for all weather so we plan on a family hike in all weather although it might be shorter when weather is not great. Read Aloud 1-1:15My school is doing One school, one book and all families are reading the same book.  We hit the couch and read one section around this time.Quiet Time 1:15-2:15My kids are beyond napping but this is a vital part of our day.  Kids go to separate rooms and play or read independently.  Mom can work, relax or do anything that has to get done.Flexible Time 2:15-5We will use this time to be outside again when the weather is perfect, work on larger projects like organizing the basement or do more learning things like virtual field trips or kitchen science experiments.Family time and Dinner 5-6My husband is home and can spend time with the kids.  Mom gets a break if she needs it.  Dinner prep and cooking lessons, hanging out time.Screen Time 6-7:30Watch a movie as a family, play video games, make whatever screen choices kids and parents would like.Get ready for Bed 7:30-8We are only getting  started on this trying to work and homeschool and go nowhere journey.  We shall see how our schedule changes and adapts moving forward."},
{"title": "Helping Kids Learn From Home", "date": "Friday, March 13, 2020", "text": "TweetAs I write this, a small percentage of K-12 school across the US have already made the decision to close schools for several weeks.  In the days to come, I am sure a great many more will also reach such a decision.Many online learning companies are now offering their services for free to schools that are facing these situations which I think is great but not all of our students will have the same level of access to these things.  I also do not know how much elementary schools will expect from kids and teachers in terms of at home learning.  I do know I want to create a culture of learning and provide opportunities for my students to continue learning while they are away from school even if this time isn't going to \"count\" toward school days for teachers or students.  I also know that if I am in a situation where I have to stay home with my own children for an extended period of time, we are going to need some school like stuff in our days to keep us all sane and happy.Here are a few little things that you can do now that will help give your students some offline learning opportunities if you are required to go on an extended break.Send Home BooksYour school library is full of books!  Relax guidelines on limits of books checked out and let them borrow more!Many schools have a free book shelf or area.  Make sure that kids get some time to go through these books today!  You know which kids need these the most, make sure they get the first look! Look for other books in your school that are no longer being utilized like they once were and add them to the free book shelf!  You know there are some books in that science unit box you haven't taught in 5 years and there are always books that can be culled from the multiple copy area in our school!Card GamesOver at Math Coach's Corner you can grab a printable book of games for kids in grades 3-5 to play with a deck of cards.  Most kids have cards at home and if they say they don't you might consider sending a deck home from school!  Decks of playing cards are super easy to replace, they sell them at Dollar Tree for 2/$1 and if you know anyone who plays poker they will keep you supplied for life! For younger students, ten and twenty frame games are the way to go!  Click here for a post about 10 ways to use 10 frames (also 20 frames). Feel free to print this post and send it home with a set of 10 or 20 frame playing cards. Need printable 10 frame cards?  Need printable 20 frame cards? Here is a FREE printable booklet for 10 games to play with 10 frame cards written with parent friendly directions! DiceMath Coach's Corner again hits it out of the park with a free easy to print booklet offering dice games.  These can be played with an ordinary pair of dice, which many kids probably already have at home but again you may need to send some from school.  If you have time making origami dice can be a fun way to provide dice for home use. Here is a post about using dice K-6 to promote additive reasoning.  Might be less printer friendly but offers suggestions for every grade level.  Math PracticeWe have structured our math classes to include more hands on learning and less worksheets but there is still plenty of written practice that comes with our math program.  We take a sampling of that written practice and make individualized mini math practice books for kids that we tend to use in class once a week or so or in place of main lesson when a substitute is in charge of the class.  If we get the word that we are going on an unanticipated break, these will go home in backpacks.  Do you have some unused pages from your math curriculum that you could pull out of books or copy to send home? Bridges practice books: These a free and offered at K-5 levels.  Maybe you have time to print 15 pages for each kid.  Try to find things that are at kids independent levelReading/WritingI found this great post which I think is the perfect way to handle something like this if you have time with you class before the break starts.This writing bingo looks like fun and is just a one page printable!I know you probably won't have time to do all the things but these are the quicker and easier ways I have been thinking about this week.Good luck to all my fellow teachers as we tread into this uncharted territory.I just  saw this list of 25 ways to practice math at home!"},

of the big things changes I have made over the last few years but have had very little time to write about here on  my blog is our shift from teaching math to one grade at a time to a multi-age math approach.  We went to a multi-age model due to declining enrollment and after 5 years, we have really figured out how to differentiate and personalize learning for kids in a multi-age classroom.  The big surprise is how it has changed the way we approach our single grade classrooms as well.  The things we have learned from multi-aging have helped us differentiate and personalize learning for all learners.  Differentiation and personalizing math class are the things that I can talk about all day right now.  In the next few months, I will be working to share some of the things we have learned while multi-aging that will help differentiate and personalize in all math classes.Today's topic is the structure we use for math classes.  We currently have a 3-4 multi-age and a 5-6 multi-age that follow this structureWarm-Up We start math class with a whole group warm up.  This almost always includes all learners and is a great way to fit in cumulative review and lessons on mindset.  It is also the perfect opportunity to engage kids in low floor high ceiling tasks, do a whole group number talk or introduce a game that will be part of our math menu later.  Some of our favorite resources includeEstimation 180Which One Doesn't Belong3 Act Math TasksOpen Middle ProblemsNumber TalksNumber Talk ImagesMindset VideosMain LessonOur main lesson time is the problems and investigations times.  It is when we do a mini lesson or problem launch followed by kids working on that problem.  This is where we implement what we know about math workshop.  Sometimes this is done as a one whole group and other times we split into 2 groups for this portion.  We use a co-teaching model in math several days a week so there often is 2 adults who can do 2 different main lessons if needed.  If only one adult is available, they can do main lesson with one group and send the other kids out to math menu and then switch.  How do we know when we can do one whole group lesson and when we need to offer 2 or more different main lesson options?  It all comes down to what we are working on.  Near the beginning of a unit, we often do one main lesson.  As our formative assessment adds to our knowledge about what kids know and are able to do we sometimes get to a point where we need to offer more than one main lesson. Ready for an example?  Right now our 5/6 class is jumping into an algebra unit.  We have kept these kids together for main lesson a lot this year partly because we have gotten better at differentiating our main lesson and partly because our fifth graders have had several years with a more differentiated math class which has allowed them to access more challenging problems from an earlier age and has put them in a place where they are happy to take on challenging problems.  For the past week and for the next several weeks, they will have main lesson together.  When our formative assessment shows us that some kids really have it and others start to struggle, then we may break into 2 groups for main lesson.Another example: Our 3/4 class is in the midst of working on fractions.  We are about halfway into our fraction unit and have decided to break into 2 groups for main lesson for the rest of the unit.  We do not put the third graders in one group and the fourth graders in another group, rather we put kids in whatever group they happen to be ready to be in based on formative assessment.  We currently have a smaller group of mostly third graders working on part whole and equivalence and magnitude.  They are working on placing fractions on number lines and comparing them and noticing things about equivalence and magnitude using models.  They are working on the traditional third grade standards.  Our second group has these fraction skills down and is working on the next level of fraction stuff.  They are noticing things about adding and subtracting fractions.  They are using models to find sums and differences.  They are connecting fractions and decimals.  These kids are working toward traditional fourth grade standards.  This group has a lot of fourth graders in it but it also has some third graders. Math MenuWhat started out as math stations or math games 10 years ago morphed into a guided math type set-up about 6 years ago and has now landed on a math menu style intentional practice period.  We end almost every math class with about 20-30 minutes of math menu.  Kids transition to math menu when they finish their main lesson.  For us, math menu is a selection of games, problems and activities that are offered at multiple levels that kids can play with a partner or independently.  We offer students choice and voice during this time.  They do not have to do every activity or problem we present but get to choose from a selection and within each selection, there are often multiple levels.  I have a lot more to share about math menu in the coming weeks and months so stay tuned.What questions do you have about how we structure our multi-age math classes?  Please respond in the comments below or head over to our Facebook group and join our community as we explore ways to differentiate math class!"},
{"title": "Giant Yohaku! ", "date": "Friday, February 7, 2020", "text": "TweetA few years ago, I discovered Yohaku puzzles which are an excellent way to engage all learners in your classroom.  They might be the ultimate low floor, high ceiling math task.  We have used these puzzles in grades 1-6 and revisit them frequently.  They make an excellent addition to math menu and can be accessed by all learners.  They are an easy way to start differentiating your math practice.  Kids love solving Yohaku puzzles and creating their own.  You can access a bunch for free here or check out the collection of books on Amazon. My students had the grand idea to create a GIANT YOHAKU board in our front hallway.  We used paper from our rack of large paper rolls.  They are about one square yard each.  We wanted to laminate them so that we could use dry erase markers on them so we made them as large as our laminator is wide.  After creating a set of Yohaku puzzles that each have multiple correct answers, we made sure we had puzzles that ranged from easy to quite challenging.  We put them up in order from easiest to most difficult and pinned small squares of microfiber cloth and a string with a dry erase marker.  We put up a few signs to invite folks to solve these puzzles.What happened next was truly amazing.  Despite most kids being exposed to these puzzles within math class over the weeks leading up to this project, these giant puzzles made Yohaku a school community project.  Suddenly, kids from different grades were comparing puzzles and parents got involved since the front hall way is where parents wait to pick up kids.  Even some community members who are not usually part of our school got involved during town wide events.  These puzzles got solved over and over again in many different ways.  Folks were free to erase and start again at any time and the students who helped me with this project and myself would erase them all a few times a week so we could start from scratch.  I wish I had taken a picture of all the different ways these got solved because that itself would have made a great follow up to this!This week I also started a brand new Facebook group for teachers who want to  start working on ways to differentiate and personalizelearning.  It is a place where I will be sharing extra tips and motivation and also a great place to ask questions and learn from other teachers who are walking down the same path.  It is free to join and a great choice for any K-6 teacher who wants to do more to meet the needs of all his or her learners.  We are just getting started so it might move slowly for a week or two but as more teachers join and contribute their ideas it is sure to become a rich mathematical community! We got a lot of our Valentine's Day favorites out this week and had a great time trying out some new Valentine and winter freebies that are part of our new grades 3-5 math freebie bundle!  Have you ever tried a Yohaku puzzle?  What is your favorite low floor, high ceiling math task?  Please respond in the comments below!"},
{"title": "Reflections on Our First Global School Play Day", "date": "Thursday, February 6, 2020", "text": "TweetToday is our first snow day of 2020 and I have to say, it is nice to have an extra day off!  Yesterday was a busy day at my school, we participated in Global School Play Day in the morning and then our students went home and we had professional development in the afternoon.  I have been leading a group of teachers working on differentiating math class, trying out math menu and focusing on the big ideas in math class.  It takes a lot more energy to lead inservice training than it does to just sit and listen so today I am taking a much needed day to slow down, snuggle my babies and reflect on our first Global School Play Day.First, there were certainly mixed feelings for staff about spending a day \"just playing\"  but since it was already an early release day for our students and we all know we get way less done when our schedule is interrupted, staff had a generally positive attitude about the whole thing.  The other thing that happened was that many of our classroom teachers were participating in a full day of district led professional development and that meant a LOT of substitutes in our building for the morning.  This meant some shifting about of staff so that there were familiar adults in each space. Kids were allowed to bring toys from home as long as they had no screens, batteries, plugs or weapons.  This meant a lot of lol dolls, legos and sports equipment made their way into school.  We also have various toys, STEM type building materials and a huge pile of cardboard boxes.  We had a bunch of classrooms open, the gym, the music room and the playground as choices.  We did two sessions and took a break in the middle for kids to go back to their homeroom for snack and attendance.  Kids were welcome to move about the building freely.  Areas of the building that were closed had closed doors and kids knew ahead of time which spaces would be open. Adults were asked to stay out of the way unless behavior became unsafe or if a kid asked us to play.  Some kids had a hard time settling in at first and moved from room to room looking for friends or the right space to play in.  Some spaces like the gym got to loud for some kids and they went in search of a new spot to play.  In my space, there was a lot of building going on.  Of course my classroom has a lot of different STEM challenge type toys anyways and the kids adore them.  Also many kids brought Legos into my room and dolls.  Pokemon cards were also very popular.  There was also a pile of cardboard boxes in my room and it was amazing how the play changed when kids started dragging those out. One groups of kids started building the Titanic out of cardboard and tape and within 10 minutes, so many kids were building things with cardboard that we had to get MORE boxes and eventually used every piece of cardboard in the school!  The kids playing with LOL dolls and trucks started building houses and shops.  They started incorporating other objects like digiblocks, small cups, craft sticks and more.  All of the sudden, everyone was building and making stuff to go along with whatever they were playing.  It really reinforces the idea of the book Not a Box and why giving kids time to make and create things is so important.By the end of the morning, kids were trying to figure out how they could transport their boxes and creations home and what they were going to add onto it and what else they were going to make out of cardboard. There was a spark of creativity and an excitement about play that  was contagious.  I think a lot more kids went home and played the rest of the day instead of going home to sit in front of a screen or play with electronics which is pretty common on these early release days in the middle of winter. I think our first time trying the Global Day of Play was a success and I am sure we will be doing it again next year.  If you want to join us, you can get more information here!If you teach grades 3-5, you won't want to miss out on this great bundle of 10 winter and Valentine themed goodies that I put together with some of my math blogger friends!  Head here to sign up and grab this freebie!"},

{"title": "Hailstone Series Numbers", "date": "Thursday, September 5, 2019", "text": "TweetWe are on day #5 of back to school and I wanted to share a fun lesson with you all today.  We start each year with the Week of Inspirational Math published by You Cubed.  We have been starting the year this way ever since I read Mathematical Mindsets and it has been a great way to jump into a new year and set classrooms up for success.If you have used Week of Inspirational math in the past, you might know that each year they release a new week.  The week consists of math tasks most of which are low floor high ceiling and videos about having a positive math mindset.  This year, instead of releasing a new week, they re-did the website and it now allows you to pick and choose tasks, videos and other inspirational math options.  I have been working with classroom teachers to take turns picking and choosing old favorites and trying out some new tasks.  Yesterday when I was doing a quick browse on the Week of Inspirational math page, I found a task about the Hailstone series.  This is a series of numbers that I have explored with students in the past but one that I haven't revisited in quite a number of years.  I decided to try it out in my third and fourth grade math class.  If you are not familiar with the Hailstone series, let me give you a quick summary.  You can start with any positive integer (counting number).  If the number is even, you cut it in half (n/2).  If the number is odd, you triple it and add one (3n+1). Mathematicians have found that you can start with any number and follow these steps, you will always end up with 1.  They have not found a number that this doesn't work for yet, but they also haven't proven that it works for every single number.  This means it is kind of an unsolved mathematical mystery which is an angle that my students always seem to find very intriguing.  The reason it is nicknamed the hailstone series is that the numbers go up and down similar to the way hail is formed in a thunder cloud. I started the class by asking kids what they knew about hail.  The kids were quite surprised by this question and quickly engaged with their classmates on a discussion about what they thought they knew about hail.  After sharing as a group, we watched this quick video clip about how hail is formed.  Because they had already had a chance to activate prior knowledge about hail, they were very interested. I then spent a few minutes engaging kids in a review of odd and even numbers and did a quick number talk about strategies for cutting numbers in half.  I then explained how the hailstone series worked and we tried it out for a couple of single digit numbers.  Once kids understood how it worked, I had them try a number in pairs.  We had kids coming to the board and adding their ideas to the ones that were already up there.  We came back together after a bit and kids got to share what they noticed.  They were very excited to take what they noticed and try it out on a few more numbers so we made some time for that before wrapping up class for the day.  This is the type of problem that was a great review of important math vocabulary and worked on computational fluency all in the context of exploring a larger mathematical mystery.  It was engaging and motivating for my students, I knew I wanted to repeat it later that day for grades 5 and 6. In fifth and sixth grades, we had even more fun and excitement because we had to spend less time reviewing things like halving, odd and even and were able to jump into the actual series faster.  They are also much more fluent with computation and were able to generate numbers faster.  They noticed SO MANY mathematical patterns and were making and testing conjectures left and right.  After exploring the numbers to 11 as a group and in pairs, some kids were excited to continue going in order while others wanted to jump around.  I gave them the option of either and they had so much fun playing around with math.  They worked so hard and were so engaged and excited.  At the end of class, I heard one boy say to another, \"I am going to work on this all night.  Why don't I facetime you and we can do it together!\".  Music to my ears.This type of problem isn't done after one class period so we put some of our work up on a bulletin board in the hallway where kids can keep exploring this series and adding to our work over the next few weeks during math menu time or even at home!  We listed the series of for the first 15 or so numbers on chart paper, leaving room for kids who were going in order to add to it later.  We also decided to add index cards for those numbers kids did out of sequence.  I can't wait to gather them around this board in a week or two and see what new understandings emerge!  They have some big questions they are still working on answering and for now I am quite content to leave them unanswered and to let them keep exploring!A big thank you to You Cubed for putting the Week of Inspirational Math out there and working so hard to promote positive mindsets.  Jo Boaler, the creator of You Cubed just release her newest research on mindsets, Limitless Mind!  I think this would make a great book study!  My copy is due to arrive this evening and I am sure it will inspire me to do more with my students."},

I ordered extra in my last shipment from Grove Collaborative and will be using these in many thank you gifts this spring!  Small, inexpensive, smells great and consumable! Want to add a little something extra? Slip a gift card to Teachers Pay Teachers or Amazon in there! My youngest just wrapped up her last day of preschool today which was fun and exciting and emotional.  All my kids will be in full time school for the first time this fall and that makes me super excited and nostalgic all at the same time. Despite a super successful school year, I have been feeling like the daily grind of life has really been wearing down my gears this year.  I have been working hard at being more intentional about how I spend my time and making sure I am finding time for the things that re-charge me (like blogging!).  I have been using some of my Audible credits to listen to some books on productivity and personal growth.  I have recently finished Deep Work, Girl, Wash Your Face, Girl, Stop Apologizing, and Getting Things Done.  Next up on my list are The Power of Habit and Stumbling on Happiness.   It's amazing how much more reading I am getting done with Audible!I do plan on some summer teaching/math reading as well but still working on exactly what I want to read next!  I am super excited for Jo Boaler's new book, Limitless Mind but that is not out until September 3rd.  Look for a book study on that in the fall!  In the meantime, if you have any summer teacher reading recommendations, leave them in the comments below!"},

{"title": "Personalizing Learning With Math Centers", "date": "Sunday, April 1, 2018", "text": "TweetEarlier this week, I shared how I have been working on personalizing learning in my math classes.  This change came about because I was challenged to teach math in a multi-age setting but has led to some great discoveries that have helped me improve math instruction for all of my learners whether they are in a single grade or a multi-age setting.  Today I want to talk about math centers.  Math centers, also known as math stations, guided math, workplaces or math menu really can help with differentiation and personalizing learning.  Despite the fact that there are many names, strategies and ways to do math centers, their central purpose is to provide students with differentiated practice so that learners are engaged and occupied, freeing the teacher up to meet with small groups and provide further targeted instruction or enrichment to those who need it. It also solves the age old question of what to do with early finishers.Math centers have long been popular in the primary grades in many schools and have been mostly absent in upper elementary and middle school.  At my school, we have been doing some version of math centers in K-2 for as long as I can remember.  In grades 3&4 there has been some sporadic math center activity and at the 5th and 6th grade level, we have had very little math center time.  All of that has changed over the past 2 years and now all of our learners K-6 participate in math centers in one form or another.  Our younger students participate in something closer to guided math and our older students' model looks more like math menu. I have found math centers are most successful when kids can be offered choices.  There are many things you can either require or give choices for depending on the age of your students and the behaviors in the group.Who To Work WithStudents work in pairs at a table playing one version of Movin' it MathMany of your math centers will involve games or activities that lend themselves well to kids having chances to socially construct their knowledge.  Who a student works with can be something you choose for them or that you let them choose for themselves.  This is one of the areas where I am least likely to offer kids the chance to choose.  I almost always choose groups or pairs for my students.  As they get a bit older, I might offer them some limited choices about who they work with.  I find a lot more work gets done during math centers when I make intentional decisions about who is working together.I do want kids to work with a variety of other students.  I want them to have a chance to work with kids of similar academic ability sometimes but other times, I want them to work with someone who may have stronger or weaker skills in math.  I find that when I try only to group for academics, behaviors deteriorate quickly.  I also believe that kids learn so much from each other and do my best to facilitate this learning among kids of all ability levels.What Level To Work OnEach of my math centers contains the same activity at multiple levels (I will be writing a full blog post about this soon!). I almost always allow students to choose the level of the activity they are working on.  I do quite a bit of intentional teaching around choosing a level and find kids do very well choosing the just right activity for them.  Which Activity to Work OnIf you are offering several different math center options, you can decide which ones everyone has to do and which are optional.  You can let kids choose the activities and the order or you can pick who does which activity when.  In this area, my classes are kind of all over the map.  In general, the older students are the more choice I offer them in terms of which activity they want to do and the order they want to do them in.  With my upper elementary students, I often have a short list of \"have-to's\" and then a longer list of \"get-to's\".  The younger the students are and the wilder the class' behavior, the more I assign them a task and/or set a timer for when it is time to go onto the next class.  With my most challenging behavior classes, or when math centers are new to a group, I make more of the choices for them.  As the year progresses, I transfer responsibility of the choice more and more to the students.Where to WorkOn a beautiful day we may even take math centers outside!  My classroom has several large tables in the center, some desks along the perimeter and plenty of wide open space on the carpet.  While I often set math centers up on the tables, my students will often make a choice to work on the floor nearby or at one of the desks on the perimeter, particularly if they are working independently.  This is another area that I feel like kids in general make good choices.  I almost always let kids choose where to work and only very rarely will I have to ask someone to move to a different spot.  The variety of sitting a table, standing at a table and working on the floor seems to help keep my students engaged."},
{"title": "Personalizing Learning in Math Class", "date": "Tuesday, March 27, 2018", "text": "TweetOver the last few years, the enrollment at my school has continued to decline.  This led us to create several multi-age classrooms.  I had not experienced a multi-age classroom since I was an elementary student myself so I did what any professional reading junkie would do and looked up books on Amazon.  I was surprised to find that almost all the books written about multi-age classrooms were published in the early 90's.   This must have been the last time there was a big push to make classrooms multi-age.  After doing some research, I ended up purchasing Multiage Portraits which gave me some good information to start with.  I also visited a classroom at another local school who had been doing multi-age classrooms for years and learned a great deal there.As we began doing multi-age classrooms, classroom teachers found a way for most subjects to work in a multi-age way.  The subject they were struggling the most with was math.  We ended up in a model where we were pulling kids into grade level groups for math.  This meant I was doing primary instruction for several grades and eliminated a great deal of the time I used to have for co-teaching, intervention, coaching and the myriad of other tasks being a math specialist in a small school entails.  These factors along with the fact that there are already huge spreads in ability in a single grade, led me to believe that we could teach math in a multi-age setting.  I recruited one of my most enthusiastic colleagues and last school year we co-taught a Kindergarten/first grade combination math class.  There were a few bumps in the road along the way, but in the end it turned out better than we could have ever imagined and we learned a great deal about personalizing learning along the way.  The lessons we learned from doing this combined math class together have helped me create a 2/3 and a 5/6 combination math this school year.  In addition, it has helped both of us better meet students' needs in single grade classrooms as well.  We might have needed the push of attempting multi-age to get us there, but personalizing math class benefits all learners.Over the next few weeks, I will be writing detailed posts about what I learned last year and how I have been using that to personalize learning for students from K-6 this year.  Here are some of the basics of what we did, each of them will be posted on in greater detail soon! -Math Centers-Leveling Games-Curating Online Resources-Color Coding-Math Boxes-Teaching Mindset-Independent Practice-Number Talks-Flexible Groupings-Formative Assessment-Math Journals-Co-Teaching-Low Floor, High Ceiling Tasks"},
{"title": "How and Why I Spring Clean My Classroom", "date": "Sunday, March 25, 2018", "text": "TweetThis school year has been one big long example of how life sometimes gets in the way.  Every time I feel like I have things under control again, something happens to push me back into survival mode.  I finally am fighting my way back to a semblance of normal now and one of the first I things I did to help me ensure I stay here was give my classroom a big old fashioned spring cleaning.  5 Reasons Why I Prioritize Spring Cleaning My ClassroomClear Out Clutter  Like many teachers, I have a hard time getting rid of things that might be useful someday.  I have fought back against this urge by ruthlessly pitching things I no longer use each spring.  I think this works best in the spring because I can think about whether I have used something at all this school year or if I have plans to use it in the coming weeks.  If the answer to both of those questions is no, it gets thrown away, donated or recycled.  I also get ride of anything that is broken or no longer works as it should. This year I got rid of a bunch of non-geared mini clocks, a pile of very well loved student sized white boards, 2 boxes of math curriculum our district no longer uses, several board games that are no longer used and some old files on students who are no longer in my school.When your flat surfaces are completely covered in books, manipulatives and more you know it's time for a good cleaningSave TimeThere is certainly some upfront time to spring clean my classroom, but in the long run, I save a lot of time.  As the weather gets nicer and I want to spend more time outside, I find myself wanting to be able to leave school earlier in the afternoon and not work so long once the kids go home.  When my classroom is clean and organized, I save time by being able to find what I need when I need it and having less clean up that I have to do by myself because my students know where to put things when they are organized. The way the heater is supposed to look!  I am so much more energized in clean spaces!Rearrange and RevitalizeAs I spring clean my classroom, I take a few minutes to think about the furniture and arrangement of the room.  Is there any furniture that I no longer use that can be removed to make more space?  Is there any furniture I am lacking that I can check the storage area for or think about ordering for next year? I re-arrange furniture to better meet the needs and flexibility of the space before I am finished.  This year I got rid of a few chairs that were starting to break along the side and dug out a few better ones from our storage shed.  I also rearranged some desks along the perimeter of my room to make them friendlier for pairs of students working together.  This one is a bit embarrassing to share with the world, but this is what a math manipulative shelf can look like after being neglected for a bit.  Once things start to unravel, students don't know where to put things so they just shove them anywhere on the shelf.  Clean and DisinfectAfter 8 months of not getting wiped down, my book shelves, walls and those nooks and crannies the vacuum doesn't quite reach all needed a bit of love.  I use a bucket of soapy water and some microfiber cloths to give everything a once over.  I also disinfect all tables, desks, doorknobs and the sink area to help clear out those winter germs.  I also open my windows if the temperature allows it!  Getting everything back to clean and fresh makes me feel better every time I enter the room.  So much easier to put things back where they belong now! Make Things Seem NewWhen I clean things up and move things around some, it makes things feel fresh and new to me and to my students.  I am much calmer and my thoughts seem better organized when I am in an organized space.  Switching things up with a few months left to go in school seems to help everyone feel more energized as well.Finding Time For Spring CleaningI have three different ways I have found time to spring clean my classroom over the years.  Depending on my schedule and other life events happening during a particular year, I may use one strategy over the other.This one is almost painful to look at!  Here is what it looks like when I have been in survival mode for to long! The Dedicated DayI used this strategy for spring cleaning this year.  We had a week off for winter/spring break and my family was not traveling.  My mother in law wanted my own children for the day and the weather was terrible.  I spent the better part of a day at school alone and totally revamped my room from start to finish all at once.  I felt like I accomplished so much and got things exactly as I wanted them.  I feel like I have saved 1-2 hours a week in the 3 weeks since then.  As the weather gets warmer, those extra hours outside or at home feel great!The top of my desk is brown!  I also have some empty spots on my shelves which is always a good thing! A Little at a TimeIf I can't dedicate a bunch of hours together, I try to do a bit at a time.  Either choosing one area a day or just setting my timer for 10-15 minutes and cleaning furiously each day are great ways to get a lot done in small chunks.Recruit Help!Particularly for teachers who have the same kids in their room all day, spending an hour or so at the end of a school day doing a group spring clean can be a great way to get your classroom sparkling and teach your students about being responsible for their things and their space.  It can be a lot of fun to put on some music and work together to things back to the way they belong.  It is also a great chance for students who are great at organizing to get a chance to shine! What are your best classroom organization tips?

{"title": "Yohaku: The Ultimate Low Floor, High Ceiling Math Task", "date": "Saturday, March 24, 2018", "text": "TweetLast spring when I was doing the Mathematical Mindsets book study, I wrote a lot about rich mathematical tasks that all students can access but that also keep going or growing for students who need more challenge.  Since then, I have been on a quest to add more tasks like this to my repertoire and recently I cam across one that I just have to share with the world.I first heard about Yohaku in this month's issue of Teaching Children Mathematics.  I was sitting in a waiting room while reading about them and was instantly engaged in solving the examples offered in the magazine.  I quickly moved to their website and was amazed at the variety of puzzles they offered to meet many different math skill levels.  I knew this was going to be my next school wide low floor, high ceiling task.A great Yohaku for beginners!  I started by introducing my second and third grade group to Yohaku puzzles and by the end of the week, I had kids from K up through grade 6 working on them.  I highly recommend starting with one of the easier 2X2 addition puzzles when you introduce the idea of a Yohaku even if your students are older.  It is nice to be able to focus on the challenge of the puzzle and how to solve it and develop some strategies for solving these puzzles before moving onto more challenging puzzles.Some Yohaku puzzles have some text at the bottom which limits the numbers you can use.  We have found these puzzles can be more challenging that the ones that do not include additional limits. The puzzles increase in difficulty by getting larger (2X2, 3X3, 4X4), changing the operation from addition to multiplication and changing the numbers included in the puzzle (whole numbers, fractions, decimals, algebraic symbols)My students have generated so much enthusiasm for these puzzles that many adults in the building have joined in on the fun.  A few brave teachers have even been working together to tackle the algebraic puzzles which has really helped them move forward in their understanding of algebra. A teacher sent me this picture along with the words \"I finally did it!\"  When kids (and adults!) are working on these, they are not only deepening their understanding of math content, they are also working on the Math Practice Standards.  My students have decided that since these are so fun and since the entire school is working on them, we should turn our HUGE front hallway bulletin board into Giant Yohaku puzzles that are laminated so we can use dry erase markers on them and folks can solve them as they walk by or visit our school.  I think its a great way to get parents involved as well and will keep you updated here on the blog or over on Facebook once we get the project done. (We did it!  You can see it here!)I highly recommend trying these out with your students, you can get started over on their website or grab the Yohaku book!I also have started documenting my journey toward personalized learning!  You can read more about that here!"},
{"title": "Playing With Integers", "date": "Friday, March 23, 2018", "text": "TweetLiving in the northeast, my students get a lot of real life experience with negative numbers every winter.  Integers don't show up in our standards until grade 6, but my students get a fair amount of exposure to them much earlier than that through real life experiences with temperature.  Here is a problem I posed to my students earlier this week on the first day of spring.I just snapped a picture of the outside temperature as it shows up in my car when I got home after school one night and then again the next morning as I was leaving.  We had quite a temperature swing and unseasonably cool weather for the first day of spring and many kids were talking about the weather that day.  I love when I get a chance to capitalize on their interest with a well timed math problem.  This problem led to some great discussions about addition strategies and integers in all the grade levels.  Many students used or thought about number lines and in the older grades we talked about writing equations to go with this type of problem.  My sixth graders will have a more formal unit on integers in about a month but in the meantime, I introduced a game to my 5/6 math group a few weeks ago that is giving them a lot more experience playing around with integers. It is a card game called Absolute Zero.  Each kid gets between 3 and 5 cards in their hand then draws and discards a card each time it is their turn.  The cards are positive and negative numbers and the goal of the game is to get zero.  The current sum of this hand is 10.  On the next turn, if I draw a -3, I could discard the 7 and the sum of the hand would be zero and the round would end. One particular group of kids has been playing this game every spare minute they can and really playing around with strategies for winning depending on if you have 3, 4 or 5 cards in your hand at a time.  Another group of kids has loved playing war with these cards.  They have been playing addition war at this point, but some of them are ready to start thinking about integer multiplication so very soon I will be showing them how to play the same game with multiplication.  Kids have been integer addition war.You can learn more about Absolute Zero, print record sheets and see some videos of the game in action over at their website."},

I picked it up a few times today and read bits and pieces and started thinking about the message in the book. The book is Who Moved My Cheese? and apparently it is the most popular  book I have never heard of.  It is a very short book (under 100 pages) but packs a powerful message about how different folks deal with change.The story is very simple and short and is preceded by an introduction and followed by a conversation between a group of friends about how they interpret the story.  At my school, we are facing a great deal of change over the next several years and I think this book will really help us open up some conversations about the changes that are coming and how we are going to deal with them.  The story is about 2 mice and 2 little people.  The mice, Sniff and Scurry are much more adaptable to change.  Sniff can sniff out the situation and sees change coming early on.  Scurry is able to take action immediately when presented with change.  The little people, Hem and Haw have more trouble adapting to change.  Hem is the most resistant to change and really wants to stay in familiar territory.  he has a great deal of fear over any change and really wants to stay in one place.  Haw learns the most during the story.  He doesn't see the change coming but once things change, he is able to see what he is doing wrong and make some changes himself.  The change actually ends up changing him.  When I was reading this story, I could see myself and my colleagues in all of these characters.  It really made me think about how I deal with change at work and at home and how I can improve my response to change and my attitude about it.  I look forward to discussing this book with colleagues! I also think this book has a great message for my students.  In particular, I have a group of sixth graders right now who are fearful of the changes coming next year when they move up to our district middle school.   I also would like to share this story with my own children who could always use more practice dealing with change. Luckily, there is a picture book version and several animated versions available on You Tube.  Have you heard the story Who Moved My Cheese? Which character do you identify most with? How would you use this story with students? Please respond in the comments below!"},

She is a very well read author and brings a lot of other experts into this book.  She has been a first grade teacher for over 20 years but this book is really fitting for all educators.  She writes a lot about teaching writing but the lessons learned are those that would apply to teachers of any subject at any grade level.The format of this book is short chapters based around a quote.  There are 50 chapters but they are quite short, around 300 words on average.  They can be read in any order and are great short pieces that helped me reflect on my practice and think about what is next for me.  I read the first half of the book in one sitting and then decided to slow down a bit and read a little each day.  I also did something the author says she does herself and began a journal collecting quotes and ideas from my professional reading.  I had this beautiful journal laying around waiting to be used and I have to say it is so nice to have all my thoughts about my professional reading collected in one place instead of on sticky notes all over the place. Here are a few quotes from the book that I found memorable along with my own reflection on them.From Chapter 26. Slow Down to Speed Up\"Being deliberate and explicit about the smallest of details is essential.  If my students don't know what I expect of them, come January they are certainly not to blame when things are not going as planned.  It takes a considerable amount of time, patience, and energy to be deliberate in those first several weeks though, especially when curriculum is impatiently piling up.  Rushing into the academic  fray too early without a sure foundation could sabotage everything. \"Slow down to speed up\" is my mantra\"This chapter really resonated with me because when I read it in early November, I was just begging to feel like I was getting out of the back to school rush.  Some years that busy back to school time seems to go on longer than others and this year was certainly one of those years.  In the moment, it can feel painfully slow and almost agonizing to make sure classroom routines and procedures are set up properly, but it is always worth it in the end.  Thinking about the idea of slowing down to speed up is a great way to frame it and remind myself that the speed will come later.From Chapter 28: Grace\"I often envision the teaching profession as a path without end.  It's occupied by teachers but all at different points.  They're all moving but at varying paces.  Then I spot myself.  It's plain to see how far I've come, and I can identify many teachers who are currently where I once was.  They deserve my grace.  I can also look ahead to where I'd like to be and see many teachers occupying that space.  I hope they show me grace as well.\"This quote really made me look at other teachers in my building and in the world in general that I know and to think about where they are along this path in relation to myself.  I have so many things I want to accomplish still as an educator and it can often seem like I have so far to go.  However, when I look back to where I came from, I see an equally overwhelming amount that I have already accomplished.  It is so helpful to me to think about my teaching career as this path without an end.  It makes me proud of what I have accomplished and hopeful for my future.From Chapter 42: The 3 R's of Teaching\"Simply put, reading + risking + reflecting = meaningful change.  I suppose we could call them the 3 R's of teaching.  Is this equation evident in our schools, or, better yet, in our own classrooms?\"Doing a lot of professional reading has been a great way for me to make meaningful changes in my classroom.  Some of the biggest shifts in my practice including formative assessment and number talks came from reading about them, trying them out and reflecting on how well they worked.  I can't emphasis enough how much reading about teaching and trying new ideas has moved me forward as an educator.  I know that not all teachers have made room in their days for this type of professional reading and I have been thinking about ways to help them increase the reading they do.  One thing is sending shorter, blog post length links to them.  Another idea is sharing podcasts I enjoy or encouraging teachers to sign up for a free trial of Audible.  There are quite a few good general education books available in audio format now. Gatekeepers was an inspirational read and would make a great holiday gift for your favorite educator."},
{"title": "Looking at Strengths ", "date": "Sunday, December 10, 2017", "text": "TweetOver the past few years, I have put a very high priority on keeping up with professional reading.  As my kids have gotten older, we seem to be on the go more than ever and I found my pile of to be read books growing and growing and very little reading getting done.  After discussing this with a colleague I decided what I needed to do was give audio books a try.  I signed up for Audible, got 2 free audio books and was off and running.  After my 2 free books, I decided to stay subscribed and now I can download new audio books whenever the mood strikes. I have found that teaching books specifically about math are pretty limited,but general books on education, leadership and mindset are almost all available on Audible. The first book I listened to via Audible was Strengths Based Leadership by Tom Rath. (He also wrote one of my FAVORITE picture books How Full is Your Bucket?)I have been in a teacher leader position in my school since almost the beginning of my career.  Much of what I have learned about being a leader has come from experience and mentors.  I am now interested in exploring more about leadership and how I can take things to the next level.  I read Lead Like a Pirate back in March which is much more specific to education than this book.  Despite the fact that this book was written for leaders in general, I got a lot out of it.  The biggest thing I took away from this book was a deeper understanding of my own strengths as a leader.  The book details many different strengths and comes with an access code to the leadership version of Gallup's Strengthsfinder Program.  The strengths the program identified for me are Achiever, Maximizer, Learner, Activator and Arranger. Each of these is described in detail in the book but I also received a customized report about how exactly each of these applies to me.  I was surprised how well this assessment pinpointed my strengths and to some extent, even parts of my personality. Another huge take away from this book was about looking for strengths in others.  It really made me think about how to best utilize members of my team and my colleagues to support me, my students and the mission of our school.  There were certain strengths that when listening to them talk about, I would think so clearly of one teacher or another that I have worked with.  Looking at people's strengths has helped me make ground as a leader in just a few short months. What other books about leadership would you recommend?  If you use Audible, what education books are available in this format that you would recommend?

{"title": "Let's Talk About Multiplication Fact Fluency", "date": "Friday, November 3, 2017", "text": "TweetThese cards are an awesome way to develop conceptual understanding of multiplication facts!Earlier this week, I shared this post about memorizing facts versus knowing facts from memory. In this post, I talk about how I used to think timing kids daily on multiplication facts was the backbone of my fourth grade curriculum and how my perspective has shifted over time to one where I believe kids should know their facts from memory rather than through memorization.  If you are not familiar with this idea, here is a video where Graham Fletcher explains it better than I ever could.After re-sharing this post from last summer on my Facebook page, I received the following comment from Michelle:\"While I agree that strategy is the way to go (it's the only way we teach math facts), I'm second guessing myself when it takes 15 mins to work through a 2-digit x 2-digit multiplication problem bc every 'part' (when using partial products for example) has to be worked out using a fact strategy when kids don't know their facts well. It takes soooo long. I'm so proud when my intervention students get the correct answer but it might take 40 mins to do 3 problems and I start to second guess myself-should I be drilling them more often. I know that they know AND can discuss the fact strategies they used as they go, but I sometimes wonder when is the leap to automaticity going to come. Maybe I need to just be more patient? I'm speaking of intervention students that are seen multiple times per week. Taught the multiplication strategies last year, didn't retain the strategies over the summer, now reteaching but feeling stagnant...guess I'm just having trouble bridging the gap b/t them knowing the various strategies and automaticity. I am supposed to be teaching division to one of them but it is so so difficult when they don't know their mult. facts. This student can complete problems correctly using 100 bead number line or draw a picture and circle groups (divisor) but w/o that are completely unable to make an educated guess bc multiplication facts are not solid. I just hope I'm doing the right thing focusing so much on strategy. Would really love for them to be proficient by the end of the year.\"Here is how I would respond to Michelle and to anyone else facing this struggle.Michelle makes some excellent points!  Their strategies do need to have some level of efficiency.  First of all, are your students fluent with adding 2 double digit numbers mentally?  The ability to do this is the backbone of multiplication fact strategies and is a super important pre-requisite skill.  This is one of the many reasons I hold off on introducing the standard algorithm for addition.  If this is a skill you find is missing in your students, here are some great games that can be done to get your students comfortable with this important skill. Another excellent resource is the Number Talks book which offers a great framework and specific problem strings that can move your students forward with mental addition strategies.Once you are feeling good about your students' fluency with double digit addition,there are lots of ways to work on building efficient strategies.  I know it can feel like you are moving backwards to have to go back and work on multiplication fact strategies but it will pay off in the long run.  Your work with double digit multiplication and with division will be so much easier if your kids have efficient strategies for multiplication.  Again, I have to say the Number Talks book is an excellent resource that provides a framework and specific problem strings that will move your students forward on fact strategies.  Here are a few of my other favorites for moving kids forward with fact strategies:Making Array CardsMath Cards from You CubedMultiplication Fact Playing CardsExample of a multiplication fact number talkAnother Number Talks resource Your students are lucky to have you Michelle!  I am sure you will make a big difference for them.What advice would you give Michelle?

{"title": "Sharing the Good Things Happening In You School", "date": "Monday, October 16, 2017", "text": "TweetIn the past few years, the political make up of our schools has been changing a great deal.  The way schools are funded and the amount of local control in schools has been changing.  There has been a huge push from our state government to consolidate school districts and push some of the local control to the district level.  This has resulted in many fears from parents, teachers and community members about losing their local, small town elementary schools.  They are rightfully afraid that these schools will be closed and our children will be sent to larger regional elementary schools.  I get these fears from the perspective as a teacher who works in a small school and as a Mom who loves the small school her own kids attend. In our school, so many wonderful things happen that the general public is not aware of.  Some parents who are well connected to the school have a pretty good idea, but I often think the community in general lacks specifics about the good things happening in their school.  Thinking about the change in political climate and understanding the fears of other teaches and parents about our small school being on the chopping block in the next few years, I have been thinking a lot about how to promote our school and share all the wonderful things happening here. 1. Video Last year, when I was researching ways to get out message out to parents, I stumbled upon Your School Rocks... So Tell People.  This book was full of great ideas that really helped me see the potential to up our game in several areas, including video.  Last spring, I challenged myself to create at least one video a week showcasing something going on in our school and after a few weeks, it got to be part of my routine and the response I have got is amazing.  I use the iMovie app for iPad to edit video clips, add text, etc.  We have been loving using video so much that this year, I have many students so excited to create their own videos that we are doing a trial of WeVideo which seems to be the go to video editing software for use on Chromebooks.  We are working on creating videos highlighting out behavior expectations for PBIS, math how to videos, trailers of upcoming events and so much more.  We share these videos on social media, the school website and on teacher blogs. 2. Social MediaOur school district has a Facebook page and a twitter account that previous to reading this book, I hadn't paid much attention to.  After reading this book, I immediately looked into who was providing content on these platforms and made sure to send content their was as often as possible.  I am also working on organizing teacher take over days where different teachers get control of the account for the day/week and provide a detailed look into their classroom.  Since I work in an elementary school, we are trying to reach parents on social media, and Facebook is definitely the place where we can find most of the parents.  The book had an excellent chapter on using Instagram to reach your students which I think would be perfect for middle and high school age kids. 3. School/Teacher BlogsIt is the expectation in my school that all teachers maintain a classroom blog where they share pictures, videos and updates at least a few times per month.  These are linked from the school website and it can be hard to see how much they are getting viewed or how helpful they are to families and the community.  They are a huge asset when someone new is looking into working at or sending kids to our school because they give a great flavor of what we have to offer.  My own blog is also used to curate online resources so it gets a lot of views at school and at home.  When I started adding videos that featured the students and videos that students helped create the engagement on the main page of my blog went up by 500%! Video is so powerful!  4. Alert the PressWhen something special is happening at your school, let the local press know.  Our smallest local paper is always interested in reporting on events happening in our schools.  They sometimes send a photographer & a reporter and other times they ask for more details and a picture that one of us took at the event.  Just a quick email to let them know what is happening in our school has resulted in positive press for us multiple times.  It is free and requires minimal effort. 5. School WebsiteIs your school website kept up to date?  For many folks, your school website is the first thing they see when they search for you and you want to make sure you have enough information posted that they can really get to know your school.  Also, you want to make it a place where students and families return to over and over again to get the information they need or to catch up on the news.  Make sure your school website is updated at least weekly to get the most out of it.  Regularly sharing pictures, videos, newsletters, etc is a great way to keep things fresh. 6. Get Folks Inside the BuildingOne of the best ways to get parents and community members up to date on what is happening at school is to invite them to come in.  When they are in the building, they not only get to see what is going on, they get to feel the culture as well.  We try to invite parents and community members in at least a few times a year and are now looking for ways to invite them in even more frequently.7. Class DojoClass Dojo is an app that another teacher in my building began playing around with last year and I can't say enough about how much it improves communication with families.  This year, we have several teachers using it in my building and my own kids' school is using it school wide.  I love it so much from the perspective of a teacher and a parent.  It is a communication app that lets teachers and parents share videos, pictures and messages.  A teacher can post to the class board where all families can see it or to each students' individual stories.  It is enough like Facebook, that parents seem to figure out how to use it quickly and it can really improve communication.  I have not yet found a way to use it to communicate to the community at large but it cannot be beat for communicating with parents. They also have GREAT videos about Growth Mindset! How do you share the good things happening in your school? Please respond in the comments below."},
{"title": "When You Don't Agree With Your Child's Teacher", "date": "Friday, October 13, 2017", "text": "TweetI have known a lot of teachers.  First as a student, then as colleagues and now as a parent   I have been very lucky that my children have had wonderful teachers who I absolutely treasure.  I love their school, the sense of community and the teachers willingness to go above and beyond.  I am trusting these folks with the things that are most important in my life which has really forced me to reexamine my own role as a teacher in other students' lives.  These teachers and my kids' school is such an important part of their life and their happiness there is vital to the happiness of our family.A situation recently arose where the teacher of one of my children made a decision that I did not agree with.  It was a decision that made me and my child feel unwelcome in their school.  My emotional response to this decision was dramatic and I can't remember the last time I was this upset about something.  I was in the place of the irrational parent rather than the calm and reassuring teacher.  Being in that role was new to me, and I really had to think about the best way to approach this with my child's teacher. Talk to the Teacher FirstIn my case, talking to the teacher was actually done by email.  I did not grasp the entirety of the situation when I picked my child up that day and once I did understand what had happened, I was much too emotional for an in person discussion that day.  In fact, I waited until the next day to begin composing the email and I went back to it several times throughout the day to make sure it was conveying what I needed it to without being too emotional.  The point here is that this was a decision the teacher made, and I needed to talk to her first before complaining to other staff members about this decision. Assume Good IntentionsThis teacher is one my family has known and loved for years.  I know she has always had the best intentions her students and their families.  I went on the assumption that she was not purposely trying to make families feel unwelcome. Think About it From Her PerspectiveI spent some time thinking about why she made this decision.  I thought about some of the changes that happened in the school this year and how the number of students in her class has gone up quite a bit.  I also thought about the fact that she seems to have some very challenging students this year and how that might be affecting her. Encourage OthersI heard a lot of grumblings from other parents the day I picked my daughter up from school.  I know from experience that parents are much more likely to complain to other parents than to tell the teacher directly why they are upset.  When other parents complained directly to me, I encouraged them to call, email or talk to the teacher about their concerns rather than to other parents.  If the teacher does not know multiple parents are upset, there isn't anything she can do about it. Follow ThroughIn my case, several emails back and forth to my child's teacher was enough to defuse the situation and have her reconsider her decision.  Whatever agreement you come to, make sure you hold up your end of the bargain.  If you get what you ask for make sure you say thank you. Mend the RelationshipI can be super challenging to disagree with someone you like and respect.  Even if you come to an agreement in the end, it can do damage to the relationship.  Things might feel a little awkward for a while and you may have to go above and beyond to be friendly and to help repair the relationship. Have you ever disagreed with your child's teacher?  How did you handle it?

{"title": "Fall Math Fun ", "date": "Sunday, October 8, 2017", "text": "TweetI am loving the fall weather we have been having this week!  It gave me a chance to get outside with some special Kindergarten kids and do some play based math activities using natural materials.  It was such a nice way to spend some time outside learning together! We started by going on a little nature walk with a few buckets and picking up some beautiful leaves, acorns and pine-cones.  Then we dumped our treasures out on the table, grabbed a few fine pointed sharpies and got to work exploring and adding some mathematical details to our fall materials.  We started by writing numbers on leaves.  Some kids wrote numbers to 10 while others wrote some random numbers they knew. We have been doing a lot with the 10 frame model recently and I wanted to capitalize on this so I used some of the larger leaves to draw some 10 frames which led to a lot of ordering and matching activies. Some kids are ready to look at addition and subtraction facts so we added leaves that had the symbols for +, - and = and they were able to use these with the numeral leaves and natural counters to create equations. Many kindergartners need plenty of practice with one to one correspondence and matching objects to numerals.  The acorns, pine-cones and number leaves let them have lots of experiences with this! We put everything in a bin and brought it inside to explore for a few more day.  The leaves will crinkle up along the edges and be unusable if you don't put something heavy on them when they are not in use.  I forgot this important step and ended up replacing them with artificial leaves that I had left over from another project. These materials placed in a sensory bin or sand table will give your kiddos opportunities to revisit them over the following week.To connect our outdoor exploration of natural materials, we made this fun fall themed number craft.  This is a great way to reinforce many models and makes an excellent fall bulletin board display. How are you embracing fall with your children or your class?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

These little movement breaks have been super important as we have transitioned from summer vacation back to school 5 days a week.  I forget how busy the back to school season can be and now that things are finally calming down, it is so nice to be back to sharing things with you on my blog. This week, I have had subtraction on the brain as we have been working on subtraction in the fact range in both grades 1 & 2. We are are playing a lot of games, using the same deck of cards over and over.  When kids master one deck of cards, I change them out for a more challenging set but the rules of the games don't change.  This really helps me personalize learning! Movin' It Math Subtraction Facts to 20 CardsWe have been getting tons of movement in playing Movin' It Math but today I want to share with you some of the other ways we have been using movement and music to practice subtraction facts.  When You Subtract With a PirateThis catchy tune from Harry Kindergarten Music gets at two big ideas for subtraction.  It includes the word difference and talks about how you are getting less.  There are some great examples, all with facts in the under 10 range. Subtraction Song for KidsThis song from Jack Hartmann is a great way to get kids up and moving.  This song is easy to sing along and dance with.  All examples are facts under 10. Subtraction Halving Numbers Math SongThis song is a great way to look at the half facts for numbers up to 24.  It is produced by Dream English Kids which is a You Tube channel that is very new to me. My Dog SubtractionThis video uses the \"take away\" and \"minus\" language. One Less Number GameAnother great song from Jack Hartmann, this one is based on the idea of one less.  Numbers go up to 100.  Adding and SubtractingAnother Harry Kindergarten Music song!  This one has a lot of different language in it and highlights the differences between addition and subtraction.  Do you have a favorite song/video for teaching subtraction?

{"title": "Catching Up and My Summer Reading List ", "date": "Thursday, July 13, 2017", "text": "TweetThe last few years have been an absolute whirlwind with trying to balance parenting and teaching.  I have been making many changes in my teaching as I move toward personalizing learning.  I continue to prioritize professional reading and wanted to share with you what books I am reading this summer as well as a few life updates.Taking a real vacationThis past week, I went with my family to Wells, Maine and had my first full week off from thinking about or reading/writing about teaching in at least 3 years.  I didn't take any of my professional reading or even bring my laptop.  I did read 6 books just for fun!  It has been at least 7 years since I have been able to read 6 books for pleasure in a week! My favorite read of the week was the Gilly Salt Sisters.  Despite my attempt to stay away from professional reading for the entire week, the house we rented had several bookshelves full of random treasures, one of which was this interesting looking book by Ron Clark.  I have always been very inspired by Ron Clark's work but have never read one of his books. Despite the fact that I managed to stay away from the book the entire week I was there, I decided I had to read this and have downloaded the audio version using a credit from my Audible subscription. I find audio books are a great way to help me keep up with all of the books I have on my wish to read list.  I often listen to them while cleaning, cooking or driving if I don't have the kids in the car with me. Older Kids = More AdventuresMy children are 7, 5 and 3 this summer and for the first time ever, I don't have a kid who is 2 and under.  This has opened up an entire new world of possibilities for us in terms of going on summer adventures. They can handle all day excursions and our world does not have to revolve around nap time for a change.  They also all walk well, listen better and have much more endurance.  This has led us to having tons of active summer fun all over our land, our neighborhood and our state.  We can visit many more isolated treasures in the area because our ability to hike has grown exponentially. Library TimeI am spending a great deal of my time this summer volunteering at our little local library.  This gem is tiny but an important part of our small town.  It is inside an old Baptist Church from the early 1800's.  There is such an eclectic collection of books both new and old.  It is entirely staffed by volunteers and is open a few hours each week.  I have been working to help update and reorganize the collection of books in a way that makes them easier for folks to access.  It is a lot like thinking about how to organize a classroom library and I have very much enjoyed my extra time among the books. Staying Out of My ClassroomI have been on summer vacation for almost 3 weeks now and I have managed to stay out of the school building and for the most part away from my school email.  I like taking a break and then slowly easing myself back into the school routine and plans for next year.  Beginning next Tuesday, I will spend a few hours each week in my classroom putting it together for next year and getting this prepared.  Our students start on August 30th and I like to avoid the last minute rush while still feeling prepared.  I find putting in 5-6 hours a week at my leisure over the second 2/3 of summer really helps relieve the back to school rush.My Summer Reading ListAccessible MathematicsI picked up this book because I saw the author, Steve Leinwand speak at a conference last year.  I was impressed by his ideas about only changing 10% of your teaching practice each year.  Designing GroupworkI read an earlier edition of this book when I was in college and student teaching.  After my book study on Mathematical Mindsets, I decided revisiting these ideas would enhance my ability to teach for a growth mindset. On Your MarkThis is another book I decided to read based on seeing the author speak.  This past spring, I attended a 2 day workshop on grading and reporting with a team from my district.  We have made some excellent progress in this area over the past 10 years but still have a few things we could do to improve the grading and reporting process.  The Best of the Math Teacher Blogs 2015I ordered this book because I am so inspired by many of the teacher blogs represented in this book.  I am impressed with how these teachers share the happenings in their classroom and ask important questions about teaching math.  Lead Like a PirateBack in 2014, I did a book study on Teach Like a Pirate and was so inspired by the ideas.  As my job evolves, I get put into leadership roles quite often in my school and my district so it was natural that when I saw Lead Like a Pirate had been published, I knew right away I wanted to read it.  I am almost done and will be sharing some of my thoughts soon!   Big Ideas in Primary MathematicsThis one I picked up on the recommendation of a friend.  Much of my reading over the past 2 years has focused on the intermediate & middle school grades and I like to keep myself up to date with all the grades I teach so I asked a friend who is an expert in primary mathematics which book she recommended and she picked this one! The Dyscalculia Resource BookThis book will be coming out in the next few days and looks to be a great resource.  Dyscalculia is something not well understood by most educators and definitely something I want to read more about. Two Books I Recently FinishedYour School Rocks.. So Tell PeopleI read this book during the last month of school, and loved the ideas presented.  I am always looking for ways to improve communication and feel like there are awesome things happening in my school that nobody knows about.  The ideas in this book, especially around sharing with video were things I was immediately able to put into practice.  I passed this book onto my principal and we are working together to make a plan for using some of these ideas building wide next year.  140 Twitter Tips for EducatorsI have officially been on Twitter since the fall of 2013 but have not really used it in any substantial way.  Many fellow educators in the math field and otherwise have encouraged me to use Twitter for professional development and a way to connect with other educators.  Since being the only math specialist in a building can be isolating, I knew Twitter would be an excellent way to connect with the larger educational community.  While reading this book, I began to take many of the tips to heart and was doing a great job with Twitter at least until the school year was coming to a close!  This book definitely helped me feel more comfortable using Twitter and I would highly recommend it to any educator!How are your plans for the summer progressing?  Feel free to respond in the comments below!"},

{"title": "Assessment for a Growth Mindset", "date": "Friday, March 10, 2017", "text": "TweetThis week we are wrapping up our Mathematical Mindsets book study.  I have loved reading this book and going deeper into the big ideas in my classroom.  If you are just joining us, be sure to check out part 1, part 2 and part 3. Chapter 8: Assessment for a Growth MindsetBig Ideas-Teachers are being asked to test and to grade students to a damaging degree-Often what is easy to test is being assessed rather than valuable mathematics knowledge-It is common to start a math class with a pre-test to determine what students know.  This gives students a message that math is about performance. -Research has shown that test scores demotivate students and convey a fixed messages that result in lower achievement-Boaler recommends assessing less-Use more formative assessment Impact in the ClassroomTest LessI am happy to get on board with this one.  We use standards based grading on our report cards so I don't have to worry about giving a percent score.  This naturally reduces the amount of assessing and grading that I have to do.  I never put a grade on classwork or formative assessment prompts. I do grade unit assessments and such but often do not share the percent grade with students.  I have to collect some percent grades currently mostly used during IEP evaluation processes.  I have not yet figured out a way to convince the special educators that a kid is in the lowest 15% of the class without some percentages.  I would be happy to never put a percent grade on anything again and would love to work toward this goalMore Formative AssessmentWhen I was in graduate school, I read Assessment for Learning and started using many formative assessment strategies.   The following school year, I got even further into formative assessment ideas when all of the teachers in my school had the opportunity to take a formative assessment course together during in-service time.  Reading this chapter brought back a few ideas that we had great success with in our school but have sort of fallen out of practice.  After reading this chapter, I led a staff meeting about formative assessment strategies to remind us all of some of our forgotten favorites.  We also got to have a good discussion about how the assessment practices in our district have shifted and what we have had to give up as a result.Screeners and MTSSSince starting our formal work as an MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports) school two years ago, we are doing much more formal testing.  These tests are given 3 times per year and are meant to be screeners to see who is not meeting standards in math and reading.  I work in a small school where I literally know all of the students very well and many of them I work with for 7 years.  I do not need more assessments to tell me who needs help in what area.  These additional assessments have added more to our students' and teachers' plates and seemed to have pushed some of our formative assessment strategies out.  I am really struggling with how MTSS systems effect math mindset and will be having some discussions with other folks in my district about these ideas.Chapter 9: Teaching Mathematics for a Growth MindsetBig Ideas-It is important to set up classroom norms based on research.  Here is the printable poster with the big ideas from Youcubed. -Teaching kids how to work in groups is an important step.  Designing Groupwork is an excellent reference to get you started.-Believe in all of your students and make sure they know you believe in them-Value persistence and hard thinking instead of speed-Change praise!  Here is a great list of suggestions. -Choose tasks with a low floor and a high ceiling!Impact in the ClassroomThe Participation QuizWhat an awesome strategy for encouraging group work!  I am a bit ashamed to admit that I learned this strategy from my mentor teaching when I was student teaching but somewhere along the way I lost it from my repertoire.  Bringing it back to the classroom was just the jolt we needed to re-invigorate our group work.  It is an amazing way to motivate students and share all the skills you value.  Low Floor, High Ceiling TasksMany of the math tasks in this chapter I have tried out with my students over the past two weeks.  It is amazing how much mileage I have gotten out of some of these tasks and how much it has helped move some of my multi-age groups forward.  Another resource for these types of problems that I stumbled upon this week and then spent way to many hours there is Math Pickle. It is an amazing website full of great math problems, puzzles, games and ideas about how to bring unsolved math problems into K-12 classrooms.  Thanks for following along on this book study!  This book is such a wealth of information.  I am considering doing another book study this spring around Designing Groupwork.  I will let you know the details when I work them out!"},
{"title": "Mathematics and the Path to Equity", "date": "Friday, March 3, 2017", "text": "TweetWelcome to week 3 of our Mathematical Mindsets book study! If you are just joining us, be sure to check out our launch, The Power of Mistakes and Struggle and Creating Mathematical Mindsets. Chapter 6: Mathematics and the Path to EquityBig Ideas-The myth of the mathematically gifted child: This section reminded me of my own math story! - All students should have access to high-level content-Try to change ideas about who can do well in math- Make sure students have opportunities to think deeply about math- Importance of group work- Eliminate homework- Encourage minorities Impact in the Classroom  Eliminating Homework The strategy that resonated the most with me is the elimination of homework.  Last school year, I made the decision to stop assigning math homework altogether and it has been great.  The kids who were the most likely to do the homework were the ones who needed it the least.  Having parents and caretakers \"help\" with homework was leading to procedures I wasn't ready to embrace in the classroom along with negative feelings about math.  I was spending more class time assigning and collecting homework than kids were spending doing it.  Now, I assign no homework.  I do have a class blog that is a curated list of online activities that go along with what we are learning in class.  Families can access this at home if they wish but it is certainly not a requirement.  I also use a lot of games/centers in my classroom and sometimes kids will love a particular game and want to share it with their families.  I let students who wish to take games home to play with family members do this.  I also occasionally will have a student who wants more practice with a particular skill and will ask for something extra.  I indulge this desire.  Since eliminating homework in my classroom, things seem much more equitable and students, parents and myself all seem happier.  I have not noticed a lack of understanding or that we are farther behind than in years past.Working in Groups Another strategy that really resonated with my was teaching students to work together.  In the times that I was most challenged by my math classes, I had a group that I could turn to for help.  I remember spending 6 hours every Thursday night in our University library working on problem sets together.  This gave me the confidence I needed because I could see others were struggling also and because I was able to construct my knowledge with others.  When I was student teaching, my mentor teacher had me read Designing Groupwork which led to a great system for making sure my students work together.  It isn't always perfect and sometimes group work can be a challenge but it is such an important part of my math lessons.Offering High Level Content to All Students The strategy I envision being the most difficult to implement is definitely offering all students high-level content. I think we have done this in our elementary school but I imagine it would be harder and harder to do as students get older and the gap between students widens.  Our school district currently offers accelerated math beginning in grade 7.  I have always been on the fence about whether this is a good idea and this chapter got me thinking that maybe it isn't. Chapter 7: From Tracking to Growth Mindset Grouping Big Ideas -When students are offered high level content they achieve at higher levels- \"We can give no stronger fixed mindset message to students than we do by putting them into groups determined by their current achievement and teaching them accordingly.\" - The importance of providing open ended tasks- Complex Instruction-Valuing different types of skillsImpact in the ClassroomRe-Thinking TrackingOver the past few years, our school has moved completely away from grouping kids for math based on skills.  We teach heterogeneous groups for each grade level and have even moved to teaching some multi-age math groups.  The only exception has been kids who are more than two years behind in math.  These kids are often pulled out of their math class and offered math in a different setting by a special educator.  I would be interested to hear more about folks' opinions on how far behind is to far behind to group heterogeneously. More Low Floor, High Ceiling TasksWhen I provide my students with open ended tasks, they are more engaged and invested in their learning.  I feel great about my teaching.  I think I need to do more of these types of tasks but I am still working on juggling doing these tasks with number talks and all of the other things I am expected to do or think work really great for my students.  I will be thinking more about this.What did you think about this week's reading?!  Please respond in the comments below!"},
{"title": "#FractionsFebruary Blog Tour", "date": "Tuesday, February 28, 2017", "text": "TweetI am finishing out the #FractionsFebruary blog tour put on by Math Solutions.  I had the privilege of interviewing Julie McNamara, author of Beyond Pizzas & Pies and Beyond Invert & Multiply.  I love reading about teaching fractions and always feel like there is more I can learn.  I read both of these books about a year and a half ago and they brought great changes to my teaching practice, especially the idea of using cuisenaire rods in my fraction lessons.  Beyond Pizzas and Pies is great for grades 3-5 and Beyond Invert and Multiply is great for grades 4-6.  If you teach 4th or 5th grade, I highly recommend you read both of these books! What is the most exciting piece of research on teaching fractions that has come out over the last 10 years?Siegler, Thompson, and Schneider’s (2011) work highlighting the importance of students’understanding of fraction magnitude provides much needed insight into the importance of thenumber line. They found that students who had a good understanding of fraction magnitude (asevidenced by their ability to accurately place fractions on a number line and to accurately comparetwo fractions) were also more successful with problems involving fraction computation. Siegler,Thompson, and Schneider suggest that the extension of students’ “mental number line” to includerational numbers is an essential aspect of numerical development - what I refer to as number senseand fraction sense.What do you feel is the biggest misconception students have about fractions? This is a tough one but one big misconception is that fractions are always considered in terms offood (pizzas, pies, brownies, etc.) and that fractions are not numbers.What can teachers do to help students overcome this misconception?One thing teachers can do is to build on students’ early work on partitioning areas, with explicitattention to the importance of equal partitioning, and connect this to linear measurement models.Contexts are very beneficial, especially ones that can be considered on a number line like time anddistance. One of the reasons I use Cuisenaire Rods so much in my work is that they are concreteenough for students to manipulate and they can be used as bridges to work with number lines.What was the most surprising thing you learned in the process of writing your books?I found that I really liked the process and that I LOVE thinking about fraction division.If you were to go back into the classroom as a teacher, what grade would you choose to teach and why?This is another tough one. I really love fourth grade, as there are so many opportunities to helpstudents begin to think abstractly. I also love middle school because there are so many connectionsback to the mathematics of elementary school that students are often hesitant to consider. Theydon’t know how much they know! One of the best parts of my position at the university is that I havemany opportunities to go into classrooms and work with students in local schools.You can read the rest of Julie's interview over at the Math Solutions Blog!Want to win a copy of these books?!

{"title": "Creating Mathematical Mindsets ", "date": "Friday, February 24, 2017", "text": "TweetWelcome to week 2 of our Mathematical Mindsets book study! Last week, we looked at the latest in brain research and talked about the importance of mistakes and struggle.  Chapter 3: The Creativity and Beauty in MathematicsBig Ideas- Math gets treated differently than other subjects.  It is much more of a performance subject than any other.-There is a big gap between real world mathematics and school mathematics- Students (and the public in general) see math as calculations, rules and procedures rather than creative and beautiful.  Impact in the ClassroomFibonacci Numbers and the Golden RatioOne of the examples given in this chapter was about taking a look at the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio with kids.  I have always loved this series of numbers and many years ago was given a copy of Fascinating Fibonaccis which I have now used many times to talk with kids about Fibonacci numbers.  I also love the picture book Rabbits Rabbits Everywhere by Ann McCallum who also wrote Eat your Math Homework.  One more excellent resource is this blog, Fabulous Fibonacci Fun where you can find more background information as well as a great collection of images that illustrate the golden ratio in nature. Let Students pose Their own Questions Real mathematicians pose and answer questions all the time.  One of the best ways to get our students doing this is to let them have the chance.  Give them mathematical tools or situations and let them come up with questions.  Let them work to find answers to their questions.  This is something I have had some opportunity to do this year in the context of our school wide genius hour.  It is definitely something I hope to do more of in the future.Chapter 4: Creating Mathematical Mindsets: The Importance of Flexibility with NumbersBig Ideas-Kids intuitive joy of math is quickly replaced with learning procedures & rules-Students need to see math as a conceptual, growth oriented subject.  They should see math as a place to think, not to blindly operate on numbers.Impact in the ClassroomNumber TalksThe single best way I have found to develop a sense of numeracy in kids of all ages is number talks.  Doing number talks with my students has been a total game changer in my students' ability to think about numbers, develop strategies and learn to talk about their thinking.  It is a structured way to spend 10 minutes each day that will give you big results.  If you teach K-4, start with this book, and if you teach grade 5 and up check out this one.  If you have been using number talks in your classroom and are ready to up your game, there is a new number talks book all about Fractions & Decimals. I have dug into this one over the past 2 months and it has really helped move my practice forward and increased my students' understanding of fractions and decimals. Hold off on Formal ProceduresWhen do you \"teach\" kids the traditional algorithms for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing?  Holding off on these formal procedures can really help kids see math as a growth oriented subject where they can develop their own conceptual understanding and design their own strategies to solve problems.  If you are using number talks, you will be amazed at what kids of efficient strategies your students can come up with on their own.  In my school, we have agreed not to introduce the traditional algorithm for addition and subtraction until grade 4.  We hold off on the traditional algorithm for multiplication until the end of grade 5 and division until grade 6.Go for Depth, Not SpeedValue deep thinking over fast thinking in your classroom. Whenever I talk about not focusing on speed, the issue of math facts comes up.  I think to much emphasis is put on memorization when kids should really be working on knowing facts from memory.  For much more about facts, check out this post. Chapter 5: Rich Mathematical TasksBig Ideas-5 c's of engagement: curiosity, connection making, challenge, creativity, collaboration-5 ways for teachers to open math tasks and increase potential for learning.      1. Open the task so there are multiple methods, pathways and representations    2. Include inquiry opportunities    3. Ask the problem before teaching the method    4. Add a visual component and ask students how they see the math    5. Ask students to convince and reason; be skepticalImpact in the ClassroomRich mathematical tasks are such a good way to generate engagement and enthusiasm in your classroom.  Providing kids with low floor, high ceiling tasks are a great way to get big math ideas, work on perseverance and get kids excited about math. After reading this chapter, I decided to try a little experiment with a very engaging, very open ended task, the 1 to 10 card investigation. If you have never heard of this investigation, head here to check out a 1 minute video. I presented the original investigation to a group of first graders who are always looking for a challenge, all of my second graders, the entire 5th and 6th grade classes and a large group of teachers during a PD day. All of these folks were able to access this problem.  The excitement and engagement were just as high with adults solving this problem as it was with first graders.  Students work together using 20 frame playing cards to solve the problem to 15. The best part of this problem was that there really is no end to it.  After folks solved the 1 to 10 card problem, all kinds of extensions were proposed and worked on.  Some kids increased the number of cards while others proposed different arrangements of the cards such as what if we flip one over and then put 2 on the bottom.  Kids challenged each other and me to go further with this problem.  One of my sixth graders must have spent 20 hours on this problem over the last week and was able to generalize a pattern that would work for any number of cards.  Kids asked to take cards home and challenge their families.  Teachers who worked on this problem during PD literally could not stop working on it. A student uses cards from my place value to 120 deck to work on solving the problem with 50 cards Your turn!  What did you think about this week's reading?

They see mistakes as a way to grow their brain and motivation to keep going.-Fixed mindsets can develop as a result of praise given by parents and teachersImpact in the ClassroomTeach kids about brain research.  Research about the brain and growth mindset has come a long way over the last few years.  I have found Jo Boaler's Week of Insiprational Math to be a fantastic (and free!) way to show kids about how the brain works and get them excited about math.  We started our school year with the week of inspirational math in grades 3-6 and have recently re-watched some of the videos included in the lessons to refresh ourselves on brain research.  We have plans to do a week of inspirational math in our K-2 classes in the near future.       Another excellent resource for helping your students understand brain research is a series of short cartoon videos produced by Class Dojo. Recently, we started k/1 math each day with one of these videos which led to some great conversations about how the brain works.  Even if you don't use Class Dojo, these videos are a great resource!  It looks like you can check out the first one on YouTube and the rest are available on their site.  It is free to use and only takes a minute to sign up. Change praise Praise from teachers can help kids develop a fixed or a growth mindset, it all comes down to the type of praise they receive. Praise has such a strong impact, it can affect their behavior right away.  The praise kids receive in the classroom needs to switch from  you are so smart to you are working really hard. This has been a challenging switch for me because despite good intentions, it is so easy to fall back on the old reliable praise.  Like most things, it is something teachers need to practice.  We spent some time at a staff meeting brainstorming different things that fit into the category of praise and then classifying it as praise that would develop a growth or a fixed mindset.  This is an area where it is so important for kids to get a consistent message and it is definitely worth discussing as an entire staff.  A colleague also shared this Growth Mindset poster with us and posted it in several prominent teacher areas. It has been a helpful reminder and has continued the discussion about changing our praise.Educate FamiliesIf students are really going to change their mindset than both teachers and parents need to be aware of this research and have practical strategies to help them.  Since our entire school has been working on kids developing a growth mindset, we have communicated with families in several ways.  We started the year by showing a few of the videos from the Week of Inspirational Math at our back to school open house.  This was after we had used these videos with kids so many families had already heard parts and pieces of this.  We also use our school wide newsletter to communicate what we are doing and share growth mindset tips.  The topic has also come up during parent teacher conferences, especially with those kids who need the most work on their mindset.  We have also shared this great little parent handout with families.   It is still a work in progress to educate families about growth mindset but we have made a start and are now developing a common language for kids at school and at home.  Chapter 2: The Power of Mistakes and Struggle Big Ideas- Mistakes grow student's brains- When a student makes a mistake, there is increased electrical activity in their brain.  - Even if you don't know that you made a mistake, it still grows your brain- After a mistake, brain activity is greater for those who have a growth mindset rather than a fixed one. - Successful people are the ones who make more mistakes than non-successful peopleImpact in the ClassroomGive students the chance to make mistakesGiving students a chance to make mistakes is one of the best things you can do to develop their understanding of mathematics.  If they make no mistakes day after day, then the math you are giving them is not challenging enough.  Kids come to believe that being smart means getting the answer right on the first try and with a bit of speed.  I love this video from the Teaching Channel where Carol Dweck author of Mindset: The New Psychology of Success talks about personalized learning and how important it is for kids to make mistakes. Teach students that mistakes are positiveI am a big fan of this routine called My Favorite No.  I do a lot of formative assessment in my classroom and doing My Favorite No is a great way to directly address misconceptions with the class.A few weeks ago, I found these growth mindset posters and put them up on a bulletin board.  In my fifth grade class, I have many kids struggling with growth mindset so I decided to really use these posters with them.  I decided to have them place a sticker on the poster each time they used the \"think\" bubble.  It struck us very quickly that we make mistakes all the time.  The mistake poster became full of stickers while the others just had a few.  This has been a great way to show how common mistakes are and how important they are to learning.Test and Grade LessOur school uses standards based grading for our report cards which means I test and grade a lot less than I used to.  However, there still are times when folks want percent grades, particularly for Special Education Evaluations.  We also have added several \"screeners\" and other forms of testing as we have moved toward an MTSS model in our district.  I do a lot of formative assessments so I have a really good handle on where kids are.  I am on board with less grading and testing but I am not sure my school/district is ready to change much more in that direction right now.  I am excited that chapter 8 is all about assessment and hope to be able to try some new ideas.

{"title": "Growth Mindset and Mathematics", "date": "Thursday, February 2, 2017", "text": "TweetWhat does a student's past experience have to do with how they learn math today?  My past experiences certainly shaped me and changed my mindset several times.My  Math StoryI was told from a young age that I was gifted in math.  I learned math easily and was always ahead of my peers.  I can not ever remember struggling with a math problem until I was in fifth grade.  When I was a fifth grader, my teacher allowed me and another student to work on our own, starting at the back of the textbook and working our way to the front.  As a teacher, this sounds like a terrible idea in retrospect but it did lead me to develop some perseverance that had seriously been lacking. After that, I continued into middle school and high school continuing to do well in math.  I had a great memory and was really good at remembering procedures, formulas and rules.  Now I know I was getting by on this and not on a deep conceptual understanding of math.  I knew I wanted to teach elementary school from the time I was in tenth grade.  I went to college as an elementary education major.  We had to pick a second major and I randomly picked sociology.  Luckily, someone convinced me that having a background in math would be much more marketable so I switched my second major to math.  This led me to taking 2 math classes per semester.  When I got a class on non euclidean geometry, I hit a major wall.  The content was challenging and required so much more of my focus and attention then I was used to.  I worked harder during that one class than I had on all the other math classes I had taken combined.  It gave me the experience of working hard and still barely keeping my head above water.  I don't remember much of the content of that class now, but I do remember what it was like to struggle and to work really hard to learn math.  Despite a major in math in college, I still lacked the conceptual understanding of math that I needed to teach.  I started teaching sixth grade and really struggled with how to help my students who didn't have a good foundation in mathematics.  I spent a lot of time repeating the steps of a procedure louder and slower until my students could do it.  After a few years of teaching sixth grade, my position was cut and I moved onto a new school in a new role as a math specialist.  I got the job because I could do a lot of math, not because I knew a lot about teaching it.  I was given a lot of free rein to use my role anyway I wanted.  I spent a lot of time the first year just figuring things out.  I started listening to my students more and helping them develop strategies rather than teaching them. From there, I delved into some of the deeper research available on teaching math at that time.  I read a lot of books and got involved in some really good professional development.  I took more math courses, these ones aimed at teachers and at developing a deep understanding of content.  I did a lot of group work and spent a lot of time learning from my peers.  I saw multiple approaches to solving problems and expanded my definition of what it meant to be good at math.  For the first time, I saw the connections between algebra and geometry and gained a valuable understanding of big conceptual ideas.  This conceptual understanding of mathematics led me to be a much better teacher. Mathematical MindsetsNowadays, I am so much better at helping my students learn math.  I have so many more tools, strategies, ideas and a much better understanding than when I first started out.  Despite all this, I still have students who are struggling.  I know that I have the tools I need to help them but something big seems to be getting in their way.  Their mindset.  The research on the brain and mindsets has been moving quickly over the last few years and now their is so much available information to help students, teachers and parents with mindset.  My research on mindset last summer led me to Carol Dweck's Mindset book.  From there, I found Jo Boaler's Book Mathematical Mindsets and knew it was the next thing I wanted to work on.  I got the book in July and read it almost in one sitting. It got my wheels turning as I was starting to think about back to school season and I have made some big changes this school year based on ideas in this book.  Now that I have the basics down, I am reading this book again (a little slower this time!) and am going to go deeper into some of the ideas as well as share how I have used some of it in my classroom.  Over the next 9 weeks, I am going to take one chapter at a time and take a closer look at these ideas.  I would love for you to join me!Book StudyI read a lot of math teaching books!  From time to time, I like to dive deeper into a new book or an old favorite by hosting a book study on my blog. I have done book such as Minds on Mathematics, Beyond Invert and Multiply, Mathematics Through Play, Number Talks, Children's Mathematics,Whole Brain Teaching For Challenging Kids, Teach Like a Pirate and Guided Math in Action.

{"title": "Teaching Math With You Tube Videos: Halloween Fun", "date": "Tuesday, October 25, 2016", "text": "TweetIn the past few years,  I have posted some of my favorite songs and videos about shapes, counting, multiplication, coins, time, fractions, teen numbers, area and perimeter and addition facts.  I try to keep these posts up to date with the latest songs and videos I am using with my students.  They are a great way to get a little movement break while still working on important math concepts. Today I want to share with you some fun Halloween themed You Tube Videos that are a great way to review math topics while having some holiday fun and movement.  KindergartenI have several kindergarten friends this year who are still struggling with one to one correspondence, counting to 20 and recognizing single digit numbers.  The following few videos are a good way to work on these important ideas.  I like to sing along with them and work with them to make up finger plays or dances to go with them.  First GradeI love the 10 in the bed rhyme for working on combinations of 10 and basic subtraction ideas.  This is a fun Halloween version of the classic song. Another great basic subtraction song/video!Can you tell my first graders are working on subtraction?  This isn't a Halloween song per say but it is all about pirates (and subtraction!) so it fits in well with out theme!We are also having a great time using our pumpkin 10 frames in both K & 1.  Next week we will read the story How Many Seeds in a Pumpkin? We will follow up the story with cutting open some pumpkins ourselves and do a counting and estimating routine.Do you have a favorite Halloween song/video for teaching kids about math?  Tell us about it in the comments below!"},
{"title": "Back To School Math Tips: Organizing Online Resources", "date": "Sunday, July 31, 2016", "text": "TweetIt's time!  Teachers all over the country are thinking about back to school.  Whether you are going back to school this week, next week or not until the end of the month, I am sure your mind is on back to school.  My math blogger friends and I have teamed up to bring you our best tips for back to school.  Check out my tips below for organizing your online resources, enter my giveaway and be sure to check out the other back to school tips.Organizing Online ResourcesI love starting the new school year with everything organized and ready to go.  It is the time of the year that I feel like I have everything in its place.  I am a math teacher who uses many games for practice and for differentiation so naturally I have a lot bins full of manipulatives, game pieces, card decks and dice.  As the years have progressed and online math games have developed, I have added them to my repertoire but have always struggled with how to keep these resources organized in a way that made them easy for my students to find.  For every good math resource available online, there are 3 bad ones and I really wanted a place to organize the good resources for each unit where my students could find them. At the beginning of last school year, I decided to get my online math resources organized in a way that made them easy for my students (and me!) to find and use at school and at home.  I decided to create a classroom blog that linked to all my favorite online resources.  I went with a blogger blog because it is easy to use and my school already uses google email and other products.  It is super easy (and free!) to set up a blogger blog.  Because I teach multiple grades, I decided to create a page on my blog for each one.  On the home page, I added a little welcome message and directed students to click on the tab for their grade across the top of the page. I work with 7 grades but decided to start with 4 grades for the first year.  If you are a classroom teacher, you can create a page for each content area.  If you want to start small, just create one page for one subject and add more as you get comfortable. When kids clicked on their grade, they were taken to a page that had resources on it that went with their current unit of study.  They were a mixture of online games, you tube songs and math literature book read alouds.  It takes just a few minutes to learn how to add links and embed you tube videos in your blog posts.  Here is an example of what was on the grade 2 page when we were working on telling timeHaving my favorite online resources in one place where kids could access them from home or school was fantastic.  I probably spent less than 15 minutes a week keeping my pages up to date with what we were working on.  If you are new to blogging, it will definitely take you longer when you start out but it is certainly a skill worth learning.  Having your favorite online resources organized when the school year starts will certainly help to make this the best year ever!  If you have other tips for keeping online resources organized, be sure to share them in the comments below!The TPT Back to school sale will take place Monday and Tuesday August 1st & 2nd!  All of my resources will be 28% off with the code BESTYEAR.Want some extra money to spend during the back to school sale?

{"title": "Memorizing Facts Versus Knowing Facts From Memory", "date": "Wednesday, June 22, 2016", "text": "TweetI used to think one of the most important things I did with my fourth graders was to make sure they were fluent with their multiplication and division facts.  My definition of fluency was synonymous with fast.  To me fast = fluent.  To ensure my students all had \"fluency\" with their multiplication and division facts, we had daily timed tests which some kids loved and others dreaded.  We used a boxed program that was on my self when I started teaching.  As much as I thought I was doing the right thing, there were a few things that bothered me about this process.  There were a few kids who were very proficient mathematicians who just were not doing well with these timed tests.  I also had some kids who were doing really well with the timed tests yet they were really struggling to multiply larger numbers.  After more and more of these concerns popped up over several years, I started doing some more research into what exactly fluency meant.  I stumbled upon the work of Catherine Fosont and read her Young Mathematicians at Work series.  I learned about models for multiplication, using equal groups, arrays and the open area model.  I learned about helping kids develop strategies for multiplication facts.  Strategies based in understanding and the properties of multiplication. Strategies that will help kids develop number sense.  I still focus on fluency with multiplication facts in fourth grade but fluency has a completely different meaning to me now.  The way I work on fluency now does not involve timed tests.  It does not involve kids being anxious or feeling unsuccessful at math.  Instead I focus on developing number sense which helps kids learn and remember strategies that make them fluent with their multiplication facts.  To the untrained eye, it often appears as if my fourth graders have memorized their facts when they actually know their facts from memory. This short video does a great job of explaining the difference I am talking about:How do you think about or teach fact fluency? Please share your ideas in the comments below!Looking for more?! A reader asked some great questions about this post and I answered her question and followed up with more thoughts on fact fluency in this post!"},

The reflection I enjoy the most is the time at the end of a unit or a semester or school year when we have time to look a little more in depth at progress.  This is often when we will do some writing or comparing work from the beginning and end of a unit.  This is the deep reflection that makes all of my students feel like they are really learning.  It really helps to make their learning personal.  It also really helps with setting goals in an authentic way.I love the reflection prompts printed on pages 162 & 163 in the book.  I think these would be well worth posting in my classroom to help us bring our reflecting to the next level.  I don't often do quick written reflections but with the questions and sentence frames presented here, I think I could get some valuable information from my students without adding a lot of time or stress to our day.Thanks for following along as I read this great book!  Please share your thoughts about sharing and reflecting in the comments below!"},
{"title": "Math Workshop: Mini-Lessons and Worktime", "date": "Saturday, April 23, 2016", "text": "TweetWelcome to week 4 of our Minds on Mathematics book study.  If you missed them you can go back and read Understanding Takes Time and Shallow Versus Deep Math or Starting Class. This week are going to take a deeper look at the mini-lesson portion of math workshop and talk about what work time looks and sounds like. Mini-LessonsMini-lessons during math workshop should be- Short and focused (under 10 minutes)- Whole group instruction- Goal is fostering independence\"The more I explained the less my students seemed to understand.  The more sample problems I did for them, the sleepier they appeared.\" (Hoffer page 103)This quote from the book perfectly sums up my past experience with teaching rather than listening. As I have shifted my practice from that of an expert giving out knowledge to that of a facilitator helping kids build their knowledge, this quote is no longer true.  Many of the ideas presented in this chapter were ones that I have been comfortable with for the past few years.  My mini-lessons look a lot like these.  As I read, I kept coming back to modeling thinking as something I really wanted to work on. My Own Experience with Modeling Thinking I immediately thought of my second graders and solving multi-step problems.  We are finishing the year up with more practice adding and subtracting 2 and 3 digit numbers and I wanted them to get the chance to practice these important skills while working on solving problems that involve more than one step.  I find that with second graders, story problems can be tricky because there are a lot of words on the page for those who are struggling readers.  I decided to use modeling thinking to help these kids out with multi-step problems.In the spirit of keeping my mini-lesson mini, I presented one problem to students.  It was: Jonathan had 172 baseball cards.  He spilled his drink on part of his collection and had to throw away 58 of his cards.  For his birthday, his friends decided to surprise him with 75 new cards.  How many baseball cards does Jonathan have now?I put the problem on the screen and had a student read the entire thing.  I then thought aloud about how overwhelmed I was with trying to figure out what happened to Jonathan and what I was supposed to do.  I decided aloud to tackle the problem one sentence at a time and to stop and think after reading each sentence.  I switched to a new slide on my screen that had one line come up at a time.  After reading each line, I stopped and thought aloud about what I knew.  I would then reveal the next line and repeat.  I did much of the thinking aloud but also had some students contribute to my think aloud.When the problem was solved, kids shared what I did to make a challenging problem easier.  Then I sent them to work with a partner on 2 additional multi-step problems involving some combination of addition and subtraction.  They did an amazing job and really focused on what strategies made it easier. They finished by writing their own multi-step problems. Tomorrow I will start class with a think aloud on one of their problems and then they will pair up again and solve another few examples.  Work TimeThe postulate and question of the day at the beginning of this chapter really helped me think through the big ideas about work time.How can we facilitate thoughtful and productive work time for math learners?\" Facilitating thoughtful and productive work time for math learners is something I have worked hard at developing over the past five years.  I think this is a strength in my classroom and in my school.  My challenge for next school year will be to make this thoughtful and productive work time work in a multi-age setting.  With our declining enrollment over the past few years, we have had multi-age classrooms but have been separating kids by grade for math class.  Next school year it is my goal to work with teachers to build capacity for truly multi-aging.  I think it will be a fun challenge to see how we can structure thoughtful and productive work time for such a diverse group of math learners.  \"Students learn most when they spend math work time thinking, talking, and making meaning of mathematics for themselves.\"This quote sums up my teaching philosophy in one neat sentence.  To me, this is where the fun and the learning of mathematics takes place.  I know in my own education the math classes where I did the most talking were also the ones I did the most thinking and the ones where I finally had a chance to construct the meaning of mathematics for myself.  This nicely summarizes the constructivist ideas around learning and is what I strive to do each and every day in my classroom.  \"pages of mindless computation do not foster the construction of new knowledge. Learners need the opportunity to collect, generate, and frame their own problems and inquiries. The learner must be in the drivers seat.\" (Hoffer, p. 116)This used to be so challenging for me.  I was very afraid that giving up the drivers seat meant giving up control of the situation and of my class.  It took years of seeing how other teachers managed their classrooms and employing the best management strategies before I was able to step back and really let my students be in charge of their own learning.  It is my goal to give the illusion of the classroom running itself.  I have high expectations for behavior and being on task and I am not afraid to spend the extra time making sure the backbone of classroom management is there.  Without excellent management skills, you can never be an excellent math teacher.  Join us next week for the final installment of the Minds on Mathematics Book Study!"},

Welcome LearnersIf you are teaching a self contained classroom, this is your chance to make a transition to math class.   You might play a math song, check out a math you tube video, have kids share a favorite memory of math class or have some way to get kids pumped up that math is about to start.  If your students switch rooms for math and this is the first time you are seeing those students that day, this is your chance to greet kids at the door and work on making those connections with students.  It is your chance to work on developing community.   Activate Prior Knowledge with an Opening ExerciseWhat do your students already know that can help them with the day's problems?  How can you ask questions in such a way that students are engaged and feeling capable?  You are trying to convey that students already know some thing that can help them and that they are capable of being successful mathematicians.  \"Offer students problems that invite challenge by choice; Let the first question be something everyone will likely know, followed by questions of increasing complexity that may feed into one one another, reminding learners of the concepts behind the mathematics.\"  I love how the book presents these tiered openings and it is definitely one of my goals to be more intentional with choosing questions like these for my openings. The other way to activate student knowledge is by having them consider a concept.  They might write everything they know about division or provide examples of vocabulary words that are likely to come up during the day's problem.  My struggle with the opening of math class is always making sure it doesn't take more time than I allotted or take over the class entirely.  This is something I am still working on.  Learners Setting Purpose for this LessonThis is more than just writing your learning target on the board and having students read it.  It is about having students set goals for themselves.  What are they good at? What do they need to work on?  It might involve the topic for the day such as fraction division or it might involved one of the math practices such as attending to precisionManaging HomeworkI have stuck to my resolution this year and not given any homework.  This is a decision I am quite happy with and have no plans to return to giving homework.  If you do give homework and want to work it into your opening, the author offers several suggestions.  Your turn!  How do you open your math class each day?  What are the essential components for you?  How do you make sure your opening doesn't take over the entire class?  Please respond in the comments below.Join us next week as we look at the mini lesson and work time in our Minds on Mathematics book study."},

{"title": "Understanding Takes Time", "date": "Saturday, April 2, 2016", "text": "TweetI know math workshop is for me!  Why?  Because I share these beliefs:1) Students Are Capable of Brilliance2) Understanding Takes Time3) There is More Than One WayWelcome to part 1 of our Minds-On Math Workshop bookstudy.  Here are some of my thoughts from this week! Students Are Capable of Brilliance     My best teaching friend and Kindergarten teacher extraordinaire has this as her mantra.  Her students constantly outperform other Kindergarten students in the district and she is always being asked to share her secret.  Her #1 reason her kids do so well is because she holds them to very high standards.  She truly believes that all kids can learn and in many ways their teacher's attitude about their learning becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Her students learn because she believes they can.  ALL OF THEM.      Every time I feel like giving up on a kid and just \"Teaching him how to do it\" (aka arithmetic without understanding) I remember my friend and how beliefs become her students.  All students can learn and we need to keep expectations high for our students.Understanding Takes Time     You can \"teach\" your students the standard algorithm for subtraction in ten minutes and have them practice it for an hour.  It will look like your students understand subtraction.  Next week or next month you will give them three subtraction problems and they will tell  you that they forgot how to subtract.   Worse yet, they might not tell you that.  They might keep missing a step in the procedure or do a step wrong repeatedly.  Now they are in a position where they think they know how to subtract and they have no idea all their answers are wrong. They don't know how to tell if an answer is reasonable because you didn't \"teach\" them how.     Alternatively, you can spend an hour per day for three weeks guiding your students to develop flexible and efficient strategies and giving them opportunities to share these ideas with their classmates.  They will also have a chance to hear their classmates ideas and compare how they are similar or different from their own.  In the process of doing this, they will strengthen their understanding of addition, place value, estimation and inverse relationships.  Next week or next month, you will give them three subtraction problems.  They will solve them all mentally applying a strategy that is efficient for the numbers in each problem.  They may or may not use the same strategy for all three problems.     The example above illustrates the difference between telling and guiding.  With telling, you are doing most of the talking and learning.  Sure it is faster but your students will lack understanding.  Guiding students to develop and refine strategies takes much more time upfront.  The students do most of the talking, and you get through fewer problems during a class period.   You might in fact spend 20 minutes talking about one problem.  It takes time but it also develops understanding.  Understanding is what will be there for your students next week and next month.  For me, it is worth the investment of time to produce understanding.There is More Than One Way     This is one I learned from my students.  There is one student in particular who I will always remember helping me see a new way to look at subtraction.  I was taught that there was one way to solve each math problem and it has taken me years of teaching and learning to undo that thought.  \"With faith that each child, given time, has an innate ability to reason out a solution to a problem, even if their initial approach and strategy may differ from how we believe things \"ought\" to be done, we can begin to turn over the responsibility for learning mathematics to our students.\" This quote from the book really resonated this change for me and helped me see how my thinking has changed since I started my teaching career.  I know embrace multiple strategies and love that my second graders can currently solve a problem like 17-9 using six different strategies.  Most of them are very efficient and none of them involve counting! Do you share these beliefs?  How has your own experience in the classroom enhanced or changed your beliefs?

{"title": "Why Don't We Get Math? ", "date": "Sunday, March 27, 2016", "text": "Tweet     We are less than a week away from the launch of our new book study of Minds on Mathematics.  I had a few minutes today to dig into the book and wanted to share some of my thoughts about the introduction.  Why Don't We Get Math?-Cultural: It's Okay Not to Get It   This is the one I see the most in my school and in my life.  I see over and over again an acceptance among adults that math is hard and it is okay not to get it.  I know of several well educated adults who almost brag that their fifth grader does math they don't understand.  I have never heard a well educated adult bragging that they couldn't read at a fifth grade level.  As the author states, \"this social acceptance of mathematical illiteracy is a huge barrier to our children's progress and preparation for life beyond our classrooms.\" - Pedagogical: Math is Memorizing    When I was in elementary school math was all about memorizing.  The parents of my students are very much in the same place.  For some of us, memorizing worked.  For others it didn't even come close.  No matter where parents fall on this spectrum, most parents believe that math is memorizing.  They want to help when their student is struggling but their idea of helping is to remind kids of the steps to a procedure.  - Individual: Math Ability is Innate    This is true even in my own family.  I remember being good at math from an early age and my Mom always being surprised and wondering where my math ability came from.  More than any other subject in school, people seem to have this idea that math skills are inherited or passed down genetically.  This is where the excellent research on growth versus fixed mindset can really help understand how ability is the product of effort.  Minds-On Math WorkshopsMinds on math workshop aims to challenge these beliefs and provide students with a \"learning experience in which students are challenged to grapple with their thinking and understanding about math in light of new information and challenges, to make meaning for themselves.\" Minds on math workshop is about leaving behind decontextualized arithmetic and giving the kids a change to construct meaning for themselves.After reading the introduction, I can see this book aligns well with what I am already doing and the things I have experienced as a math teacher over the past 10 years.  I am excited to read more and further refine my teaching practice!  Want to join me?

{"title": "Fluency with Comparing Fractions", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2016", "text": "Tweet   I spend a lot of time in grades 3-5 working on developing strategies for comparing fractions.  I have written before about the 5 strategies my students use to compare fractions.  I also shared my favorite free computer game for kids who are working on fluency with comparing simple fractions.  Today I was working with an intervention group of fifth graders and had a few minutes at the end of our session.  I knew that I needed something quick and fun so I grabbed my regular old deck of playing cards.     We split the deck and each flipped two cards and made a fraction.  The first card flipped became the numerator and the second card the denominator.  This allowed us to make all kinds of fractions.   The person with the largest fraction won all of the cards.  Some of our fractions were less than one, some were equal to one and some were more than 1.  It was a great way for students to practice comparing fractions.  Out of the 5 strategies for comparing fractions, I saw students use comparing to a benchmark most frequently during this game.  It was a great way to reinforce the idea of one half, one whole and improper fractions.  I also saw students using common numerators to compare fractions and quite a bit of unit fraction reasoning.  My favorite use of unit fraction reasoning was when a student used the idea of unit fractions and the distance from one to compare 10/11 and 11/12.  \"They are both missing one piece.  11/12 is missing 1/12 and 10/11 is missing 1/11.  Since 11/12 is missing a smaller piece, it is greater.\"              After a bit, we changed up the game and had each person flip 2 cards, use their smallest card as the numerator and their largest card as the denominator.  This made all our fractions less than or equal to one.  It made it so that the fractions were a bit closer together and required more critical thinking.  After a few minutes playing that way, we reversed it and had folks put their higher card as the numerator and the lower one as the denominator.  This was a great way to really reinforce the improper fraction, mixed number connection.  This entire game took under 10 minutes and was a great way to reinforce some big fraction ideas!  I love how it requires no prep and is easy to differentiate!  By pulling out some of the cards in the deck, I could make this game based on friendlier fractions which would be great for third and fourth graders.

Grab these directions from Google Drive.Two of my groups had 3 kids in them and one group had 4 kids.  I gave the groups with 3 kids 45 jelly beans and the group with 4 kids 60 jelly beans.  I have really been working on independence with these kids and tried my best to step back and observe and not take over!  I saw so many things that made my math heart happy!Kids organizing and recording estimatesOne group organized all their beans by color and then decided it would be much more efficient to put them in groups of 10.  The other groups went for groups of 10 from the get go. When each group had figured out how much they had, it was quite easy for them to figure out how much they were off by.  These kids are so flexible and fluent with double digit subtraction! Dividing the jelly beans equally between each group member was fun to watch.  Each group started by giving everyone 10.  Two of the groups were convinced that there would be a leftover bean that would have to be cut up.  The rationale was that because 15 is odd, there will be a leftover.  They were surprised to find that there was none left!  The main strategy for sharing out the beans was to give each person 10 and then share them out 1 by 1 until they were gone.This part took a total of 14 minutes (including a few minutes of eating the beans!)Then I pulled the group together and had each group share out how many beans their group got and how many each person ended up with.  There was some outcry over one group getting 60, but it provoked an interesting discussion about how each kid ended up with 15.I then presented them with this problem.\"There are 10 second graders in this room and I gave you each 15 jelly beans.  How many jelly beans did I give out?\"  I gave kids a minute to think at the circle then sent them off to grab a white board and show me what they knew.  I chose this problem because last winter when I was reading Children's Mathematics I became very intentional about making sure kids have the chance to solve Base 10 Story Problems.  Since 10 kids were in this group, I thought it would be interesting to see who used base 10 knowledge to solve this problem.  I gave out 10 groups of 15 but some kids used the idea of that being the same as 15 groups of 10.  This student used base 10 knowledge to solve the problem (and the distributive property!)Another student who used base 10 knowledgeThis student added 45+45+60.  They used the number of jelly beans each group had.Total time for this was 25 minutes.  We had a lot of fun, the kids got some good practice and I got to learn some new things about what strategies my students have.  How are you working on estimating and counting in your classroom?  Want to try this out?  Grab the directions from Google Drive!"},
{"title": "100th Day Fun!", "date": "Monday, February 8, 2016", "text": "TweetToday was our 100th day of school!  It was a busy day and I am exhausted!  Here are few of the things we did:100th Day Bulletin BoardI saw this idea in my son's school and instantly loved it!  Our 100th day is always around Valentines day so having kids think of 100 reasons we love our school was perfect.  I cut 100 hearts out of pink paper and glued them to a piece of chart paper.  We passed it around the school and had kids and adults write reasons they love our school.  I will definitely be doing this again next year but I will be using heart shaped post-it notes because I won't have to cut anything out and they will be a bit bigger.  The hearts were a bit on the smaller size for something I wanted to make a bulletin board out of and kids could really only fit one word.   Here were a few of my favorites math, feeling of community, caring teachers, amazing students, respect, safety, creativity and honesty.  100th Day SwagThe primary teachers in my building are great about making 100th day hats and glasses and such with their students but I find kids of all ages love 100th day swag.  I made these fun 100th day ties and bracelets with my older students.  I myself supported a 100th day tie, several bracelets, my 100th day pin a 100th day crown and a pair of 100th day glasses that my son made with his class and let me borrow.  There is nothing like a bit of swag to make it feel like a holiday. 100 EquationsOver the years with my grade 3-6 students we have celebrated the 100th day by writing 100 equations in whatever area we have been working on.  This year I made it more official and dressed it up with some cute clip art.  My grade 4 kids just learned the traditional algorithm for subtraction so they rolled dice to create 100 three and four digit subtraction problems.  The fifth graders just finished a unit on adding and subtracting fractions so they did some dice rolling to generate and solve 100 fraction addition and subtraction problems.  We took all 100 problems and organized them on chart paper to make a display to share in the gym. I love this idea because you can do it with any grade and with any topic.  A great way to celelbrate the 100th day and still work on your current unit.  You can grab my printables from Google drive here. 100th Day of School WorkoutI found this little routine on You Tube when I was looking for a 100th day book.  We have been working on adding more movement breaks into our day and it was fun to have a special one for the 100th day.  If you want to jump right into the workout, skip to the 2:10 mark.  We watched the whole thing through once and then did it a few more times throughout the day starting from 2:10.LiteratureI pulled out a lot of my favorite 100th day books to read to various grades today.  Here are a few of the books that were being read around our building today.What a fun day!  What is your favorite way to celebrate the 100th day?"},
{"title": "Hands on Fraction Fun", "date": "Saturday, January 23, 2016", "text": "TweetComing into this school year, I knew that the thing my fourth graders struggled with most last year was fractions.  I remember chatting with the teacher they had for third grade math about their strengths and needs and fractions came up over and over again.  After reading Beyond Pizzas & Pies and Beyond Invert and Multiply this past summer I had plenty of new ideas and lessons to try out but I still hadn't quite figured how I wanted to kick off this unit.  This class in particular has a huge span of ability levels and experiences and I wanted everyone to be able to access this first lesson without it being to easy for half the class.  I also wanted to provide them with a hands on experience using fractions in their world.I decided to have them in mixed ability groups exploring some fraction manipulatives.  I put a manipulative at each table along with a large piece of chart paper and a variety of markers.  Their task was to explore the materials and write down anything they noticed.  I had 4 stations each with different manipulatives.  We used fraction bars, fraction circles, cuisinare rods and measuring cups and spoons.  I borrowed the sand table from Kindergarten and threw in a variety of measuring cups and spoons. Most of these I found this past summer at the Dollar Tree.  The dark orange cups are a set of ancient Tupperware cups which I LOVE because they have a 2/3 and a 3/4 cup.  These were so great for kids to use to explore non-unit fractions.  Kids spent lots of time filling and ordering cups.  They also liked filling and organizing the spoons.  Because the sets included 1/2 cup, 1/2 tsp and 1/2 Tbsp kids were also able to explore the idea that the size of 1/2 can change based on the whole changing.  \\As students made discoveries, I had them jot them down on chart paper.  This was a great way to record what they had discovered to share with the other students at the end of class.  We also went back to this chart paper part way through the unit to review some ideas.   Each group had about 12 minutes at each station.  We spent the last 15 minutes of class having each student share something they learned.  We posted all the chart papers and refereed back to them as our unit progressed.  I was able to keep the sand table for the first 2 weeks of the unit and several times I had kids (especially those in my intervention group) go back to the sand table to explore something specific around the ideas we were learning.  If you have the chance, I highly recommend starting off your fraction unit with this kind of hands on exploration.  Even if you don't have access to a sand table, putting some measuring cups and spoons in a bucket of rice or a bowl of water would also give kids a similar experience.Looking for more ideas for teaching fractions?

{"title": "Announcing Movin' It Math!", "date": "Sunday, November 8, 2015", "text": "TweetAbout 6 years ago, I came up with a game to get my students up and moving around during math class. I called it Movin' It Math and made many versions on index cards. As the years have passed and beautiful clip art and desktop publishing has gotten easier, my cards have migrated to computer generated. Over the last 11 months, I have been working on getting them in a shareable format. This weekend after many hours of putting final touches on, I have released my first 4 sets. Each set includes 40 cards, directions for Movin' It Math and 10 other activities you can use these cards for. These cards are the ones I find myself using over and over again.  We have been using them everyday in K and many days at the beginning of grade 1! I have many more versions of Movin' It Math that are sitting as files on my computer waiting for finishing touches.  This game as spanned my classes K-6.  I have cards for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding fractors, fractions, classifying 2-D and 3-D shapes, classifying angles, geometry terms and more.  I am excited to share these with you in the coming weeks.  Here is a peek at the rules of the game and how I have been using these cards with K&1 students over the past 2 months.  My first grade students are pretty fluent with these numbers now but I see many more months of great activities for K kids as they transition from learning numbers 1-10 to learning numbers 11-20Movin' It Math!The CallerThis game is a fun way to practice math for a wholeclass.  Before playing this game, youwill want to make sure your students are familiar with these cards.  There are 40 cards in each set.  Use the representations your students aremost familiar with.  You will  need one less card than the number of kidswho are playing this game.  Poly spotsare VERY handy for playing this game  butnot required.  If you have poly spots,have kids stand with their toes on the edge of the spot but not covering thecard.  If you do not have poly spots,have kids stand with one foot on either side of the card.  You will need the small numeral cards forthis game.  Cut the numeral cards apartand put them in a container that your students can put their hands into.  Toes on SpotTo play the game, choose one kid to be the caller.  This kid stands by the bucket with the smallcards in it.  The rest of the kids gofind a spot and put their toes on it. When kids get to a spot, have them figure out what their card is (andkeep it to themselves).  The callerreaches into the bucket, pulls out a card and says the number loudly.  If a kid is on a spot with the number thatwas called, they are SAFE and don’t move. Everyone else has to move to a new spot. The caller also goes and takes any spot. One kid will be left without a spot. This kid is the caller for the next round.  They go to the bucket, pull out another ofthe small numeral cards and say that number loudly.  Anyone who has that number on their card isSAFE and doesn’t move.  The rest of thekids need to move to a new spot and figure out what number is on their newspot.  The caller also takes a spot.   The caller is continuously changing witheach round.   You can keep playing roundsin this way until your students have had enough.  There is no winner or end to this game. If you don't have spots....There are many ways to adapt this game to fit the sizeof your class.  I have also used it witha small group but find it most successful when there are at least 5 kids.  When kids are new to this game, especially ifthey are young or have a hard time listening to directions, I will teach themthe game in a group of 5 or so kids and we will play as a whole group afterkids have had some experience on a smaller scale.  If you find your kids are not moving around trying tofind another spot because they all want to be the caller, you can adapt thisgame by having all kids have a spot and being the caller yourself.  This works really well for some groups ofkids.  You can also use call sticks topick a caller for each round.Take it outside!This game can work in the classroom if you have someopen space but works really well in a gymnasium or a large open space.  This game is also great to play outside!  If you are playing it outside, having thepoly spots makes it much easier.  Itkeeps the cards from getting muddy/dirty and a little piece of tape between thecard and the spot and the wind isn’t a problem. If you are doing it outside without poly spots, make sure there isn’tany wind! Once kids are familiar with this game, you can switchout the cards for more challenging ones as the year goes on.  To see all the Movin’ it Math cards available, clickhere.  (At this time, I am just getting started posting these so more will become available each week!)The Cards That Keep GoingWhen I first started out, I had one way to use these cards.  I quickly learned that if only used each set of cards I made one way, I would be spending a lot of time making cards.  Because of this, these cards have evolved into something I use over and over again. In the following pictures, I will share with you some of the other ways I use these cards. FlashA great way to work on subitizing!Go FishA game that is easy to teach and valuable to know!  Any 2 cards that represent the same number can be a pair!CompareA fun way to introduce and practice using the <, > and = symbols.  We like to play with the rule that whoever has less gets to keep both cards!PyramidI spent hours when I was in sixth grade playing the solitaire card game pyramid 13.  In this version of pyramid, we find pairs of cards that represent the same number.  Flip and TallyThis years' first grade group is crazy for tallying and keeping track.  I made up this little workstation as a great way to incorporate that.  I tried it out with some K kids this week and it was a bit challenging for some but we are working on it!Sorting CardsThis is simple but kids seem to really like it.  We pull out the numeral cards, work together to put them in order across the top of a table or in the first row of a pocket chart.  Then we pass out all the cards and kids put them where they belong.  Then we take a few minutes to look at the cards as a group and fix any that are wrong.  If you take some of the cards out of the deck, this activity can lead to a nice introduction to ideas about graphing. Find a ____This is my adapted version of Movin' It Math that I like to play with my intervention groups.  I put out some dots and some cards and ask kids to find a number.  After each kid is on a representation of that number, I ask them to find another one.  It is a great way to get a small group moving! When it is pick up time, I have each kid pick up all the representations of a given number. Each Movin' It Math resource includes more ways we use these cards in the classroom and much more detail about how to play each of the games above.Here are the 4 sets released so far!Want all 4 sets?  Click on the picture below to check out the money saving bundle!"},
{"title": "Conference Time!", "date": "Tuesday, October 13, 2015", "text": "TweetWe are 7 weeks into the school year and gearing up for parent teacher conferences later this week.  In our school, we try to schedule all conferences on a Thursday evening or Friday morning.  This way if multiple folks need to be involved in the conference, we are all in the building at the same time. The evening hours also work much better for parents.  As the math specialist I get invited to attend the difficult conferences.  If a student is behind or in some cases very ahead of their peers, I will often be asked to join the conference.  Classroom teachers also invite me when they know parents have specific concerns or when it is a student I have a lot of contact with.  Sometimes I am asked to sit in on a conference because the parents are very difficult or have expressed opinions about their students math learning that do not show understanding of how or why we are teaching math as we do.  Depending on the reason for the conference and what the concerns are, I have many approaches but here are a few things I always do in conference situations.- I like to start on a positive note by sharing a recent piece of student work that illustrates something they can do well or something that shows how far they have come.  Because I do so much formative assessment, I have a lot of student work samples available to choose from and can always find something positive.- I then like to have parents share how they think their child is doing and any concerns they have.- I am all about data driven decision making so then I will share any assessments.  For primary students this often includes individual interviews, especially if a student is behind.  I go over the current assessment results and show their progress over time if applicable. - I show other student work and point out specifically how the work illustrates them progressing or not progressing toward meeting the standard.  I also like to explain what the next steps are in terms of what we are working on next.- I prepare myself to answer the hard questions.  Why are you teaching it this way instead of that way?  These big questions parents have when they are new to my school or my way of thinking about math used to really challenge me.  As I have become more experienced and read more research on math education  I have been better prepared to answer these questions.  I like to show parents that it isn't MY way of teaching that I am going for but rather what the research says works.  - I focus on the big mathematical ideas for that grade.  For each grade level I can think of 3-5 things that are the most important things kids have and understand in order for them to be successful in the next grade.  If a student is behind, I focus the conference on the most important skills and make sure my discussion focuses on how to move a student forward with these big ideas.This year, in addition to my role as a math specialist (part interventionist and part coach), I have 2 groups of students that I am doing the primary math instruction for.  This means that I will hopefully get to meet with the parents of kids in these groups because their classroom teachers don't see them for math.  To help out with ones I might miss and to keep the classroom teachers up to speed on what their students are doing in math, I have been gathering data and putting together some things that can be shared with parents.  One of the things I created for my fourth grade group was this quick reflection on their learning.  I loved seeing their responses and it gave me great information about how they are feeling about math!Want to use this with your students?  Click on the picture to get it from Google Drive."},
{"title": "Formative Assessment for Combinations of 10", "date": "Tuesday, September 15, 2015", "text": "TweetThe school year is in full swing in my neck of the woods and we have been hard at work doing assessments, setting up groups and even getting some teaching in! My second graders have been looking at addition and subtraction strategies for facts to 20.  One of my top priorities for this unit is making sure kids are solid with combinations of 10 by the middle of the unit.  Without being solid with combinations of 10, some of the most efficient strategies for the facts between 10 and 20 are much more challenging for kids to develop.  We talk about the friends of 10 from the first day of the unit and incorporate games like make 10 go fish, flip and write, pyramid,  and popper cups.  My second graders are getting really good at these!  This morning, I was thinking they all seemed fluent but I wanted a quick way to check without another formal assessment. Today I was using One Big Pair of Underwear to introduce the difference model for subtraction.  Kids already had out white boards, makers and erasers.  As I was finishing up the whole group lesson and transitioning to math station and guided math groups, I had kids quickly write down as many of the friends of 10 that they could think of in 1 minute.  This let me see who was really fluent and to make sure there were not kids who were looking at other kids boards to get the answers.  For the most part, kids were very quick and the wandering eyes didn't happen until kids were done or close to it.  It was interesting to see which kids organized their equations and which kids wrote equations in a seemingly random way.  To finish this up and give kids one more chance to practice combinations of 10, we watched this Friends of 10 song and as each combination of 10 appeared on the screen, they erased that combination on their board.  This made them really pay attention to the song and gave them one more chance to practice.  I am so pleased with the progress my second graders have made in this area and am looking forward to seeing them use this skill to develop other strategies! How are your students doing with fact fluency? How are you doing at finishing up those beginning of the year assessments? Please respond in the comments below or head over to my Facebook page to leave your thoughts!"},

 Some studies have shown wait time in the average classroom is about 1.5 seconds.  Not a lot of thinking can happen that fast!  Being aware of your wait time and practicing it from the first day of school will make you and your students much  more comfortable and you will notice an increase in the number of participants.  You might also notice that taking a few extra seconds to think about what a student says before responding or hearing from another student will increase your awareness of what students understand and are able to do.  I personally aim for a wait time of 10 seconds.  Don't be afraid to watch the clock or count to yourself when you are first starting out!Re-voicingWhen you re-voice a students' idea, it give your students a chance to hear the idea again and the student who shared it a chance to clarify their thinking.  When you have students re-voice each other's ideas, you give them the opportunity to take another person's perspective and hold them accountable for listening to each other.  Re-voicing can also slow the conversation down a bit so that kids can focus on the big ideas and those who require more think time a chance to clarify their thoughts.  Room Set UpWhen you are setting up your room for the back to school season or rearranging it for a fresh outlook as the school year continues, think about the spaces your students will be in for math talk.  If you really want kids to be talking to each other, make sure the way your room is set up reflects this.  I like having options for kids to talk at tables as well as space on the floor where we can do our number talks and other math discussions.   If you are seeing that kids will answer questions and engage with you but not with each other, I highly recommend sitting kids in a circle and removing yourself to the outside of the circle to get things going.  Once kids are more used to talking to each other and not just talking to you, I don't find this as necessary but it really helps when they are first starting out.  Also, remember to think about your wait time.  Kids will never have a chance to respond to other students if you are always jumping right in with a comment!Pair Share If I had to pick a favorite strategy for getting kids talking about math, pair sharing would be my number one.  Giving kids a chance to talk to one or two other kids about how they solved a problem or what they were thinking gives them a chance to rehearse sharing their ideas and refine their plan for sharing their strategy.  Pair share can also help kids practice listening to another person's ideas and comparing them to their own.  I also like to hold kids accountable for listening to others so I often have them share their partner's strategy instead of their own when we come back to a whole group discussion.Provide Focus VocabularyOne of the reasons you want kids talking about math is to get them extra practice using math vocabulary.  I like using vocab cards to help kids focus on new words.  I will often use a magnet to attach focus words to the white board when we are discussing them.  If you are looking for vocabulary cards for grades K-8, check out this awesome (and free!) resource.  My vocabulary cards have the word and picture on the front and we write the definition on the back as a class.  That way it is in their words but it is there if they need it.  I hope these ideas will help you get started setting up math talk in your classroom.  If you are looking for further reading on this subject, you should check out Talk Moves: a Teacher's Guide for Using Classroom Discussion in Math.  This book is full of ideas for getting kids talking across all kinds of math settings.  Great for grades K-6.  It also includes a DVD with video clips so you can see many of the ideas in action.  Head over to The Research Based Classroom to check out more ideas for setting up your math class for back to school!"},

I encourage all teachers to take a good look at their curriculum and see what problem types are not being represented.  Make sure your fraction multiplication and division units contain a diverse group of problems!Chapter 6 Making Sense: Multiplication with Fractions This chapter got me excited for teaching fractions this fall!  I know I will be working with an intervention group of sixth graders right off this fall and there were so many ideas in here that made me think about this group.  I still have 31 days before I am due back at school but this book is really making me think about heading back!I loved the term \"constructive struggling\" used at the beginning of the chapter.  Apparently this term is used in the book Faster Isn't Smarter which looks like a book I will definitely have to check out!  I have seen some of students' best ideas come from constructive struggling yet it can be so hard for teachers to let kids struggle.  I used to be that teacher who couldn't stand to see kids struggle and would jump in way to soon.  This is something I worked on with peer conferencing a few years back and I still like to check in with colleagues when we are co-teaching about when we should jump in and when we should leave kids with a little disequilibrium.  The research around how kids learn fraction multiplication always interests me and it seems each time I read a new fraction book, I get a new take on how to teach it better.  I really liked the ideas presented about teaching fraction multiplication (and multiplication in general) from a measurement standpoint.  I always struggle to help kids understand how finding a fraction of a fraction translates to multiplication because I have never been able to connect it to whole number multiplication.  On page 9, this paragraph made me stop in my tracks: \"Given the problem 4 X 3, if one considers a multi-unit length of 4, iterated three times or a multi-unit length of 3 iterated four times, one arrives at 12.  This could be thought of as \"four iterations of length 3\" or \"three iterations of length 4\" or the shorter \"four of 3\" or \"three of 4.\"\" There is my example of how the word of can be used in whole number multiplication.  Right there!  I can't wait to see how this will help me this year!Next week we will be wrapping up this book study and I will be getting busy preparing for back to school!  Look for a lot more blog posts again in August as I tackle the beginning of the year things and get back to teaching!"},
{"title": "Beyond Invert and Multiply Book Study Part 2", "date": "Wednesday, July 15, 2015", "text": "TweetWelcome to week 2 of our Beyond Invert and Multiply book study!  Last week, we looked at some research around fractions and dove into the 12 different problem types for addition and subtraction word problems.  This week we will be taking a closer look at fraction addition and subtraction.  Here is the posting schedule. July 8th Part 1: What is a Fraction?July 15th Part 2: Addition and Subtraction with FractionsJuly 22nd Part 3: Multiplication and Division with FractionsJuly 29th Part 4: Discourse with FractionsChapter 3: Making Sense: Addition with FractionsFraction addition used to be my enemy.  I remember struggling with fraction addition more than I struggled with any other topic in elementary school math.  I learned it in such a rote and procedural way and it didn't make a lot of sense to me.  Now when I think back to that experience and I read some of the research on fraction addition, I see myself in the classic cases of how not to teach fractions.  I was that kid who really didn't know what estimating was or how to do it and I had no sense of the magnitude of fractions.  In elementary school I would have really struggled with the problem they presented on page 42; \"Estimate the answer to 12/13 + 7/8.  You will not have time to solve the problem using pencil and paper.\"   This is presented in a multiple choice format with the choices being 1, 2, 19, 21 and I don't know.  I would have been in the 76% of kids who could not answer this question correctly.So how do I keep my students from following in my footsteps?  First I make sure they have a strong foundation in part to whole reasoning, equivalence and magnitude.  If they are not there yet with these foundational ideas about fractions, I give pull them for booster groups, do additional whole class lessons or meet with them during Guided Math time.  If you are looking for ideas for helping kids develop these foundational understandings, check out Beyond Pizzas and Pies or A Focus on Fractions. It struck me when reading this chapter how similar fraction addition is to whole number addition.  We often treat it as a brand new topic but I think we miss out on connecting it to what kids already know about whole number addition.  The properties all still hold true and some of the strategies kids developed when learning basic addition can also help them when learning fraction addition.  I feel like the idea of decomposing numbers to make friendly tens and hundreds is something we are doing very well at my school.  However, I don't think that we are using this skill quite as well with fractions.  The video clips from lesson 3.4 really opened my mind to some new ideas to try this year.My other big take away from this chapter was activity 3.6.  As someone who was terrible at estimating and didn't really get it, this activity would have really helped me out.  I also like that it could be used for any operation with any number.  This is definitely a routine that is getting added to my math classes.  This is the activity where you give students a problem and have them tell you all they can about the answer.  I particularly liked the sentence starters for those students who are stuck:The answer will be more than ______ because _________The answer will be less than ______  because _________The answer will be between _______ and ________ because ________Chapter 4 Making Sense: Subtraction with FractionsThis chapter really got me thinking about the mistakes kids make when subtracting fractions.  It seems like it as the inverse of addition, subtraction should be very similar but it always seems to trip up a lot more kids.  Here are examples of some of the most common mistakes for fraction subtraction. Seeing the numerators and denominators as separate whole numbers and subtracting across both of them.  Finding a common denominator but not making the corresponding change to the numerator.When presented with mixed number subtraction, ignoring the fractional part and just subtracting the whole numbers or vice versa. For a problem where the minuend is a whole number and the subtrahend is a fraction, thinking the whole number has the same denominator as the fraction.The borrowing issues! On the left the student does 4 - 2 but then ignores the fact that is should be 2/4 - 3/4 and switches them around.  On the right, the student borrows a whole and turns it into 10/4. Context problems!  When writing word problems, there is a thin line between a fraction subtraction a fraction multiplication problem.  I like to give my students this little printable pictured below, have them cut the stories apart on the thin black lines and have them sort them according to which operation they could use to solve them.  Many students think they are the same at first glance.  Look closely!  A few words changed make for a big difference in the operation and approach for solving the problem.  If you want to try these with your students, you can grab them from Google Drive.  Grab this freebie here!  What mistakes do you see students making with fraction subtraction?  Leave your response in the comments section below or head over to my Facebook page and let us know what you think!"},
{"title": "Beyond Invert and Multiply Book Study Part 1", "date": "Wednesday, July 8, 2015", "text": "TweetWelcome to the first installment of our Beyond Invert and Multiply book study.  You can order this book at Math Solutions or on Amazon.  There is a great video introduction to this book here if you want to learn more about it.  This book is written about fraction operations and is a follow up to Beyond Pizza and Pies.  I have received several emails and Facebook messages from folks asking which book they should get if they have to pick just one.  My answer to that is that if you teach grades 2-3, go with Beyond Pizzas and Pies.  If you teach grades 4 and up you REALLY should have both.  If your students lack the foundation knowledge covered in Beyond Pizzas and Pies, many of the activities suggested in Beyond Invert and Multiply will be a struggle for your students.  Chapter 1: Fractions As NumbersI love the way this chapter starts off with the classroom scenario of the human number line.  This is a great way to introduce kids to big ideas about number lines and doing it in a big way like this makes it very memorable.  I feel like kids really get the idea of equal spacing when doing a human number line and I think this is a great way to review what number lines are before moving into working with fractions on a number line.The chapter lays out these 5 foundational understandings about fractions that kids need in order to compute with understanding.  These are the things that you will find your students tripping up on when learning fraction operations.  These are the things that are worth devoting some class time to before jumping into fraction operations.  They are all big conceptual ideas and together form the foundation for fraction understanding. Fractions are numbers and follow the same rules and properties as other rational numbers. The unit fraction is the building block of fractions.Fractions can be decomposed and recomposed in infinite ways.Equivalent fractions represent different ways of naming the same value.All rational numbers can be expressed as fractions in the form a/b, where b does not equal 0. The other thing that really struck me in this chapter was how important number lines are.  Over and over again you see how they can help kids see fractions as numbers.  The activities and DVD clips in this section do such a great job capturing the power of the number line.  It is hard to believe that less than 10 years ago, I had never used a number line for fractions in my own mathematics or with my students.  Chapter 2: Addition and Subtraction with FractionsThis chapter dives headfirst into the research on problem types for addition and subtraction word problems.  These problem types are used with whole numbers and should also be used with fractions. If you use the Common Core for your standards, these problem types are detailed in the glossary.  I wish this table was right in the standards themselves because many people miss it.  I have included a snapshot below!  If it is out of focus or hard for you to read, you can click here to see a better copy.  If your students have never experienced these problems with whole numbers, I would be hesitant to introduce them with fractions.  I think it is worth the time to go back and do some of these problem types with whole numbers before expecting kids to do them with fractions.  When my school first started paying attention to all the different problem types, we started with the primary students on single digits, moved up to double digit computation and then finally used the different problem types with fractions. Which problem type is this?  Feel free to peek at the table above! Grab these cards here:) How would your students do on this one?  Would they use subtraction or a missing addend? Which problem type is this? I think there is a lot of value in sitting down and writing some of each of the problem types for your students to use.  It can be challenging at first, but gets much easier with time.  If you want to explore some problems that have already been written, you can check these out!Addition and Subtraction FactsDouble Digit Addition and SubtractionFraction Addition and SubtractionThere was also a chapter on the different problem types in Children's Mathematics.  You can read my thoughts on that here!Your turn!  Please tell us how you are doing with fractions in the comments below and what you thought about this week's reading.  Has your school addressed the different problem types for addition and subtraction?  How are your students doing at developing the 5 foundational understandings for fractions?"},

Number Line ModelFractions are numbers and it just makes sense to think about them on a number line.  I love how the number line model leads to great questions about equality and the density of fractions (the idea that there are always more numbers between any two numbers). The power in these models is really using them all and moving between them flexibly.  As McNamara states, \"helping students understand the meaning of fractions in different contexts builds their understanding of the relevant features of different fraction representations and the relationships between them.\"I love the activities presented in this chapter and always try to make sure I have some version of 7.1 included in each grade that has a fraction unit.  The idea of connecting the math they are learning to the real world is so important and these kinds of lessons really help.  Lesson 7.3, where students write fraction problems that can be solved with various models looks great!  I have never done a lesson like this during the fraction unit and I think it would make a great addition.  I love how this book is helping me refine my plans for next year.Chapter 8 Comparing Fractions: Do You Always Need a Common Denominator? I think the only way I ever compared fractions in elementary school was with a common denominator.  Even when I began teaching, I really didn't have a good understanding of other ways kids (and adults!) might compare fractions.  As part of my journey to learn more about teaching math, I have read a lot about these ideas and now I have a good understanding about different strategies for comparing fractions.  I love presenting kids with various fraction activities and watching them develop and refine these strategies for themselves.  It is always so fun to watch!I was surprised by the \"What's the Research?\" section of this chapter.  It is amazing how few kids could estimate the answer to a fraction addition problem.  This is a problem I would love to take back to school with me in the fall and give to the sixth graders.  I think it would be a good way to check in with how we are doing as a school on our quest to teach kids how to think about math rather than just doing procedures.  I can't wait to read your thoughts on this week's book study!  Remember to come back next week for the second part of our summer focus on fractions.If you are looking for more ideas about teaching fractions, check out this blog hop on squishing fraction misconceptions!  Just click on the links at the bottom of each post."},

The posting schedule for Beyond Pizzas & Pies (all Wednesdays)June 10th Chapters 1&2June 17th Chapters 3&4June 24th Chapters 5&6July 1st Chapters 7&8Chapter 5: Is 1/2 Always Greater Than 1/3? \"Our research suggests that many students did not understand that, within a context, the size of the wholes must be determined before comparing fractional quantities.\" This quote from chapter 5 really sums up what I have seen over and over again with students and teachers. When I learned about fractions in elementary school, I can't recall a single time where we solved a problem about fractions where the wholes were not the same.  Even now, when companies send me various curriculum samples, many of them do not contain any problems in which the wholes can vary.  I think a lot of the issue with kids not understanding that the size of the wholes must be determined is that they don't get a chance to see a lot of problems where the size of the whole might vary.   If your curriculum is lacking in this area, the activities suggested in this chapter will go a long ways toward helping your students uncover this important fraction concept  The pattern block activity described in 5.2 and in the video clips is one I have done with students many times and it is a great way to bring forward a variety of big ideas around fractions  I also love the ideas presented in 5.2 around using 6, 12, and 24 packs of soda or water.  This is definitely somethings I will be thinking about adding to my repertoire for next year.  In my school, we have a long standing tradition of introducing the ideas of the size of the wholes with Hershey bars.  A good teacher friend of mine came up with this many years ago when we were co-teaching a fifth grade.  Now I do this lesson in grade four.  I get two paper bags and some candy bars.  One bag contains regular sized Hershey bars (the ones with 12 small rectangles).  The other bag contains the smaller Hershey bars.  Here you can either use the minis or the small ones with 4 rectangles that often come in an 8 pack at drug stores and supermarkets.  I then hold one bag and have another person hold the other bag.  Then I ask, \"Who would like a chocolate bar?  Mrs. ____ and I have chocolate bars in these bags.  I will be giving out whole chocolate bars and Mrs.  _____ will be giving out a half of a chocolate bar.  Please raise your hand if you want a whole chocolate bar and I will come give you one.\"  Most or all of the kids choose the whole chocolate bar which of course means they get one of the small ones.  If no students choose the half, I will \"run out\" of whole bars and one kid will have to settle for half of one.  When it is reveled that the kids who is getting half actually gets more, many kids are shocked but I think it leaves a big impression about making sure you notice the size of the whole.  Does your curriculum include lessons about the size of the whole or ask questions where the two wholes vary in size?  Chapter 6: How Come 1/5 is Not Equal to .15I was shocked by the statistics presented in the \"What's the Research\" section of this chapter.  It really scared me that so many students had no concept of how fractions and decimals are related.  The fact that almost half of the sixth graders in the study couldn't write 4.5 as a fraction really made me question the way fractions and decimals are taught.  In most cases in a given year, I cover fractions first and then kind of glide into decimals after.  I try to make sure I am showing how they are related and do many activities that involve fractions and decimals during our decimal unit but I am thinking about how I can make the work with fractions and decimals even more explicit.  It also brings up the question about which topic to teach first and how much of one topic (fractions or decimals) I should teach before I start using both simultaneously,  These are good questions to ponder as I begin planning for next year.In previous years, we had probability units in grades 4 and 5 where a lot of work was done with fractions and decimals between 0 and 1.  Now that we have moved to using the Common Core standards, the probability work has shifted toward grade 7 and we no longer do these units in grades 4 and 5.  I want to make sure my students are still getting some of these opportunities to work with fractions and decimals together.  I like how many of the activities suggested in this chapter are game based.  I am going to make sure we have a set of math stations next year that really work on this fraction and decimal connection.Two activities I added a few years ago when we stopped doing the probability unit that I think can be really helpful and are very similar to the double number line lesson presented in this chapter are the Meter Stick Number Line Lesson and the 100 Bead String Number Line Lesson.  How do you make sure your students have a good understanding of how fractions and decimals relate?  Looking forward to reading your responses in the comments below!"},

The posting schedule for Beyond Pizzas & Pies (all Wednesdays)June 10th Chapters 1&2June 17th Chapters 3&4June 24th Chapters 5&6July 1st Chapters 7&8Chapter 3: Understanding EquivalencyI love the opening scenario in this chapter.  Kids following a procedure that their teacher taught them without any real understanding of the concept or context is so common in our current mathematics instruction.  If this teacher hadn't dug a little deeper and asked a context question like this one, they might never have known that their students had no understanding of the idea of equivalency.  I have had this happen to me and seen it happen to other teachers over and over again.  When you move from teaching procedures to teaching conceptually, it can be hard seeing how little your students understand.  I am blown away by the video clips in this chapter and the entire lesson on measuring with Cuisenaire Rods.  I spend a lot of time on equivalency using area models and a number line but this lesson seems like a great way to bridge the two.  This lesson is simple and easy to replicate but seems like a brilliant way to look at equivalency and to move from an area model to a linear or number line model.  The follow up lesson where the rods are used on the number line also looks very effective.  These two lessons will definitely be a part of my students' work on equivalency next year.  Fraction Kits: Friend or Foe?I love the subtitle of this chapter.  I have a love/hate relationship with fraction kits.  When I first started transitioning to using more manipulatives and visual models, I thought fraction kits were the best thing ever.  Then I realized many of my students were using their fraction kits like calculators.  Something that was meant to be used as a tool to move them toward conceptual understanding was now being used as the only strategy they had for solving problems.  Since then I have been on a quest to find the right balance between hands on experiences and helping kids to develop mental models and conceptual understanding.  I found the research the author conducted about using fraction kits to be similar to my own experience.  I love when this happens!  She talks about how she worked with 2 different groups of students on part-whole fraction ideas.  Cuisenaire Rods were used with both groups.  One group used them as a fraction kit where each piece was always the same fraction.  The other group used them with more flexibility where the whole would change and therefore the names of the other pieces.  The second group made more gains in their understanding than the first group.  When I started using pattern blocks in addition to fraction kits, I saw the same thing.  Although problems were initially harder for kids as the whole was changing, the developed a better understanding of fractions over time. Based on this reading and my own experiences, I think fraction kits still have a place and I will be keeping my making fraction strips lesson in third grade.  However, I will be adding the lessons in the book using Cuisenaire Rods and will continue to think about how to make sure students are not using fraction kits as calculators.  I leave you with this quote from the end of the chapter:\"They (fraction kits) can support students' reasoning about fractions and help them make sense of basic fraction computation.  When used in a superficial way, however, fraction kits may lead students to develop superficial understandings of part-whole relations.  Students may come to understand fraction names such as one-fourth to be merely the name of a piece from a fraction kit, not a name that implies a specific mathematical relationship between a part and a whole.\" What are your experiences with fraction kits? How about teaching equivalency? Let us know in the comments below!  Join us next week as we look at the importance of context in identifying the unit and making sense of fraction and decimal notation.  Be the first to see new posts by following my blog (look in the upper right hand hand column for ways to follow me) or my Facebook page."},

book studies, check out this post.  If you need more convincing about how much this book has to offer, check out this short introduction video!I am so excited that you are joining me on this journey to learn more about teaching fractions.  My go to book for fraction teaching for the last few years has been A Focus on Fractions.  I learned so much from that book but realized that I haven't read anything on fractions in quite some time so this summer I am making fractions a priority!The posting schedule for Beyond Pizzas & Pies (all Wednesdays)June 10th Chapters 1&2June 17th Chapters 3&4June 24th Chapters 5&6July 1st Chapters 7&8Chapter 1: The Problem With Partitioning: It's Not Just About Counting the PiecesThe title of this chapter really sums up this issue.  Over and over again, kids are exposed to problems that show equally partitioned shapes or number lines and are asked to find the fraction.  With these types of problems being the only ones they see, kids often develop strategies like counting the pieces and they seem to work because the only problems they see have equal parts.  It can be very uncomfortable to begin to ask kids to solve problems where the parts are not partitioned equally.  Many teachers (myself included!) really balk at this idea at first.  It can feel like you are trying to trick your students.  What you are really doing though is not letting them rely on counting pieces and are helping them think about fractions rather than just repeating a procedure.  Yes, kids who have always seen equally partitioned areas and number lines will have some wrong answers and some disequilibrium when they first work with shapes that are not partitioned equally but this will lead to a better understanding of fractions. I love the classroom activity described in this chapter using Cuisenaire Rods to help kids see that fractions are a relationship between the whole and the part.  Our current math curriculum does something very similar to this using pattern blocks.  The idea of the whole changing rapidly during the lesson freaked me out the first year I did it.  I remember having a discussion with the fourth grade classroom teacher about how confusing the lesson would be to the students.  Well I was very wrong.  It was a bit confusing to the adults at first, but the kids loved it.  I could see their fraction understanding deepening and they had such rich discussions about what they were noticing.  To this day it remains one of my favorite lessons.   I love the take on this using Cuisenaire Rods.  I am one of those people who does not use Cuisenaire Rods very often even though I have met countless teachers who swear by their effectiveness.  I can see how this lesson would be a very nice way to deepen my students fraction understanding.  Because we use a similar lesson already using pattern blocks, I think this lesson would be a great for my intervention groups.  Chapter 2: Top or Bottom: Which One Matters?The student at the beginning of this chapter who over generalizes the idea that the bigger the denominator, the smaller the fraction could be a story about the way I learned fractions.  One of my clearest school memories was in fourth grade when I remember realizing that this rule worked.  Of course, we had just started our unit on fractions and had only been working with unit fractions.  I plugged right along in my text book thinking I was big business getting ahead of the class and doing the next several pages only to find out later that I really was doing things wrong.   I had no conceptual understanding of fractions and I don't really remember using visual models.  We had a text book and that was it.  My teacher marked most of my answers wrong and \"taught me\" how to find a common denominator when comparing fractions.  That is the one and only strategy I had for many years.  After having more life experience with fractions, I was able to tell which fraction was bigger or smaller if they were fairly far apart but still had to resort to a common denominator strategy for many fractions pairs.After several years of teaching fractions the way I was taught, I began to see there was some work I needed to do.  I had found a copy of About Teaching Mathematics in my classroom and began to read it.  I started moving more of my teaching into conceptual understanding rather than procedures.  I was still pretty stuck on fractions and really lacked conceptual understanding myself on this matter.  I took a wonderful class on teaching fractions and read A Focus on Fractions.   This led to a huge shift in my own conceptual understanding which led to a huge shift in my teaching.  Now instead of teaching kids the procedure for finding common denominators, I guide them toward developing a toolbox of strategies for comparing fractions. One thing I think I still struggle with in my teaching is making sure kids are not over generalizing rules like the larger the denominator the bigger the fraction.  I get so excited when kids make conjectures that I sometimes forget to stop and ask them if it always works.  I recently read a blog post over at Traditionalist Becoming Non Traditional about journal prompts that ask kids if something always, sometimes or never works.  I think adding in journal prompts about these conjectures kids make could really help make sure over generalization does not happen. Watching the video clips and reading about the activities in this chapter makes me really rethink some of the number line activities I do and change them around to use the Cuisenaire rods.  This seems like a powerful manipulative for number lines and I am currently not using them at all in my fraction instruction. Now it is your turn!  What did you think about these chapters?  What ideas can you take back to your own classroom?  What are some things you are doing well?  Let us know in the comments section below!"},

{"title": "What to Expect When You are Applying: Math Coach", "date": "Tuesday, May 19, 2015", "text": "TweetRecently, I have had several folks ask me about my role as a math specialist and what exactly it is that I do at work.  I have also had several folks contact me through my Facebook page with questions about roles and responsibilities as a math leader.  This week I will be sharing some of the different roles I play as an elementary math specialist.  Because I work in a small school, I have several roles to play.  In larger schools it is often the case that one of these roles is a full job.  Yesterday I gave some details about what to expect as/from a math interventionist.  Today I want to share with you another of my roles.Math CoachBuilding RelationshipsIf you are going to be getting into teacher's classrooms and really making a difference for them and their students than it is vitally important that they find you helpful and they trust you.  Building strong relationships with the teachers you are going to be working with is the foundation that the rest of this role is built on.  Present yourself to teachers as someone who is helpful and ready to work together.  Be a good listener and try to understand where other folks are coming from!  Being the neutral party that everyone gets along with can really pay off for a math coach!Start With Teachers Who Want Your HelpSo many teachers are used to closing their classroom door and doing the best they can with the knowledge and experiences they have.  They might not be ready to make a change or might be terrified of any number of things associated with your presence in their classroom.  There will also be teachers who are eager for your help and guidance.  These are the teachers you should start with.  If you work with the folks eager for change, you create a positive climate and shared experience.  As other teachers in the building see changes in instruction and climate, they might be more open to changes.  I have found that some of the teachers who were most reluctant to give my ideas about constructivist teaching and letting kids figure out their own strategies are now some of the ones who embrace the ideas the most.  You might have a small group of teachers that you feel like you really haven't influenced even after many years but you can't let that overshadow the work you do with others.  Focus on the positive. CommunicationFind the best way to communicate with the teachers you are working with.  Follow up conversations with emails and reminders.  If I meet with a teacher to co-plan a series of lessons, I take notes on my computer or tablet while we are meeting.  Then I email this to any teachers who were part of the discussion.  This reminds folks what we talked about and makes sure we are all on the same page.  If planning time happens more than a few days in advance, I send out reminder emails.  Take the time to follow up with extra communication and things will run much smoother for you. Resource ManagerAs the math coach in the building, you will be expected to know a lot about various resources.  This might mean physical resources such as manipulatives and books and it also means virtual resources and ideas.  A teacher might come to you with questions about teaching fractions.  A parent might ask how they can best help with homework.  You are expected to be the expert on all things math related and having knowledge of resources that are available in  your school and online can really help answer these questions. Professional ReadingA great way to stay up on what resources are available is to do a lot of professional reading.  This can be a lot of different things but might include reading several math teaching books (I try to read 1 per month!).  You get the knowledge from these books and you put them on your shelf at school.  If someone asks a question, you can point them in the direction of one of these books.  This also could mean reading math blogs and other online resources.  I love how the format of blog posts allows me to share information in small pieces.  When I find a blog post I think a teacher would benefit from or find interesting, I send them a link in a quick email.  I find teachers are much more likely to read a short blog post than an entire book!  Sometimes a few short blog posts around one particular subject qets their interest piqued enough to ask for a book recommendation. Embedded Professional DevelopmentAs part of my math coaching role, I do a lot of embedded professional development.  This can vary greatly but is good math practice broken into little chunks.  I might model a number talk or explain the research behind a particular method for teaching fractions.  I follow up my words with links to blog posts, books or other resources.  I also am often asked to lead lesson studies or professional learning communities around particular topics. In-service DaysWhen my district has an in-service or teacher training day, I am often asked to provide professional development to the teachers, administrators and/or paraprofessionals around various math topics.  This used to be one of the most challenging aspects of my job because getting up in front of adults and teaching them something used to be terrifying to me.   With practice, this has gotten much easier and now I really look forward to getting to do in depth professional development with the adults in my district. Communications with Administration As the math expert in your building you will need to spend some time communicating with administrators about your schools' math program and what you and the teachers you work with need in terms of professional development, time and materials.  You will probably be asked to attend several additional meetings each year around these issues. Create a Math CommunityCreating a school culture around math may be part of your responsibility.  Organizing family math nights and communicating with parents about how math is taught in your school might be part of your job.  You also might have to showcase assessments, construct bulletin boards or attend school board meetings.  Getting your math message out to the community can be a great way to build long term support for your position.

{"title": "What to Expect When You are Applying: Math Interventionist ", "date": "Monday, May 18, 2015", "text": "TweetIt seems to me that math support positions have been becoming more common in schools across the country.  In the last few weeks, I have received several emails and Facebook messages from folks who have applied or are thinking about applying for various elementary math positions.  Many people are looking for advice and ideas and others are really asking what to expect.  I know expectations for these types of jobs vary widely but I want to share what I have learned over the last 10 years.  Over the next few days, I will be describing some of the roles that I have played as a \"math specialist\" and my best advice for doing a great job in each role.Math InterventionistProviding Additional InstructionThis is the backbone of what your role will be as a math interventionist.  The majority of your time will be spent working with small groups of students who require additional instruction to meet standards.  There are many math intervention programs available commercially which your school may or may not use.  My school does not have a commercial program and I create what I use with my students.  I tend to keep much of my interventions game based, especially with primary students and get a lot of mileage out of my place value card decks.  With my older students I do a lot of hands on practice with manipulatives and concrete models and linking those to the representational and abstract simultaneously.  When I first began this job my interventions looked very different and I sometimes struggled to figure out what I needed to do and what tools I needed.  If you are new to being a math interventionist and do not have a commercially available program, see if you can spend some time talking with another math interventionist about what they use with their students and how they know it is successful.  It can be a lot of work to start from scratch.  I do like being in charge of making my own intervention materials now that I have had a lot of experience, I find that I can really customize my interventions to individual students in a way that would not be possible with a commercially available program.  Know Your AssessmentsStudents are referred to me based on assessments, both observational and formal.  Some of it is formative assessment and others are local assessments that we use as screening tools or provide intervention for follow up.  Students who are currently on my case load get assessed several times a year.  They usually get an assessment when school starts, in January and in May.  They might also get one before a parent conference or report card if I am looking for more information.  For K-2 kids, I use a local assessment that is an individual interview.  It is great to get this level of detail on my intervention students.  For older students, I have recently started using the Math Reasoning Inventory which is part written and part interview.  Marilyn Burns was one of the authors so like all of her stuff, it is awesome !  You can check it out here.  Tracking DataYou have all those assessments, now how are you going to track and share data?  If you use the Math Reasoning Inventory, much of this is done for you.  If you use local assessments or a combination of things you might have to invent your own data tracking system.  I use Excel to track data in a variety of ways.  If you do not know how to use Excel I highly recommend you learn!  I learned how to use it to my full advantage 6 years ago while I was taking a statistics class.  Understanding how data can work for you and what tools are available to you can really help.  Knowing the basics of statistics and how to use a spreadsheet program can be really helpful for a math interventionist.  Communicating with ParentsSo now you have identified students in need of intervention.  The next step is to let parents know and introduce yourself to families.  I work in a very small school and after 10 years I know most of the families.  I find a quick phone call to let a parent know when I am doing intervention with their kid to work well for me.  This mostly is due to the fact that I already know the family.  If I need to do intervention with a kid whose family I do not know, I often have the classroom teacher get in touch with the family and let them know I will be working with their child.  Then I make contact by phone or in person and start developing that relationship with the family.  For students whose families already know me or for students who are on my case load the most frequently, I find that email is a great way to communicate updates and quick shares about what we have been working on.  I try to be in email contact with parents at least twice per month with a quick update.  This takes a lot less time than it may seem and really helps parents feel connected.  I also meet with families at parent conference time.  I mostly set it up so the parents can see myself and the classroom teacher in the same conference.  This makes for less meeting for the parent and keeps everyone on the same page.Each job is going to be different but these are some of the things I have experienced as a math interventionist.  I will be detailing other roles that I have taken on as a math specialist this week so check back or make sure you are following me on Facebook!If you have any tips or experiencesabout being a math interventionist to share please let us know in the comments!  Any questions I can answer for you would be great as well!Want to know what being a math coach is like?

{"title": "Mathematics Through Play Book Study: Part 3", "date": "Saturday, April 11, 2015", "text": "TweetWelcome to week 3 of our Math Through Play Book Study!  I have been thinking a lot over the past few weeks about getting more play into the classroom and have some great ideas.  I will be sharing some of these in the next few weeks!Here is the posting schedule for this book study:Sunday March 29th: Chapters 1-3Sunday April 5th: Chapters 4&5Sunday April 12th: Chapters 6&7Sunday April 19th: Chapters 8&9If you are just joining us, head to this post for more details! Chapter 6: Shape and Space3-D ShapesI love 3-D shapes and find that they are an easy thing to incorporate into play.  My students have access to a large about of block play and construction kids such as Lincoln logs, polydrons and legos.  I would love to add Magna tiles to my rotation as my budget allows.  These toys are fun and engaging and kids can build and play with them for hours.  They are the perfect way to introduce 3-D geometry vocabulary and for kids to explore ideas about movement and symmetry.  When reading this chapter, I did think of some other ways that I could increase students access to 3-D shapes with other materials.  The book talks a lot about modeling dough and working on 3-D shapes through this medium.  I certainly have plenty of access to modeling dough and could absolutely spend some time encouraging kids to explore 3-D shapes with this medium.  The other idea from this chapter that really excited me was using recyclable materials.  Several years ago, I worked with a second grade class to build 2 robots out of recycled materials and they got so much good hands on math out of this experience.  Much of what I put into my recycling bin each day is a 3-D shape and the possibilities of how kids can use these to build and create are almost endless.  The best part is that I don't have to wait for budget money to be there or spend my own money on these materials. Using a CameraJust a few years ago, we had one digital camera to be shared by everyone in the school.  Now with a few iPads in most classrooms and the way cameras have improved on cell phones, I have all day access to a good camera.  This chapter made some excellent points about taking pictures of students' creations with 2 and 3-D shapes.  Seeing shapes from different angles and perspectives is a great way to talk about geometry concepts.  This is something I definitely would like to do more of.   Chapter 7: MeasurementVolume and CapacityI have always been a big fan of sand/water tables and this type of play in classrooms.  While I still see these in almost every preschool classroom, they have been disappearing from primary classrooms in many elementary schools.  I think this is a huge lost opportunity for the development of measuring volume and capacity.  Kids can learn so much from these experiences.  I particularly liked some of the suggestions in the book for going beyond just sand and water in the table.  In my online research for more sand and water table ideas, I came upon this awesome website which really takes the sand/water table to a whole new level.   TimeI really don't think I have ever thought about how to incorporate learning time into play.  I love the idea of giving kids a calendar or plan book to use in their play.  The calendar would be great to include in their play around doctor or vet offices or anywhere where appointments need to be made.  A planner would be great if they are playing school or something that requires a schedule on an hourly basis.  I also love the idea of providing a clock (analog or digital depending on level) that they can use to play train station or other activities where the tickets might have a time written on them.  Looking for more ideas for math play?  Check out my new pinterest board where I will be collecting ideas from all over the internet!"},

{"title": "More Ways to Use 10 Frames", "date": "Wednesday, April 8, 2015", "text": "TweetLast fall, I wrote about 10 different ways I was using 10 frames in the classroom.  I love using 10 frames in the classroom and keep things fresh by changing out which ones I am using as the season changes.  In Kindergarten and grade 1 I get so much mileage out of 10 frames and they really help build a solid foundation for early numeracy and additive reasoning.  I also love my 20 frame playing cards and wrote about how I use them in my classroom here!Compare or Flip and AddWar was always my favorite card game as a young child and I often play versions of war (also called compare) with 10 frame cards as well as my other place value decks.  To play this game, mix up a few sets of playing cards and give each player an equal number of cards.  Then have them flip over 1 or more cards and compare the result.  I have very young students start with flipping over one card and saying the number represented by that card.  Then whoever has the largest (or smallest) number after every player has flipped over a card gets all the cards in that round.  As kids get older, you can have them flip 2 cards over and find the sum.  You can also have them flip over 3 cards if you are working on adding 3 one digit numbers.  Ready for subtraction?  Have them flip over 2 cards and find the difference.  I love how this one seemingly simple game can be played in so many ways!  Your entire class can look like it is playing the same game but different pairs or small groups can be playing different versions customized for their skill level.  You can further differentiate this game by mixing 10 frame cards with numeral cards or having some kids playing with 10 frames while others use numerals.  You also do not need to spend a lot of time going over the rules to a \"new\" game because kids already know how to play!Close to 15 (Or another number of your choice!)This game is a great way for students to practice multiple skills at the same time.  I have students create their own record sheet for this game which is a great way to use up scrap paper from the copy room.  Flip over two cards and find the sum.  The person who is closest to 15 (or some other number of your choosing) \"wins\" that round.  The winner can circle their answer.  This allows students to practice addition facts and at the same time practice comparing two numbers (subtraction).  The game can end when kids run out of cards or you can have them re-shuffle and keep playing!  You can also change this game up by having kids flip just one card and see who can get the closest to 5 (or another small number).  Ready for a challenge?  Have them flip over 3 cards and see who can get closest to 20 (or another number of your choice!). Compare with GameboardI used to teach the greater than and less than symbols toward the end of second grade.  As standards and expectations have shifted, I have moved to teaching these symbols and the language of greater and less than earlier.  A good way to do this has been with a compare board and playing cards.  Kids can start at a very basic level by comparing 2 ten frames.  As kids gain proficiency with number, I can mix in numeral cards or other representations.  Using a small piece of a colored index card and some brads, I can make a game board that will make the <, > and = symbols.  The kid with the larger (or smaller) card gets to keep both cards.  It is fun to mix it up and not always have the kids with the largest number win.Flip and FillThis is a great game for helping kids make the connection between a written numeral and a 10 frame card.  They use a blank 10 frame and a set of numeral cards to play this game.  The blank 10 frame gets laminated so they can write on it.  Give them a dry erase marker and they are set to go!  Flip over a numeral card and build that number on the blank 10 frame.  As kids get more proficient with this, you will see them erasing from or adding onto what they had previously built instead of starting from scratch each time.  Want to try these out today?  You can grab the playing cards featured in this post here.

{"title": "Monday Math Literature: Fun with Math at Home", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2015", "text": "TweetWelcome to this week's edition of Monday Math Literature!  I have been having so much fun the last few weeks playing with the recipes and math ideas in this great book.  Eat Your Math HomeworkThis book includes 7 different recipes that kids and adults can make together.  There are ideas for incorporating math before, during and after cooking.  As part of my quest to get kids playing more I have found a lot of great ideas in this book.The lesson I want to share with you is called Milk and Tangram Cookies.  It was done with a few upper elementary students who are a bit behind and then some younger students joined us at the end.  Check it out!These students have had some experience with fractions.  I was concerned about some of their conceptual understanding of fractions and wanted to take this opportunity to review a few big ideas.  Many of the ingredients in the recipe called for half a cup.  I decided to only put out the quarter and eighth cup measuring cups and the half teaspoon and half tablespoon.  This contrives it a bit and helps students review and think about what they know about fraction equivalencies.   The students read the directions and started thinking about how they were going to use the measuring tools I gave them and still follow the recipe.  Practicing with measuring, fractions and more. It takes two quarter cups to make a half cup. We were supposed to bake these in a square pan.  I didn't have a square pan but have several circular and rectangular ones.  The kids problem solved and decided to go with a circular pan.  The directions include a traceable template to help you create tangrams but we just eyeballed it.  Notice how we had to make a square first.  This led to a great discussion about polygons versus non polygons.  We pre-cut the cookies before putting them in the oven. I highly recommend this because if you make a mistake on the dough, it is easy to fix.  Much of the lines disappear as they bake, but you can still see where they were and it is an easy step to re-cut along the old lines.   As the cookies were baking, I took a suggestion from the book and gave the kids a paper set of tangrams.  They were highly interested in them knowing that their cookies were going to be like this momentarily.  They spent some time creating different designs as well as composing and decomposing shapes.  One of several designs.  This one sparked a great discussion about the different angles in the shapes and led to us sorting the shapes by the types of angles they have.  The kids were so impressed that all the triangles had equivalent angles despite being different in size.  Also the parallelogram sparked a great debate about angle size and obtuse versus acute angles.  We had so much fun exploring more with the cookies that I didn't get to take a lot of pictures.  We repeated some of the ideas we found on the paper tangrams and extended some ideas about angles.  Then we had two primary students join us and the older kids did a little lesson with them on the number of sizes and angles the names of the shapes.  I love this book and can't wait to try out the last few recipes.  I had the BEST TIME doing the lesson on fraction chips and I think it is an excellent match for any kids who need some more practice or motivation with fractions.  I love having fun with my students and giving them a memorable experience to anchor their math understanding.  This book has been an excellent addition and I am excited about using it in other ways.  It can easily be adapted for older and younger students but I would say the best grade range is 2-5. If you teach other subjects besides math, there are other books in this series that look just as engaging. In other Math Maniac news, you can now find me on Instagram.  I will be doing a giveaway over there over the next few days and would love for you to check it out!  My best selling QR code scavenger hunts will be up for grabs so head over to enter! Also, my newest book study will be starting soon.  We will be looking more at math play.  Head to this blog post to check out all the details.  TweetThe countdown to spring is on!  This is the time of year that I can't wait to get outside and dig in the dirt.  I also like to re-commit myself to professional reading because it motivates me to be my best as the school year comes to a close.  I have not done much professional reading since finishing up the Number Talks books study and I can't wait to dig into a few more good books.  With the emphasis this time of year on standardized testing, I wanted to pick something to keep teachers minds off of testing.  I have done some exploring with math play and am interested in reading more about play based learning.  So I have decided for my next book study, I will be digging into Mathematics Through Play in the Early Years.  Each Sunday, I will be posting my thoughts about a few of the chapters and I would love to have you join me.  You can participate by leaving a comment here or writing your own blog post and linking it in the comments section.  Here is the posting scheduleSunday March 29th: Chapters 1-3Sunday April 5th: Chapters 4&5Sunday April 12th: Chapters 6&7Sunday April 19th: Chapters 8&9Grab a copy of the book and finish your school year strong!"},
{"title": "Fly on the Math Teacher's Wall Squashing Fraction Misconceptions ", "date": "Saturday, February 21, 2015", "text": "TweetI love fractions!  Today I am linking up with some of the best math bloggers out there to bring you the Fly on the Math Teacher's Wall Blog hop.  Last time, we talked about place value and this time we are talking about squashing fraction misconceptions.  One of the biggest misconceptions I had when I first started teaching is that finding a common denominator is the only way to compare fractions.  Boy was I wrong.  After reading a great teaching book and listening to my students share their invented strategies, my misconception has been cleared up.  Today I am going to share with you 5 different strategies for comparing fractions.  Common DenominatorsYes, you can compare fractions with common denominators.  However, this isn't always the most efficient way of doing things and it involves a lot of steps and a lot of calculation which means there is a lot of places where you can make mistakes.  The good news is, it works every single time and sometimes you just can't figure out which fraction is larger without it.  Common NumeratorsThe long lost twin of common denominators, finding a common numerator is just like finding a common denominator.  However, sometimes the numerators already are the same and sometimes it can be more efficient to calculate a common numerator than a common denominator depending on the numbers in the problem. The numerators already match!  Use this to help you compare the fractions instead of finding a common denominator.  Comparing these two fractions is tricky because they are very close together! Finding a common denominator would work but look how much easier it is to find a common numerator for this problem because the numerators are much friendlier numbers to work with then the denominators.  Most kids will instantly know the LCM of 3 and 5 but I bet they won't know the LCM of 17 and 27! Comparing to a BenchmarkThis is a great strategy that can be very efficient on the right numbers.  If your fractions are close to a benchmark number like 0. 1/2 or 1, this can be so quick and easy!  These two fractions are great to compare using a benchmark because one of them is a bit less than 1 and the other is a bit more.  One of these fractions is a little more than one half and the other is a little less than one half.  This makes them easy to compare using a benchmark!Draw a ModelModel drawing is so important in the development of fraction understanding.  I certainly don't want to leave my fifth graders in a place where they need to draw a model every single time they need to compare fractions but it is an excellent stepping stone and one that should not be skipped.  When students draw models, they develop some big ideas about fractions and help make a visual model in their head that they can refer to later if needed.  I spend a lot of time teaching good model drawing in second and third grade.  There are many ways to draw models, but I like to focus on using rectangles because they are easy to partition and if you partition them all in one direction, it is a quick jump from a rectangle model to using a number line.  The farther apart two fractions are, the more reliable model drawing can be.  When the fractions get very close together, small model drawing inefficiencies can lead to students getting the wrong answer or concluding that the fractions are equal when they are now.  The student who can use a rectangular model like this one is just one step away from really understanding number lines.  This student used a number line to compare these fractions.  Notice that if the fractions were really close together, this model drawing might not work.  It also takes some time to set up and draw accurately.  Partitioning into equal pieces is definitely a conversation to have with students as you work on model drawing.  I introduce the number line model in grade 3.  Unit Fraction Reasoning Unit fraction reasoning is often one of the first strategies to develop.  It starts in first grade when you are partitioning rectangles into halves and quarters and a student notices that one half is bigger than one quarter.  It develops from there and as kids get more comfortable with using unit fractions it can lead to some great ideas when comparing fractions.  This student used the fact that each of these fractions is missing a pieces that is a unit fraction to help him figure out which fraction was bigger.  Don't let the writing fool you about the amount of time the student took to figure this out.  He just looked at them and knew each was missing one piece and the one missing the smaller pieces would be the bigger fraction.  The writing was done during the sharing of strategies and is an attempt to capture his thinking for the other kids to see.  If you want to see what strategies your students have for comparing fractions, here is a quick little worksheet that will give you an idea of some of the strategies your students have.  The numbers were chosen strategically to illicit a range of strategies.  Ready to learn more about squashing misconceptions?  Head on over to Beyond Traditional Math to read more about the importance of the whole!"},
{"title": "Great Teaching Books: Fluency Through Flexibility", "date": "Monday, February 16, 2015", "text": "TweetI like to read.  Yes, I have spent the last 9 years teaching just math but I still love reading.  I may not like teaching reading as much as I like teaching math but to the shock of my students, I do know how to read.  They seriously look at me like I have 2 heads when I make a comment about helping them with a reading assignment.  I read whatever I can get my hands on.  To the shock of many of my colleagues, I read a lot of teaching books.  I read at least 1 teaching book per month and often will be in the middle of 2 or 3 at a time.  I love hearing what other teachers are doing in their classrooms and how they are applying educational research to improve their teaching practices.  I have so enjoyed doing book studies on my blog (like Children's Math and Number Talks) and love how they get me to slow down and interact with other teachers about what I am reading.  However, there is just no way I can keep up with my own reading doing book studies, so I will also be sharing with you some of my favorite teaching books as I read them and a few of my past favorites. (Like A Focus on Fractions) Today, I want to share with you a book I read a few weeks ago.  I have been working on a blog post about fluency with addition and subtraction facts since October.  Now, usually I just write a blog post and hit publish, but this one has been bothering me.  I feel like talking about fluency can be a loaded conversation.  In my post, I am trying to convey the importance of fluency and kids thinking flexibility while not making it all about speed.  Yes, figuring out facts quickly is important but focusing on developing thinking strategies is so much more important than pushing speed so much that your students just become fast counters.  We need to move them beyond counting strategies.  I have been struggling with these words for months but this book has essentially said what I was trying to say in my blog post and really conveyed that being fluent requires number sense.  If you are a primary teacher or a teacher who has always wondered why some kids seem to develop addition and subtraction fact fluency while others can't seem to get there than this book is for you. Fluency Through Flexibility: How to Build Number SenseThis book really follows the idea of Cognitively Guided Instruction.  The activities in each section are based on children sharing and comparing ideas and strategies about how they got they answers.  Many of these activities are also easy to adapt to a Number Talk.  All of the activities are designed with best practices in mind and all blacklines are included.  Busy teachers will love having a set of blacklines that can be made once and used over and over again in a variety of games and activities. I think the most powerful part of this book is that it is such a good mix of theory and practice.  The beginning pages outline the why of teaching this way and the rest of the pages tell you how.  Unlike other books that are all theory with a few examples thrown in, this is a book that you can but in a busy teacher's hands and have them going with new and engaging activities in a matter of days.  I also think this would be an excellent book for special educators and para professionals that work with kids in math.  As a math leader in my district, I am often asked to provide professional development in math teaching to other teachers and para educators.  This book would make an excellent resource to use in conjunction with this kind of professional development around early numeracy and additive reasoning.  It would be a great resource for everyone who works with K-2 teachers to have access to both for its theory and easy to implement classroom ideas.  Want to grab a copy of this book?  You can head here to pick up your own.   You can also read more written by this author over on her blog, The Recovering Traditionalist."},
{"title": "Number Talks Book Study: Part 6", "date": "Sunday, February 15, 2015", "text": "TweetWelcome to the conclusion of our Number Talks book study!  After learning about number talks several years ago and implementing them in my classroom, it is great to finally read the book and have some time to reflect on how number talks have changed the way I teach math.  If you missed some of the previous posts, you can catch up on them below.  Posting SchedulePart 1: January 11th Chapters 1 & 2Part 2: January 18th Chapter 3Part 3: January 25th Chapter 4Part 4: February 1st: Chapters 5 & 6Part 5: February 8th: Chapters 7 & 8Part 6: February 15th: Chapter 9Today we will be looking at chapter 9 which wraps up some of the big ideas of number talks.Getting Parents InvolvedWhen I started making the transition from a teaching by telling model to a inquiry based constructivist approach, I had many parents balk and struggle to understand this \"new math\" their kids were learning.  I did a few things to help alleviate their fears but their is certainly more I could have done to help ease this transition for them.  If I were to do it all over again, I would do many of the things suggested in chapter 9.- Host a school wide Family Math Night.  We have done this at my school since the very beginning and families love it.  We host it in the middle of winter when there is less going on and families are looking for something to do.  We have excellent attendance and it is such a fun night for families.  You can read more about our Family Math Night here. - Host grade level math nights.  At our school this started with the Kindergarten teacher wanting to reach out to parents and grew up from there.  The way do it is to offer child care in the gym and bring the parents down to the classroom.  There we can take them through a number talk or let them experience some other aspect of what they might see in their students' math class.  We finish the night by bringing kids and parents back together to play some of the math games or center activities they have been working on in class.  These grade level math nights are certainly a huge commitment of time but they don't need to be done every year and offer huge rewards for the time invested.- Get parents into the classroom!  The best way to get parents to see what their children are doing in math is to have them in the classroom for math time.  We have had parents make a weekly commitment in the past but are currently very short on classroom volunteers for math time.  This is definitely an area where my school could use some work.  If you have a good system for getting classroom volunteers in your school, I would love to hear more about it!School Wide Number TalksWatching the DVD let me see how powerful it is to have students in fourth or fifth grade who have had years of number talks under their belts.  The idea of number talks began in my school as a K-2 initiative and has since spread to grades 3 and 4.  Since we have had quite a bit of staff turn over in the 4-6 grade classrooms over the past 2 years, we still have more work to do incorporating number talks into upper elementary classrooms.  I really want my older students to have the same deep understanding of multiplication, division and fraction operations that they do of addition and subtraction.  I am planning on making number talk professional development a big part of the coaching part of my role in grades 4-6 next year once I know which teachers will be teaching math at those grade levels for the foreseeable future.  I am excited to have this DVD and the excellent number talks happening at the lower grade levels in my building to serve as models for good number talks. Your Practice: A Closer LookIf you haven't had a chance to look at the reflection questions on page 333, make sure you make the time.  These 8 questions really helped me think about how number talks are going and what I need to do next.  I am going to wrap up this book study by asking you to think about reflection question #8: \"Remember to start small in making shifts in your classroom practice related to number talks.  Write down one change you will make.\""},

 Approaching multiplication and division in this way and having kids invent strategies to solve these type of problems really does work.                                                                                                                                    The Array ModelIf you have never used the array model for multiplication and division, you are missing out on a huge opportunity.  There has been a ton of research done about how much the area model helps students and using it in number talks is a powerful tool.  Just like recording addition and subtraction ideas on a number line, using the area or array model to record students' thinking about multiplication and division will provide a visual and help all your students connect the big ideas for these operations.  We started using the area model 8 years ago in my school and what a huge difference it made!  If you want to read more about this model and other amazing ideas for teaching multiplication and division I highly recommend Constructing Multiplication and Division.  This book changed the way I think about teaching multiplication and has made such a difference in my school.  The Number Talks DVDWhen watching the number talks on the DVD this week, I was struck by how powerful this DVD would be during professional development.  The number talks on the DVD do such a great job of showing best practices, showing how to do a number talk and showing some of the big ideas of operations and properties.  Even if you only have professional development time in small chunks like for an hour after-school, this DVD could be a great tool for getting the discussion about number talks going.  Handing busy teachers a big book and telling them to read it means that many folks are not going to ever open it or learn more about it.  Having the DVD really could show teachers the power of the number talk and increase their engagement and excitement about reading the book.  EfficiencyI love the focus on efficiency in these chapters about multiplication and division.  It is so important for kids to develop efficient strategies for solving problems.  It is great when kids develop new to them ideas about multiplication and division but it is our job as teachers to move them from less efficient strategies towards more efficient ones that will work for a variety of problems.  I think number talks are such a powerful way to help kids make this transition.  The suggestions about asking kids which strategy is most efficient are excellent and definitely something you will want to make sure you leave time for at the end of your number talk time.  What did you get out of this week's chapters?  What have your experiences been using number talks for multiplication and division?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

Students can be as creative as they want.  While enjoying the creative process they are also being exposed to some of the bigger ideas around fractions like part whole relationships and equivalency.  By giving kids multiple designs to make and allowing them so share their designs with others, students can see many ways to make fractions such as one half.  I love having students build this one with all fourths because it is a great way to expose kids to the idea that the pieces do not have to be congruent to be equal fractions.  If you are doing basic fraction work with students, this is a game you might want to bookmark for later!  Looking for more fraction fun?  Grab this free game to play with your students before or after trying this computer game. It makes a great math center or scoot game! You might also be interested in:Teaching math with You Tube videos: FractionsFractions, First Grade and the Common CoreSecond Grade FractionsMath Books that will Change Your Teaching: A Focus on Fractions Do you have a favorite fraction game?  Tell us more in the comments below!"},

Today I want to share with you how I try to bring winter fun into the classroom with math story problems.  No matter what grade I am working with and what type of computation my students can do, it is always more fun to use a context.  Using a winter context is a great way to have fun with the season and get kids solving problems they are really interested in.  Here are some of the ways I get kids engaged!Picture ProblemsThere is nothing like a fun winter scene to pull my youngest learners into a problem a really get them thinking about math.  A visual images goes a long way toward helping these little learners contextualize a situation and solve a problem.  I like to start picture problems by making a few of my own for students to solve.  Then I let them make their own picture problems.  It is easy to create a background out of construction paper and then kids can draw, use stickers or use stamps to create the rest of the scene.  My favorite winter theme for picture problems is penguins! One example of a picture problem.  Click here to grab this one and another penguin freebie!  After solving a few of these as a class, let your students make up their own. Winter LiteratureHave some winter literature you use every year in your classroom?  It is amazing what kinds of math word problems can be made based on kids' books.  It might be the words in the story or it might be the pictures in the book, but something in almost every book can inspire a word problem.  I have been really focusing on this over the past 2 months and with practice it has gotten easier and easier to come up with good math problems based on popular non-math picture books.   I like to make these problems into little task cards and stick them in the book where I will be sure to remember to ask them.  Here are a few sets I have made for popular winter picture books.  Please feel free to use these with your students and I hope they inspire you to keep going!  Here are some problems that go along with The MittenThese problems I used with Snowman at NightProblems for Tacky the PenguinWinter Task CardsFor my older students, I like to write winter themed problems on task cards.  Then I take the task cards and we go to our gymnasium and spread the cards out.  Then kids move around the gym solving problems and recording answers.  When we have had a long week cooped up in the classroom it is great to give kids this chance to have a bit of extra movement.  On days when we can't get into the gym we use them in the classroom and play a version of scoot or some game where we can move from desk to desk at the very least.  If we get a sunny and warmish day, we might even venture outside and solve a few problems outside.  Our winter task cards are a mix of ones I have written for the students along with ones we have written as a class and kids have written independently.  Here are a few to get you started!If you are working on double digit addition and subtraction you can grab this freebie from my TPT storeIf your students need to work on multiplication and division facts, this freebie will get you started!How do you keep kids engaged during the winter?Head over to Keep 'Em Thinking to learn about how to make Snowflake Crystals with your students!"},

{"title": "Improving Additive Reasoning and Numeracy With 20 Frames", "date": "Tuesday, January 20, 2015", "text": "TweetClip art by Whimsy ClipsThis fall, I shared with you 10 different ways I use 10 frames in the classroom.  Today I want to share with you 10 different ways I use 20 frames with students.  From helping kids identify teen numbers to working on addition and subtraction 20 frames are a very useful tool in the classroom.  Any set of 20 frames will work for these activities.  If you want the ones featured in this post, you can get them here. Most of these activities work well in whole group, small group or individual situations.  The visual model of the 20 frame can support kids who have a fragile understanding and lead to a conceptual model of numbers that they will take with them as they learn more mathematics.  The flexibility of the 20 frame makes differentiating these activities easy to do.  It might look like everyone is working on 20 frames, but the difficulty of what they are doing can range greatly. 20 Frame FlashThis is probably the simplest way to use a 20 frame but can really help build subitizing skills which is the ability to instantly recognize a quantity.  Having students that are confident with what number is displayed on a 20 frame without having to count each time makes the rest of these activities go much smoother!  All you need to do is flash the 20 frame at your students for 1-5 seconds and then put it back down.  When you first start doing this with students you may need to show it longer or give a second peek for some students.  As your students gain experience with this, it will get much quicker.  Make sure you give kids the chance to share with their classmates how they knew the quantity being shown.  This allows all students to hear other students strategies and gives them ideas for how to solve it on their own the next time.Matching 20 Frames and NumeralsThis can be great fun as a whole group activity but can also be played in partners or individually.  When playing with a whole group, pass out 20 frame and numeral cards to each kid until you run out and ask them to find the matching number or picture.  Have them stand shoulder to shoulder when ready and review all matches as a class.   Played as an individual or partner game I like to have students spread out all the 20 frame cards and then flip over one numeral card at a time until all matches are found.  20 Frame MemoryOnce your students get proficient with matching 20 frame and numeral cards, it can be a lot of fun (and learning!) to play memory with them.  Simply mix all of the 20 frame and numeral cards together, place upside down in an array and flip 2 over at a time until you get a match.  This makes a great math center and is also quite a popular game to take home to play with families since most folks are already familiar with the rules for memory.  I like to keep a few sets in zip top folders ready to go home with students who request them.Sequential and Non Sequential OrderingBeing able to put numbers in order is an important skill and one that is easy to do but often overlooked.  Giving your students a chance to put numbers in order at this level will make it much easier to order numbers later when they are working with much larger numbers.  When I give sequential numbers to kids to order and they have finished I have them read them in order from smallest to largest and then from largest to smallest to me or to a classmate.  This gives them extra practice with the rote counting sequence both forward and backwards and allows them to practicing counting starting from a number other than 1.  You can use either 20 frame or numeral cards for this activity.  Some kids need the visual model of the 20 frame when they are fist starting with an activity like this.  Roll and BuildIf you have 20 sided dice, this is sure to be a class favorite.  There is something so engaging to young children about dice games and this is no exception.  If you do not have 20 sided dice or want kids to practice building a specific set of numbers on the 20 frame blank dice are an easy way to differentiate.  If you don't have blank dice or are looking for something very engaging, you can make an origami cube and use that for your blank dice.  All you need to do is roll the dice and fill in the number you rolled on a blank 20 frame.  Odd and Even SortThe concept of odd and even is important for kids to develop and it always seem like they need more exposure to it.  using the 20 frames for this sort is great because kids can see if each dot has a pair or if there is one left over.  This is great for a whole group activity where each kid has a card and you sort onto 2 sides of the room.  It also works well in a math station or for an individual activity.  It is simple as sorting into 2 piles.  Of course, I always follow up this sort with picking one or two cards from a pile and asking kids how they knew those numbers were even or how they knew they were odd.  Flip and FillThis game is a great one to use to check in with how kids are doing with 20 frames.  It is very similar to roll and build but this time they are using the numeral cards to flip over and fill in the 20 frame.  When you do it this way, you know students will be getting the numbers 11-20 (unless you decide to limit it further) and can really practice those teen numbers.  I like to laminate blank 20 frames and have kids flip over the numeral card and fill in the number on their 20 frame.  If the cards are laminated, they can use a dry erase marker for this which they love.  You will see some kids erase the dots each time while others quickly figure out that they only need to erase or add some each time as the numbers change.  Close to 30I love using this game with kids who are showing proficiency with adding single digit numbers and are ready to be introduced to the idea of adding larger numbers.  This game is great played in pairs and makes an excellent math center.  Each student flips over 2 cards and finds the sum.  Then they figure out how far away from 30 their answer is.  The person whose answer is closest to 30 wins both cards.  You can have kids make a simple record sheet to go along with this.  My students like to circle their answer when they win by being the closest one to 30.  I love how this is a gentle introduction to double digit addition and works on the concept of comparing numbers all in a game format.  I love having 10 and 20 frames in the classroom and find that these cards, along with the cards in my place value deck are used in about 75% of the games and activities I do with my intervention students.  There is just something about the visual model combined with the flexibility of these cards that make them engaging and effective.

The website (there is also an app) consists of mini interactive games designed to teach a specific math concept in a fun and engaging way.  The mini games, called episodes are organized by grade and Common Core strand.  There are also \"worksheets\" which are easy for kids to fill out on the computer and click submit to see if their answers are correct.  If you teach K-6 math, this is a website that you are definitely going to want to check out!Here is a tiny sampling of some of the things Matific has to offer. This is bees and flowers from the Kindergarten menu.  It is a fun way for young children to learn about more and less.  You can pick the bees up and match them to the flowers in this episode,  This is Out on the Tiles from the second grade section.  You pick up and drag squares to cover the rectangle and find the area.  The idea of area is pretty new to second graders and this is a fun way to work on tiling to fill in the rectangle.  It is very interesting to watch kids who have done this episode a few times find ways to be more efficient and to figure out the area without tiling the entire shape.  This leads to kids constructing their own knowledge about area and designing their own shortcuts.  This is What's Your Angle I from the fourth grade section.  This is a great introduction to using protractors to measure.  There is also a what is your angle II that steps up the difficulty.  You will find on Matific that there is often a series of episodes that get progressively more challenging around a particular topic.  I really like this because I can have some students working on level 1 while others work on level 2 or 3 as they are ready.  This one is Volume Fraction from the sixth grade section.  I love doing these episodes with upper elementary students because they often feel like they are to mature for other hands on manipulatives.  Matific lets them have hands on experience in a fun and engaging way.  The hands on practice is such an important part of conceptual understanding.  Head over to matific.com for more great games that will help your students build conceptual understanding of important math topics! Grab yourself a big cup of coffee or a nice cup of tea, and check out what these other great blogs are saying in the You Oughta Know blog hop."},

 When most kids are giving me the ready signal, I first ask for answers.  I record just the numerical answers that kids give me not indicating right or wrong answers.  Then kids can share with a partner or the entire class what their strategy is.  As the teacher, I try to capture what the students are telling me by recording equations, open number lines, diagrams or other tidbits that show their strategy.  Other students get a chance to share their ideas as well and then the strategies are compared and contrasted.  I also like to talk with kids about the efficiency of various strategies.  Wrong answers given serve as a great learning opportunity to find mistakes and help kids think more flexibly about numbers.  Most of the time a number talk will take 10-15 minutes but occasionally my students will be so engaged and excited about their strategies that I will let it go a little longer and offer more problems in the string or increase the complexity of the problems we are solving.Chapter 2: How Do I Prepare for Number TalksLocation: I most often do number talks by having kids gather on the rug in front of the white board.  Things might get a little squished but I like to have the students close to me so I can hear them sharing their ideas when we do a partner share.  This is the time where I can listen in and think about which students I want to share with the entire class.  When all students are close to me, it is amazing how many conversations I can listen into at once.  I also like how changing the location mixes up who is paired up with who each day.  My students greatest teachers are each other and I like to keep things fresh!Wait Time: Most teachers THINK they give plenty of wait time, myself included.  When I was doing my master's program this is one of the things I worked on in great detail though observations and video.  I thought my wait time was excellent and it really was only 2-3 seconds.  Extending my wait time was super uncomfortable for both my students and me but now it is the new normal.  Along with my other formative assessment strategies, waiting until kids have time to think has really helped increase the achievement of all the learners in my classes.  Think-Pair-Share: To me this is the backbone of number talks.  I get the chance to hear kids strategies and decide who I want to share with the entire group.  ALL of my students get a chance to articulate how they solved the problem.  My students get a chance to practice listening and understanding someone else's strategy.  I love the pair-share aspect and do it with almost every problem.  When pair-share time is finished, I often ask a pair to share each other's strategies.  Partner A tells me what partner B did to solve the problem and partner B tells me what partner A did.  Holding kids accountable for their partner's idea has really increased engagement during pair-share time.  Recording Student Thinking: It is your job as the teacher to record students ideas on the white board while they are sharing their thinking.  It can be very intimidating the first few times, especially if you are not used to hearing a lot of different ideas.  I still sometimes struggle to understand and capture a students idea but I try to tell myself to stop teaching and start listening.  Listen to what your student is saying, ask questions and let the class work as a team to figure out how each student solved the problem.  Keeping Students Accountable: For me, the best way to keep kids accountable is by giving an exit question.  Even though my students sit close to me, I listen hard and work my best at making sure everyone is getting it, some kids are just so good at faking it.  Giving an exit ticket is a painless and efficient way to see what strategies kids are using and who is completely lacking a strategy.  I often just give kids one problem and a quarter sheet of scrap paper.  I write the problem on the board and ask them to solve the problem and show me how they got their answer.  Because they are used to seeing me record their thinking with number sentence, open number lines and diagrams they are usually pretty good about being able to capture their strategy on paper.  I collect the papers and take a minute right then (usually) to sort the exit tickets by strategy.  I take particular note of those students who do not have a strategy so I can address that with a small group number talk during Guided Math groups.  I also take particular note of any strategies that were super efficient or something I want shared with the entire class.  I might start the next class by showing a few of the exit tickets on the projector and having kids try to tell me how they problem was solve based on what they see on the paper.I love how number talks have changed learning in my classes and can't wait to read more and refine my approach.  How about you?  What are your thoughts on setting up and starting number talks?  Have you tried it yet?  How did it go?

{"title": "Fun with Combinations of 5, 10 and 20", "date": "Tuesday, January 6, 2015", "text": "TweetIf you are a regular follower of this blog, you might be tired of me talking about combinations of 5, 10, 20 and 100.  I spend a lot of time making sure students are fluent with these ideas and am always coming up with more ways to make sure students get the practice they need with these facts.  Today is no exception.  Over the holidays, I spent lots of time with my nieces and nephews and one of them had a fun looking paper cup they were playing with.  All it is is a balloon that has been tied off and had the tip snipped off.  Take a paper cup and cut the bottom out of it.  Stretch the balloon over the cup and you have a little popper.  I used the regular 9 oz paper cups for this but depending on what objects you want to pop and if you are working on numbers to 5, 10 or 20, a bigger or smaller cup might work out better for you.Let's say you are working on combinations of 10.  Give each student a popper cup and 10 pom poms.  I made sure each kid had 10 of the same color so there wouldn't be arguing and let them get to work! They pull on the tied end of the balloon and release.  Some of the pom poms will pop out and some will stay in the cup.  This is a great time to ask questions about how many came out and how many are still left in the cup.  After a few rounds of popping, you can have kids make a simple record sheet and record their combinations.  These can be done as addition or subtraction equations or in a table format.Here are a few other things we have put in the poppers to work on number ID, shape ID and coins! If you try these with your students remember that pom poms are a lot lighter and softer than other materials.  If you have a large class or are short on space, stick with the pom-poms!"},

{"title": "Children's Mathematics Book Study: Part 5", "date": "Saturday, January 3, 2015", "text": "TweetWelcome to the last installment of our Children's Mathematics book study.  If you are just checking this out, it is certainly not to late to join in!  Grab a copy of the book and head through the posts at your own pace.  If you are looking to join a book study from the start, I will be starting a new on next Sunday on a great new book called Number Talks.  Check out the full posting schedule here.  Here is the posting schedule for Children's Mathematics:December 7: Chapters 1- 3December 14: Chapters 4 & 5December 21: Chapters 6 & 7December 28: Chapters 8 - 10January 4: Chapters 11 - 13I will post each Sunday morning and share it on my Facebook page.  Please join in by leaving a comment on my blog post or Facebook page.  If you have your own blog and want to write a post about the book that works too!  Add your link in the comments section here.  Thank you to all who shared last week!Chapter 11: Mathematical Principles Underlying Children's MathematicsWhen I was in 7th grade, I remember learning about the commutative, distributive and associative properties.  They were each a section at the beginning of our text book and I remember feeling so confused.  I was learning about these properties in such an isolated, text book driven way that I literally had no idea they were things I had been using to solve math problems my entire life.  I certainly do not want my students to feel this way so as we use Cognitively Guided Instruction I make sure kids are developing a real understanding of the properties of mathematics.  It is truly amazing to see kids develop these big mathematical ideas from experiences and from thinking about how to solve problems.  Having a good understanding of the properties of mathematics and helping kids put equations and words with their ideas is one of the most important jobs a teacher can do in a CGI classroom.  \"One way of making these properties more explicit is to introduce notation to record relational thinking strategies so that there is a written record that can be used to discuss a given strategy.\"  I often find that when kids first start solving problems of a particular type, they might have a mental strategy but will really struggle with how to notate that strategy symbolically.  This is when I step in and write the symbolic notation to go along with their idea.  This seems to really help all kids in the classroom make sense of the strategy.  This chapter also talks about the fact that it is not necessary to use the names of the properties with students but it is important that they understand what the properties allow.  I agree with this but I also almost always use the names of the properties with students, even primary ones.  I think this is because of my own experience learning the names of properties in isolation and not really understanding what that meant. Chapter 12: The Conceptual Basis for Cognitively Guided InstructionThis was by far my favorite chapter.  I feel like it really captures what CGI is and what a difference it can make in terms of kids learning to think about the math they are doing rather than just doing it.  The idea that knowledge is connected and that all kids benefit from learning conceptually and building upon what they already know is what I strive for in my teaching every day.  I have to confess that I have already read this chapter multiple times and continue to find gems of understanding each time I read through it.  If this chapter can't prove to folks that teaching conceptually is the way to go than I don't know what can. Chapter 13: Conclusion: Keep on LearningI have so enjoyed reading this book and will continue to provide my students with the benefits of Cognitively Guided Instruction.  I really believe that teachers matter to students more than anything else.  It really does not matter what the standards are, what curriculum you are using or what the administration requires if you don't have good teaching.  A good teacher who listens and understands her students thinking and ideas and facilitates an environment where kids can build upon their intuitive ideas and learn more efficient and elegant ways to solve problems is what every kid deserves.  The standards and curriculum and everything else come second to the power of the teacher and his or her ability to guide students learning.I hope you have enjoyed reading this book and if you are still haven't read it, I assure you it will be worth your time."},

One thing that has made having students share strategies easier over the last few years is the availability of document cameras.  When I read the first edition of this book, I had an overhead projector and a small chalkboard.  Now many classrooms have access to document cameras thus allowing kids to share their work instantly without having to copy it to the board or a transparency.  While watching the video of Mr. Graces's class, I was thinking about how nice it was that the entire class of students could see multiple strategies at the same time and how the kids who were not writing on the board were talking about different strategies while they were being written up there.  I think I have gone a bit to far away from this with using document cameras and need to remind myself that the time invested in having kids show their work on the board is valuable in itself.  I need to find a better balance between the efficiency of the document camera and the breadth of possibilities I get by having multiple kids show their work on the board.

Teaching Concepts versus Teaching ProceduresI have seen time and time again how powerful it can be for students to construct their own knowledge and I love how the paragraph as the top of page 91 supports this idea.  It is so tempting to teach kids a procedure or a rule and tie it into a cute jingle because then it seems like they \"get it\" right away.  It is also the way most teachers were taught themselves and the only way most adults have ever experienced learning.  As someone who works with kids over a span of 7 years, I have seen first hand how these rules don't hold up over time.  It certainly takes longer to let kids develop a good conceptual understanding of math concepts, but it pays off big time later when they can add to their knowledge rather than throwing out old rules and learning new ones.  Number WordsWhen I first started teaching math at the primary level, I remember feeling very frustrated by the lack of understanding in reading and writing numbers.  Even very small numbers seemed to be super challenging for some kids to read and write.  It just seemed like such an easy skill to me because I had been doing it for so long.  \"As adults, we have used number words and pace value for so long that we no longer pause to think about the fact that there is a difference between spoken number words and written numerals or that the same symbol can have many different values depending on where it is placed in a numeral.\"  After I took some time to stop and think about all the nuances of place value and of the English language, I realized why my students were struggling with this so much.  I have to say that arrow cards have really changed the way I teach number words and can make a huge difference for your students.  Chapter 7: Children's Strategies for Solving Multidigit Problems This chapter opens with this statement: \"Problems with two- and three-digit numbers actually provide a context for children to develop an understanding of base-ten number concepts.  As children solve and discuss these problems, their understanding of base-ten number concepts increases concurrently with an understanding of how to apply this knowledge to solve problems.\"  I love this statement and think it sets a great tone for the chapter.  I have spent a great deal of time developing better ways guide my students through multidigit problems over the last 3 years.  When I first started my blog, I wrote this post about how I presented a group of second graders with a problem that involved them solving 1000-668 without ever having \"taught\" them how to do it.  I was so impressed at the time with how well my students did with this and how many strategies they had.  Now I do these types of problems a lot more with kids.  It really helps them cement their place value understanding while building their own strategies for multidigit computation.  There are so many excellent examples and videos in this chapter that I could spend a full week talking about all the great ideas.  Similar to the earlier chapters, it is important to remember that kids move from direct modeling to more efficient methods over time.  If you change the numbers or the context of the problem, they might revert back to direct modeling.  It is not a linear progression where kids graduate from one type of problem solving and never use it again.  They will move up and down in terms of efficiency based on the problem type, the numbers and the language in the problem.  What are your thoughts on this week's reading?  Please respond in the comments below or head over to Facebook and leave your thought there!"},

{"title": "Common Core Word Problems: Fraction Addition and Subtraction", "date": "Tuesday, December 9, 2014", "text": "TweetTime for a quick quiz!  How many different problem types are there for addition and subtraction word problems?!?!Answer: 12!Yes!  There are 12 different problem types for addition and subtraction word problems.  When I first learned about the different types I realized I was not exposing my students to all of them.  At first it was challenging for me to remember to ask these questions in all these different ways.  I started with my youngest learners and have moved up through the grades.  In the past I have written about how I address these different problem types at the fact level and with multi-digit addition and subtraction.  Today I want to share with you how I address these problem types in the context of fraction addition and subtraction.A great place to find examples of the different problem types is table 1 in the appendix of the Common Core.  If you are new to these problem types, you might want to print yourself a copy and keep it handy.  It is a great way to make sure your students are getting the exposure they need!Just being aware of the different types of problems is a big step in the right direction.  I highly recommend you sit down and write a few problems of each type that are at a good level for your students.  This is what I did with fractions.  Because it is December and school schedules are crazy, I made mine into reindeer themed task cards.  This way we can try a few problems at a time and I can use them again in math centers.  This problem is a take from, change unknownThis problem is put together/take apart total unknown.  I have a collection of reindeer antlers that are apparently fun to wear when doing these problems!  If you have a Christmas tree in your classroom, decorating it with task cards can lead to some fun times! Get your students started on the journey to being successful with fraction addition and subtraction story problems with this sample set of free reindeer cards.  If you want the full set of 24, you can grab them here!If you are looking for more information about the different problem types and a lot more examples, you might want to grab a copy of Children's Mathematics or check out our book study!"},
{"title": "Candy Cane Math in the Primary Classroom ", "date": "Monday, December 8, 2014", "text": "TweetHappy December!  Thank you to all of you who have already commented on this week's book study of Children's Mathematics.  If you haven't joined us yet, it is not to late!  Head over to the first post for more information. With Christmas just around the corner, I wanted to share with you 5 of my favorite candy cane math activities to use in primary classrooms.  I like using using mini candy canes for these activities but any type should work!  These activities can be used in whole group or small group settings and some of them make great math centers if you do Guided Math.  SymmetryCandy canes are a fun way to introduce or reinforce the concept of line symmetry.  You can get mirrors out if your kids are new to these ideas or just make a line and have them experiment with making a symmetrical picture.  You can even grab your camera and snap pictures of students creations to make a class book.  Measuring Candy canes make a great unit for measuring with primary students.  Mini-candy canes add accuracy and make it possible to measure shorter items.  If you are using standard sized candy canes, have students measure things that are longer.  Depending on the level of your students, you can have kids measure to the nearest whole candy cane or go ahead and open up the idea of fractions.  EstimatingI am a big fan of giving students a chance to estimate and count in all grades.  There are so many math skills you can introduce or review with an estimation jar.  With candy canes it is a lot of fun to fill 2 identical jars.  Fill one with regular candy canes and the other with mini ones.  See how they relate.  For more ideas on estimation jars, check out my Counting and Estimating Routines Series.  Patterning and Positioning If your students are anything like mine, than chances are you have a student or two who struggles with positioning words like sideways, upside down and to the right.  This is a great time to work on positioning words and patterns at the same time. Counting and Tallying  Once you have had a chance to use the candy canes for math, the kids are going to want to eat them.  Have them take 100 (or 20 or 300, etc) licks and see what the candy cane looks like after that many licks.  If appropriate for your age group, had then keep track of their licks with tally marks.  If tally marks aren't something you want/need to work on plain old rote counting works great. Looking for more holiday fun for primary students?  Check out this free reindeer game or some great penguin activities.  Looking for more fun Christmas math activities?  These counting puzzles are a fun way to practice a variety of counting skills and make an excellent math center in the week leading up to Christmas! You can grab the FREE SAMPLE SET here! They are available for Kindergarten, grade 1, grade 2, grade 3 and as part of a money saving bundle!"},
{"title": "Children's Mathematics Book Study: Part 1", "date": "Sunday, December 7, 2014", "text": "TweetI am so excited to be starting a book study on Children's Mathematics.  This is an excellent book for elementary teachers.  The first edition of this book helped set me on the path my career has taken from being a general K-6 teacher towards being a math specialist.  It helped me get started with making math meaningful for kids and has shaped me into the teacher I am today.  I am excited to be sharing the second edition on my blog and can't wait to hear what everyone else thought about this book. If you are just joining us, it is not to late to join our book study.  Grab a copy of the book and maybe a friend or two and jump in when you are ready.  Also, if this December is just to hectic for you, I will be starting another book study the second week in January.  Read more details about both book studies here.  Here is the posting schedule for Children's Mathematics:December 7: Chapters 1- 3December 14: Chapters 4 & 5December 21: Chapters 6 & 7December 28: Chapters 8 - 10January 4: Chapters 11 - 13I will post each Sunday morning and share it on my Facebook page.  Please join in by leaving a comment on my blog post or Facebook page.  If you have your own blog and want to write a post about the book that works too!  Add your link in the comments section here.Introduction and Chapter 1\"I have always known that it is important to listen to kids, but I never knew what questions to ask or what to listen for.\"  This is a quote from the opening paragraph of the book and does a great job demonstrating the journey I have taken over the past 9 years as a math specialist.  I have learned to stop teaching and start listening and I have learned how to seize teachable moments.  When reading the introduction and the opening chapter what struck me most is how much of a different place I am in than when I read the first edition of this book.  Chapter 1 also reinforces my beliefs that students can and need to construct their own knowledge about mathematics rather than being taught a procedure.  \"Without direct instruction on specific number facts, algorithms, or procedures, children can construct viable solutions to a variety of problems.\"  Chapter 2: Addition and Subtraction: Problem TypesWhen the Common Core was first published and I took a look at Table 1 from the Glossary it was a real wake up call that my students were not being exposed to all the different problem types for addition and subtraction.  If you haven't checked out table 1, you will see there are TWELVE different problem types for addition and subtraction word problems.  When my students were first exposed to some of these problem types that I had been neglecting, they found them extremely challenging.  Now I have included them in problem sets starting in the primary grades, working on double digit addition and subtraction and going up through fraction operations.  What a difference it has made!  Chapter 2 does such a great job of outlining these different problem types that I think anyone who has looked at Table 1 in the Common Core and been confused should definitely read this chapter.  It provides the detailed explanation about the different problem types and give some great ideas about how to make problems easier or more challenging by playing with the wording and the positions of the unknowns in the equations.   Please make sure that you note distinguishing between the different types and knowing what they are called in a job for teachers, not for students.  Don't spend time trying to teach kids which kind of problem it is and what it is called! Chapter 3: Addition and Subtraction: Children's Solution Strategies I love this chapter and I think it has a lot of value for professional development.  It is great to read about different strategies and ideas kids have but it is even better to be able to watch the videos. I absolutely love the chart on page 41.  I think this will be something I refer to often.  What are your thoughts and ideas about this week's reading?!"},

Ready to reduce some fractions. I plan on using this book in grades 4 and 5 when we talkabout reducing fractions.  I think it would be really fun to build the ray gun like George has in the story using an old keyboard and such.  I have to think more about how I will be attaching these parts together so if anyone has any suggestions for how to make this let me know in the comments below!I will be following up this story with a little holiday themed equivalent fraction sort.   You can grab this to use with your students from Google drive.  This reindeer themed equivalent fraction sort is a fun way to practice fraction equivalency.  It can be used as a simple matching game or turned into a memory game.  If you are looking for a fun way to practice fraction addition and subtraction, you might want to check this out!"},
{"title": "A Low Prep Way to Work on Place Value, 1 More, 10 more and Counting", "date": "Friday, November 21, 2014", "text": "TweetDo you have an impressive collection of craft sticks in your classroom?  How about some rubber bands and a sharpie?  If you have this basic supplies you have everything you need to make a fun and easy game that will help your primary students practice a few important skills.I actually use craft sticks a few different ways in the classroom but today I want to share with you how I use them for 10's and 1's.  Each kid or pair of kids needs 10 craft sticks (any size or color).  On one side of each stick, make 1 dot in the middle. On the other side of each stick, make 5 dots on either end.  Now each stick has a 10 on one side and a 1 on the other.  Now you put all of the sticks in your fist and hold them a few inches above the surface of the table or floor and drop them.  Some will land with the 10 side up and some will land with the one side up.  Kids need to figure out how many dots are showing.  When they first start doing this activity, they will often organize the sticks into tens and ones before they count. Many kids will organize the sticks into tens and ones when they first start playing this gameWhen kids put them in order like this it is a great time to talk about tens and ones and what the 6 and 4 mean in the number 64.  There is nothing like a visual to help kids explain that the 6 means 60 and 6 tens. As they progress and practice playing this game, I encourage them to straighten them up but to leave them in the order that they fell.  This really helps push their ability to add ten more and one more to any number.  They have to have a good understanding of two digit place value to do it this way. This student would count 10, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 52, 62, 63, 64.  I then might have them count them fro m right to left to practice a different sequence and to help them see that the order you count in doesn't matter.  Now the student counts 1, 11, 21, 31, 32, 33, 43, 44, 54, 64.  They will start noticing that some numbers appear over and over again.  After playing this game as a whole class, in pairs and at math stations we will have a whole group discussion about why this is happening.  After students have had several opportunities to play this game, I will have kids play with partners and shout out their number as they finish each round.  One student will record these numbers on the white board and the rest of the kids will be playing this game for about 5 minutes.  Then I pull them together and we talk about what numbers people got.Some of the numbers you can get while playing this game.  Notice anything? We might organize the numbers in order so it is easier to see and then think-pair-share things we notice.  Then I like to ask some deeper questions like these:Are there any numbers that are possible to get that are not already up here?Why haven't we got any of those numbers?How could I get 65 when I play this game?How do you know if a number is not possible?What if we played the game with 9 sticks?  What numbers would be possible then?Make sure you are following me on Facebook, Pinterest or Bloglovin so you can check out my next post about other ways I use these sticks to promote the big ideas of math!"},
{"title": "Top Ten Christmas Gifts for Teachers", "date": "Wednesday, November 19, 2014", "text": "TweetAs a teacher, I have always appreciated receiving an extra thanks around the holidays.  Whether it is an extra hug, a smile, a hand written note, a Christmas card or something else it has always been held close to my heart.  Now I also sit on the other side of things and have kids whose teachers I would love to thank around the holidays.  I have already started thinking about what I would like to give my son's teachers this season and started thinking about my favorite gifts from the past 10 years.  Praise for a Job Well DoneTwo years ago, I received the most wonderful holiday gift and it cost the giver nothing but a few minutes of her time.  It was an email addressed to me and copied to the principal and school board explaining how this family's child benefited from my services and what a difference I had made in this child's school experience.  This is something I treasure to this day and I can refer to when my job seems overwhelming.  Group GiftThis Chocolate Caramel Crunch basket was a bit hit!Some students work with many adults in their daily travels around the school building.  Depending on how many teachers, assistants and support staff your student works with, trying to thank them all with a gift can get expensive and time consuming quickly.  Several families I know have solved this problem in a fun way.  They put together a gift basket or special snack and leave it in the staff room along with a card thanking staff members for their work with their children.  Some families have made this a tradition and do it every year.  The two gift baskets our staff looks forward to every year are a fruit basket an a chocolate lover's basket.  School SuppliesTeachers love school supplies and often spend their own money on things for the classroom.  Fun supplies like scented markers, post-it notes, cute staplers or other themed items can add to a teachers decor or collection.  Classroom necessities that are always running low like pencils and dry erase makers also make great gifts.  If you want to give your child's teacher something that will last for a very long time, invest in a quality pencil sharpener or 3 hole punch.Oriental Trading Gift CardWhen I asked about holiday gifts on my Facebook page I learned that Oriental Trading offers personalized gift cards.  I know many teachers who use Oriental Trading for small items for their classrooms and a personalized gift card looks like a fun way to say thanks.   They also have an emailed gift card option for those who leave shopping to the last minute or want an easy way to have their gift delivered.Coffee or TeaMy favorite coffee of all time!Most teachers I know drink tea or coffee every day.  With a bit of research (aka asking your child) you can find out if your child's teacher is a coffee or tea drinker.  Look around their classroom the next time you are there and you will probably see or smell some evidence that helps you see if it is tea or coffee they prefer and you might even find out what flavors or brands are their favorites.  Dinner What could be better during the busiest time of year than having dinner planned for you?  I have received gift cards to the local pizza place or take out restaurants several times and have loved them.  Another reader on my Facebook page suggested a dinner to go basket.  I love this idea.  A cute basket and some pasta and sauce and maybe a bottle of olive oil or a loaf of bread from a local bakery and this would be ready to go.  There is something about gift baskets that I find so appealing.  Having to not think about dinner would be a great gift to give (and receive!) Gift CardsIf you know a few things about your child's teacher than you will probably have some idea about the types of things they like to do.  If you know something they are interested in, you can pick up a gift card to a local store that matches their interests.  Even if you never go to that type of store, you can always pick up gift cards online or at the grocery store.Pampering ItemsTeachers tend to be well groomed and many use lotions and such on a daily basis.  I know many teachers who keep a favorite bottle of lotion near their desk so this is a great place to look to get a favorite scent.  Lotions and soaps make great gifts and are easy to arrange into a gift basket or to wrap in cellophane for an easy to give gift.  If you are not sure about what scent to go with, I find that vanilla is a fairly universally loved scent and usually is a safe bet.Something LocalWhether your child's teacher loves home knit scarves, maple syrup or farmstead cheese, receiving a locally made gift is wonderful.  You can honor your child's teacher while supporting the local economy, farmers and craftspeople.  This is really a gift that gives back to the community in many ways.  If you are not sure what to give, do a quick internet search for local gifts in your area and you might be surprised what you come up with.Amazon Gift CardThis is a default gift you don't know your child's teacher that well or you want to be sure they find their gift useful.  Amazon is the go to store for many busy teachers to get supplies for their classrooms or books and other things for themselves.  They sell cards in many designs and you can decide if you want them packaged in a card or box or sent by email.  Quick, easy and painless.  I still have a few weeks to decide what I will be getting my son's teachers.  I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below!  What are the best gifts you have ever received or gave to a teacher? Check out my Facebook page where I will share my decision in a few weeks!"},

Once the socks were numbered, we circled the count by 2 numbers and talked about how counting by 2's was a more efficient way to count socks.  This kind of activity really shows kids how the count by 2 numbers work and why we are skipping a number each time. The next day we wrote the count by 2 numbers in and used the board to practice counting by 2.  If you are looking for more count by 2 resources, you can check out my complete bundle here!For lots of great ideas about teaching young children, check out the Love to Learn Linky!"},

{"title": "You Oughta Know About: Making Origami Dice", "date": "Saturday, November 15, 2014", "text": "TweetA tool that I use again and again in my classroom is dice.  They make math time into game time.  They provide a fun and engaging experience for students.  I have a massive dice collection consisting of dice of all shapes and sizes with a huge range of numbers on them.  I also always keep a box of blank dice on hand so that I can a customized dice in a matter of minutes.  Despite my massive dice collection, I also make origami dice to use with students.  Sometimes I make these myself for specific uses such as large or small group work.  Other times, I made these dice with kids.  Making these dice or doing other origami in the classroom can be a great way to review geometry concepts such as the names of shapes, ideas about symmetry and words like similar and congruent.  The best part about doing origami dice is that not only does it let kids have a rich mathematical experience during the dice making process, but it gives them a tool that can then be used in a math game or for some other specific purpose.  I have tried these dice out in a variety of different grades and I have noticed that grade 3 is really the first time that you can get nearly all kids to be successful with this project with a limited amount of hands on help.  I have had about 50% success rate doing these cubes with first and second graders.  Some kids will be able to do them successfully but many others will need a lot of help.  I recommend that you keep this project to grades 3 and up unless you are doing it with a small group of younger students.  One of my favorite homemade cubes.  This is a 6 inch cube and is great for whole group games.  I made it from a large piece of oak tag and \"laminated\" it with packing tape.  It has been going strong for 2 years and still looks great!Ready to make your own?All you need is 6 pieces of paper cut into squares.  The heavier your paper, the more durable your cubes will be but the harder they will be to fold.  If it is your first time making one, start with some lightweight paper like origami paper or copy paper.  Even ones made from copy paper hold up quite well.  You can use almost any size square.  Here is the sequence you need to fold these up!No repeat with the other 5 pieces of paper.Put your cube togetherI am linking up for the You Oughta Know blog hop over at Buzzing with Mrs. McClain.  Check out all the great ideas below!

{"title": "Taking Place Value to the Next Level", "date": "Saturday, November 8, 2014", "text": "TweetI used to think that if a kid could count to 1000, then they had a good understanding of three digit place value.  After many years of teaching math to kids of all ages, I have found that I could not have been more wrong.  I know think about place value understanding all day long.  I find that it is the single biggest thing that holds kids back from developing conceptual understanding of bigger math ideas like multiplication, division, fractions and decimals.  I have made it my mission to make sure the kids I work with in grades 2 and 3 have an excellent understanding of three digit place value so they are ready for bigger ideas by upper elementary.  When I get an upper elementary student in need of intervention the first thing I do is check for a deep understanding of place value.This August as I was prepping for back to school, I got Fishing Around with Place Value Riddles written by Linda over at Primary Inspiration.  This is a product that works extra hard and I have put it to good use with some of my students in grades 2-5.  Grade 2My second graders are responsible for numbers up to 1000.  This means I want them to be able to count forward and backward in this range, skip count, order numbers, build numbers and be able to add or subtract 10 or 100 from any of these numbers.  The biggest thing is that I expect all of this to be done with fluency.  This time of year we are only a few months into second grade but I always have kids who are meeting these end of second grade standards by this time of year.  This is when I like to introduce a challenge to these kids.  These place value riddles are an excellent match.  These kids get to stretch their understanding of place value and keep their brains engaged in learning more math.  They have to think outside the box and gives them something to work towards.  For these learners, I made a set of cards and placed them in a small plastic container.  I then gave each of the kids who were ready for this challenge a Poly Envelope and a record sheet.  Then they are free to come and grab riddle cards as they need them and work together or independently to figure out the riddles.   Once a week or so during Guided Math I pull this group and we go over answers and work together on any riddles they are stuck on.  As the year progresses and more kids meet my second grade standards, they will be invited to try these out!My second grade set-upGrade 3Third graders should have a good understanding of three digit place value and be ready to take it to the next level.  I have found these cards are an excellent match for my third graders.  I have used them several times this year for whole group instruction, partner game time and Guided Math centers. I store everything I need for third graders in the classroom in a regular 2 pocket folder.  It includes the game board, answer key, student record sheets and riddle cards.  This way I have everything ready to go when the year starts and I revisit these cards throughout the year.  The game board made an excellent Guided Math center.  Kids pull riddle cards and answer them to progress through the game board.  They love when they land on a fish and get a free turn!I also used them in another math center during the first weeks of school.  In this version, they solved the riddles with a partner, wrote the answer on a sticky not and then ordered the cards from least to greatest.  This was a great way to review ordering and comparing numbers under 1000 as well as pushing their place value understanding to the next level by solving the riddles.  The third way I have used these cards in math centers is to have kids write their own riddles.  This was very challenging for some kids but a great way to really think about numbers.  Several kids have written riddles that were not specific enough and when the class went to solve them, they had to be revised.  This was great learning for all and a good way to add more riddles to our set.  In recent weeks, I have clipped a pile of these riddle cards to the white board.  Because my students have become much more fluent at solving them, they are now fairly efficient.  Now I use these during transitions and at line up time.  Give each kid one and they can line up or move to the next task once they have the answer.  I often just have them tell me what the number is but occasionally I have them write the answer on a sticky note with their name and  place it on the table.  Then later I have a student who is an early finisher check the work and bring ones they think are wrong to my attention.  Grades 4 and upI have used these cards in fourth and fifth grade with the entire class as a choice math center.  This is when the cards are all in a tub along with the options described above and a few others from the packet.  Kids can write their own, play with the game board, solve and order and more.  This lets them review important skills and pull things together.  I have also used the riddle cards during transitions and line-up time.  When I pull older students to my own space for intervention, I use these riddles in many of the ways I described for third graders. If you are looking for a hard working product that will help your students with place value and will be used over and over, check out these Place Value Riddles!Grab this excellent resource for your classroom!"},
{"title": "Math is Real Life: Watts Up?", "date": "Wednesday, November 5, 2014", "text": "TweetToday I am linking up with A monthly REAL WORLD math blog link-up hosted by 4mulaFun, The Teacher Studio, Teaching to Inspire in 5th, AND MissMathDork,In the last several months, my local electric company has seriously upgraded their technology.  They have installed smart meters and made huge updates to their website.  I can now pay my bill online and generate graphs and statistics for my power usage by the month, week, day and even hour.  As I was playing with all of these graphs and statistics, I started to think about how important it is for folks to understand how their choices will effect their bill.  Bringing this into the classroom would be a great lesson for all!I think this lesson is best done in upper elementary through high school.  It is an important real life skill and could be incorporated into a lesson on decimals, proportions, graphing or measurement conversion.  I spent some time analyzing my electric bill with a group of sixth graders.  This lesson took about 20 minutes but gave kids a real look into how electricity consumption is measured and billed. Here is how the lesson unfolded1) I had kids pair share and then share as a whole group their ideas around how electricity bills work and how you know what you have to pay each month.  There were a few kids with surprising amounts of knowledge about this but many kids had no idea.2) I signed into my online account for my house.  We played with the graph generator looking at electricity usage over the last monthWhen we originally did the lesson with started with a graph of electricity usage over the past month.  Here is an example I generated recently.  Looking at my usage for a month led kids to questions what was happening on the days were usage was very high and what was happening on days where usage was lower.  This led to looking back through a calendar to figure out what days of the week each date fell on.  They were quickly able to see that more power was being used in my house on weekends.  This led to some great discussions about why this was happening.  As these discussions took place, they wanted more details about certain days.  Using the graphing tool, I was able to get an hourly look at power usage for any day I chose.A look at the hourly usage on an average dayA look at the hourly usage on a very high day.   Because I was graphing a recent day both during my original lesson and again for you today, I can tell you exactly why the power usage jumps so high on this day.  I was doing laundry and used my dryer for 2 loads.  It is very obvious from the graph how much electricity my dryer uses! Looking at these graphs led to a great discussion about why power usage is so high or so low.  Many kids thought it was just because more people were in the house but others argued that what we were doing was more important.  This led to discussions about why power was being used every hour even when we were not home.  I asked them to think about that for a minute and then showed them a graph of our power usage when we were on vacation.  Some kids were shocked that power was being used even when we were out of the house for an entire week.  As we were having these discussions and talking about what in our homes uses power, I clicked on a link to our state's energy efficiency collaborative.  On their homepage, we saw a picture of a power meter and learned that one of their services was to lend these things out for a month at a time.  The students thought this sounded like a great idea.  They wanted to know what was using all the power in my home and report back to them.My efficiency collaborative sent me a Watt Meter and I got to work following the directions.  Anything that cycles on and off like a fridge or freezer has to be plugged in for at least 24 hours to get a good view of power usage over time.  The meter has settings and modes galore and you can easily see how many watt-hours you are using and the estimated monthly cost of that appliance.  You can also use it to plug in things that don't cycle on and off like toasters, tvs and such that are either on or off and get a reading on how much power they are using if they are on and what they are using when they are off. I wrote down all the numbers I got in kilowatts.  I brought my results into school and had kids help me figure out how manykilowatt hours I was using and how much each appliance was costing.  This fancy meter actually does all kinds of conversions and cost analysis for you but that takes all the fun and math out of it!  The students brainstromed a huge list of ideas that I could try to save power.  Then we plugged the watt meter into various things around the classroom and did out own analysis of how we could save power at school.  A huge aha moment for kids was how much power is used by things that are not on. Since doing this lesson with students and having these discussions, I have made some changes to the way I use power in my house and we have made some changes at school.  My favorite change is the new power strips I am using for things like my TV and computer.  It is called a smart strip and really reduces the amount of power being used by things that are off.   There is a lot of math in power usage and paying for power and analyzing usage is a great real life math skill.Any ideas about how I could continue this \"powerful\" education with my students?  Let me know in the comments below!I am also linking up with Middle School Math Moments for Workin' on it Wednesday!"},
{"title": "10 Ways to Work on Counting by 2", "date": "Tuesday, November 4, 2014", "text": "TweetMy students have been hard at work learning how to count by 2.  I have been polishing up my count by 2 resources and have recently posted them in a money saving bundle on TPT.  To help you get your kids counting by 2's with fluency, here are 10 ways to work on this important skill.                                                                                                    1) Fairies in the Fog: 2'sThis is a fun game to do on a SMART board or projector but also works well on any computer.  Kids find and touch or click on the missing number.  The music pulls kids in and it gets harder as kids get more right.  Check it out over at ICT games!2) Number Puzzles     These count by 2 puzzles make a great math center or an activity for early finishers.  They all include frog math pictures and count by 2 numbers along the bottom.  The picture supports kids who are still developing their fluency with counting by 2’s and helps students know when they have the puzzle in the right order.  When students finish putting the puzzle in order and claim to be done, I have them read the count by 2 numbers across the bottom to another student.  To clean up, I have them put all the puzzle pieces into a standard business envelope.       Three of these puzzles start at 2 and go to 30 while the other two start at higher count by 2 numbers.  This allows me to differentiate the center for students who are ready for a challenge.     I find puzzles like these work much better if they are laminated.  I use the TL901 from Scotch which works great and is very inexpensive.    If you don’t have access to a laminator, print these on card stock for best results.  You can grab a free Frog Count by 2 Puzzle here!3) You Tube Songs and VideosYou Tube is a great way to give your students a movement break between centers or during transition times.  Get your kids up and out of their chairs singing and dancing and practicing skip counting. 4) Count by 2 Bingo     This count by2 bingo game makes a great whole group, small group or partner activity.  Simple cut and copy the bingo cards and youare ready to go!   This game is fun toplay as a whole class and then add to your math stations.  I also make a few sets up in top loadingfolders for kids to take home for extra practice.  It is a great game for home because mostfamilies already know how to play Bingo!This game is available as part of my Count by 2 resources bundle.  5) WorksheetsMath is more fun with games and manipulatives but ofcourse their comes a time when a teacher needs students to have a little bit ofwritten practice, some homework or some kind of assessment.  My count by 2 worksheets offer a littlesomething for everyone.  There are 5different options for you to select from for your students.  They can count by 2’s to 30 or 50 or even120.  If you want students to have morepractice but don’t want to invest a lot of time into writing the numbers, thereis even a cut and paste activity you could choose.  These will work as assessments, homework orjust some written practice for this important skill.5 different options for worksheets are included in the bundle.  You can try this fun Cut and Glue activity for free!6) Fishy CountingAnother great game for the SMART board or individual computers, fishy counting is a fun way for kids to practice counting by 2's up to 20.  Find the fish that comes next in the count by 2 sequence and click on it!Try fishy counting over at ICT games7) Count by 2 Base 10 CardsThis is one hard working set of cards!  Here are a few of the many things you can dowith these cards.  1)Put them in orderface up and have kids practice counting by 2’s. As they gain fluency, flip some of the cards over so they can’t read thenumbers.  The ultimate goal here is tohave them count by 2’s without seeing the numbers so keep working on it untilthey can.2)Pass out a card toeach student in your class.  Have themget in order from smallest to largest. Practice counting by 2’s together.3)Give students a stackof these cards all mixed up.  Have themput them in order from least to greatest.These cards are included in my Count by 2's bundle!8) Count by 2 Missing Number StripsThis is one of my favorite games to use in math centersbecause it is so easy to differentiate. 16 different number strips are included and no matter where in the countby 2 sequence your students need work on, there is a missing number strip ortwo that will help.  I know kids reallyunderstand a counting skill when they can start and stop anywhere in thesequence.  Having opportunities to fillin the missing number in this sequence will lead to a better understandinglatter on when they are working with more complex number patterns.  Included in my Count by 2 bundle!9) Children's LiteratureI love including literature in my math lessons and counting by 2 is no exception.  My favorite book for counting by 2's is: What Comes in 2's, 3's & 4's?Reading this story with my students helps me provide a context as to what comes in 2's and why it is important to be able to count this way.  10) Memory     I like when Ican prep something once and use it in more than 1 way.  This activity uses the bingo cards and thefirst 2 pages of the base 10 count by 2 cards. There are several ways to play this depending on your students’ abilityto count by 2’s and how familiar they are with matching games.   You can also change the rules depending onif you want to use it for whole group, small group, partner or individualpractice.Option 1: Place the base 10 cards from 2-32 out whereyou can see them all.  Make a stack ofthe bingo cards.  Flip one bingo cardover at a time and find the matching base 10 card.Option 2: Shuffle some or all of the cards togethermaking sure you have included all matches. Place cards in an array and play memory. If you print the cards on two different colors, they will turn over oneof each color looking for matches. Option 3: Use the cards with the whole class by handingout cards to students and having them find their match.   Have students with matching cards standtogether shoulder to shoulder and check for accuracy.  Then place matches in pocket chart and talkabout how kids knew who their match was. How do you work on skip counting with your students?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

One Big Pair of UnderwearI have had this book for a few weeks and have already found a few ways to use it in the classroom.  Because it is a book about sharing and counting, it is a natural fit for Pre-K and Kindergarten classrooms.  The story line is super engaging, funny and does an excellent job combining sharing and counting concepts.  Just reading the story with your class will open up a lot of ideas about sharing, counting, one to one correspondence and writing numbers.  You can also grab a few great worksheets for free of the author's website which make this an ideal book to leave along with some plans and these worksheets in your emergency substitute plans.Simple worksheets that include pictures from the story are a great way to follow up reading this story.  This story is also great to use with older primary students to look at the difference model for subtraction.  I find that the difference model is much harder for students and teachers partially because they have less experience with it.  Several of the 12 types of addition and subtraction word problems are all about finding the difference and kids need a lot of hands on practice with this idea.   I used this book with a group of intervention second graders to get some more practice with compare type problems.  This lesson would also work well in a first grade classroom.  Check it out!We used 2 sided counters to place over each object.  We then matched up the 2 sided counters and saw that there was one more yellow one.  Pulling the counters off the bookShowing how they match up and using the language of how many more with a subtraction equationPracticing on another page.  Here we used the language of how many fewer (kids need exposure to both!).  We also reviewed the greater than and less than symbols.  How do you introduce the idea of the comparing model for subtraction?You might also be interested in:Addition and Subtraction Problems and the Common CoreFall Theme Addition and Subtraction Word Problem Task CardsPenguin Problem Solving: Addition and Subtraction Facts"},

{"title": "Fly on the Math Teacher's Wall: Place Value", "date": "Saturday, October 25, 2014", "text": "Tweet Today I am joining some great math teacher bloggers to bring you a new series of blog hops: Fly on the Math Teacher's Wall.  These blog posts will be all about SQUASHING teacher, student and parent misconceptions.  They will give you a look inside math teachers classrooms and help you find new ideas and understandings across the grade levels.  Today we are talking about place value.  Today I want to talk about decimals.  I feel like teachers have gotten pretty good at using manipulatives with young students first learning about place value.  However, I think there is a huge misconception that older kids learning decimals don't need as much hands on practice with models to develop their understanding.  I would like to SQUASH that misconception and share with you 6 different models for learning decimals.   Moving between these models will give your students the hands on experience they need while helping them to see how decimals are used in the world around us.  Base 10 BlocksThis is by far the most popular way for teachers to introduce decimals.  I use these myself when working on decimals with kids.  In fourth grade, when I first introduce decimals, I make a big production of using the document camera to \"zoom in\" on one of the units.  I tell kids I am getting really really close.  While doing this the camera goes out of focus a big and I trade the unit (1)  for the mat (100).  I tell them that when you get really close to the unit, you can see it is really broken into 100 pieces.  Of course they know right away that I traded pieces because it is usually very obvious.  However, this is where we reestablish that the mat which in the past has been worth 100 is now worth just one.  This means the strip which was formerly 10 is now worth a tenth and so on.  It takes kids a few tries to adjust to this way of thinking but they eventually do.  If you are looking to extend this or don't have a class set of base 10 blocks handy, I would recommend checking out this applet on the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives.  (You need Java for it to run)MoneyThis is often the most useful connection for students between decimals and real life.  By the time kids learn about decimals, they have often had some real life experiences with money and have a much better understanding of decimals when they are in a money context or written to the thousandths place.  If you ask a fourth grader who is just starting out with decimals if 1.8 or 1.09 is larger, they may or may not be able to answer it correctly.  If you ask them which is more money $1.80 or $1.09 they will probably think that is an easy question.  Connecting tenths and hundredths to dimes and pennies is one of the best ways to build on students prior understanding and help them construct new knowledge.  I like to make the connection between money and base 10 blocks explicit with these money value pieces from the Math Learning Center. Meter Stick(s)An model that is often overlooked in math classes for teaching decimals and other kinds of numbers is number lines.  I find teachers are spending more time modeling number lines in the lower grades now but it is still often something that is missing from decimal units.  Number lines are a great way to help kids think about ordering and comparing numbers.  They also make a great conversation starter to talk with kids about the density of numbers.  Asking questions such as \"how many numbers are between 1.2 and 1.3\" get at the idea that the numbers are infinite.  A meter stick is perfect for this kind of activity because it is already split into hundredths.  You can read more about how I use meter sticks for decimal number lines here.  Exploring the idea of density of decimals on a meter stick number line100 Bead String I use 100 bead strings for a huge variety of activities around counting, place value, decimals and percents.  They are easy to make and cost under $1 each so I make sure I always have plenty on hand.  They make a great number line because like the meter stick they are already broken into hundredths.  They also switch color every ten beads so the tenths are also easy to see.  There are no numbers written on the model to start with so it is a little bit different than the meter stick.   Read more about how I use the 100 bead string for decimals here.  Decimal Arrow CardsI love arrow cards for teaching place value and find them to be a vital tool to use in K-3 to work on numbers up to 10,000.  If kids are already familiar with arrow cards from younger grades, these are a super easy way to extend their understanding to the right of the decimal point.  If your kids haven't used them in previous grades it will only take you part of a class period to get them familiar with them on the whole number side and you will be ready to use them with decimals in no time.  You can grab a free set of printable arrow cards here and the decimal version is available here.  To read more about how I use arrow cards with kids, check out this post! Digit BlocksI first heard of Digi Blocks last fall and was very intrigued by the implications for place value.  I received a small collection of them from a colleague and have used them a great deal with intervention kids.  I recently watched a colleague at another school use decimal digi blocks and was super impressed with how well the kids understood place value.  They are one of the more expensive manipulatives but have actual pieces for tenths and hundredths.  You can read more about my first impression of digi blocks or head over to their website to learn more. When your kids are ready to move on from direct modeling, I highly recommend number talks.  This book is full of ready to go number talks for decimals.You know I love math picture books, my favorites for teaching decimals are Fractions, Decimals and Percents by David Alder and  Little Numbers by Edward Packard      One of my favorite decimal activities are these fall themed decimal task cards!Head over to Beyond Traditional Math to see what she has to say about teaching place value!"},
{"title": "Monday Math Literature: Pumpkin Math", "date": "Thursday, October 23, 2014", "text": "TweetMonday Math Literature is happening on Thursday this week but what can I say.... it has been a crazy week.  I wanted to share this book and lesson with you today because it is very seasonal and great fun to do in the fall.  Check out this fun book!How Many Seeds in a Pumpkin?This story is about a group of kids who are asked by their teacher to figure out how many seeds are in 3 different pumpkins.  They talk about the size of the pumpkins, estimating and counting ideas.  Some kids count by 2's some by 5's and some group the seeds into piles of 10.  There is also some great information in this story about how to estimate how many seeds a pumpkin has just by looking at the outside.  I love this lesson because it combines my love of math literature with counting and estimating routines.  I began this lesson by presenting my students with 2 pumpkins. I did this lesson with second graders but it would work with other kids K-3 with some small adaptations.  One was a very small Jack be Little pumpkin and the other was a larger pie pumpkin.  I asked them to estimate which one had more seeds.  Everyone was convinced that the larger pumpkin would have a lot more seeds.   We made some estimates but they were really all over the place ranging from 17-1000.   Next we cut the pumpkins in half and adjusted our estimates based on what we saw.  The estimates for the smaller pumpkin ranged from 80-200 and the estimates for the larger pumpkin ranged from 101-320.  The inside of the larger pumpkinInside of the smaller pumpkinKids worked in small groups and got all the seeds separated from the other guts.  When I do this lesson again, I will be sure to have more pumpkins because despite this being a smaller group of students, there were to many kids working on each pumpkin.  I would recommend no more than 4-5 kids per pumpkin for optimum working conditions.  Kids continued to adjust and refine their estimates as they put the seeds all in one place.  It was obvious to all students that there were more seeds in the large pumpkin than the smaller one.   After a quick rinse of the seeds, the groups counted them mostly grouping into 10's.  We came to the conclusion that the small pumpkin had 134 seeds and the large one had 285.  We spent some time comparing these numbers and wiring them in different ways.  We finished up the lesson by reading the book.  It was interesting for kids to compare their own experience with counting the seeds to the experience of the kids in the book.  This was a fun fall lesson and definitely one I will be doing in the future!  There are a lot of grade levels that I could apply this lesson with.  My K-2 kids will be following up this lesson with some work with pumpkin 10 frames.How do you use pumpkins in the classroom?"},

Chapter 28: Whole Brain Teaching and Learning ResearchThis chapter has some great points about the benefits of WBT.  I really like how they connected Whole Brain Teaching to being part direct instruction and part cooperative learning.  I have had a lot of professional development in these two areas and appreciate the connection between the two.  They both have their advantages and WBT seems to swing from using direct instruction to using cooperative learning. For the first time, I saw the word constructivisim  used in this chapter.  Since this is at the heart of my teaching style, it was nice to read about how Whole Brain Teaching is linked to students constructing their own knowledge and being in the zone of proximal development.  I still do have some reservations about how much lecturing can be involved in Whole Brain Teaching because I tend to do much less lecturing than other teachers.  I have to think more about how the WBT strategies can be used in a a more student driven environment.  I have watched several videos of Whole Brain Teaching being used in math class and they seem to be based on lecture.  I guess what I am still struggling with most is what does student individual practice and extended small group time look like with Whole Brain Teaching?  How about guided math time? Chapter 29: Additional ResearchI love numbers, statistics and percentages so I was excited to see some numbers on Whole Brain Teaching especially the percentage of educators who give it high ratings.  I think the biggest power in WBT is that students are more engaged.  This is the biggest issue I see in classrooms today.  Students are not engaged in the lesson, interested or paying attention.  No matter what great teaching you do, you can't be a great teacher unless your students are engaged.What are your feelings about the research behind Whole Brain Teaching?  What is your favorite Whole Brain Teaching strategy?  Please respond in the comments below."},

{"title": "Monday Math Literature: Identifying Coins", "date": "Monday, October 13, 2014", "text": "TweetSeveral weeks ago, I shared with you that I had recently purchased this book and was anxious to use the ideas in it with students.Why Can't I Have Everything?Teaching Today's Children to Be Financially and Mathematically Savvy     If you have never heard of this book, it is full of great ideas for getting kids to think about money and finances.  My goal with K-2 students is to make sure they know where money comes from and how it is used.  The best part about this book is that all the lessons incorporate literature!       Today I want to share with you a lesson from this book that is great for identifying coins.  It is lesson 1.2 in the book entitled Beginning to Identify Coins.  It could be used with kids from pre-k up to grade 2.  I choose to do this lesson with first graders.     This lesson could be done with any of the coins but I decided to focus on the quarter because this particular group of students already has good ideas and information about the other coins but always seems to be mixing up the nickel and the quarter.  I also think kids find the quarter challenging because there are so many different pictures on the back of it now with the 50 state quarters and the introduction of the National Park Quarters there are so many different things that kids might see on a quarter that it makes the job of teaching money harder.I began the lesson with the kids on the rug in a circle.  We started by passing around a cookie sheet with coins on top and having everyone find and take a quarter.  Some kids needed to look at other kid's quarter to figure out what they were looking for and a few kids took a nickel and had to switch but it all worked out in the end.  I then had kids take a good luck at their quarter and tell their neighbor one thing they noticed about the quarter.  Then everyone returned to their desks where I had placed crayons, quarter sheets of scrap paper and tape dispensers.  I found that a small piece of tape rolled into a circle and placed under the coin goes a long way towards holding the coin in place. If your student desks are not as smooth or if you are doing this on the carpet, you could skip this step.Next kids got to work rubbing with their crayons.  When I had put crayons out, I used our \"rubbing crayons\" which are older crayons missing their wrappers.  When we use these crayons, we most often use them horizontally so that is how kids started.  As you can see, this did not work well and only gave them an outline of the rim.  By holding the crayon vertically, they had much better luck.  The more gentle a student moved the crayon over the quarter, the better the rubbing seemed to come out.  Also darker colors seemed to show up better than lighter ones but when I took pictures of the rubbings, the lighter ones looked better.  Kids love doing crayon rubbings and figured out what worked best rather quickly.  As kids finished rubbing each side of the quarter, I let them come trade their quarter for another one and they were very excited to see different quarters.  After about 10 minutes, I had everyone bring their rubbings and the quarter they currently had back to the rug.  There they talked with a partner about their rubbings, shared what they learned and compared quarters.  I then pulled them all back together and we made a quick anchor chart about what we noticed and discovered about quarters.My new favorite way to make anchor charts is by using power point and a handwriting font by Teacher Gems.  This gives me the homemade look without my terrible handwriting and poor spelling.  I can project it on the smartboard or projector depending on what classroom I am in.  I can save it for later, share it with other teachers or students and print it and put it on the wall if I want to.  I used the math literature at the end of the lesson this time by reading Quarters to the class.  I like this book because it has big pictures and easy to read text.  It tells a bit about features of the quarter and goes into some details about the state quarters.  It is a level 7 book so many first graders can read this on their own.  After reading this book, we revisited and added to our anchor chart with the new information we learned about quarters.  This book was added to the students' shelf where they pick their own books for book boxes and such.  I love this series of books and purchased them several years ago from Scholastic but they look like they are currently out of print.  Your best chance to get this book right now would be to look for a used copy online.To follow up our learning about quarters and to provide students with more practice with the other coins, I put together a quick math center for students to work on independently over the following weeks.  In it I included a dish of coins, crayons, quarter sheets of paper and this microscope.  The students have been having a great time studying the coins by making coin rubbings and looking at them under the microscope.  I like this microscope for this kind of activity because it make the coins bigger but not so big that you can't see the whole coin at once.  It also has been dropped on the floor repeatedly and has not broken!  It gives you a similar magnification as a magnifying glass but is easier for little kids to use and the kids think they are really cool using a microscope.  We had a great time doing this lesson and can't wait to try out more ideas from this book!  What are your favorite ways to practice coin identification?  Please respond in the comments below!Head over to The Teacher Studio for more Loved That lesson posts!Check out these other ideas for teaching money!Teaching Math With You Tube Videos: CoinsHow Much Money?

{"title": "10 Ways to use 10 Frames", "date": "Saturday, October 11, 2014", "text": "TweetClip art by Whimsy ClipsMy students are so engaged by the changing of the seasons and learning with a theme that I try to incorporate the seasons into what we do each day.  Because some members of our school community are not really into celebrating holidays in the classroom, I try to stick with lots of activities around the different seasons rather than specific holidays.  Fall is a great time to bring pumpkin, apples and leaves into the classroom.  When I saw this great set of 10 frame clip art by Graphics From the Pond I knew I wanted to make a new set of 10 frame cards.                When I made a set of cards and spend time and money putting them on cardstock or laminating them, I want them to serve more than one purpose.  Ten frames (and twenty and five frames) have so many uses in the classroom, so I put together 10 ways to use these cards with kids.  These activities work great in Kindergarten and first grade classes and can be used for whole group, math centers or interventions.  With the mix of ten frame cards and numeral cards, it is easy to differentiate the activities to meet a diverse group of needs.   10 Frame FlashThismakes an excellent whole group, small group or partner activity.  Simply flash the 10 frame at your studentsfor 1-3 seconds and then ask them how many pumpkin seeds they saw and how theyknow they are right.  Read more about this here!Matching Numerals and 10 FramesAs a whole group game this can be a lot of fun and agreat way to work on numbers to 10!  Passout 10 frames and numerals and ask kids to find their match.  You can then display them on a pocket chartand talk about what they see.  Kids canalso do this on their own or with a partner. Spread out all the numeral cards and make a pile of the 10 frame cards.  Have the student(s) pick a card from the 10frame pile and find it’s match in the numeral pile.  You can also switch this around and spreadout the 10 frame cards and have them pick a numeral card.  10 Frame MemoryAn easy twist on a classic game!  This game is great for kids to play with a partner or ina small group.  Simply mix all of thecards together, do a bit of shuffling and then arrange in a rectangulararray.  If your students are not readyfor all the 10 frames you can pick and choose. Just make sure you have the corresponding numerals and 10 frames!Note: Your students should be familiar with matching 10frames before trying this activity!Sequential and Non Sequential OrderingThese activities can be done as a large group by givingeach kid a number (until you run out!) and having them get in order from leastto greatest.  It also works great as anindividual task or a partner activity.  Once kids have the cardsin order, it is agreat time for kids to practice counting forward and backwards.  Make sure your students get a chance to put numbers in orderthat are not sequential as well.  Thisactivity can be done with just the numeral cards or with both the numeral and 10frame cards together.  Roll and BuildThis is a simple and effective game! All you need issome blank 10 frames, 10 sided dice and pumpkin seeds.   If you don’t have pumpkin seeds bingo chipsor other small markers will work just as well. Students can play alone or with a partner.  Roll the die, and build that number on theten frame.  This goes much faster if kidsdo not remove the bingo chips each time but just add more or take some off asthey roll.  The pumpkin seeds I used got rinsed off and left out for a few hours on a towel to dry.  The kids had a lot of fun with them!Odd and Even SortThese cards are a great way to practice odd and evennumbers.  Using the 10 frame cards iseasier than just the numerals but when your students are ready go ahead and usethem all!  Check out more ways to work on odd and even. Flip and Write Combinations of TenYou can never have to many games for combinations of 10and this is a great one requiring little teacher prep.  Give the student a stack of 10 frame cards ornumeral cards if they are ready.  Havethem flip over a card and write an equation showing how many seeds they see andhow many more they need to make 10.  I usually have kids create their own record sheet for this activity on a piece of scrap paper.  It saves prep time and money!  You also might want to check out computer games for combinations of 10.Make 10 Go FishThis is one of my students’ favorite games forpracticing combinations of 10.  Mix twosets of the ten frame cards together. Shuffle and distribute 4-5 cards to each player.  Have each kid look for matches that maketen.  For example the 3 and the 7 are amatch and the 6 and the 4 are another one. When all matches have been found in individual player’shands, have them play go fish.  If I havethe 2 card in my hand, I would ask another player, “do you have the 8 to gowith my 2 to make 10?”  That player wouldrespond “yes I do or no I don’t have the 8 to go with your 2 to make 10.  This language can be challenging to studentswhen you first start but they will catch on quick!Read more about how I use this game in the classroom and see some pictures of the game in action.Pyramid 10This is played like the classic solitaire gamepyramid.  Mix two sets of ten frame cardstogether or use one set of ten frame cards and one set of numeral cards if yourstudents are ready.  Students make apyramid and find matches that make ten.  Read more about how my students play pyramid and see more pictures!Mystery Card (Addition and Subtraction)This is a fun game and a nice challenge when studentsare ready.  This game must be played ingroups of 3.  Two players choose a 10frame card and place them on their foreheads. The third player finds the sum of the two numbers on their foreheads andtells  what it is.  Then each of the players with cards on their headslooks at the other person’s card and tries to determine what card theyhave.  This lets one student practiceadding 2 numbers under 10 while the other two students practice solving missingaddend or subtraction problems.  The 10frame visual really supports this learning. I like to change out the 10 frame playing cards with the seasons to keep things fresh for my students!  You can grab the pumpkin playing cards here or the spring seeds card set here. Looking to extend these activities for older students or those who are ready for a challenge?  Check out my Double 10 Frames Activity Set!If you are looking for more ways to get 10 frames into your classroom, I highly recommend picking up a copy of Using Ten Frames to Build Number Sense.  It is full of great ideas that are easy to implement in the classroom."},

I also like how the guff counter encourages positive interactions between students not just focusing on the teacher to student relationship.  Chapter 20: The IndependentsThis seems to be the most effective way to break up those groups of students who encourage each other's bad behavior.  I love that \"rebellious behavior by one student has an immediate unpleasant effect upon the other students in the independent group.\"  The fact that kids can opt out of being in this group simply by asking seems to really be effective in breaking up a group's unity.  The deeper life lesson of knowing that is important to choose one's friends wisely takes this level of scoreboard to a very important idea for success not only in the classroom but for life in general.  This level also does wonderful things for the kids who are always behaving by putting the worst offenders in their own group.Chapter 21: The Bull's Eye GameThis level of scoreboard involved no punishment and is reserved for the most challenging students.  I can see the appeal in this for many kids because it is configured like a game, there are no penalties and it is all reward.  This seems like an engaging way to really work on specific behaviors.  Because the approach is so intentional and one one one it also seems like a great way to build a stronger teacher to student relationship with your most challenging students.Chapter 22: The Agreement BridgeI have worked for many years with a wonderful guidance counselor that often problem solves with students in a manner very similar to the Agreement Bridge and I have seen it work wonderfully.  I love how it works towards solving problems while making teacher to student relationships stronger.  It is non threatening and interesting that it is in a game format.  I think this could really help kids learn to problem solve and set them up to be successful in school.  What are your thoughts about these ideas?  I look forwarding to reading your comments!"},

Richard Evan Schwartz, the author of You Can Count on Monsters has written another book.Really Big NumbersThis is not your average Math Literature book!  The first thing that is very different about this book is the length.  It is the longest picture book I own at almost 200 pages.  Another thing that is very different is the pictures.  They were made with a computer drawing program called Inkscape which makes them engaging and bright.  It also makes the diagrams and other mathematical pictures blend in nicely with the more traditional illustrations.  The book starts out with the premises that reading this book is like climbing a ladder.  You might not make it all the way to the top the first time.  This is really a book that a kid can have around for years and get a bit more out of each time they read it and their mathematical knowledge grows.I plan on using this book in just about every grade this year.  Here are some of my ideas about using this book in various classrooms.Using this book with K-1 StudentsKids this age seem to think 100 is the biggest number in the world.  I like the idea of using the first 40 pages or so with young children to introduce them to the idea of bigger numbers.  These pages take them through some big ideas for primary kids about counting by 10's, what 100 looks like, counting by 100's and the idea of one thousand.  I love how this book shows 100 pictured in many ways and I would bring this into the classroom by giving small groups of kids 100 dot stickers and having them make a picture or a display of some sort.  This would be a great way of helping them with estimating and counting skills.   Taking it to the next level in grades 2-3As kids start second grade and begin working with numbers up to 1000 I often start getting questions about much bigger numbers.  This is also when the competitions seem to start where kids try to name bigger numbers than their friends.  This is also when I hear a lot of fake numbers like a gillion (which historically was a number), a zillion or a bazillion.  This is when I like to have \"the talk\" with kids about bigger numbers.  After \"the talk\" there are always kids who have more questions about big numbers than I have answers to and this book would be a great way to help answer some of those questions.  I could read the first third of this book to the whole class and leave it out for those kids who are ready for more to explore on their own or in a small group.   Getting at some big ideas in grades 4-6At this level, I have some kids who are already showing huge mathematical potential.  I have kids who are always thinking about math.  The questions in this book like \"how many ways can you color a tic-tac-toe board with three colors\" get kids brains thinking and seeing math in their everyday lives.  There are many good questions and ideas in this book that could provide the basis of a challenge for kids who are already meeting classroom standards and are ready to take their math learning to the next level. As a whole group lesson, many students of this age would benefit from reading most of this book.  Kids this age really like to know about what they are going to learn in middle school or high school and this book can give them some ideas about that in a friendly and nonthreatening way.  Hearing number words like quintillion and octillion make kids laugh and keep them engaged in learning more about math.  The focus on powers of 10 really helps kids build on previous place value knowledge and learn how exponents can really speed things up.  By the time you get to the back cover, you will be exploring numbers that are completely abstract and very complex.  There will probably be things you as a teacher learn about big numbers from reading this book.  You might not make it to the end the first time you read this to a class or even read it to yourself but the next time you pick it up, you might be ready to read a bit farther.  This book has a lot of potential for sparking mathematical curiosity in your students while increasing your own knowledge and understanding of really big numbers.   How would you use this book with your students?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

It is our belief that when math is explored in contexts that are familiar and of interest to students, students will be more engaged to do math, reason, think critically, question and communicate.  Our activities are written to correspond with the NCTM Process Standards and the CCSS Standards for Mathematical Practice.\"I have used these problems multiple times in whole class situations and have had some great engagement.  When I have the opportunity to work with small groups of students who are really excited about math, these problems have been a lifesaver.  There are many problems that kids can solve in small groups or pairs during guided math time and they are a great way to help differentiate your instruction.  All problems are provided in a PDF format for FREE!  For a small membership fee which is currently $17.95 per year you get access to answer keys and editable word documents so you can change the problems to suit your students.  Here are a few of my favorite Yummy Math problems that my students solved last school year.We played with ratios and proportions trying to figure out how much dye it takes to turn the Chicago river green for the St. Patrick's Day Parade.  My students learned a lot about light bulbs and energy conservation with this investigation.  I originally did it with my fifth graders but had so much success, I repeated it with sixth and fourth graders as well. My sixth graders got a lesson in economics with this cell phone investigation problem.  In my area many kids seem to be getting cell phones before starting seventh grade so this investigation really made my kids aware of how much different wireless options cost.  It also lead them to explore other options online and ultimately led me to the decision to switch my plan to Republic Wireless.My students of all ages enjoyed doing parts and pieces of this problem!  A Santa made entirely of 12 packs of soda!  The ultimate problem for counting, estimating and multiplicative reasoning!This is just a small sample of the many wonderful problems offered by Yummy Math.  Be sure to check it out! Also check out all the other great ideas in the You Oughta Know Blog Hop!

Is there anyone who has tried either of these ideas in their own classroom that can tell us more?Chapter 5: Brain Science     I am fascinated with brain science but have not yet seemed to get much of what I read about it into long term memory.  I think it is all the terminology and the fact that I am usually just reading it.  The exercise at the beginning of the chapter where you use your hands to represent the brain really helped me visualize the different parts of the brain and how they work together to control emotions and learning.       I think the downfall of many teachers' management systems is habituation.  \"Habituation occurs when an individual's response to a stimulus decreases after repeated stimulation.\" I find that teachers will be very excited about a new management system, will introduce it to kids, the kids will do well for a few days or weeks and then it stops working.   As kids get used to something, the response is not the same.  That is why I am very curious to learn more about the different levels of scoreboard.  I can't wait to see how this will help combat habituation. Chapter 6: Class-YesEasy, fast and effective.  Love!Chapter 7: Five Powerful Classroom RulesIn my school district, we use responsive classroom and one of the elements of responsive classroom is to have kids come up with the rules.  As well as this can work, I also think it becomes less and less effective as kids get older.  By sixth grade, they have already participated in writing the classroom rules 6 other times and frankly are usually tired of it.  Especially because the rules always turn out to be so similar.   I love the idea of laying down the rules with the class and all the fun rehearsing that can go into these rules.  I was also excited to read about having the class vote the rules in because this seems to help with the buy in and ownership without seeming like a labor intensive task that kids have already done repeatedly in the past. What are your thoughts on this week's chapters?  If you are already using whole brain teaching, what can you tell us about how the classroom rules work for you?"},

I have written several times about the importance of 10 frames but this is a fun way to get kids lots of practice with the structure of 10 frames in a fun and engaging way.All you need is some table space and a roll of painting tape.  The roll I used is Scotch 2 inch tape.  Thinner tape would work just as well if not better!  I have had this roll for various projects at home and school for at least 5 years.  The reason for using painting tape is that it will not peal the finish of your surface or leave a sticky mess behind.  I like to get this set up and let the kids play with it before addressing it as a whole group.  I put the cars or animals or other themed thing nearby and let them try it out.  It is a great way to tie in a classroom theme if you have one.  Once they have had some experience with playing with the 10 frame, I like to bring them together and talk about how we can use 10 frames for numbers and math.  There are many things you can do with 10 frames to improve early numeracy, you can check a bunch of them out here!  You might also be interested in checking out how I made this magnetic 10 frame!"},

If you are within 5 degrees, you rescue the alien and get a point.  A full game consists of 10 rounds like this.  I find that kids (and adults!) usually do quite poorly the first time they play this game but usually start figuring it out as the first game ends.  It is fun and motivating though and most kids want to play again right away.  It really helps kids think about the math behind angle measuring rather than just doing it.  Have you tried Alien Angles with your class?  What are you favorite computer games for geometry concepts?"},

The broad application of these ideas also appeals greatly to me.  I have always taught in fairly rural areas and in elementary schools but these ideas do seem to be universal.  Even my most challenging class to manage was a walk in the park compared to some situations I know teachers have been in.  If all kids are always constantly learning either positive or negative behaviors, I am all for a system that emphasizes the positives.  In my experience, when kids are engaged and entertained their behavior is excellent.  Seven Common Teaching MistakesOf the seven common teaching mistakes listed in Chapter 3, numbers 1 and 3 resonated with me the most.  \"When we lost our temper with difficult kids and yell at them, we don't fix our teaching problem we make it worse.\"  Over and over again I hear from students that I have known for years that their least favorite teachers are those who tend to yell a lot.  This is especially true of substitute teachers.  These teachers do not know the kids well and lack a strong foundation relationship.  One incident of yelling by a substitute seems to turn kids off to that substitute for the rest of the year.  Teachers who routinely yell at kids are also greatly disliked in my school and kids often seem to be plotting against them.  Teaching mistake number 3 is about making sure you stay organized.  \"Disorganized teachers breed chaotic classrooms.  If you have mutinous students, a good way to make your problem worse is by shooting from the hip.  The less class structure you have, the less structured your classes will be.\"  I love this point and have seen it played out in my own school.  As a teacher who spends a lot of time in other teachers' classrooms, I get to see all kinds of management styles and how kids react to them.  The biggest difference between the teachers who I would say are good at management and the teachers who are great at it is the structure in their classroom.  The very best teachers I have seen and try to emulate are 100% consistent in their structure.  They are on top of what their class is doing at all times.  They have their lessons ready and have planned things to stay within a structure.  No matter what the situation, they always have a plan.  I am looking forward to reading what others thought about these chapters!  Which of the seven common mistakes do you find in your school?  If you are already implementing some whole brain teaching strategies, how is it going?"},
{"title": "Monday Math Literature Volume 58", "date": "Monday, September 1, 2014", "text": "TweetOne of the first things I made sure first graders can do when we get back to school is count to 120.  It is a huge standard in Kindergarten and after a long summer, I always get a few kiddos who come back not counting to 120 fluently.  I like to spend some time in the first weeks of first grade reviewing the numbers to 100 and introducing some counting and estimating ideas that we will build on later.  I knew I wanted to connect literature to this lesson and I got this fantastic book last year that is full of flaps to lift.  I originally bought it for my nephew's birthday because he loves lift flap books but once I got it, I knew I needed one for my classroom too.David Carter's 100: Lift the Flaps and Learn to Count!This book is FULL of flaps to lift.  There are actually 100!   It is super fun for kids to read and a great way to review counting to 100.  Each flap is numbered so there is also practice with symbolic notation built right in.  You can get a good look at this book here! This fall, I decided to tie this book together into a lesson using this picture.Which picture shows 100?I had a bunch of colored paper clips laying around from my magnetic addition strips project and decided to use them in a lesson of 100.  I took 4 different pictures of 100 paper clips arranged in various ways and put them together into one image.  If you want to do this lesson with you class, you can grab this image from Google drive as a pdf or as a png.After reading the book, I showed this image on the projector for about 10 seconds and then covered it and asked kids to think about which picture shows 100 paper clips.  I then let them see for another 15 seconds or so and once again covered it.  Next kids were asked to turn and talk with a neighbor about which picture they thought showed 100 and why they chose it.  Next we shared as a class.  About 80% of the kids selected picture #2 and the rest chose picture #3.  This did not surprise me at all because 100 seems like a lot to a young child and photos 1 and 2 are more spread out and therefore look like more.  When I told the kids that all the pictures show 100, they did not believe me.  I had to actually get 100 paperclips out and prove it to them!  I had already put the paperclips back into a larger container so I had to have the kids help me count out 100 again but it actually worked out well because it gave them one more chance to practice their counting. We wrapped the lesson up with a little movement and counting with this video You might also be interested in checking out some other videos I use to practice counting.  Want to see more ways to use math literature in the classroom?  Check out the Math Literature tab at the top of this blog!How have you used literature in math class?Head over to Mrs. Jump's class for more great literature to use in your classroom."},

{"title": "My Favorite Classroom Supplies: 3 Hole Punch", "date": "Friday, August 29, 2014", "text": "TweetLike many teachers, I have a thing for school supplies.  I use them every day and want quality at a good price.  My philosophy for school supplies is not to buy the cheapest things, but rather the things that will give me the best value over their lifetime.  A teacher I work with has a paper cutter that she purchased when she first started teaching in 1962.  It is huge, heavy, sharp and still works like a charm.  That is ideally what I want from my school supplies.  If that can't happen, I do want them to last as long as possible.  Last spring, I shared with you my favorite pencil sharpener and today I want to tell you about another one of my school supply loves.I purchased this 3 hole puncher in the spring of 2004.  I was working as a classroom teacher in a 4th grade class and had already gone through several 3 hole punches when I decided enough was enough.  I took a pool of other teachers in the school to see what they were using, what they loved or hated about their 3 hole punch and tallied the results.  It was amazing how passionate teachers were about school supplies!  Then I headed down to my local Staples (this was before my love affair with Amazon began). I picked out this little fellow.And I fell in LOVE!After 10 years I am happy to say that I am still in love with this thing and here are the top five reasons why1. The paper guide does NOT adjust!  About 99.9% of the time my students or I need to punch holes, it is on an 8.5\"X11\" piece of paper.  Having the paper guide stable makes it easy and accurate to ALWAYS have the holes line up.  No more changing that paper guide or having it break off!2. The handle is easy to lock down into a not using place.  Because I have had this hole puncher through multiple classrooms, schools and grade levels, the ability to lock the handle down easily has been great for safety.  3. It can punch holes in a lot of paper at once.  This hole puncher is rated for 40 sheets of hole punching capacity and I have easily done 40 sheets or maybe even a few more many times over the last 10 years. 4. The paper circles cut out of the holes are cleanly cut out and stored in a large container below the puncher.  I can not stand when you use a 3 hole punch and it leaves the little paper circles attached in one corner and you have to rip them off.  Not acceptable and it makes a huge mess in my classroom.  5. You don't have to push with all your strength or weight to get it to work!  I have worked with kids from Kindergarten up through 8th grade and none of them have struggled to push down on this thing.  The big level and sturdy construction allow a gentle push to get the job done.10 years young!After 10 years, this thing still gets used every day and still looks fairly new.  Here is to hoping the next 10 years are as good as the last 10 years!  My hope is that if my teaching career lasts the same 50 years that my colleagues has that thing thing will still be beside me.  I just purchased my first laminator this week after checking out a lot of reviews on Amazon.  Here is to hoping that I will still be in love with this after 10 years.  What are your favorite school supplies?

{"title": "Math Books That Will Change Your Teaching!", "date": "Saturday, August 23, 2014", "text": "TweetToday I am teaming up with some of the best math bloggers out there to bring you 12 different math books that will change your teaching!  Each blogger has chosen a different book to tell you about and will be giving away a copy of that book on their blog.  Check out this great group of blog hop participants! I spend a lot of my time reading math and teaching professional development books.  I always get some good information out of the books I read but only a handful of them get a special spot on my shelf as the books that I will recommend over and over again to other teachers.  Today I want to tell you about one of those books.  A Focus on Fractions: Bringing Research to the ClassroomI first read this book when it came out in 2010 and it completely changed the way I teach fractions.  The authors of this book read all of the research on how kids learn fractions and present it in an easy to read format.  Chapter 1: Modeling and Developing Understanding of Fractions    What kinds of models does your math program use?  Do you know there are three different kinds of models that kids need to interact with as they are developing and understanding of fractions?  I certainly did not!  This chapter will walk you through area, set and linear models and give you some ideas for incorporating more modeling into your classroom.  I found linear models completely lacking from my math program when I first read this book.  As I gradually addressed these changes and added more modeling into our program, I noticed a big difference in kids' understanding and ability to use models to solve problems.Chapter 2: Inappropriate Use of Whole Number Reasoning     Have you ever had a kid tell you 1/4 is bigger than 1/3 because 4 is bigger than 3?  This is just one example of inappropriate whole number reasoning.  This chapter also gets into some detailed ways that teachers actually TEACH kids to use inappropriate whole number reasoning during their early fraction instruction.  This is a huge eye opener to most teachers, especially those who teach first and second grade.  I had to tweak some of the wording I use with kids when I teach first and second grade fractions.  Chapter 3: What is the Whole?     This chapter helped me push students conceptual understanding of fractions much deeper.  It made me realize that all the questions I was asking involved giving the students the whole and asking them to find a part.  I never thought of asking kids to find a whole when given a part.  An example of this would be showing kids what half of the candy bar looks like and asking them what the whole would be.  These problems seem so awkward at first when you are not used to asking them but quickly become part of your repertoire and really help push kids' thinking to the next level.  Chapter 4: Partitioning     This chapter made a huge difference in how I use models with kids and how I teach them to use models as well.  This breaks down the difference types of partitioning and shows you how to move kids from halving to more complex fractions.  Good drawing of models has gone a long way in helping my kids construct all kinds of algorithms and notice many patterns in their fraction understanding.  Think about how you would teach kids to draw eighths or fifths or twelfths.  Check out this chapter for more help!Chapter 5: Comparing and Ordering Fractions     Before you read on, think about how many strategies there are for comparing fractions.  I could think of one and only one before reading this book.  The common denominator.  Well I was VERY wrong about that.  Now I listen to my students very carefully when giving them comparing fraction type problems.  I also am much more intentional in which fractions I ask them to compare so that I can elicit some of the different strategies.  This chapter outlines five different strategies for comparing fractions and your students WILL invent these on  their own if given the right fractions.  This chapter gives teachers lots of aha moments!Chapter 6: Number Lines and Fractions     I am a bit embarrassed to admit that before reading this book, I did little to no work with linear or number line models for fractions.  Fraction number lines barely made an appearance in our state standards and showed up very inconsistently in our math program.  After reading this book, I discovered the power of the number line and now my number line lessons are some of my favorite ways to elicit the big ideas of fractions and to help kids make connections between fractions, decimals and percents. Chapter 7: The Density of Fractions     This is about really getting at the big idea of infinity and more specifically that there are an infinite number of fractions between any two whole numbers.   The number line model really supports this big idea!  Think about asking your students to name two fractions between one fourth and one half.  Could they do it?  How about naming two fractions between seven eights and a whole?  See how these questions can open up some great discussions?Chapter 8: Equivalent Fractions and Comparisons     Finding equivalent fractions is such an important skill for kids to have!  It is the gateway to fraction operations and something many MANY kids need more work with.  Chapter 9: Addition and Subtraction of Fractions     Now that my district follows the Common Core State Standards, we do a lot more with fraction addition and subtraction in grades 4 and 5.  Most of this work used to be done in grade 6.  The biggest aha I got from this chapter is that just because a kid can follow the common denominator procedure to add or subtract fractions does not mean they have any understanding of the quantities.  There is an example in the book that asks kids which number the sum of two fractions is closest to and a kid does a great job showing fraction addition with common denominators, gets a fraction like 19/20 and then says the sum is closest to 20!Chapter 10: Multiplication and Division of Fractions     This chapter is chuck full of great ideas for fraction multiplication and division which has always been something I had struggled to teach in a conceptual way.  This is where I first thought about using the area model for fraction multiplication.  If you teach fractions, this is definitely a book that could change your teaching!  It is loaded with examples of real student work and will open your eyes to some new ideas for teaching fractions.  It also is a great example of using formative assessment to inform your instruction.  Go grab this book now or enter below for your chance to win a FREE COPY!  This giveaway is open to folks living in the US or Canada!  At the bottom of this page you can head over to the next stop on this blog hop!a Rafflecopter giveaway"},

There are a lot of facts about bugs in this book!  It is a great way to build vocabulary and non-fiction knowledge about bugs but let's talk about using this for math.  This crew of kids has been working on numbers to 20 and we used this book and some realistic plastic bugs to further explore counting, numbers to 20 and pairs that make 20. Many pages have multiple bugs pictured on them and these are the pages we focused on when using this book for math.  We figured out how many bugs were pictured and how many more we would need to make 20. Another picture that is great for figuring out how many bugs are there.  I know these kids very well and was able to call on kids who I know need more practice with one to one correspondence to help me count up these bugs.  We then used the plastic bugs and these bug 20 frame cards to help us work more on numbers to 20.  We also made a small world/sensory bin for the bugs which they had great fun with while reviewing vocabulary, counting and other skills!Using the plastic bugs to help us solve problems.  Notice how they look like a 20 frame?  This helps students connect this lesson to the next one and the 20 frame bug learning center they will be using.Our bug sensory  binWe also threw in a counting and estimating routine to kick off our days of using bugs in math.As a kick off to using this book, we estimated and then counted the bugs in this bug box.We finished our work up on bugs and numbers to 20 with these cute bug themed 20 frames!

Using Ten-frames to Build Number Sense. I have posted about using 10 frames in the past but today I want to share with you some specific things I do with this great set of bug themed 20 frames and their corresponding numeral cards.   I love materials where you can prep them once and use them over and over again and these cards certainly have many uses!  I also like when each \"deck\" is easy to identify and you don't have to search for where a missing card belongs.  That is why I like the 4 different bug cards here.  It keeps my sets straight with little work on my part.  Here are some ways I use these20 Frame FlashThismakes an excellent whole group, small group or partner activity.  Simply flash the 20 frame at your studentsfor 1-3 seconds and then ask them how many bugs they saw and how they know theyare right.  I like to give pairs a few minutes to talk about how they knew they were right and then share some strategies as a whole group.20 Frame and Numeral Match MemoryAs a whole group game this can be a lot of fun and agreat way to work on numbers to 20!  Passout 20 frames and numerals and ask kids to find their match.  You can then display them on a pocket chartand talk about what theysee.  Kids can also do this on their own or with apartner.  Spread out all the numeralcards and make a pile of the 20 frame cards. Have the student(s) pick a card from the 20 frame pile and find it’smatch in the numeral pile.  You can alsoswitch this around and spread out the 20 frame cards and have them pick anumeral card.  Ordering Sequential and Non Sequential NumbersTheseactivities can be done as a large group by giving each kid a number (until yourun out!) and having them get in order from least to greatest.  It also works great as an individual task ora partner activity.  Make sure yourstudents get a chance to put numbers in order that are not sequential as well. 20 Frame/Numeral MatchAs a whole group game this can be a lot of fun and agreat way to work on numbers to 20!  Passout 20 frames and numerals and ask kids to find their match.  You can then display them on a pocket chartand talk about what theysee.  Kids can also do this on their own or with apartner.  Spread out all the numeralcards and make a pile of the 20 frame cards. Have the student(s) pick a card from the 20 frame pile and find it’smatch in the numeral pile.  You can alsoswitch this around and spread out the 20 frame cards and have them pick anumeral card.  Mystery Card (A Missing Addend Game)This is a fun game and a nice challenge when studentsare ready.  This game must be played ingroups of 3.  Two players choose a 20frame card and place them on their foreheads. The third player finds the sum of the two numbers on their foreheads andtells  what it is.  Then each of the players with cards on their headslooks at the other person’s card and tries to determine what card theyhave.  This lets one student practiceadding 2 numbers under 20 while the other two students practice solving missingaddend or subtraction problems.  The 20frame visual really supports this learning. Odd/Even SortThese cards are a great way to practice odd and evennumbers.  Using the 20 frame cards is easier than just thenumerals but when your students are ready go ahead and use them all!Build it!This is a simple and effective game! All you need is someblank 20 frames, 20 sided dice and bingo chips. Students can play alone or with a partner.  Roll the die, and build that number on theten frame.  This goes much faster if kidsdo not remove the bingo chips each time but just add more or take some off asthey roll.  If you want kids to practice specific teen numbers, usea blank die and write the numbers on you wish to have them practice.    Make 20A fun way to practice combinations of 20!  Students pick a 20 frame and use bingo chips or other small manipulatives to figure out what goes with their number to make 20.  It is quick and easy to have students create a record sheet to go along with this!Check out a few of the other bug designs!  Clip art is by Graphics From the Pond!You can grab your own set of these 20 frames over at TPT!"},
{"title": "Teach Like a Pirate Book Study Part 5: Building a Better Pirate", "date": "Saturday, August 9, 2014", "text": "TweetWelcome to the conclusion of the Teach Like a Pirate Book Study!  It is not to late to join in, so if you are looking for some inspiration for your teaching, grab a copy of the book and join our discussion!  Feel free to leave your discussion in the comments or if you have a blog and want to do a post about it, leave a link in the comments.  I have to say that I have so enjoyed reading this book and it has really helped renew my enthusiasm for teaching.  This book is going to have a permanent place in my collection and will be one I will be going back to for inspiration and fresh ideas.  Teach Like a PirateHere is the posting scheduleJuly 12 Passion and ImmersionJuly 19 Rapport and Ask and AnalyzeJuly 26 Transformation and EnthusiasmAugust 2 Part II: Crafting engaging lessonsAugust 9 Part III: Building a better piratePart III: Building a Better PirateDo you want to be great?  That is the big question in this section.  Do you want your classroom to be a place where students are engaged and building a love of learning.  Working towards being great makes you a better teacher and keeps your enthusiasm and passion strong.  \"Teaching is a tough job filled with unbelievable hardships, hurdles, and headaches.  Our profession has a notoriously high burnout rate.  Unless you find something big to care about, you won't make it.\" I know I want to be a great teacher and when I am committed to putting passion and enthusiasm into my teaching, I enjoy it more and so do my students.  I love when colleagues notice my positive attitude and complement me on not just going through the motions. I love the comments in this section about failing in the classroom.  If you play it safe all the time, not only are you not having any fun with your teaching, but you are not pushing your limits in your efforts to become great.  Some of my very best lessons have risen out of others that were complete disasters.  \"If you haven't failed in the classroom lately, you probably aren't pushing the envelope enough.  You are being too safe.\" There is no perfect time to try out the lesson or the new strategy.   You  have to jump in with both feet and know that the cost of one failed lesson is not that high.  This advice rings so true with my own teaching practices as well as those times where I have been the teacher during professional development with other colleagues.  If you let fear of failing get in the way, it can be very difficult to get started. Finding your crewOne of the things that has had the strongest impact on my teaching is the people I have met along the way.  All of the opportunity I have had for co-teaching has led me to develop relationships and learn from a huge variety of educators.  Attending conferences and taking courses had benefited me not only from the increased knowledge but from the increased opportunity to develop relationships and share my passion with other educators.  I have also been able to connect with teachers worldwide through my own and other educators blogs and Facebook pages.  I also have been fortunate enough to have a \"best teacher friend\" who I have been able to co-teach with, collaborate with and who has always been there to bounce ideas off of and push my teaching to the next level. Classroom Kung FuIn my school district it seems like every few years we buy a new math or literacy program that is supposed to fix everything and make everyone achieve the standards.  Despite words like fidelity to the program and rigor being thrown around, the program has never (and will never) fix all out problems.  \"Districts and schools always seem to be investing in the latest, greatest program to solve all their problems.\"  It is not a program that will fix your school's problems.  It is people.  Teachers.  Great teachers who are always looking to \"add more and more moves to their teaching style.\" Wrapping it Up!My biggest take-away from this book is to continue to find what sparks my passion and enthusiasm for teaching and to think outside the box.  If you don't have passion and enthusiasm for your job than you need to find it or move onto something else!  The more passion and enthusiasm you have the better your potential for becoming a great teacher.  Find what fuels you and bring it into your classroomWhat makes you passionate and enthusiastic in the classroom!  I look forward to reading your responses! TweetI am excited to be linking but today with Mrs. McClain for the You Oughta Know Blog HopI want to share with you a free online resource that I use over and over again with students in all grades.  It is the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives which is maintained by Utah State University.The manipulatives are organized by strand (Number & Operations, Algebra, Geometry, Measurement, and Data Analysis & Probability) as well as by grade cluster (Pre K-2, 3-5, 6-8 and 9-12).  If you need a manipulative you can probably find it there!  I have used many different manipulatives for specific classroom purposes as well as letting students explore a particular category.  You must have Java installed on your computer to run the manipulatives.  If you don't have Java, it is a free download and easy to install! Today I will share with you a few of my favorites!Fractions- ComparingYou can find this one under number and operations grades 3-5.  It is a fun tool to use on a projector or SMART board as a demonstration tool or as a student learning center or partner game.  It starts by showing two fractions.  The number of pieces can be changed on each until they are both equal pieces and the same size.   Once the pictures have equal pieces of the same size, you can rename the fraction so they have the same denominator. Once you click on check and have the right answer, you plot your fractions on a number line.  Next you have to find a fraction between your two fractions.  I love this for thinking about fraction density!  Density is often something teachers and math books skip or do not emphasis but it is super important! Click check and if you are right it will ask you to find another fraction between your two fractions.  This will go on and on until you click new fractions.  I use this virtual manipulative in grades 3-5.  I ALWAYS use this with my fourth graders!Number Line Bars- FractionsThis is my absolute favorite of all the virtual manipulatives.  When I found this about 6 years ago, it completely changed the way I teach fraction division and helped my students understand this challenging idea so much better!  I even did an action research project on this topic for my master's thesis and the results of using this manipulative to teach fraction division were statistically significant.  I have created a series of worksheets to go along with this virtual manipulative that I will be sharing on my blog in the coming weeks so make sure you are following my blog or have liked me on Facebook so you will be the first to know when these get posted!Before finding this virtual manipulative, I did not have a good way to teach fraction division in a hands on way.  Now I have kids use this to help them notice patterns and give them a visual image for fraction division. Here is how a student could do a problem like 1 and 2/3 divided by 4/5.Start by making a bar that is 1 and 2/3 long.  You must enter it as an improper fractionWe need to figure out how many 4/5 bars fit into the 5/3 bars.  We can easily put 2 on top but need to find what part of a third bar will fit. By placing a third bar on top and changing the step size we can see that 1/12 of the final bar fits over the 5/3 one.  The answer is 2 and 1/12Again... these bars are super powerful and the example above is one students would do after being led through a series of problems specifically designed for them to notice some patterns that will lead them to constructing an algorithm.  Stay tuned for a more detailed post on this!I have used this manipulative mostly in sixth grade.  However because the Common Core has placed some ideas about fraction division into grade 5, I will probably be using it in grade 5 as well. TangramsI have written about many ways I use tangrams in the classroom but neglected to mention this one in that post!  This is a fun thing for kids to work on spacial reasoning and I always love working with tangrams because there will be a student or two who really excel at this that sometimes don't excel at number and operations.  You can choose from any of the shapes at the bottom of the screen and try to fit the 7 tangram pieces onto it.  You can change the color of the pieces, flip them by pressing the red arrow and turn them by dragging on the corner. If a shape is to challenging, you can click on hint and it will draw in a line that will really help with placing the next piece.  The National Library of Virtual Maniplatives is really something all teachers should know about.  If the above three manipulatives don't appeal to you there are still many others to choose from.  My estimate is that there are around 80!Head over to NLVM now to see what they have!Have you used the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives?  Which ones are your favorites?

{"title": "Proportional Reasoning and Peach Jam", "date": "Wednesday, August 6, 2014", "text": "TweetToday I am linking up with A monthly REAL WORLD math blog link-up hosted by 4mulaFun, The Teacher Studio, Teaching to Inspire in 5th, AND MissMathDork,I love when I can connect real life stuff to my students' math education.  A few weeks ago, I was lucky enough to be able to give a very fun real world math lesson to a few middle school students who I was doing summer tutoring with.  We had finished working on proportional reasoning problems and their rides had not yet arrived.  A few days prior to this session I had purchased a bunch of peaches and one of my tutoring students asked if he could have one.  He noticed that several of them had developed soft spots and I really didn't want to throw out all those peaches so I made a spur of the moment decision to make peach jam.  I had never made it before and did not have a recipe so I did a quick online search and found this. We used this recipe from food.comIt seemed like more peaches than I had but I had all the ingredients.  My two students seemed very concerned that it wouldn't work without enough peaches.  Little did they know that we were about to get majorly involved in a proportional reasoning problem.  A few phone calls to parents and they were both granted permission to stay an extra hour so we got right to work. Peaches about to go bad!We peeled, and diced the peaches and did not follow the recipe where it says to let them sit an hour and it seems to have come out fine!After all the peaches were cut up, we had 6 cups.  It was nice that it was a nice whole number, because these kids are just getting the hang of proportional thinking.  If these kids were a bit more advanced, I would have loved to see it be 6.25 cups or another number involving a fraction or decimal.  We started trying to figure out how to change the recipe.  The recipe calls for 10 cups of peaches and we were short of that amount.  I asked them to make an estimate about how much sugar we would need.  They noticed that we had a little more than half of the peaches we were supposed to and would therefore need a little more than half of the sugar.  Because jam can be super tricky and will often not set of the right proportions of ingredients are not used, I explained to them that we would really need to figure out the right amount.  The estimate ended up being a good jumping off point for them along with the fact that six tenths is a friendly number to work with.  They quickly figured out we needed 3 cups of sugar and about 1.75 teaspoons of lemon juice.  They were so tickled that they used what they had been learning in our tutoring session to make this jam.  Of course, I could not stop there because these kids also need to review some multiplicative reasoning concepts so I jotted down a few notes and sent them home with the challenge to figure out how much it cost to make each jar.  Here is the information I gave themPeaches were $0.77 per pound.  We used 3 poundsSugar I bought a 10 lb bag for $3.99.  We used 3 cups.Lemon Juice 99 cents for 200 mLCanning lids $1.99 for 12.  We used 5.They had to use multiplication, division, measurement conversion and addition to solve this problem.  Multi-step and multiple ways to approach this!  We had the best discussion a week later when they returned with their costs per jar.  They got the sweet reward of a jar of jam and I got kids thinking about math and not just doing it which really is the best reward of all! How do you help your kids see that Math IS Real Life?  Please respond in the comments below or head on over to the linky and check out other teachers' ideas!"},

I don't think I could have done better if I measured.  The best part is that it took about 2 minutes!I used black button magnets to be the black dots.  If you want fancier dots, you can use Mod Podge to stick pictures, or decorative paper to the magnetic buttons.    I can't wait to use this with my kids!Here are some of the other 10 and 20 frames I use with my students.  I like to switch things up once in a while to keep things fresh for the students!Spring 10 FramesPumpkin 10 FramesCute Kids 20 FramesBug Themed 20 FramesDo you use this story with your students?Head over to 4th Grade Frolics for more made it ideas for your home and classroom!Head over to Mrs. Jump's Class for more great children's literature!"},

When we were learning about 3-D shapes we took the iPad with us on a 3-D shape hunt and made a movie trailer out of what we found.  When my second graders were working on measurement we made a video of good measuring techniques and some things to avoid.  Working with my challenge fifth and sixth graders we made how to videos for common math procedures.  Kids were super engaged in this and learned the material well.  I would like to expand on this.  \"How can I show my students why learning this content is important in the real world?\"     Math is all around us and I love connecting what they are learning in school to something happening in their community.  Right now I am working on taking pictures of real life building and other places where arrays are displayed for when I teach my introduction to multiplication facts lessons.  \"Can I invent a superhero or a super villain for this subject?\"    Love this idea!  I do a lot of co-teaching and I think it would be so fun to create a super hero and super villain that both come to one of these lessons.  It could be a classic tale of good versus evil.  \"Can I, unknown to their classmates, cue certain students to play a prearranged role?\"    I have played around with this one a bit and always had great success.  It can be so much fun to let a student or two in on your lesson ahead of time and certainly makes for a memorable experience.  I find I get the most bang for my buck when I include students who are my most challenging to keep engaged.  \"How would speaking in character, using accents, changing intonations, and varying volume for effect (even whispering) have an impact on the class?     I haven't done this, but I am excited to try it!\"How can I take advantage of the fact that students are intrigued by things they aren't supposed to hear?\"     I have played with this one a bit with younger kids, particularly first graders.  They are instantly more engaged when I whisper a bit and make sure the doors to the classroom are closed because I am telling them something that I am not supposed to tell them until second grade.  What do you do to hook your students into your lessons?"},

{"title": "More Quick and Fun Math Practice For Little Kids", "date": "Tuesday, July 29, 2014", "text": "TweetLast week, I started describing how I have been making busy bags to use in the classroom in conjunction with my math browse boxes to keep kids busy and learning in the classroom, at home or on the road.   You can check out last week's post about number sticks and read more about math busy bags and browse boxes here!This week, I want to show you another simple to make but effective way to keep kids busy and practicing math!Materials List-Felt sheets: I used a full blue one as well as about 1/5 of a sheet of yellow, green and orange and a few scraps of a black sheet.-Wiggle eyes: I included some round and some oval shaped ones.  The sky is the limit here!  They have all kinds of wiggle eyes available these days.  I picked up a multi-pack with a lot of varieties for various projects. -Permanent Marker-Scissors-Small scrap of cardstock or cardboard-Small circular objectI simply traced the bottom of a round yogurt cut onto a scrap piece of cardstock.  Then I cut this out and used it as a pattern for cutting out the felt.  When I had 12 circles, I wrote the numbers 1-12 on them.  The kid I was making this for has been working on ordering numbers up to 10 and was ready for a bit of a stretch.  You could also put other numbers here.  I will be making another set for some first graders who need practice pulling through decades.  This one might only contain 8 circles and have the numbers from 57-64.  If I was making one of these for second graders, it might contain numbers that pull through a century such as 297-306.  If I wanted to make one for a third grader, I might use skip counting numbers to work on multiplication. I have tried this out on a few kids and here is what I have discovered. When given to a 5 year old, her first instinct was to line up the numbers in sequential order.  Another 5 year old put the numbers in order around the perimeter and used the black pieces and eyes to make a design in the middle.  Another kid put them in order in a long line and then made a worm out of them.  The entire task fits in a quart size Ziploc bag and is ready to be added to a browse box or taken out when a student needs an activity to keep them busy and learning.  After sitting with kids and showing them how to put the numbers in order and make a caterpillar, they were very successful.  Without instruction, they did tend to focus on the numbers and putting them in order and that is the main goal for this activity anyway! I will be sharing more ideas for busy bags and browse boxes for a variety of grades in the coming weeks so stay tuned! The easiest way to get updates is to like me on Facebook!"},

It is a very engaging story, and kids get hooked in quite well.  There are quite a few words on each page, but the pace is excellent and kids definitely remain engaged.   It is an excellent addition to any unit on 3-D geometry and reviews the different shapes as well as terms such as faces and vertices.  I have used it in grades 1-4 with great results.The next time I do this lesson in the classroom, I plan on using my shape posters to have kids do a 3-D shape hunt around the classroom.  I will spread out the posters around the room and have kids bring examples of each type of shape back to the poster that it matches. My 3-D shape posters are available in red, green, purple and blue!You might also want to check out this lesson that combines literature and 3-D shapes!Does anyone have any other recommendations for children's literature that can be used to for a 3-D shape hunt?"},

I know many people who work in a job like mine are seen more as an interventionist than as a co-teacher.  It can be hard for them to build rapport with a whole class and if their groups change frequently they may be seeing a huge number of kids and for very short term commitments.  Because of my decision to try to do push-in interventions whenever possible I have much more opportunity to build rapport with my kids.  Ask and AnalyzeThis section is all about the creative process.  The author does a great job of outlining some examples of how all people can be creative.  No one is creative by accident it takes time, energy and effort to be creative.  \"Creative ideas don't come out of the blue; they came from engaging in the creative process.  That critical process starts when you ask the right types of questions and then actively seek the answers.\" There is also a strong focus in this section on asking good questions.  \"The quality of your questions determines the quality of your answers, and the type of question determines the type of ideas your brain will receive and conceive.\"  I completely agree with these ideas.  I feel like I became a much better teacher when I started focusing on the types of questions I was asking my students and making sure I was asking myself questions about my lessons.  One of the reasons I started this blog was to capture my good and not so good teaching moments.  I have a great memory but I still can't remember every single thing I liked, loved or hated about a lesson.  Back when I started this blog I was the only person who was reading it and it really was just a place to capture my ideas.  Now that others read my blog, it still is a place for me to capture ideas but now I just use better pictures and cuter graphics and links back to my other posts.  When I am planning a lesson now, I can search my posts for keywords and remind myself about how I did a particular lesson or intervention in the past or how I can do it in the future. Because of my blog, I feel like I am much better at noticing when I have a creative idea.  These ideas really are fleeting though and if they don't get written down, they tend to be lost forever.  Even writing down a few words can help me think of the idea later.  I do this very simply by using the notes app on my iPad which I usually have with me.  These quick little notes about lessons and ideas or tweaks really help move my teaching forward.  So does reading great books like this one!I look forward to reading everyone's thoughts on rapport and the creative process!"},

{"title": "QR Code Scavenger Hunts: Using Technology to Practice Math", "date": "Tuesday, July 15, 2014", "text": "TweetWe all know how important it is for kids to have basic arithmetic skills.  Whether you teach all algorithms or help kids construct their own strategies their comes a time where they need a little more practice with a skill to work on accuracy or fluency.  You can go with a traditional worksheet or you can make it super engaging with a QR code scavenger hunt.  You have probably seen QR codes around.  They are popping up on cereal boxes, business cards and subway stations.  Here is a look at one if you are not sureYou need a smartphone, tablet or other digital device with a camera and the ability to install apps.  You need to download a QR code reader app (there are many good free ones!) and then you are set to go.  Simply scan the QR code and it will take you to a website or display text or a phone number or even show you a coupon.  There are many options and more are being added each day.So how do I use QR codes in the classroom?  My favorite way is with a QR code scavenger hunt!  I use my laptop and a QR code generator to generate QR codes with math problems and then place the QR codes onto task cards, add some text and a border, design a record sheet and an answer key and then they are ready to use.  If I don't have time to commit to doing all that, I jut head over to Teacher's Pay Teachers and browse my options for QR code scavenger hunts that are already made.  For a few dollars, I can usually find what I want and be ready to go.My favorite places to do QR code scavenger hunts are in the gym or outside on the track.  Although they work fine in the classroom or a hallway, kids get really excited to do math in the gym or on the track.  My sixth graders doing a decimal QR code scavenger hunt in the gymIn my school, we have several iPads and older smartphones as well as a few iPods.  All of these devices work great for this activity.  I also let my older students (grades 4 and up) bring in their own devices when I know we are going to do a QR code scavenger hunt.  I usually have kids work in pairs and share one device. (Update: we went 1 to 1 with Chromebooks in my school and we love using this free app with our Chromebooks. Now that I curate online resources with a school wide math blog, I just leave the link to this free app at the top of each grade level's page. )A student uses an iPod to do a fraction QR code scavenger huntThe students start by scanning the start card.  The first problem will appear on their device.  They use their record sheet or a piece of scrap paper to figure out the answer.  Once they find the answer, they go out and find it on another card.  If they can't find the answer on any of the cards, they know it is wrong and try the problem again or get some help. A student uses partial products and area models to solve a double digit multiplication QR code scavenger huntA student uses multiple strategies to solve a double digit addition qr code scavenger huntA student uses partial quotients to solve a division QR code scavenger huntThey continue in this manner until they get to the card that tells them they are done.  Then they bring their record sheet to me so I can check for accuracy (this is usually not an issue) and types of strategies used.  QR code scavenger hunts can be a fun way to practice routine skills during math.  I have used them with kids in grades 1-8 and they work great at all levels.Here are a few free QR code scavenger hunts if you are looking to try them out!Multiplication FactsAddition and Subtraction FactsTypes of Lines and Angles100 days of schoolYou can browse the entire collection here!"},

Here it is!I was taught arithmetic in elementary school and didn't findit particularly interesting but was always quite good at it.  When I think about my own instruction inmath, it is amazing that I didn't completely hate it.  We used Addison Wesley style textbooks andeverything was taught as a procedure. Nothing was ever connected for us at all.  In fifth grade I remember we had a wide rangeof ability levels in our classroom.  Theteacher allowed another student and I to start from the back of the fifth gradetext book and work our way forward.  Idon’t think we ever got any teacher time, we just did page after page of rotepractice.  We even checked our own workand graded our own tests with the teacher’s edition.  I thought it was a great adventure then butnow it seems like a recipe for disaster!In middle school and for algebra 1 and geometry, I was ableto follow the procedures that had been taught and relied on my great memory to “plugand chug” my way through these classes with excellent grades.  Looking back, I see that I didn’t reallyunderstand the math but I could do it.  Iwas never taught to think about the numbers I just operated on them.  It wasn’t until tenth grade when I steppedinto an Algebra 2 class that I ever started getting the connections betweenthings.  I had a fantastic teacher whohelped me to see connections and challenged me to live up to my mathematicalpotential.  Luckily I had the sameteacher twice more before graduating from high school and he really helpedfoster my love of mathematics.As an undergraduate, I had a dual major in elementaryeducation and mathematics and took some very challenging math classes.  I had the widest range of professors you canpossibly imagine ranging from the very good to the completely inept.  I had a dynamic, inspiring teacher for mycombinatorial theory class and to this day I get so excited about combinationproblems and I love doing them with my students.  I also had some of the worst professorsimaginable and I think now looking back it is because they couldn't or didn'tconnect what they were trying to teach me with what I already knew.  I don’t know if they actually understood theconnections themselves.  I remember oneprofessor who taught a class on groups and rings would have the entire classshow up at his office during office hours because none of us could figure itout.  Finally he told us all that if weshowed up for class and tried our best, he would give us all a B.  It wasn’t until I began teaching and started working on mymaster’s degree in K-8 math instruction that I finally really understood theconnections in math.  Being introduced tothings like the area model for multiplication and finally getting that multidigit multiplication, fraction multiplication and polynomial multiplication areall connected by this model changed the way I view math.  Instead of a list of disconnected procedures,I had a visual model that could help me solve ANY multiplication problem.  Through my master’s program, I also finallygot the connection between algebra and geometry.  When I was in high school they were taught astwo different subjects but through the problems I worked on in this program, Igot to see that you can solve many problems with algebra or geometry.  I also learned that I tend to favor solvingproblems with algebra and really had to open my mind up to see how the sameproblem could be solved with geometry. It made me a better mathematician and a better teacher.  When I think about my own math education, I can see why Iteach the way I do and why I am always annoying my students with my sayingslike “think about the math, don’t just do it!” I spent many, many years just doing the math and was quite successful atit.  However, I was missing the passion,understanding and beauty of mathematics. I could not solve novel problems. I could only plug numbers into formulas. If I forgot a formula or a procedure, I had no way to go back andre-create it for myself.  I have a greatmemory so I did well in general because I tended to not forget.  As my deeper understanding of mathematicsdeveloped, it helped shape me into the teacher I am today.  I get the connections now.  I know if my answer makes sense.  If I forget a formula or a procedure, I canrely on other things that I know that are connected to it to help me out.  I love nothing more than jumping into solvinga novel problem.  I thrive on trying newmath and applying my new knowledge to what I have learned in the past.  I love math. I want my students to feel about math the way I do now.  I want them to have the connections and bepassionate about using what they know to solve new problems.  I don’t want them to settle for being taughthow to do it!  I want them to constructtheir own knowledge and learn to think instead of just applyingprocedures.  I am not willing to let mystudents learn math the way I did.  Iwant more for them.  It is time to stopteaching kids how to do math

Today I want to share with you a lesson I thought of when reading to my children.  I have not yet used this lesson in the classroom but tried it out with a few nieces and nephews.  I think it would be great in grades 1-4.  It is all about 3-D shapes!The Little Red Hen Makes a PizzaThis book is super cute!  It stars the little red hen who is working hard to make a pizza.  She doesn't seem to have what she needs on hand and has to make several trips out to pick up supplies.  She asks her friends if any of them would like to help her prepare the pizza or run errands and they keep saying no.  Finally the pizza is made and is very large!  She asks her friends for help eating it and of course they say yes.  Then she asks for help cleaning up and her friends finally agree to help.  It would make a great story to use in a lesson about helping out your friends and doing your part also.  The best part of this book to me is that it features a lot of 3-D shapes in the pictures.  Take a look at these:See what I mean?  This is the perfect book to use in conjunction with a lesson on 3-D shapes.  Here is a fun way to record the 3-D shapes you identify in the book!  You will notice there are not a lot of examples of pyramids.  I find this to be true quite often when going on 3-D shape hunts.  You can grab this record sheet for free from Google drive.  When I do this lesson in the classroom, I plan on using my shape posters to have kids do a 3-D shape hunt around the classroom.  I will spread out the posters around the room and have kids bring examples of each type of shape back to the poster that it matches. My 3-D shape posters are available in red, green, purple and blue!Does anyone have any other recommendations for children's literature that can be used to for a 3-D shape hunt?Check out other great books over at Mrs. Jump's class"},
{"title": "You Oughta Know About.... Push-in Versus Pull-out Intervention", "date": "Saturday, July 12, 2014", "text": "TweetAs a math specialist I often get asked which is better... push-in or pull-out interventions.  Today I am linking up with a bunch of great bloggers to share with you all kinds of things you might like to know about.  You can check out other blog posts by checking out the links at the bottom of this post. Let's take a look at the pros and cons of each intervention methodPush-InPros      To me, the best part of the push-in model of intervention is that I really get to know all of the kids in a class. When I am there for co-teaching whole group lessons and available for small group instruction I get to know and work with a wide range of kids.  The groupings can be more flexible and there is a great sense of teamwork with the classroom teacher.  There is a great opportunity to follow a guided math structure and having two adults in the room makes things run very efficiently.  It is also a great way to learn from another professional and see new teaching strategies.  When I do push-in interventions, I am the person moving between rooms rather than the students which certainly saves transition time.  Push-in instruction also means all the materials kids need for that subject are in one place.  Finally, it provides more consistency in terms of classroom rules and routines.  Cons     There are several things that can be very challenging with a push-in model for intervention.  If the classroom teacher and the interventionist have different ideas about classroom management, it can present a challenge.  If one teacher is very laid back with management while the other is very consistent and on top of things it can be tough to co-teach and co-exist in the same room.  Also, noise and distractions can be more of a problem especially as class size increases.  Pull-OutPros     The very best part about pull-out intervention is having a quiet, focused place to do it.   It is a small group of kids and at least in my case, I have my own mini-classroom to work in and there are not any distractions from other groups, students or teachers.  If I am using specific materials for a particular intervention I can leave them in one place and know they won't get moved by another teacher or kid.   Many of my favorite intervention materials like my place value decks and number puzzles are also used by teachers in the classroom so I can access most of my favorite things regardless of where I am.  When kids come to my room, they get a change of scenery and a quick break as they walk to my room which is always nice.  I also am in control of classroom management in my own space and I have to say, I really like having things my way. Cons     The thing I miss most when I do pull-out interventions is the co-teaching relationship I have with the classroom teacher.  I also have a very packed schedule and if I am not in a teacher's classroom, it can be hard to catch up with how students are doing and what we are working on.  I also find during pull out interventions the groups are much less flexible and I tend to end up with the same kids over and over again.  There also seems to be a bit more of lost instruction time waiting for kids to come to me or having to go to their classrooms and wait for them to be ready to go.  There are also some kids who seem to get lost on their way from their classroom to my room.  My General Rules for Intervention     In general, I find push-in intervention to be the most effective way for me to deliver math services.  I love getting to know all the kids in the school and I really enjoy collaborating with other teachers.  Co-teaching and sharing kids can be a great way to increase the learning of all students.  I am very good at getting along with other educators and have spent a lot of time developing relationships with the folks I work with.  When you first start with a push-in model there is certainly a learning curve as you figure out the other teachers styles, preferences, strengths and weaknesses.  After a decade of working with many of the same teachers, I have strong co-teaching relationships and can be very effective teaching with the people I know so well.  Our school also tends to have smaller class sizes which really help make push-in instruction less distracting and more effective.    Despite the fact that I really love push-in interventions, I still do some pull-out interventions.  There are some days that the push-in model is not effective and there are some kids whose needs are so specific that they need to be in another room or near different materials to have their needs met.  The best part about my job has been the flexibility I have to move between the push-in and pull out models.     I work almost exclusively with math but feel that many of these pros and cons still hold true for literacy interventions as well.  If you are looking for the perspective of a literacy person on this matter, you might want to check out Amy's post over at Eclectic Educating. Amy is a reading specialist who has had experience with both kids of interventions.    How does intervention work in your school?  What method do you prefer?  Please respond in the comments below! Check out these other great blog posts about things you oughta know!  Tell them the Math Maniac sent you!

       I have 2 topics in math that I am most passionate about.  The first is algebra.  I am not talking about that big heavy text book you had in eighth grade.  I am talking about the patterns and conjectures students make starting in Kindergarten.  I am talking about the moment when a student realizes that knowing 8 + 9 = 17 helps them know 17 - 8 = 9.  I love seeing these magical moments when kids get the big ideas of mathematics.     I also have a slightly unhealthy obsession with fractions.  I think this is because I was taught fraction in such a strict methodical way that I am always surprised and delighted when I find a new way to look at fractions.  I remember sitting in my first math professional development after graduating from college and the instructor told me that her research was showing that kids had 5 different strategies for comparing fractions.  I thought common denominators was the only way!  When I was a sixth grade classroom teacher, I remember waking up one night thinking about how to use the area model to multiply fractions.  I feel like there is always more to learn about fractions and that is exciting to me.     Within your profession, but not specific to your subject matter, what are you passionate about?     I am passionate about seeing kids gain knowledge.  I love seeing that spark kids have when they have worked really hard at learning something and the self-confidence boost they get when they master it.  I love how that confidence can translate into a better attitude, a willingness to work hard and a passion for learning. I love the focus on making sure you have identified your professional passion because, \"On all of the days when you don't have passion for your content, you must consciously make the decision to focus on your professional passion.\"  I may be one of the freaks Burgess mentions who is passionate about everything they teach (almost) but I have days where I am just not feeling the love for the content.  When that happens, I need to make a conscious effort to focus on my passion for teaching and seeing student growth.When you combine your content, professional and personal passions you get an unstoppable teacher!  \"Teaching is no longer about relaying the content standard... it's about transforming lives.  It's about killing apathy.  It's about helping the next generation fulfill their potential and become successful human beings.  It's no longer about memorizing fats; it's about inspiring greatness.\"  Reading quotes like that get me so fired up for the new school year!ImmersionThis section focuses on being present in the moment.  I love the analogy of the swimming pool and the person watching from the sides versus the person in the pool.  As a math specialist, I spend a lot of time in other teacher's classrooms and I think the difference between a good teacher and a great one can be their willingness to jump right in the pool.  Their students really benefit in both engagement and academic success from their willingness to completely immerse themselves in the lesson.  As much as this section focuses on being present in the moment and making sure you are not distracted by other things, it still shows the importance of sizing teachable moments.  \"I'm a firm believer in having structure and definite plans for the direction of lessons, but sometimes things happen that demand a change in direction and a \"letting go\" of the plan.  The teachable moment is called that because if you wait it will be gone!\" Even if it means you are not \"covering\" the curriculum you are supposed to, it is important to seize these teachable moments!  \"At some point in your career you have to decide if you care more about teaching to tests or teaching kids.\" I know the reason I became a teacher was to teach kids and not to teach to tests! Your turn!  What are your thoughts on Passion and Immersion? I bought the kindle version of this book and have been reading it on my iPad and my desktop using the free kindle app. This is my first time using a kindle version and I am still not sure how I feel about it.  What is your opinion on e-books versus real books? amzn_assoc_ad_type = 'banner'; amzn_assoc_tracking_id = 'theelematman-20'; amzn_assoc_marketplace = 'amazon'; amzn_assoc_region = 'US'; amzn_assoc_placement = 'assoc_banner_placement_default'; amzn_assoc_linkid = 'UME36LSLLD566RGS'; amzn_assoc_campaigns = 'kindlereadingapps'; amzn_assoc_p = '12'; amzn_assoc_banner_type = 'promotions'; amzn_assoc_banner_id = '1P3YWVYE8G217EXN4182'; amzn_assoc_width = '300'; amzn_assoc_height = '250';"},
{"title": "Guided Math in Action Book Study Chapters 3 and 4", "date": "Wednesday, July 9, 2014", "text": "TweetWelcome to my guided math book study!  It is not to late to join in!  Every week, I will provide the links to past posts so if you are just finding this book study you can jump right in!July 2   Chapters 1 and 2July 9   Chapters 3 and 4July 16 Chapters 5 and 6July 23 Chapters 7 and 8July 30 Chapter 9Guided Math in ActionChapter 3: Managing the Math WorkshopThis chapter starts out with this GREAT quote \" We must spend 40 hours a year dealing with students' pencil problems (dull or broken tips, wanting to use the sharpener, running out of eraser, and so on). To solve all these problems ahead of time, just prepare a few hundred sharpened pencils at the start of the year.\" I love this quote because I have been in many classrooms over the last few years where it feels like 25% of math time is consumed by kids looking for pencils or trying to share an eraser with another student.  Do yourself, your sanity and your class a favor and get a great pencil sharpener,  a few huge boxes of good pencils and spend an hour or two getting them sharpened and ready to go for the school year.  Make it your mission to not lose any precious minutes of instruction time on pencil issues. The meat of this chapter is the discussion on how to set up your classroom and establish routines and procedures.  Many ideas are similar to those outlined in The First Six Weeks of School and are a great way to set up a responsive classroom situation where kids know the expectations and contribute to a positive classroom environment.  Central to this working well is the idea that you have to teach kids how you want them to behave, treat materials and treat each other.  I love this section's focus on teaching kids to work independently so that the teacher is free to run small groups.  Independence is such an important skill for students to develop and it is important to teach it.  There are also great ideas on scheduling and setting up for guided math.  It is all about organization and does take some time up front to have materials that you will need prepared and organized in a way that is easy to access them.  I find this is the most intimidating part of getting started with guided math.  There is quite a bit of prep work up front but I feel this really pays off in the long run!  \"Staying organized is going to help you keep your sanity.  There is so much going on in math workshop, you don't want to be running around looking for stuff that you need to do your lesson.  Keep your stash stocked!\"Chapter 4: Forming Guided Math GroupsThis chapter focuses on the importance of making sure you are meeting with ALL students and meeting them on their level. I love the quote from the beginning of the chapter, \"when a teacher tries to teach something to the entire class at the same time, chances are, one-third of the kids already know it; one-third will get it; and the remaining third won't.  So two-thirds of the children are wasting their time.\"  That is pretty strong evidence that you should be doing at least some small group work in your classroom!  I also like how this chapter emphasizes the importance of meeting with kids below, at and above the standard.  It can be challenging to make sure all kids are getting what they need, especially since so much time is given to kids who are behind to try to help them catch up.  All kids deserve to have teacher attention, even if it isn't always fairly divided.Depending on your class size, you might have 3-4 groups of kids.  The book does a nice job detailing the different levels of learners you may encounter.  The most important thing to remember is that these groups need to be flexible!  \"Guided math groups are organized according to the common needs of a specific group of students in a certain place and at a certain time.\"  This does not mean they are ability grouped for the year!  The key to all this working is a good formative assessment system.  I feel that if you don't have a good understanding of formative assessment, guided math groupings are not going to be effective.  There are some great books and blog posts out there about formative assessment if you need some help getting started! I am really enjoying reading this book and discussing it with all of you!  It is not to late to join!

{"title": "Monday Math Literature Volume 50", "date": "Monday, July 7, 2014", "text": "TweetHi all!  If you missed last week's post (and freebie) about using The Napping House in math class, you can check it out here!This week, I want to share with you a great book that I discovered this past school year and a little activity I did with it to help my kids with adding and subtracting money.  I have been very inspired by the Math and Literature series and came up with a way to use this great story in math classThe Princess and the Pizza The Princess and the Pizza tells the story of Paulina, a former princess whose father gave up being king to be a wood carver.  Since he is new to wood carving, he doesn't make a lot of money and Paulina misses the life she had as a princess. When she hears prince Drupert is looking for a wife, she heads to the castle to show off her best princess skills.  Many other princesses also arrive to compete with Paulina to be Drupert's wife.  Paulina makes it to the final part of the competition where she has to create a meal and accidentally invents pizza to win the competition.  She wins but decides to open her own pizza place instead of becoming Drupert's wife.  The story ends with Paulina's Pizza place becoming a huge success!I read this book to my fourth graders this year during our decimal and money unit.  I made a simple menu using some of the pizza combinations mentioned in the book and a few my students came up with.  We also put a few drinks and desserts on the menu.  The kids got to work with a partner to choose what they would order from Princess Paulina's Pizza Palace.  Their budget was $20.  They had to answer three questions1. What would you order?2. What would be the total cost?3.  How much change would you get if you paid with a $20 bill.  The kids did a great job with this and used some great thinking strategies for adding and subtracting money.  I love to hear kids talk about different strategies and build their own understanding of adding and subtracting money.  I also love when they use estimation and mental math to solve these types of problems.  This is the type of real world math I want to make sure my students can do!  Want to try this with your students?  You can grab our little pizza menu for free from Google drive."},
{"title": "Guided Math in Action Book Study Chapters 1 and 2", "date": "Wednesday, July 2, 2014", "text": "TweetWelcome to part 1 of my Guided Math in Action book study!  I will be posting on two chapters each Wednesday for the next 5 weeks.  Please join in by writing your thoughts and ideas in the comments below.  If you want to write about a blog post about your ideas, leave the link in the comments.  July 2   Chapters 1 and 2July 9   Chapters 3 and 4July 16 Chapters 5 and 6July 23 Chapters 7 and 8July 30 Chapter 9Guided Math in ActionChapter 1:   Guided Math: An IntroductionThis chapter lays out the basic structure of guided math.  A session of guided math, it includes a mini-lesson, a student work period, time to share and differentiated center activities.  The goal of guided math is to meet students where they are and teach math in their zone of proximal development.  I liked how this chapter laid out the basics of guided math.  It serves as a good introduction to the big ideas.  I also love the idea of showing the lesson in action and getting a glimpse inside a guided math classroom in the first chapter is an effective way of communicating what it is going to look like.  However, I wished that a different example was given for the mini-lesson.  If you are a regular blog reader, you know how much I work on students developing their own strategies for double digit addition and subtraction and the emphasis I put on teaching kids to think about math rather than just do it.  To me, the mini lesson described in this chapter falls into the teaching kids how to do it category. My favorite reflection question from the end of the chapter is question #4, how do you promote perseverance in your classroom? This is something I need to work on for this school year.  I feel like perseverance is something that ALL kids need to develop.  Interestingly, I often find that kids who are good at math are the least likely to develop this important skill.  I think guided math can help with this but I want to spend more time developing or finding really good real life math problems for these kids to solve.  Which reflection question was your favorite?Chapter 2: Guided Math in a Numerate EnvironmentI love the emphasis that is place on proving answers and sharing thinking in this chapter.  Dr. Newton says, \"Whatever the context, whether you do math workshop or not, the atmosphere should be filled with talking and making mathematical sense.  Students should be ready for that famous phrase \"Prove it\" or \"Show me what you know.\"  The culture should support reasoning out loud.\"  This is great advice for any math classroom and any lesson.  Getting kids to talk about math helps them make sense of math and is a great way to check for understanding and clear up misconceptions.  The idea of home base where your learners can meet to talk math and share learning is great.  I love getting kids out of their seats and on the rug or in front of the white board when we are discussing our math learning.  It gives them a chance to move to another place and be around different people.  It is also the perfect opportunity for the teacher to intentionally place kids in pairs for math talk time and think-pair-share.  I agree with Dr. Newton that kids should talk with the same partner for a while but I usually switch it up once a week or so.  The elements of math workshop can seem overwhelming if you are used to doing one whole group lesson per day.  Keep in mink that you can do parts and pieces of it at other times of the day as well.  Calendar and number of the day fit nicely into morning meeting time or other small pockets of time in your schedule.  I do like to keep the whole class mini-lesson, the math centers/guided math group and the share/journal time together.  I squeeze math strategy practice and energizers into every available minute of the day and bring them out when kids need them as well as when we have a few minutes of downtime.  The reflection question from this chapter that I need to think more deeply about is question #3, At the end of your math period, how do you summarize the learning?  Do you ever write a class journal to document the key takeaways?  This question got me thinking because I feel like this is something I don't do enough of.  At the same time, I am packing a lot of math into a little bit of time and am often working with kids who are really far behind and am not sure how much I personally value this step.  I can see the value in it for some learners, but I have never been one of them.  I need to think about what type of learner this benefits the most and find a way to squeeze it into my lessons.  What are your thoughts on the first two chapters?  What are you favorite reflection questions?  Please respond in the comments below!See what folks are saying about chapters 3 and 4."},

The wise ladies who wrote Math And Literature, Grades K-1 wrote about how they used this book in the classroom.  I took many ideas for this lesson from their book.  This series of books spans K-8 and is a great way to inspire you to go deeper into your literature collection for math class.  You can see my favorite lesson on graphing from the 3-5 book here!Here is the entire collection (I have and love all of them!) The book I want to share with you today is The Napping HouseThis is a book that many teachers already have in their math literature collection.  If you have not read it, it is a funny story about a mouse, a cat, a dog, a child and a granny taking a nap on a bed when a wakeful flea comes along bites the mouse who wakes the cat and you can guess what happens from there!  It is a great read aloud and very engaging for students.  But where is the math?The math is hiding in the house.  When I finished reading the story, I asked students to help me find out how many feet live in the house.  We worked together to figure out different ways to prove this.  (I forgot to take a picture!)  Some kids wanted to draw each animal and others wanted to make a list.  Several students even suggested writing an equation.  Once we figured out that there were 18 feet in the house, I gave each student an origami house and had them figure out how many feet lived in their house.  We had a quick discussion about drawing a sketch versus drawing a detailed picture.  I made the origami houses ahead of time, but they are simple enough to make with kids as well.  Here is a video that shows you how!One students drawing of who/what lives in their house.  Most kids chose to draw the people and animals living in their house.  Then, I asked them to close their house and write the number of feet living in their house on the door. Then we practiced ordering numbers by putting the houses in order on the table from the smallest number of feet to the most.  I did this lesson with a smaller summer intervention group but had I done it with a full class, I might have asked them to hold their house in front of them and line up. Now for the really fun part!  I chose the house with an 8 on it and asked kids to think about who could live in a house with 8 feet.  We brainstormed a list of several ideas as a whole group.  At this point, one kid(who loves to write) suggested we write the names of the people living in the house and how many feet they have instead of drawing them.  Other kids really wanted to stick with drawing all the feet in the house. After doing this as a whole group, I sent kids out to work on their own.  I gave them each one of the papers I was using for recording, had them choose any number they wanted for the number of feet on the house and get to work figuring out different ways that you can represent that number of feet. This student is writing the name of the people or animal that live in the house and the number of feet they have.  Notice they wrote a 14 on the house in the middle of the page.   You can grab this record sheet here!This student is working on 10 feet in the house and is using sketches and equations to record her thinking.  Ready to try this lesson with your students?  You can grab the recording sheet here free on Google Drive.  The best part about this lesson is that it is so easy to differentiate.  You can use other books in place of the Napping House as well like Best Friends Sleep Over, Winter Days in the Big Woods  or Clifford's Family.  Any book that has people or animals in a house would work well for this lesson.  Head over to Deanna's blog for more great children's literature."},

{"title": "Great Math App: King of Math Junior", "date": "Tuesday, June 24, 2014", "text": "TweetA few months ago, I wrote about an app I was using with early finishers and kids looking for a challenge in grades 3-8 called King of Math.  Recently, I realized that the same company also put out King of Math Junior and installed it on my iPad.  It is a great app with a lot of different options that I will be using in the classroom this coming school year.I can see myself using this app two different ways.  First, similar to the original app, I can see this app as a great option for early finishers or kids looking for a challenge in grades 1-3.  Second, there are parts of this app I like so much for early numeracy and additive reasoning practice that I can see myself using parts of this app with intervention kids who need a fun way to practice important skills.  You can have students sign in as a player with their own name if you want them to use this app repeatedly for early finishers or a challenge.  You can also create a generic account for use with intervention or individual time in the classroom.  Once you open the app and choose your player, you see a bunch of books.  These books have the topics that are available and include counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, geometry, comparing, puzzles, measuring and fractions.  When you select a book, you will see it has 9 levels.  You must start with level 1 and complete it before it will unlock level 2.  If a level is unlocked, you can play it over and over again.  Each level has 10 questions.  You will see 3 stars in the upper right hand corner.  These are your three \"lives\" for that level.  If you get more than 3 wrong answers, you fail that level and have to start over.  Here are some shots of the game in actionCountingThis is an easy and quick level to use with K students or intervention first graders who need more practice with subitizing or countingMissing numeral up to 5Another great one for K students!Addition and SubtractionThe models are the same for addition and subtraction and quite a variety of models are included.  Objects, fingers, dice and number line are all part of the addition and subtraction section.  I also love when students have to pick the equation to match the picture.  You can see how useful this app would be to target specific skills for specific students.  Multiplication and DivsionI love how these operations start out with their very basic beginnings and how well they use the equal groups models.  As you move up in levels, there are some fun ways for kids to practice their multiplication and division facts with visual supports.GeometryThe geometry section offers a variety of practice with 2 and 3 dimensional shapes.  However, I did find one mathematical inaccuracy with one of the sections where kids are asked to identify a prism.  It shows a triangular prism, a pyramid, a cube and a cylinder.  They have the \"correct\" answer as being the prism.  However, a cube is also a prism because it is a polyhedron that has the same cross section along its entire length.   If you address that issue with your students, the rest of this section has some good practice.  I particularly like the angle practice where it asks for an estimated angle measure.Other SectionsThe other sections also have some interesting levels.King of Math Junior is currently free in the app store!  I am not sure if it is always free so grab it now! (The original King of math app was 99 cents but is also currently listed as free!)"},

We also did this little poem and worked on showing numbers up to 10 on our fingers.

{"title": "Wormy Apple Counting Strips", "date": "Wednesday, June 18, 2014", "text": "TweetFor a long time now, I have been a big fan of using counting strips in the classroom.  They are a great way to increase a student's ability to rote count and gives them a fun way to practice a very important skill.  The other thing I love about counting strips is that you can use them to count forward or backward and can start and stop on any number you please.Because I often work in the classroom co-teaching as well as doing interventions, some kids end up spending quite a bit of time with me and consequently if I don't keep my materials fresh, they get a bit bored.  So this year, I worked on updating some of my counting strips, adding new ones and ones that are shorter and longer.  I also made them much cuter than in the past and by printing a bunch of tiny heads, I turned many of them into worms.  Also instead of having them pull the counting strip through an index card or a scrap of paper, I made some apples instead.  This made counting strips feel fresh and new again and gave my students even more practice with important skills. I also had quite a group of students this year who needed a lot of practice with number writing so I also made these strips using a very cool dot to dot font.  Now kids who need number writing practice can trace these numbers before we put the strips together.This seems to give kids a greater sense of ownership of these counting strips than when I just made them myself.  Even if I am the one doing the cutting and taping, they feel like they created it.   By making these counting strips cuter and getting the kids more involved, I have had more students who want to take them home and play (practice) with them there as well.  I have used these in grades K-2 this year.  Here is a peak at how I have used them.KindergartenThis makes a great whole class lesson for kindergarten.  I like to give them the 1-100 dot to dot sheet.  For kids who are not ready for the entire thing, I like to start them off with the numbers from 1-10 or from 1-20.  It is absolutely fine if some kids are working with smaller numbers and others are working with larger ones.  This is a great way to differentiate!  I also will start some kids off counting backwards by 1's long before others are ready at this age.  Just pull the strip in the opposite direction and they are counting backwards!  A big thing to remember with Kindergartners is that they should be counting starting at different numbers.  Make sure you don't always start from 1!A great place to start with Kindergarten studentsThese short strips are also great for K and grade 1.  It is a VERY good way to work on pulling through the decade.  They are also less intimidating than a huge 1-100 or 1-120 strip!First GradeIn first grade I really like making the 1-120 strip with the whole class and then have them use it different ways to practice rote counting forward and backwards by 1's.  I also use the strips pictured above a lot, especially when I am doing interventions on kids who need work pulling though those tricky decade numbers.  I also introduce some other skip counting strips in kindergarten paying particular attention to counting forward and backwards by 10's and counting by 5's. These skip counting strips help my students learn to count by 5's 10's and 2's.  I always have students who are ready for a challenge and they love trying to count by 3's! Second GradeIn second grade, it is my job to make sure students are FLUENT with the numbers to 120 at the beginning of the school year and ready to tackle numbers to 1000.  I also have them use the skip counting strips and go farther than I would make a K or first grader go.  Most students who were challenged by pulling through the decade in first grade are challenged by pulling through the century in second grade so I spend a lot of my time giving them counting strips that assure they develop this skill.  Just as before, I make sure kids can count forward and backwards by simply pulling the strips in the opposite direciton.These strips are great for second graders or anyone who needs practice counting through the century mark!Regardless of which grade I am using these in, there are always students who really struggle with putting them together and there are also students who need every second of math instruction I can give them so I often put the strips together for students.  Stored rolled up in a shoe box, counting strips usually last me about 2 years and I use them very regularly.  Here is how I put them together: Cut strips apart and glue on worm headPlace a piece of tape over the gapFold the tape around the stripI store them by winding them up with the tab on the outside that says what is on the strip and then paper clipping them together.  You can store a bunch of them in a shoe box this way and can always find what you need when working on interventions.  Have you tried using counting strips with your students?  If you want to give these ones a try you can grab them from my TPT store!"},
{"title": "Monday Math Literature Volume 47", "date": "Monday, June 16, 2014", "text": "TweetIf you missed last week's Monday Math Literature about a few fun tangram books and a great free app for tangrams, you can check it out here!Today I want to share with you a really fun book that is great to use as math literature and also makes a great mentor text for writing workshop.Fat Frogs On a Skinny LogI recently used this book with a group of pre-K students who will be starting Kindergarten in the fall.  My goal was simple but important for kids this age.  I wanted to work on number recognition, one to one correspondence and writing the numbers to 10.  I also was going to be making a little frog craft and wanted to tie everything into the frog theme.  The great part about this book is that it can be used with older students as well as a mentor text for writing time.  As the number of frogs on the log increases, so does the number of adjectives used to describe the log.  This is a great text to use when working on improving adjectives in students' writing.  After listening to the story, we went back through the pages in random order and worked on identifying numbers.  As you can see in the picture above, there is a nice numeral in the top left corner of each page.  Some kids could identify the numeral right away while others needed to count the frogs.  This was great formative assessment for me to see who already recognizes numbers to 10.Then I had kids trace numbers to 10 on this little half sheet of paper.  You can grab this little printable for free on Google driveThen we made some sweet little frogs and when they were dry we used them to practice counting and do some simple addition and subtraction story problems as a group.  If you are working with slightly older students, I have several other frog themed freebies that I use with kids in Kindergarten and first grade.  These cute little frogs doubled as father's day gifts!These frogs are simple enough for very small kids and look cute even if they are not that crafty!  All you need is some rocks, paint, wiggle eyes and green craft foam!  We used the yard and garden variety of paint that is specifically made for painting rocks and does not wash out once dry.  These frogs were meant to double as father's day gifts and many kids wanted them to be left out in the garden.  The paint washed right off when it was still wet but shouldn't once dry. Get more ideas for great books for your classroom at Mrs. Jump's Class"},
{"title": "S.M.A.R.T Adventures Mission Math App", "date": "Thursday, June 12, 2014", "text": "TweetTo me, there is nothing better than the feeling I get when I find the PERFECT resource for a kid.  Something that they love, that gets them excited about math and improves their skills. Recently I was working with a fifth grade girl who has always struggled with math.  I have been part of her team since she was in Kindergarten and she really knows all my tricks.  She is the hardest worker and has made great gains but still needs to put in extra effort in math class.  When I started using an iPad with my students this year, I thought that would hold her interest and help her get the extra practice she needed but it didn't appeal to her as much as I thought it would.Until now.  I finally found an app she can't get enough of and it is the perfect thing for her to use during summer school and at home to keep her skills sharp.  I picked it up one day on Apps Gone Free but its usual price is $4.99.If you have a student in grades 4-6 who might need a little extra something or are looking for apps to recommend to parents, you might want to check this out.  It is targeted at girls but I have used it with several boys who enjoyed it as well.S.M.A.R.T Adventures Mission MathThe app starts by setting up a story about landing on a space station.  This takes up some time and makes it feel more like a game.  This makes it so it isn't the app to choose if you are just looing for something quick for a one time use.  It is much better used as something kids will have a chance to go back to. Kids get a chance  to choose their character next.  They are all female because that is the target audience for this game.  Again this makes it seem like more of a game but takes up time as well.From the hallway, you can go to the elevator and move up and down floors.  You go into labs and solve problems.Here a student works on place value in order to free a puppy in the Biology lab﻿Here a student was unsure what to do in the Equipment lab.  They just need to click on tutorial and it will show them how to do the task.In the equipment lab, students focus on factors and multiplesIn the chemistry lab, a student practices with metric measurementThis app has a lot to offer students in grades 4-6.  It is a great way to review and extend concepts they have learned but there is enough support available in the game so that if a concept is new to a student, they can learn and develop it without feeling completely overwhelmed.The purchase price of $4.99 and the amount of time that you would want students to invest in playing this game so that they can get to the good math concepts means it wouldn't be something I would put on a class set of iPads or even offer to a full class.  It is however, just the right app for certain students and definitely worth the purchase price for these kids!"},

On my second time around, I ask each kid how many he or she has and how many more they need to make ten.  This gives them one more chance to practice combinations of ten while getting materials passed out.  Any small manipulative would work just as well here, I just happened to have mini marshmallows left over from Family Math Night.Each kid used the mini marshmallows and the picture of the jar to act out the story again.  This time, I recorded how many were in the jar and how many were flying free on a piece of chart paper.  We also wrote number sentences together on the white board showing how many were in each place and how many all together.As we finished up this part of the lesson, kids each got a piece of white copy paper and folded it into fourths.  They then showed as many different ways as they could that the bugs could be in and out of the jar and wrote number sentences to go with them.  This lesson took about 40 minutes and was a great way to check in with kids about combinations of 10.  I will definitely be trying out other lessons from this book!﻿﻿﻿﻿"},

It also keeps the app interesting and engaging to students because it changes just enough to keep them interested.Here is the top part of the settings page.  The model setting can be apples (easier) or part whole (more challenging).  If you select the apples model, your students will see a model for each problem.  This will be an array/area model and is a great starting point for conceptual understanding.  Check out this book for more about using models to build conceptual understanding of multiplication!Scroll down the options screen a bit and you will be able to select a focus factor, change the mode from multiplication to division and pick a range for the other factor.  All of this allows you to set the app so that is is just right for a student.Here is a look at an apples setting with a focus factor of 6.  Notice how the student can see two groups of 6 and could use a variety of strategies to figure out the answer.  Apples with a focus factor of 9Apples set to division with a focus factor of 4Part whole with a focus factor of 8More part whole with a focus factor of 8Part whole divisionSo far, I have used this app in grades 3-5.  I may end up using it in grade 2 as well because we will be working on arrays and basic multiplication ideas.  This app would complement the array work that is done in my grade 2 number puzzles quite well.  What apps do you use for teaching/practicing multiplication?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

This level makes the game accessible to younger children and I often let first graders try this game.  Level 2 ups the difficulty a bit by adding dimes and asking for higher amounts to be made.  It is still very accessible to younger children at this level and I have had first through third graders like playing this game.Level 3 is the final and most challenging level.  Quarters are now part of the game and the amounts asked for increase quite a bit.  A first grader would have to have excellent money skills to play at this level.  This is a great level for kids in grades 2 and up to master.  The pace of this game is fast and it keeps it fun.  If you \"lose\" you can just click play again and get right back into it.  It doesn't take a lot of time to teach and is ready to use.Check it out!This free set of number puzzles make a great follow up to Coin Combo!Check out these other ideas for teaching money!Teaching Math With You Tube Videos: CoinsHow Much Money?

Money Bags Board GameThis is a game I purchased several years ago and my students love it!  I show 4-5 kids who are leaders in the classroom how to play it and they in turn teach it to other kids.  I have 4 of these games because each year, I decided I need another one!  This gives me almost enough for everyone to play at the same time which I love.  When I just owned 2 of these, I used them as part of math stations which I still do in addition to the times where most kids in the room are playing.Here is how the game works.  Students roll the dice which often puts them on a spot where they get money.  They spin the spinner to see which coins they are NOT allowed to use to show that amount.  This student landed on 12 cents and when she spun the spinner, landed on no nickles.  She had to make 12 cents using anything but nickles.  This is a great time to talk about different ways to make 12 cents and which is most efficient.  This student had to take his money using no dimesThe other part of this game I love is the bank exchange spaces.  When a student lands on bank exchange, they get to trade in their coins for equivalent amounts.  It is a great way to give them practice with fair trades and counting mixed coins.Once one player gets to the finish line, everyone counts up their money and the person with the most wins.  I have my students count their money and write their money amount on a nearby white board.  This gives them practice with the symbolic notation of money.Here are the final totals for the five kids playing the game.  If students at grade 2 use just cents notation, I make them try it again using the dollar sign and decimal point.  This is a great opportunity for them to get comfortable with this new notation.Getting to $1 seemed to be a big goal for this group so we finished up by figuring out how far away everyone was from $1.00.  I think second graders knowing combinations of 100 is super important and this gave them one more way to practice! Number PuzzlesI recently finished making a bunch of number puzzles for first and second grade and one of them is all about coins.  We have been using this during math center time and it has been a great way for kids to practice.Students put out all the cards with numbers written on them.  They then take the cards with coins on them, count the coins and find the matching number card.  The puzzles are self checking because if kids get it wrong, they won't fit together!A pair of students works to finish up their coin puzzles. Also included with the number puzzles is follow up formative assessment that I used to asses students' current understanding of counting coins.Two students show what they know about counting coinsWant to try these with your students?  You can grab these coin puzzles for FREE by heading to this page and clicking on preview.  The preview file is free to download and includes everything you need to make the coin puzzles for your students as well as the follow up formative assessment. If you love the idea of doing number puzzles with your students, you might want decide to purchase the full set which includes number puzzles for Canadian coins, addition facts, subtraction facts, telling time, recognizing numbers to 1000, matching numerals to base 10 pieces, adding double digit numbers, finding 10 more and 10 less and using arrays.  In all there are 11 number puzzles with follow up assessments and they will be 20% off for the next week!The full set is over 60 pages for one low price!  Save an additional 20% when you purchase it today!How do you work on counting money with your students?  Please respond in the comments below!TweetIf you have spent any time teaching math to young kids or have spent any time in a middle school setting, you are probably familiar with the idea that kids really do not know what the equals sign means.  Many students see it as operational meaning here comes the answer.  It is so important for kids to be exposed to ideas of the equals sign meaning equality from a young age.  I have written before about how I have worked on equality here and here if you are looking for ideas to get started.  Today, I want to share with you a recent experience with first graders.We were working on this Common Core StandardCCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.OA.D.7Understand the meaning of the equal sign, and determine if equations involving addition and subtraction are true or false. For example, which of the following equations are true and which are false? 6 = 6, 7 = 8 - 1, 5 + 2 = 2 + 5, 4 + 1 = 5 + 2.Understanding this standard directly supports this one and the development of good solid strategies for addition and subtraction facts.CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.OA.C.6Add and subtract within 20, demonstrating fluency for addition and subtraction within 10. Use strategies such as counting on; making ten (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14); decomposing a number leading to a ten (e.g., 13 - 4 = 13 - 3 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9); using the relationship between addition and subtraction (e.g., knowing that 8 + 4 = 12, one knows 12 - 8 = 4); and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding 6 + 7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13).I get out my trusty math balance for this activity and start by having kids make some equations that are true.  We then jump into making other equations, recording them on the board and deciding if they are true or false.  I then ask kids to come up with a true equation or come up with a false equation and we test their idea together.  As you can imagine, kids love making up equations that are false.Here is the start of our equation list.  Students write them on the white board and record T for true or F for false.  Look at all the different types of equations kids have come up with!We use the math balance to check out ideas and verify if equations are true or false.After we have done this whole group activity, it is time for partner work.  I used my Frog and Flower Equality cards to differentiate this partner work for kids.  These cards are offered at 4 different levels so I can make it easier or harder for kids depending on their own levels.  I can also offer kids who are ready more of a challenge or a second set to do when they are ready for it.Students read the equations and sort them into true or false!How do you work on equality with your students?"},

I also do a whole group lesson where each kid has access to unifix cubes that have been snapped into groups of ten.  We do more problems whole group and the kids use the concrete model of the unifix cubes to act out the problems.  This helps more kids see the connection between the fact level problem and the idea of subtracting groups of 10.A student uses unifix cubes to show 90 - 40After this, I introduce a game that will be played during math stations the following week.  It is a math puzzle game and is super engaging to students.  I also really like how it has a visual model so support kids who still need it.  As they play it throughout the week, I notice less and less students needing the visual model, but at the beginning of the week, many kids use it.A student uses her hand to check her answer to 80 - 30.  The puzzles are self-checking!  If a student gets the wrong answer, the puzzle will not fit together.  A pair of students finishes up the subtracting multiples of 10 puzzles.  After 4 days of having this included in math stations, I gave the quick formative assessment that comes with the puzzles.This formative assessment is a great way to asses students current understanding and see who needs more instruction or intervention.  It is part of the grade 1 number puzzle bundle. Based on the results of this formative assessment, I had 3 kids who needed more instruction.  I borrowed an idea from my blogging buddy Linda over at Primary Inspiration and used legos to represent base 10 pieces.  While the other kids were busy with math stations, I pulled these three kids to the back table and we worked on more problems and explicitly tried to make the connection between what they already knew and what they were learning now. I will check in with these 3 kids again next week but I think they got it now!How do you address subtracting multiples of 10 with your students?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

By the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.This was a lot of fun and I have decided to leave it up in the classroom for students to do again when they are done with other work or have a few minutes of free time. Here is a peak at the scavenger hunt.  You can grab it for FREE at my TPT Store!  While you are there make sure you are following me so you are the first to know when I post new freebies!QR code scavenger hunts are a great way to practice routine skills and are much more engaging and fun than worksheets.  They are great for skills like multi-digit addition and subtraction, and double digit multiplication.If you have never tried a QR code scavenger hunt, check out this post to see how easy it is!Here are few shots of this freebie in action!Hope you enjoy this freebie!"},

He decides that he will have them walk through the room single file and he will count them one by one.  His two royal assistants will also count them.The counting begins but the king gets interrupted by his daughter and loses track.  He allows his royal assistants to continue counting and they are marking down things as they count.  When they get to the end, one royal assistant reports that he has found there are 23 groups of 2 and one left over.  The king does not accept this answer.  The other royal assistant reports that he found 9 groups of 5 with two left over.  The king also does not like this answer.He decides to let his daughter try to figure it out and she is able to get the commissioners to stand in groups of 10.  There are 4 groups of 10 with 7 left over.  She quickly shows the kings how easy it is for her to see that is 47 by counting by tens and ones.I love using this book for kids learning to count collections because of the way the daughter arranges the commissioners into groups of 10.  This story seems to really resonate with young children especially since it is the young girl who figures out the easiest way to explain it to her father.Here are a few pictures from when I used this story recently with third graders.  The focus this time is on equality.We started by recording equations on the board that represented each person's answer using multiplication and addition. Here are the different ways the royal assistants and the princess counted the commissioners.  We worked together to solve the equations and saw that we ended up with 47 = 47 = 47.  This was a great way to kick of a series of lessons on multiplication facts, equality and what to do when there is more than one operation.  We then followed this up with my spring themed equality cards level 4 (on sale right now for $2!)."},
{"title": "Addition and Subtraction Word Problems and the Common Core", "date": "Sunday, April 6, 2014", "text": "TweetIf you are a regular reader of my blog, you know that there are 12 problem types for addition and subtraction word problems that students should know to show mastery of the Common Core Standards.  (If you are not a regular reader of my blog and want to stay up to date with creative ways to practice math, you may want to follow me on Pinterest, Facebook or by typing in your email on the right hand side of this page!)My second graders have been hard at work on developing conceptual understanding of double digit addition and subtraction over the last few weeks.  They have been inventing and sharing strategies and working with word problems with all 12 different problem types. Today I wanted to give them a chance for some extra independent practice with these skills.  I also wanted to get them up and moving around because spring fever is definitely in the air and everyone seems to be feeling a bit wiggly.  It wasn't quite warm enough to do this outside but we managed to get up to they gym for this lesson.  (if it is warm enough to be outside in your region, check out track math!)We used my newest set of word problem task cardsThese were a lot of fun for my students!  You can check then out (including a FREE preview) HERE!I printed the task cards on card stock, cut them apart and placed them around the perimeter of the gym.  Each kid got a clip board and a record sheet and they were off solving problems.  I love how engaged this makes students.  This is usually a group that requires a great deal of management yet for this assignment, I felt like I was on a vacation. Students move around the gym with clip boards solving problems.  Students can go in any order they want but there are never allowed to be more than 3 kids working near each card.  I also make sure that students know I do not want to see them near the same person over and over again.  At this point in the year, I wanted to see how students would do on their own with solving these types of problems.  Other times in the year I do a similar activity with fall and winter themed tasks and sometimes these are done with partners.  This time, I had students work alone and then consult with a partner as they finished up.  We call this having a math talk.A student's record sheet.  They have circled the answers that they disagreed with their partner on and together they will go back and find these cards and try to come to an agreement on an answer. Another students' answer keyOnce they have come to an agreement on answers, I do a quick consultation with the answer key.  If they have all the answers correct, I give them a blank task card and ask them to write an additional task that would go with this set.   As kids finish writing their own tasks, I have them switch with other kids and solve their problems on the back of their record sheet.Here are some problems the students wrote to go with the set.  Once everyone finishes up and we pick up all the cards, I give them this quick formative assessment to see where kids are in the current thinking and who needs more practice with these problem types and who is ready to move on.  It also gives me a look at what strategies students are using to solve double digit addition and subtraction problems.  Here is a look at some of the problems I used for formative assessment.  You can see that students are using several different strategies to solve these problems.My students are in great shape with meeting this standard!  I have a small group that needs a bit more practice but so far so good!Here is how I tucked these away for next year!  All organized and ready to go.Everything I need in one folder.  Cards, answer key, record sheets and formative assessment prompts.  Copies made and ready to go!I glue the title page to the front of the folder and I am all set to use these again next year or to try them out with another group!Want to try these with your students.  Head to my TPT Store to purchase the full set (on sale now!) or get a free preview set!"},
{"title": "Monday Math Literature Volume 37", "date": "Monday, March 31, 2014", "text": "TweetLast week, I showed you a lesson out of this book based on a great story about the number 1000.  Today I want to share with you another favorite out of this book.This is a great resource that will help you get even more out of your math literature collection.Math And NonfictionThis book is full of activities that go along with 20 different books at the grade 3-5 level.  They also have similar books for grades K-2and grades 6-8. This lesson is based on this great storyTiger Math This book is part of a series of animal math books written by Ann Whitehead Nagda.  My other favorites in this series include Polar Bear Math and Chimp Math.This book is all about a baby tiger named T.J. who was born in a Zoo and has a hard time gaining weight and growing at a steady rate.  On the right hand pages, it tells the story of T.J. and shows some very cute pictures.  On the left hand pages, it shows graphs that support the data found in the story.  The graphs include bar graphs, line graphs and pictographs.  I did this lesson with a class of third graders but it would also work well in grades 2-5.The lesson from the Math And Nonfiction books starts by having you read the story to the kids.  The lesson plan has you just read the right hand pages and not even show the left hand pages, but my students were so into the data and so engaged by the story, that I did show some of the graphs on the left.  While we were reading the story and looking at some of the graphs we had a very rich discussion about how the slope of the graph reflected weight gain and loss and how the steepness corresponded to how quickly or slowly his weight was changing.After reading the story, the kids we so into the story of T.J.  I knew I had them hooked.  The lesson from the Math and Nonfiction book did some really creative things from here.First, I showed a pictograph from the beginning of the story.  This is one graph I made sure I didn't show them when reading the story.  I covered much of it up with sticky notes.A peak at part of the graph.  Students had to think about what the graph was showing and what other information we were missing.  As they thought of something else on the graph, I removed another sticky note.  Once the graph was revealed in its entirety, I had 13 kids represent the different kinds of tigers and we made a human pictograph in the middle of the classroom.  Each kid represented 500 tigers just like each tiger picture in the pictograph represents 500 tigers.Kids graph themselves by tiger type.  Extra kids got to be tiger wranglers and help me line everyone upHere is where I was super impressed with this lesson.  The kids moved into one long line and then closed the line into a circle to make a circle graph.  I had never thought about making this connection for kids between a pictograph and a circle graph.  It worked very well and the kids were so impressed.After the kids moved from a line into a circle, I had them stand shoulder to shoulder and then sit down. We used meter sticks to make the partitions between the different groups of tigers.    We had a quick discussion about how the graphs were similar and which one showed the data better.  Kids had great insights to share like noticing how it was easier to see that more than half the tigers were Bengal tigers in the circle graph than the pictograph.

I have turned to several books to challenge students and get them excited about math.  Math Detectives is one I wrote about several months ago that I use to challenge K-3 students.  Cool Math is another one I have written about that I use to challenge students in grades 3-6.Today I want to share with you a new favorite book and a lesson I did with a group of students based on one of the ideas in the book.Go Figure!: A Totally Cool Book About NumbersNear the beginning of the book, there is a history of some of the ways numbers have been written in the past.  If you know any Egyptian or mathematical history,  you know the Egyptian numbers were quite complicated and required quite a few symbols to write each number.  Because of this, multiplication was challenging for the Egyptians so they developed this great strategy for multi-digit multiplication based on the idea of doubling.  I showed their strategy to my students and they worked together to see if it always seems to work and to figure out why it works. Check out some of the problemsLook at the number on the left.  Start with the number 1 and double it until you get to the point where the next doubling would be bigger than the number on the left.  Take the number on the right and double it just as many times as you doubled on the left.  Find the numbers in the left hand column that add up to the number on the top left.  Cross out any numbers you did not use and the numbers across from them.  Add up the numbers left on the right.   Here is another oneThis one made for easy doubling and easy addition!Now that they had the process down, we started thinking about why it worksHere kids made the connection that the 188 across from the 4 represented 4 groups of 188.  The 752 across from the 16 represents 16 groups of 47.  Now they pull it all togetherHere is where students REALLY got what was happening and were able to write it out and talk about how it represented the distributive property.  I also had a student who was able to show how it connected to using an array.  This lesson led to a great discussion about multiple strategies for multi-digit multiplication and how some strategies are more efficient than others and how the numbers in the problem change the efficiency of some strategies.  How do you challenge kids who are ready for it? Looking for a great book on teaching multiplication?  Check out this post!Here is a fun way to practice double digit multiplication."},
{"title": "Common Core Standards for Telling Time: Grade 1", "date": "Thursday, March 27, 2014", "text": "TweetHave your first graders started working on time?  I just introduced time to my first graders a week ago and they are already doing a great job!The Common Core standard for telling time can be found in the Measurement & Data section. CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.1.MD.B.3Tell and write time in hours and half-hours using analog and digital clocks.It is short and to the point.  First graders need to tell time to the hour and half hour.  Here are a few quick and easy ways I get my students to meet this standardIntroducing the Floor Clock (Time Mat)I have several Judy clocks and they are great for whole group instruction.  However, when I really want to get little kids engaged in talking about the clock, I pull out my Time Mat.  This is a huge clock that folds conveniently in a box but is big and kids can gather around it. I start by laying the clock on the floor and asking kids what they notice.  (I do not attache the hands prior to doing this.)  I have them share their idea with a partner and then we share as a whole group.Next I put the hour hand on the clock or have one of the students do it.A student attaches the hour hand to the time matNext we talk about what the hour hand looks like at 6:00, 11:00 5:00, etc.  We get to the big idea that when it is something o'clock, the hour hand is pointing right at the number.Next, I show them that sometimes the hour hand is right between two numbers.  We talk about this being half an hour and being half way between two numbers.  My students have a good conceptual understanding of half at this point in the year because we have already done our fraction unit.Students see just the hour hand and it is pointing in the middle of two numbersNext we attach the minute hand and use both hands to show what time to the hour and half an hour look like.First I make times and the student tells or writes the time.  Then I say show me a time and the students make it on the time matNext we do the same think with time to the half hourThis lesson up to this point takes about 20 minutes.  Then we work on other things or go to our math stations.Moving from Whole Group Practice to Independent or Partner PracticeOver the next few days, I might use the Judy clock or the time mat again to model times or have students model times.  After several days of this as whole group instruction, I give each student their own mini geared Judy clock and I have them build times as I name them.  The geared mini clocks are more expensive than the non-geared one but I think they are completely worth it!  They work like a real clock and really help students understand that the hands move together.Practicing at Math StationsAfter I feel kids are getting proficient with this, I introduce a telling time number puzzle that becomes one of our math stations.  Kids are given digital and analog times and asked to match them.  The puzzles are great because they are self-checking.  If they don't fit together, the student does not have the right answer.Students work on telling time number puzzles during math stationsA student completes all the puzzles at the telling time work stationChecking inAfter a day or two of kids having the chance to play with the time puzzles and practice alone and with a partner, I give them this quick formative assessment that comes with the time puzzles.  It lets me see who has the concept and who needs to be pulled to my table during math stations for some extra instruction and practice.  It is very easy for me to sort these into piles of kids who get it and kids who don't.  The kids who don't get it are added to my list of intervention groups and get extra instruction during math station time over the next few days.Here is a student who seems to understand time to the half hour but has some major confusion over time to the hour.  This student will be part of my intervention group!This student clearly needs more instruction! Most of the students' papers look like this.  A quick and easy way for me to see that they are getting the big ideas and their practice is paying off.A few other things about telling timeHere are some great You Tube videos and songs for telling timeHere is a fun game I use for telling time to the five minutes and to the minuteReady for more?

{"title": "My Favorite Classroom Supplies: Pencil Sharpener", "date": "Wednesday, March 26, 2014", "text": "TweetAs a math teacher, I am a big fan of kids using pencils for most of their work.  As a math student in college, I got exposed to many different ideas about the best pencils out there.  I like really sharp pencils and for a while was all about mechanical pencils.  However, I work primarily with elementary students.  Mechanical pencils do not work well with kids under 12.  The push to hard to they just play with the pencil constantly.  As such, I have good back to my roots and the original old pencil as my primary writing utensil.  I still like my pencils to be VERY sharp.Also as I have spent a great deal of time co-teaching and being in other teachers' classrooms, I have discovered how much time gets wasted by kids looking for pencils, sharpening pencils and trying to fix the pencil sharpener.  Because of this, I always have a huge mug full of sharp pencils ready to go for my students.  Since I spend my own time sharpening pencils, I have been on a quest to find the perfect pencil sharpener.  I have tried hand crank ones and electric ones and have found that nothing seems to last long.I was very happy when I saw a few posts on Facebook about a small company making great pencil sharpeners for classrooms.  I love that it is a small company run by a teacher as a side business.  It is called Classroom Friendly Supplies.  Here are some pictures of my students using the pencil sharpener and some thing we have discovered about it.You don't have to hold the pencil!  This eliminates students' pushing to hard and keeps the pencil held exactly where it needs to be!  It comes with a clamp to attach it to a table or shelf but works great without it as well. Before and after shot.  The pencil on the left was sharpened using the electric pencil sharpener I bought at the beginning of this school year.  The one on the right is from the Classroom Friendly Supply sharpener. A shot at the inside of the sharpener.  I have a group of sixth graders who think a great STEM task would be to take this sharpener and a few others apart and see why this one works so much better.  It is a great idea and think of all they would learn!  However, it isn't happening to my new pencil sharpener!  Here is the collection drawer after sharpening 5 new pencils.  Not much gets wasted!  My students can sharpen a new pencil in 7 seconds.  It takes me about 10.What are your favorite classroom supplies?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

Today I want to share with you an activity called Scoop Em Up.  It is from the first grade section but I made adaptions to it and did it during a second grade morning meeting.  It is the PERFECT follow up to the counting and estimating routines I do in grades K-4.  It takes what they have learned in a whole group setting during a counting and estimating routine and asks them to do it more efficiently and to work with a partner instead of the whole group.  It was also a great way to get kids to generate their own strategies for 3 digit addition. Here is the morning message they saw upon entering the classroomEach student was paired up with another student as they came in.  I have several large buckets of buttons and gave kids a fairly large scoop.  I wanted each pair to have more than 100 buttons. A student gets ready to scoop buttonsSecond graders need to be comfortable with numbers to 1000 so I chose a small object and a large scoop.  If I was doing this with younger children, I would choose bigger objects and/or a smaller scoop.  If I was doing this in grade 3 or 4, I would choose very small items like popcorn kernels or elbow macaroni noodles and give them a big scoop.  Each pair dumped their scoop on the floor and figured out how many they had in all.  There was a lot of arranging into groups of ten and one hundred.Here a group has two piles of 100, several piles of 10 and some ones left overAs students finished counting, we erased the morning message and had kids write the amount they had on the white board.  Amounts ranged from about 180 up to 290.  We talked about why if everyone used the same scoop we got different answers.  Kids who scooped from the bottom of the bucket definitely got more.  We only had about 6 minutes left at this point and I wanted to review a few concepts with them so I choose two numbers, 188 and 270 to focus on for our discussion.Here we found which number was larger and used the less than and greater than symbols to compare the numbersThen we wrote the numbers in expanded notation and discussed how expanded notation matched their piles of hundreds, tens and onesI finished the meeting with this BIG idea question about putting the two groups of buttons together.  Kids had about two minutes to think and then we discussed strategies.  There were several ways but most involved starting by adding the hundreds and then the tens.  I took some quick notes above on one of the strategies.  The student added the 70 and 80 by taking 30 out of the 80 to put with the 70 (because it makes 100!).  This is a great illustration of why knowing combinations of 100 is so important for a second grader!This morning meeting was so much fun and we squeezed so much extra math out of the morning!  This book is giving me so many new ideas!"},

Today I want to share with you a resource that will help you get even more out of your math literature collection.Math And NonfictionThis book is full of activities that go along with 20 different books at the grade 3-5 level.  They also have similar books for grades K-2and grades 6-8. Today I want to show you one of the activities from this book.  It was done with a full class of third graders.  It uses the bookHow Much, How Many, How Far, How Heavy, How Long, How Tall Is 1000?This activity starts by showing students the book and asking them to think about the title and what it means.  Next, we changed the focus from 1000 to 100 because we had just passed the hundredth day and it is a much more measurable amount for students.  We brainstormed a list of questions that we could ask about how much, many, far, long, tall and heavy 100 isThe beginnings of our brainstormAfter our brainstorming session, I paired students up and asked them to choose a question to investigate.  They had to report back to me when they were ready with a plan that detailed which question they were going to try to answer and what materials they needed.  As their plans got approval, they went out and found the answers.  Their was not any prep work for this lesson, they wrote their plans on scrap paper.  I was impressed at how well this lesson had kids reviewing all kinds of topics and making decisions for themselves about how to measure, what unit to use and how to be efficient.  These students measured the height of 100 unifix cubes.  They chose to use inches as their unit and used several yardsticks to do the measuring.These students figured out that to measure how far 100 pieces of paper went would take them longer than the time I gave them.  They knew they could measure one piece of paper and multiply by 100 to figure out how many inches.  They do not know how to do larger number multiplication and division yet but given a calculator were able to figure out that it was 1,100 inches or 92 feet.  They then used the measuring wheel to see how far down the hall 92 feel was.  This was a great way to give themselves and their classmates a frame of reference when talking about 92 feet. These students looked at how many centimeters in 100 inches and made an estimate about how many centimeters are in 100 feet.  These students wanted to find out the weight of 100 paperclips.  If your students are going to weigh something in grams, make sure you have a classroom scale that is accurate and precise.  We finished the lesson by each pair presenting their findings.  This lesson up to this point took about 45 minutes.  Because of some changes in that day's schedule we were out of time so we finished up the lesson the next day by reading the book How Much, How Many, How Far, How Heavy, How Long, How Tall Is 1000?"},

Today I want to share with you yet another money activity that I did with second graders.  I did this with the a full class of second graders during morning meeting but I want to share with you how I did this with a small intervention group before the whole group lesson.  The kids in this intervention group have shown that they need the most support with money, especially with counting quarters.  I find that introducing an activity like this to my intervention group before a whole group lesson can make them feel more confident and give them the extra practice they need.  The whole group activity happened in a similar way.This activity is called quarters and comes from the first grade section.  I used one of the variations that they suggest in the book to make it more challenging.I gave each kid a small handful of coins consisting of pennies, nickles and dimes.  They roll two ten sided dice and find the sum.  Whatever the sum is, they find that much money from their coin pile and put it in the middle of the table.  If they get 12, they can make 12 cents any way they know how.  We did have a great discussion about different ways we can make 12 and which way is the most efficient. A student rolls the dice, finds the sum and places that much money in the center of the table.Then they pass the dice to the next person.A student counts money to add to the center pileOnce several students have had a turn, I explain to the students that they are trying to see how many quarters they can earn before time is up.  We discuss how much a quarter is worth and I ask them if they think there is enough money in the center pile to trade for a quarter.  They find that there is and make the trade.  After each kid has their turn from here on out, we stop to see how much money is in the center and if there is enough for us to trade.Here is our collection of quarters as the game progressesWe played for about 7 minutes and when time was up, we checked for any final trades.  I then asked each student to count up how much money was left in their small pile of dimes, nickles and quarters and to write that amount on the board.  We have been working in class on writing money amounts using a dollar sign and a decimal point and I was hoping they would do this on their own.This ended up serving as great formative assessment  around the student's current ability to write money amounts.  Notice most students used a dollar sign and a decimal point.  One student used cent notation as well and one student only used cent notation.  Notice in the upper right hand corner one student wrote $4.02.  They had $0.42 left so this sparked some interesting discussionWe finished by counting the quarters we had collected several times.  Two days later when it was time to do this in morning meeting with the whole group, these kids did a great job and felt very confident.

Today I want to share with you a quick and easy way to give students another chance to practice these combinations but still have fun!  All you need is some plastic Easter eggs and jelly beans or small candies.  (I used these Starburst jelly beans.  They are so much tastier than regular jelly beans.  They are also slightly smaller so you can fit more of them under an egg.

{"title": "Reviewing for the Smarter Balanced Assessment", "date": "Wednesday, March 19, 2014", "text": "TweetIn the next few weeks, many of my students will be taking the Smarter Balanced Assessment for the very first time.  Although the assessment officially does not begin until next year, we will be piloting the full test in the next few months. This is a huge change for us!  Not only are we going from our State standards to the Common Core standards, but we are moving our testing from the fall to the spring.  We are also moving from a paper and pencil test to a computer based one.  With all of these changes, the materials I have used in the past to review math concepts for state assessments are just about useless to me now.  I also feel like I have to find new and more creative ways to review because holding onto students' attention in the spring can be trickier than keeping them engaged in the fall. Today I want to share with you one way I have started reviewing for this new assessment.  I did this series of lessons with my third graders and it was so successful, I will be doing something similar with my older students.  I also am thinking of ways to adapt this for my younger students.  Although they don't have to take the official assessment, I think it is a great way to review and practice what they have learned all year.I used this set of riddles for my lesson with third grade!The first thing I did when I got this product was to print and prep all the materials I would need.  While I was doing that, I noticed there were a lot of great vocabulary words on the cards that my third graders SHOULD know.  However, I also knew that there were probably many kids who didn't know all these words.  So, I took about 40 minutes of whole group instruction time to address this issue.Day 1I read a riddle card to students that included the word quadrilateral.  I asked students to raise their hand if they heard a word that they didn't understand the meaning of.  Several hands when up when I said quadrilateral so I wrote that word on the board.  I then passed out a small pile of riddle cards to each student and asked them to read each riddle and write any words they did not understand or that they did not think others would understand on the board.Here are the vocabulary words kids identified as ones that they or other third graders might not understandOnce all of the cards had been read, I chose a word from the board and modeled how to figure out what it meant.  I provided several copies of the Math Dictionary for Kids and the link to this online math dictionary. I then demonstrated how to make a quick definition poster with an example that we could hang on the wall to help us with these riddles. I had kids choose words, some ended up in pairs and they all got to work finding out more about their word. A student uses the online math dictionary to help them define rectangular prismStudents took a few minutes to share their new knowledge with the class and then pinned their posters up around the 100's chart.This lesson took about 40 minutes.  It was a great way to review vocabulary that will be appearing on their assessment and that they will need to be successful in future grades.  It will also provide support to those who need it when we are working on the riddles in whole group, small group or individual work time situations.Day 2I had about 30 minutes the second day and I wanted to spend it introducing some of the ways we could use the 100's grid riddles.  We started by choosing a few of the cards to do as a whole group.  One of the cards we did as a whole groupThen I introduced 3 different ways to use the cards and had kids choose the way that they wanted to try first. Using the Classroom Hundreds Chart    The idea of getting to be up in front of the class hundreds chart appealed to many students but I could only let a few up there at a time.  When these cards are offered at center time, I am sure this will be a very popular way to use them.  A student reads a card at the 100's chartTo play at the 100's chart, students read a riddle and mark the answer with a star.  The stars are included and come in several different colors.  The kids can try for 3 in a row or whatever works in your room.  Using a Small Hundreds Chart     This is an easy way to get kids involved in the 100's riddles.  All they need is a pile of the riddle cards and a small hundreds chart.  They find the answer to the riddles on the chart and circle it or color it in.  Each player needs a different color.Students work on solving riddles and finding numbers on the 100's chart.  MANY skills are reviewed by these riddles and the kids think it is so much fun!Using a Graphic Organizer     The other way to use these cards is with the included graphic organizer.  This is a great way for kids to play alone or with another person.  They figure out the answer and color in the section that their answer is in.  Here they are trying to find a wide range of answers. Each student has a graphic organizer that says things like between 1 and 20 or between 35 and 50.  When they get an answer in this range, they get to color in that section on their chart.  These students also needed to see a 100's grid for reference to support their thinking.  Moving Forward  Over the last 2 days, I have given kids the introduction they need to use these cards successfully.  Now that they know the expectations and have supports in place if they need them, they are ready for these cards to be added to our math center rotation.  At the math center, I will be allowing kids to choose the way that they practice with them.  They will also be available for students to use when they are finished other work and have a few spare minutes.  They are also good for transitions and time fillers.  The 100's chart in this room is near the door where kids line up and while we are waiting for everyone to be in line, reading one of these riddles and having kids solve it is a great way to squeeze a few extra minutes of math practice into the day.  Storing the Cards This really is an inclusive set and I have come up with a great way to store everything needed for kids to do this center in one place.  I used a top loading folder to keep everything in one place.100's charts, graphic organizer, directions and cards, all in one folder.  This is actually the set for grades 4 and 5 that I will be using next week as I start reviewing in those grades! If you teach multiple grades like I do, you might be interested in the Combo Pack.  The Combo Pack includes the primary, third grade and intermediate set of cards. Get the Combo Pack!You can also head over to Primary Inspiration for your chance to win a set!Have you started reviewing for spring testing?  What are your best tips?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

I decided to pull them to a table after whole group instruction the next day and work on a few small interventions to help them understand this important skill.  It was very focused and intentional which I find very important when doing interventions.  I started with reviewing how to read numbers such as 100, 12, 5, etc using my arrow cards.  Check out this guest post I did over at Kid's Math Teacher if you want to read more about how I use arrow cards!Here is 112 pulled apart- also known as expanded form!Here are the numbers 100 and 12.  Watch what happens when I put them together.Here is the number 112.  I love how the arrow cards let kids see all the pieces that make up the numberAfter practicing with the arrow cards, I gave each student three place value cards and had them read the numbers to a partner.  Then each kid read the numbers aloud to the entire group.   After each kid practiced reading their own numbers, those of their partner and hearing all the numbers read aloud to the group, I collected the cards and had a student flip through them as I chose students to read them aloud. This entire intervention took place in 12 minutes.  I will pull this same group one day next week and do parts of this again as well as having students write numbers in this range as I read them.  I will follow up by the end of next week with formative assessment to see if all these students have mastered this skill.How do you use intervention in  your classroom to make sure students are developing the skills they need?"},
{"title": "Understanding Rates", "date": "Friday, March 14, 2014", "text": "TweetMy sixth graders have been hard at work finishing up our work on proportional reasoning.  We just spent the last few weeks on measurement conversion and have covered most of the Common Core Standards for Ratios and Proportions in grade 6.  This week we were finishing up measurement conversion and working on some basic distance, rate and time formulas. Last summer, I read several proportional reasoning books and in one of them (can't remember which at this time!) they talked a great deal about research around how kids do not understand rates such as miles per hour.  They often think of it as one word and do not understand it is a rate between two quantities.As we were solving distance, rate and time problems my students seemed to be doing a good job with problems in the context of miles and hours and miles per hour but were having a harder time with other contexts.  They also quite often were getting the correct numerical answer but did not know the meaning of the quantity they came up with.  Was it miles or hours?I decided to address these issues by starting off class by meeting the kids at the door with a pile of markers and having them go to the board and write a quantity under one of the labels, time, distance or rate.  I was predicting that there would be many more examples under time and distance than there would be under rate.  My formative assessment showed me that students really didn't understand rates. Here is what I got for responses.  As you can see students had many more examples of time and distance than they did about rate.  We opened class by discussing these ideas starting with time and moving to the right.  As we discussed them, kids thought of other ideas and we added to the list.Here are our additions to the list.  As we started getting into more rates, the students really got the idea that there was a distance and a time included in each rate.   After finishing this discussion, we went back to the distance, rate and time formulas and connected them to what we already know about multiplication and division. This helped clear up more thinking!  Also kids were able to make the connection between a rate being a combination of distance and time by taking another look at these formulas.The Common Core standards have certainly increased the amount of proportional thinking required of sixth grade students!  How are your students handling the change?"},

I have ten frame cards that I got out of this book (which is my favorite book for all things ten frame!).  The book also has double ten frames (aka 20 frames) but does not have them in card size.  Since I am completely incompetent at using the copier to shrink things, I just made my own. Here is a look at my 20 frame cards.  If you want to use these with your students, you can click here to download them from Google drive.  I made 2 copies of each page for each deck.  I made the decks on different colored cardstock so that I could keep them from getting mixed up.I showed this game to a small group of kids and had them share it with their classmates.  Each kid got 5 cards to start.  They look for any matches.  A match is any 2 cards (it has to be 2 cards!) that make 20.  After everyone has checked their own deck for matches, they choose someone and ask them for a card.  They ask like this.  \"Do you have a 12 to go with my 8 to make 20?\"  and the other person responds \"yes I do (or no I don't) have a 12 to go with your 8 to make 20.\"  I know this is incredibly specific, but I think it is important that kids are verbalizing these combinations.  They usually need a few reminders when they start to play but quickly pick up on it and it becomes part of the game.These particular students had already played this game with 10 frames last year and earlier this year so they had no trouble getting started.

Example: If you have 2 dimes and 3 pennies, how many cents do you have?CCSS.Math.Content.3.NBT.A.2 Fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction.The students were sitting in a circle and I gave each student a white board and a bag of coins.  The coins were something I just estimated and put in a bag.  I did intentionally put a few bags that would have some dollars and less than ten cents left over.  This is because on a recent assessment, I noticed several kids in this class were representing money amounts such as $3.08 as $3.8.  I wanted to address this so I made sure 3 of the bags of change contained an amount that would come up this way. I also gave each kid their own bag because this is a group of kids where when paired up one partner tends to dominate and the other hitches along for the ride.  I didn't want to change their seating because I was joining in on a morning meeting so I just gave them each their own.I had kids look at the bag of change and gave them about 20 second to look before making an estimate.  We shared our estimates aloud.I then had kids dump out their bag of money and count it.  When they were certain of the amount, they were to write how much they had on their white board and put the change back in the bag.A student organizes and counts moneyAs students finished, I had them place their white board in front of them so that everyone could see what had been written.Students display their money amountsWhen everyone was ready, I had had students look at a few boards such as the one above that shows $3.02.  I had another student read the amount and then I asked them why the person put that zero there.  This led to a great discussion about why we put the zero there and what happens if we don't.  I also asked them to look at boards such as the one that says $2.99 and tell me about how much money that person had.  This led to a quick discussion of rounding and how why so many things in stores are priced with 99 cents included.I then asked the kids to look at each of the white boards and make an estimate about how much money we had as a class.  After two minutes of quiet think time, I asked students to share their estimate and how they figured it out.  The kids seemed to all have chosen one of these three strategies.  Strategy 1: Some students added up the dollars and ignored the cents.  They got about $40.  I asked them if this was an over estimate or an under estimate.  They did a good job in understanding that there had to be more than $40.  Some kids counted the 99 cents as another dollar and some did not. Strategy 2: Some students rounded to the nearest dollar and added the amounts.  These kids seemed to think they had a slight over estimate because many of the numbers rounded up.  (turns out they were right!)Strategy 3: A few students added the dollars up and then rounded the cents to the nearest ten and added those up.  They got very close to the actual answer and got a really good mental workout.From here, I split the class into two groups and completely added this on from the way this activity is described in the book.This class has many kids who perform really well in math and many kids who require a lot of intervention in math.  There are not a lot of kids in the middle.  I had the kids I am certain are accurate at counting money collect the whiteboards (not erased!) and go to a corner of the classroom to figure out how much money we ACTUALLY had.  I gave them no more guidance than this because I really wanted to see how they would tackle this problem on their own. For the kids who require intervention, I really wanted to check in on their coin counting skills and give them a little more practice in this area.  I had them switch bags of money and count their partner's bag to see if they agreed with the amount their partner got.  Most did. (yeah!) But the few that did not had to count the money again with their partner and come to an agreement.  This gave them another experience at counting money and provided an opportunity for them to learn from each other. Meanwhile, the other group was able to figure out exactly how much money the whole class had with no guidance from me.  There were 6 kids in this group.  They each took a few whiteboards and found the total amount of money on the boards they had.  Then they reported it to the group and the group kept a running total of the amount of money they had.  Check this out!  I was so impressed, I had to figure it out for myself and turns out they were right!  They also grouped the boards in a way that made this much easier.  I am truly amazed at what kids can do when they are given the chance.  The best part is they did this all mentally!  A group's running total of how much money the whole class had. I will be sharing other ideas from this book as I visit classrooms and try to get more math into morning meeting! Check out these other ideas for teaching money!Teaching Math With You Tube Videos: CoinsSo Does Mine!

How Big Is a Million?This is the story of Pipkin, a curious penguin who reminds me of a K-2 student who wants the big questions answered.  What he wants to know most of all is how big is a million? He waddles around and finds what 10, 100, 1000 look like.  He can't seem to find a million of anything despite looking all over the South Pole.  Finally, he returns home and his Mom shows him a million stars.I love how this book incorporates penguins and math.  Because I do a series of penguin math centers and penguin problem solving with my first graders, this book is perfect for reading to them.  I love how it shoes 10, 100 and 1000.  So many of my students at the first grade level think 100 is the biggest thing there is and have many misconceptions about a million.  This book is a fun and gentle way to show them more about the numbers they will be learning in the future.  It also ties in nicely with the penguin information they are learning in science class about the way penguins huddle up to stay warm, what they eat and what the climate is like.  It is a great addition to an integrated unit on penguins.  Looking for more penguin stuff?  Check out these two free penguin addition fact iPad apps!Head over to volume 34 to read more about some great geometry books for grades K-2."},

{"title": "Spring Theme Word Problems for Addition and Subtraction ", "date": "Wednesday, February 26, 2014", "text": "TweetI love spring time and all the energy it brings to teachers and students.  It is a time to start fresh and try new ideas.  It is also a time to make sure kids have the most essential skills required for success in the next grade and on state and local assessments.  For my second and third graders, I am looking to be sure they are VERY solid with double digit addition and subtraction and can read story problems and find the answers.  I created these Common Core aligned task cards to help me with this goal.Here is a peek at my spring themed task cards.  You can grab this set of 4 for free here or check out the full set here! I looked closely at the Common Core Table 1 of different addition problem types.  Students in the grades 2 and 3 are responsible for being able to solve all of these different problem types. A look at table 1 from the Common Core.  It shows the 12 different problem types that second and third graders need to be able to solve.My students have been working on this super important skill all year and this time I really want to make sure all my students can be successful with these at an independent level.  If your students are just starting out or have not worked with all the different problem types, you might want to present them in a more supported way.My plan is to use these on the first nice warm spring day.  We will go outside where we have a gravel track that runs around the soccer field.  There will be 3-4 task cards clipped to each of five different clip boards spread out around the track.  The kids will each have a clipboard of their own with a record sheet on it.  They will scoot around the track and solve one task card at each of the five clipboards.  They will go around and around until time is up or they have solved all of the task cards.This will be a fun way to get the kids outside and getting a little exercise and enjoying spring while still practicing math!  If spring waits to long, we may end up doing the same type of scoot game right in the classroom or the gym. As kids finish up, I will have them get with another student and compare answers.  On any problems where they disagree on an answer, they have to go find that task card and work out the answer together.  If they can't come to an agreement on the correct answer, they come to me for some help.  When they are done having their \"math talk\" and all their answers agree, I can quickly check their record sheet against the answer key.  Then if other kids are still finishing up, I often give them a blank task card so they can write their own problem.  Then other early finishers can solve their problem or we can use them for warm ups or homework over the next week.Blank task cards help me further differentiate the set by allowing students who finish early to write their own problems.  I also sometimes have all students write another problem to add to the set or to exchange with another student and solve. My students (and me!) always have fun with task cards.  They are a great way to add variety to your week! Don't forget to check out the free cards or the full set!TweetEach year I have a great time celebrating Pi day with my oldest students.  In the weeks leading up to Pi day, we do a simple lesson on measuring the diameter and circumference of a circle that helps them discover Pi. Here is the record sheet I made for my students to use.  Click here to grab this record sheet and my lesson plan from google drive (FREE).  You can also get access to this printable and 19 other March MATH freebies as part of the Ultimate Math March Bundle FREEBIEHere are some of the other ways we celebrate Pi day.Activities and VideosPi day carolsFun with digitsMathematical Pi SongLose Yourself in the Digits of PiBooksSir Cumference and the Dragon of Pi This is a fun book from the Sir Cumference Series.  It is a picture book that the students love and it reinforces the idea of the circumference being a little more than three times the diameter.  My student love this book so much that a few years ago I had a group of students who re-wrote the book as a play and ever since there has been a group of students who perform the play as part of our Pi Day festivities.  Pi: A Biography of the World's Most Mysterious NumberThis is a book I share with interested students.  It answers many of the questions my students come up with about Pi.  It is written in an easy to read way and tells some about the history of Pi, stories about people's obsessions over Pi and different ways Pi has been used. Novelty ItemsOver the years I have collected and made with students many novelty items for Pi dayPi pie panThis was a gift from a student several years ago.  It is fun for making a pi day dessert.  I am not a big pie maker, but for pi day, I like to make an exception. Pi ShirtsThis is my Pi Day t-shirt.  It is awesome!  It really lets out my inner math geek and who doesn't love an excuse to wear a t-shirt to work? Every year there are more pi themed shirts to choose from. T-Shirt Markers These are a necessity when we do make your own Pi day t-shirts.  I have students bring in a light colored t-shirt from home or purchase a large pack of white undershirts.  Then they decorate their t-shirts with a giant Pi symbol and facts about pi.  Everyone wears them on Pi day and it makes fpr a great group picture. Digits of Pi contestEvery year, we have kids who are super interested in reciting the digits of Pi.  I share a quick video like this oneThen I print and copy a list of the first few hundred digits of Pi and the kids who are really interested spend a lot of at home practicing.  The 2020 bundle of bundles is on sale now only until Monday!  This is almost $300 worth of resources for grades 3-5 for just $19!  It includes my QR code scavenger hunt BUNDLE and great math bundles from some of my internet friends! How do you celebrate Pi Day with your students?  Please leave ideas or links in the comments below!"},

One of my favorite penguin activities has been these two games we use to work on place value, reading and writing numbers to 120 and comparing numbers using the >, < symbols.   A fun two pack of games to work on important first grade skills!I have noticed that some of my students need a little more practice with these skills and some are ready for a challenge.  I did some searching and found this fantastic and free penguin themed game to work on place value.  The game is called Place the Penguins and is a great way to work on place value.  It is offered at 2 levels as well.  Level 1 was great for my students who needed a little more practice with numbers under 100 and level 2 challenged some of my students to work on numbers up to 1000. A look at the welcome screen.  Here is where you select your level.  Level 1: I have placed one penguin on 50 and still have to place the other penguin on a number to make 54Level 1: I have placed a penguin on 80 and a penguin on 7.  My students made some great connections between this game and our arrow cards.  Here is a look at level 2.  The first penguin is selected and ready to be placed on a number in the hundreds.  Level 2 after all three penguins have been placedLevel 2:  After placing all the penguins where they belong they get off the mat and squish themselves together to show the number that they make.  This is a great game to use to introduce the idea of expanded notation which is something second graders are responsible for under the Common Core.Next week I will use the penguin version of I have who has? to see how kids are doing with reading and writing numbers.  It is a fun game that makes a great formative assessment!I also got a few new books this week to add to my penguin book collection based on some recommendations from blog readers.  I can't wait to use these with my students!365 PenguinsThis book is adorable and will be a great way to challenge some of my most capable students.  I am sure the entire class will love this story and it will expose students to some bigger math ideas like multiplication.  Some of my students are so ready for this challenge! Penguin ChickEvery year my students fall in love with penguin chicks.  This is a great non-fiction book that many of my students will be able to read themselves.  We have a big push in my school to add more non-fiction to our literature collections.  This is a great way to do that and tie it in with our math theme. How Big is a Million?This sweet penguin is on a quest to find out how big a million is.  He looks at 10, 100 and 1,000 on his way to finding a million. I am excited to spend the next few weeks on this penguin theme and am very much looking forward to spring!"},

{"title": "My Fear of Standardized Testing ", "date": "Friday, February 14, 2014", "text": "TweetWhen I first started teaching and would talk to colleagues about how teaching had changed over the years, I was always surprised by how many teachers lacked enthusiasm for the new standards and new standardized test that was just being rolled out.  To me, a fresh faced 21 year old just out of college, it seemed to be the standards and the test that would revolutionize teaching.  Fast forward many years and now as new standards and a new standardized test are being rolled out AGAIN, I am finally understanding what those teachers were talking about.It has become my greatest fear that entirely to much time is being spent teaching to a test that doesn't mean anything and doesn't measure who students really are.  As we are spending training time learning how the new standardized test works and how it is going to revolutionize teachers, I am thinking about how preparing them for the test does not prepare them for life.  I am thinking about a student who I know will not get a good score on this test but will be just fine in life.  I am thinking of another student who will do quite well on this test but who I worry about every single day because the skills needed to survive life are lacking.  I want to be the teacher that inspires kids and teaches them to think.  I don't want to be someone who teaches procedures and rules.  I want my students to think about problems and solutions and ultimately be successful in life.  I want to give them the tools they need to overcome obstacles and disabilities.  I want to guide them to be good people.  I want them to feel successful. This video sums up everything I don't want for my studentsThis book is a great one to lighten the mood when you are thinking about testing.Testing Miss MalarkeyMr. Falker, the teacher in this story is someone I aspire to be like.

{"title": "Working Toward Conceptual Understanding of Double Digit Subtraction Part 2", "date": "Thursday, February 13, 2014", "text": "TweetSeveral weeks ago, I posted about an intervention group of third graders who need some major conceptual development around double digit subtraction.  Today I want to show you how we moved forward from there.  The following shows some of the steps I took with this same group of students to move them toward three digit subtraction. Place Value to 1000I used several things to make sure students had an understanding of place value of three digit numbers as well as the ability to read and write these numbers.  I used my arrow cards along with my place value to 1000 deck for most of these activities.  Here students use arrow cards and sketches to represent the number 850Here you can see that a student has written the number 480 as 804.  Using the visual images on the place value deck along with hands on activities with base 10 pieces and group discussion helps correct this problem.  When students are comfortable with numbers up to 1000, I use the larger arrow cards to push to even larger numbers.  Here students build a number using arrow cards to read to the rest of their group.  Here students write numbers to match the pictures on the place value deck cardsPlaying 10 more/10 less and 100 more/100 lessThe next step was to make sure kids were comfortable adding and subtracting 10 and 100.  We play this simple game using the place value deck to practice this important skill.  The visual images of the base 10 pieces really support this skill as it is developing.Students create their own record sheet.  The number of the card they flip goes in the middle.  To the left they find 10 less (or 100 less) and to the right they find 10 more (or 100 more)This game is simple, effective and requires no teacher prep.  My favorite kind!Moving into subtracting other numbersWe then moved into doing some problems and problem strings as a group.  This is when kids are shown the problem, get some think time and then we share answers and strategies with the whole group or with a partner and then with the whole group.Here is how one student used previous knowledge about 100 - 78 to get himself started with 1000 - 781Here is another student's process for finding the answer to 1000 - 781Here is how another student thinks about 1000 - 781.  Notice how they use addition to add up to 1000.  This group has come a long way in a few short weeks.  I am hoping to be able to say they are all caught up with their peers (at least in this area!)  It takes some time, but this conceptual development of big ideas of mathematics is always worth it!"},

When I first read the Common Core standards, I was surprised to see early fraction standards included under the geometry heading.  After thinking about it, it really does make perfect sense.  Here is the standard for first grade.CCSS.Math.Content.1.G.A.3 Partition circles and rectangles into two and four equal shares, describe the shares using the words halves, fourths, and quarters, and use the phrases half of,fourth of, and quarter of. Describe the whole as two of, or four of the shares. Understand for these examples that decomposing into more equal shares creates smaller shares.Our district wide math program does include some instruction around fractions in the geometry unit,  However, it relies heavily on teaching the symbolic notation of fractions. (writing 1/2, 1/4 etc)  From my own experience, and from what I have read about this Common Core standard, introducing fraction notation to early can lead to improper whole number reasoning.  Kids need a lot of experience creating equal shares and using the words halves, fourths and quarters before they ever see the symbols.  Because of this, last year I created a lot of my own materials to work on fractions with first and second graders.  We are using these ideas again this year and I wanted to share with you some of the great conversations and discoveries we have been having in first grade this week.  Partitioning SquaresWe started the week out with partitioning squares.  I made a big pile of squares out of scrap paper using the paper slicer.  We spent some time trying to cut a square in half and it is quite amazing how fast first graders pick up on how to do this. I started by telling a story about one of my own children making a sandwich and trying to cut it in half.  I demonstrated the cut he made (which was way off center).  I then told them he said he cut the sandwich in half and many kids were quick to notice that this was not true.  They had a big problem with the pieces not being equal.  We had a great discussion about halves always being the same size.  Then I turned kids lose with scissors and paper squares and had them try cutting the sandwich in half.  This was by far the most popular way to cut the sandwich in half.  Notice we labeled it with the word half and did not introduce the symbols for one half (1/2)We then had a great discussion about other ways to cut a sandwich.  Many kids brought up the idea of cutting it into fourths.  I again turned kids lose with the scissors and paper squares and had them try to make fourths.  We did stop briefly and one student shared how folding the paper before cutting it made him more accurate.  One student's idea about how to make halves and fourthsAnother students' idea about cutting a square into halves and fourthsAnother way to make fourthsWe finished up by creating a quick anchor chart/poster to show the different ways we made half and fourths.  I did this by simply gluing down some of the students' squares onto a piece of card stock. The different ways my students cut a square in half Here are the three different ways my students cut squares into fourths or quartersThese different ideas also inspired some great discussions and review of names of shapes and words like equal and congruent. Partitioning CirclesThe next day, we again explored halves and quarters this time in the context of circles.  I began the class by having two students come up and show me how to cut a circle in half.  Predictably, we learned a lot about how not to cut a circle in half.  Also when a student misjudges where half is and creates two pieces that are not equal, it gives the opportunity for a great discussion to come up.The funniest thing happened when one of the students cut the circle into two pieces that were not the same size.  One of the young ladies in the class said, \"my sister always cuts our pizza like this and says that she gets the bigger half.\"  The student who sits next to her jumped in with, \"if one piece is bigger than it can't be half so I guess your sister doesn't know about fractions.\"Wow.  Do you know how many adults I have heard say the bigger half or the smaller half.  I hope this sunk in with the other kids in the class but I am not sure we are there yet.  I then sent kids out to create halves and fourths on their circles.  I made sure I had plenty of paper circles cut out because there were a lot of students who needed more than one try to make halves or fourths. Most kids partitioned their circles into halves and fourths like this.  I was hoping someone would try another idea and after some encouragement to try another way, a student came up with this.A students attempt at creating fourths This caused a small uproar at the table when I asked if they thought it was fourths or not fourths.  We ended up calling over the rest of the class, all gathered around the table and tried to prove to the other kids if they created fourths or not.  The class was split about 50-50 on this matter and there were some great attempts at trying to convince kids.  Finally a student was able to prove that the pieces were not equal by stacking two of them together and showing that one was larger than the other.The picture is not very clear but this is how a student finally convinced the others that this circle was not partitioned into fourths.  We finished by adding our ideas to our fourths and halves poster we made when we partitioned squares. Partitioning RectanglesWe finished our work with paper shapes by partitioning rectangles.  The process worked very similar to the previous days but this time we got even more creative ideas and had some really good discussions about what is partitioned into fourths and what is not. Here are the ways my students found to cut rectangles in halfHere are some of the ways kids created (or tried to create) fourths.  Imagine what kind of discussions you could have about these ideas. Playing Fourths and Not FourthsThe following day we played this game:Want to play this with your students?  It is available for FREE in my TPT store This gave students the opportunity to review and practice what they had learned over the past three days.  We played it as a scoot game and the kids loved it!I followed this up with some formative assessment to see who needs more help and who is ready to move forward.  This formative assessment is from my fraction unitWe will be moving onto other activities from my fraction unit next week.  Looking for some great activities to help your first and second graders with fractions?  Check out my full unit plan.  On sale now!TweetAt some point last summer as I was perusing Pinterest, I saw a pin that showed some sight word matching activity a teacher did using plastic spoons.  I thought it was a creative way to practice a routine skill but then forgot about it until recently. Last weekend, I was stuck at a long and dull party and was trying to entertain several pre-school and Kindergarten aged children.  They had plastic spoons and this picture I saw on Pinterest came screaming back to me. I created a little subitizing activity for these kids where they were matching dots with a corresponding numeral.  They had a great time, practiced an important skill and were entertained.As I jumped back into the work week on Monday, I discovered I had a box of white spoons in my classroom and a huge box of clear spoons at home.  I used this spoon skill idea in Kindergarten, Second grade and Sixth grade this week. Subitzing and Reading NumbersThe dot spoons.  I went with predictable dot dice patterns on these because the kids were quite young and did not have a lot of school experienceThe number spoons.  To challenge kids who are ready, present them out of order and have them order them first or as part of the game.  The clear dot spoons get laid on top of the white number spoonsAddition Fact Doubles with First and Second gradersDoubles facts on the clear spoons and the answers on the white ones.  One more way to practice or check in with how well kids are doing with this skill.  Writing Decimals as PercentsWith the sixth graders, I created several sets to check in on their understanding of writing decimals as percents.  I purposely picked numbers that were very similar or easily confused.  I want to make sure kids have this skill straight because our unit assessment is coming up.  Storing the SpoonsWhen I am done with the spoons, I stack them on top of each other and rubber band them together.  Then I put them in a cup on my bookshelf.  Notice my white spoons are not the same size as the clear ones.  I would certainly make sure the spoons were the same size if I was purchasing spoons specifically for this purpose.  This was great fun for the week and kids liked having something that seemed new and exciting to use.  I am sure the newness would not last forever and it isn't something I am going to be doing all the time, but it was a creative way to add a twist to our routine.  It is one more thing in my toolbox that I can try to motivate kids or make learning seem new and exciting.  What is the strangest thing you have used in your classroom to practice routine skills?"},
{"title": "A Visual Model for Percents", "date": "Tuesday, February 11, 2014", "text": "TweetOver the last few weeks, I have been working on percents with my sixth graders.  With the move to the Common Core, some slight tweaks have taken place in what parts of percent I have to teach. I have been focusing on this standardCCSS.Math.Content.6.RP.A.3c Find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100 (e.g., 30% of a quantity means 30/100 times the quantity); solve problems involving finding the whole, given a part and the percentThe prerequisite skill for this is to be able to fluently move between writing numbers as fractions, decimals and percents.  My students did quite well with this and after some initial instruction and modeling with magnetic base 10 pieces (The magnetic part makes this a new favorite!), decimal squares and fraction/decimal tiles they showed good levels of proficiency based on a quick formative assessment I gave. We finished up this skill with a QR code scavenger hunt that had students rewriting numbers as fractions, decimals and percents.When we moved onto finding the percent of a number, I felt like kids were doing so well.  A week later when we started working on problems where they are given a part and a percent and had to find the whole, we stumbled into a few roadblocks.  It is amazing how similar these problems can sound.For example:What is 60% of 300?  VS 300 is 60% of what numberAfter a LOT of discussion and MANY examples, I felt like my students had this.  I gave another formative assessment and I had a few kids who showed me that they really didn't get it.I was able to pull them out for a 40 minutes booster group on Friday and tried to figure out where I went wrong.  While I am trying to explain the big ideas and model them again with various models that we had used in class I discovered a new model that I could use for percents. I turned away from the group for a moment to grab my water bottle and inspiration struck when I saw my 100 bead strings hanging on the wall.  Turns out, they make a great model for percents whether you are given the part or the whole.  Check this out!First we worked on the connection between 10 percent of a number and 1 percent of a numberI expect my students to be fluent in finding 10 percent because of course they are fluent with dividing by 10.  This bead string shows another representation of why finding 10 percent of a number is just like dividing by 10. Here we are illustrating that once you know 10%, dividing by 10 will give you 1%Here the students are asked to find 30% of 700.  They use what they know about 10% and can see how that relates to 30%We could see this would help us visualize the percent of a number but what about finding the whole when given a percent?I presented them with this problem  They took 20 beads and said that is worth 30.  They know this part and need to find out the whole.One student suggested that since we knew 20% was 30, 10% would be 15.  Then we needed to multiply 15 by 10 to get the whole.  Another student suggested we need to multiply 30 by 5 because we know 20 beads (percent) is worth 30 and there are 5 groups of 20 in 100.  Both these ways helped the other kids in the group think more flexible about percent problems.  Of course, I do not want my sixth graders staying at this concrete stage forever but I think this model will help them keep the ideas of finding percent of a number and finding the whole given a part straight.  I also like how it is a model they can go back to in their heads even long after the bead string is gone.  I plan on spending another day with them connecting their ideas to the bead string and gradually trying to transition them from using the concrete model to a mental model.What models do you use with students when you work on percent problems?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

{"title": "Great Math App: King of Math ", "date": "Saturday, February 8, 2014", "text": "TweetI recently found a great new app! King of MathI downloaded it immediately and in the following days set some kids who had their other work done to exploring it for me.  They LOVED IT!  I have been using it with kids in grades 3-8 who are fast finishers.  I can also see myself using it down the road for kids who need more practice and/or intervention.  It is a great app to challenge a third or fourth grader and is really good practice for grades 5 and up.  There are some things that will challenge a fifth or sixth grader, but because there are so many levels and options, the kids love it. The first three levels are available as a free app and the full version is now $1.99Let's take a look at some screen shotsStarts off VERY easy.  Students earn stars for getting answers correct.  The faster they go the more stars they get.  There are 10 questions at each level.  If they get more than 2 wrong, they fail the level and have to start again.  I love how it balances speed and accuracy.  Subtraction section also starts off easy.  See how I could use parts and pieces of this app with younger children or those in need of intervention?  It is also a great way to work on fluency.This is from the Mixed section.  A very different type of questions that gets kids thinking.See how the subtraction section has gotten more difficult?Geometry concepts:)Finding the percent of a number. I pulled this out the other day in a sixth grade class where they had been working on this skill.  A few kids needed some extra practice and this is how they got it!  I selected the level and activity for them rather than letting them select whatever they want. For kids ready for a challenge, I let them self select what they are working on.  If they choose something very easy for them, they are done it very quickly and then are forced to move onto something more at their level.  It has been a great way to keep my challenge kids engaged and moving forward instead of sitting around with nothing to do or being given more worksheets.  The powers section is great for seventh and eighth graders!  A third grader might not get to this level or if they do select it will probably get 2 wrong very quickly and get put out of the level.  This is what the sign in screen looks like!  You start off as a male or female farmer and work your way up to queen or king!  The kids love the pictures of the characters as they move up in stars.  What apps do you use to challenge students?  Ready to try King of Math?  Check it out on itunes!"},

We reinforce a lot of these geometry videos with our Movin' It Math cards.  One deck of cards to prep and 7 games to use them in. 3-D Shapes I knowThis is very similar to the 2-D shapes I know song.  It is very repetitive with a good beat and kids seem to be able to sing along with it after one playing.  It is also the one I am most likely to hear kids singing after math class is over.  It gets stuck in your head!  If you are looking for 3-D shape posters for your classroom wall or to use in sorting activities, check these out. The Shapes SongThis one is great when you are trying to bring the energy level in your room back down.  I have used it as a clean-up song as we are picking up from our geometry explorations when we have a lot of manipulatives out.  The Shapes Song Rock Song About ShapesThis one is a great review of basic 2-D shapes and also touches on other polygons such as octagon and pentagon.  The Greedy TriangleThis one is not a song but rather a reading of one of my favorite geometry picture books.  The Greedy Triangle is a book all primary teachers should own.  This video works well when you have a very large class which would make it hard for all the kids to see the pictures.3-D shapes balletThis one was shared with me by a student who had tried to find the 3-D shapes rap from above at home.  It is set to ballet music (which the boys in my first grade love!) and shows geoblocks turning into people and dancing.  The kids love to do ballet dancing (or what they think is ballet dancing) while yelling out the names of the shapes as they appear.  I am still hunting for more good shape videos!  Please leave any recommendations in the comments below!Here are a few more great books for teaching geometry to young students!More videos for teaching shapes can be found here!"},
{"title": "Getting Families Involved in Math Education Part 6", "date": "Thursday, February 6, 2014", "text": "TweetClip art by Whimsy ClipsIf you are new to this series, we are taking a look at this book:Getting Your Math Message Out to ParentsToday we are going to look at getting families involved through family math nights.Here is what the book says about family math night- I love this quote from the beginning of the chapter: \"Holding a family math night does more than just pass along knowledge about math content.  It helps create a mathematical community that includes parents, children and educators; it offers the potential for everyone involved to learn that doing math can be fun\"- The book shares ideas about having a family math night aimed at one or two grades.  It includes several parts   - Openers: These are simple math activities for families to do while waiting for everyone to arrive   - Bring the group together for introductions and to introduce and activity.   - Families complete activity and the group comes back together to discuss.     - Repeat introducing, doing and debriefing with a different activity.   - Send home materials and instructions to play the games or complete the activities again at home.- They also highly recommend these two books which have activities all set to go.  Using these books and the ideas presented in this chapter, you could have a successful math night with very little planning time on your part.Family MathThis book is packed with activities you could use during a family math nightFamily Math for Young ChildrenThis is a great book full of activities to do at a family math night with preK-grade 1 studentsFamily math night in my school    So family math night in my school is a BIG DEAL.  We started 9 or so years ago and have invested a lot of time and energy into making it a huge success.  The good news is that family math night really pays off for us.  We have been doing it for a long time and we do it school wide.  Our attendance is always outstanding.  Last year we had 85% of students and families attend math night.  Because it is school wide, we structure things differently.  Our activities and themes have changed a bit over the years but here are the basic things that are always included in our night1) Candy estimation jars.  This is a student favorite every year.  We fill 8-10 small plastic jars with different types of candy, number the jars and set them up alongside estimation slips.  Kids write their name and estimation for each jar.  About 10 minutes before the end of math night, we frantically pull out all the estimates and find who was closest.  Of course we count the jars ahead of time so we are prepared.  We also are sure to sample all the candy to assure its freshness while counting it.  The person who guessed the closest to the actual number gets to take the jar of candy home that night2) Math centers: The K-5 classrooms in my school all do math centers or stations as part of their regular math program.  Before math night, we have each grade vote on 2 of their favorite stations that they are currently using or have just used.  We set up half of the gym with cafeteria tables and each grade has two stations out.  This way the kids can bring their parents over and show them two of the games they have been doing in math class.  We leave paper copies of the directions out for parents but kids really do know how to do these stations already.  Also, kids like to revisit a favorite from the previous year or try out a station from the grade ahead of them.Our sixth graders do less with math stations but I make sure they have a game that they have recently played in class that is out that night.  This year, my sixth grade students will also have a QR code scavenger hunt to complete with their parents.  I am also considering offering an easier QR code scavenger hunt at family math night because this has been a lot of fun for kids this year.  3) Math manipulative table.  Down by the math stations table, we reserve one table for some of our fun math manipulatives.  Many parents are familiar with pattern blocks and things of that nature but we love to put out our polydrons which many parents have never seen or used and last year we added a set of polydron sphera  to the table.  It is amazing to see parents and kids engaged in geometric explorations together and the language development that happens as a result of this is always amazing.  Other manipulatives we have put out on this table include math links, geoblocks, fraction towers, wrap ups, and base 10 pieces.  Of course we don't do all of these every year but it makes me thing that you could do an entire math night around math manipulatives.  4) We have math night in the winter time.  We have always done this and I think it helps with our attendance but I can not be sure because I have nothing to compare it to.  Families seem to be less busy in the winter time in my area and are looking for ways to get out of the house when weather is bad.  Of course, planning it for winter means that we always pick a snow date and advertise that along with other details.  Having a snow date has saved us more than once!5) The half of the gym not being used for math stations is used for other math activities around the theme.  For example, when our theme was candy math we had stations and activities around Hershey bar fractions, rolling skittles, measuring with Twizzlers and weighing candy tins.  I make up quick directions and/or a worksheet that goes along with the station and try to make it appropriate for as many grades as possible.   The candy tin weighing for example was good for grades K-6 while the Hershey bar fraction activity was best for grades 3-6 and the rolling skittles was best for K-3.  I put the grade range it is best suited for on the program and post it at the table.  Occasionally, I will have a family or kid who really wants to try something that is not best suited for their grade level and it usually works out fine.  When kids have a parent sitting one on one with them it is amazing some of the concepts they can grasp.  6) I make a program that says thanks for coming and lists the choices for activities for the night.  This let's parents know what is available and helps them in planning their evening. 7) We schedule one hour and wrap it up at the end by giving away the estimation jars and thanking everyone for coming.  This is the only time we pull the whole group together. 8) We have a sign in table right inside the gym.  As people arrive, we have them sign in and there is always someone there to greet them.  I like this because it makes them feel welcome, they get a chance to look at the program and have a chance to ask questions.  We also use the sign in for door prizes on years where we have had more budget or grant money and have been able to provide door prizes.9)  I advertise well in advance by putting the date and snow date on the school calendar, in the school newsletter, making announcements at school wide meeting and taking time during the school day to talk with kids about what will be happening at family math night.  I also recruit some older students to help me make posters to hang around the school.   I also usually try to put a bulletin board together by the front entrance about 2 weeks before hand to advertise the dates, door prizes and other relevant information.  I also like to keep the bulletin board up for the week after and post a bunch of pictures of math night up.  10)  The night of math night, I like to make it feel like fun so I do a bit of decorating with Christmas lights and balloons.  It only takes a few minutes and I focus most of my attention on the entrance of the gym.  It seems to add to the festivities.Have you had a math night at your school?  What tips and tricks can you share with others?  Please respond in the comments below.Want to check

{"title": "Completing a QR Code Scavenger Hunt With Limited Access to Digital Devices", "date": "Wednesday, February 5, 2014", "text": "TweetIf you have ever checked out my blog, you know how much I love QR code scavenger hunts.  This year I have used them for decimal operations, fraction operations, whole number multiplication and double digit addition just to name a few. (Update: the entire collection is now available to browse here!)Because I am in and out of many different classrooms and work with a wide range of grades, access to digital devices varies greatly from room to room and grade to grade.  I wanted to share with you today how I used a QR code scavenger hunt in a third grade classroom where the kids have access to only two digital devices with a QR code reader (tablets, iPads, iPods, smartphones etc).We set the scavenger hunt up around the classroom, demonstrated how to use it and made it into a math station where kids could go during station time or after completing other work.  Here are a few pictures and a few things we learned about setting it up this way.Our first lesson was to have everything you need in one spot.  Using my folder organization system, all I needed to do was put this folder in a math station tub and we were set.  Everything needed is inside.  This class had been working with fluency with double digit subtraction so we did this scavenger hunt.A peek at the inside of the folder before hanging up the QR code cardsWe knew we wanted the cards up around the perimeter of the room so that they would be out of the way and could stay up for a week or longer to give everyone a chance to do the scavenger hunt.  We found that these two cards were placed to close together and some kids were scanning one by accident when they meant to scan the other.  This might have fixed itself over time as this group of kids got more familiar with QR codes but we needed to fix it right away so...We re-hung some of the cards so they were staggered in distance and height.  This seemed to eliminate the problem of  scanning one when you meant to scan another.  We had some bulletin board space that worked great as well as the ledge of a few book shelves.  We also used magnets to attach some of the cards to the large heater.  This was a great way to make use of a very un-used space.  Because students in this class will be completing this scavenger hunt at different times, we allowed them access to the answer key.  This is for use in checking work at the END of the hunt only.  The answer key is copied on a bright piece of card stock so it would be difficult for students to use it to cheat.  Also the way the scavenger hunt is set up, it pretty much checks itself.  If you get the wrong answer, chances are you won't be able to find the next card and will have to fix your mistake right away. How do you make do with the technology you have in your classroom?  Please respond in the comments below!  Want to read more about using QR code scavenger hunts in your classroom?  Check out this post!

Other options are explored.- BE ORGANIZED and SPECIFIC about what the volunteers should be doing and what the expectations are.Here is a great quote that really sums up the chapter\" Perhaps most important to the success of a volunteer program, the teacher has to put thought into what the volunteers will be doing and find a way to communicate those plans and expectations.\"Clip art by IllumismartHow I use classroom volunteers to get families involved- I like to start early.  This means I do a lot of recruiting for parent volunteers at Kindergarten information night and open house.  The kindergarten teacher I work with is very open to having volunteers in the classroom and her attitude goes a long way towards making parents feel welcome and useful.- I like to have a training night for parent volunteers.  I open this up to families with young children as a chance to get to know more about our math program, how many works in our school and how they can help their child with homework.  It also gives me another chance to meet with parents of young kids and put the idea of volunteering out again.  From this night we usually get some volunteers.- Weekly commitments used to be the norm where the same parents would come in every Wednesday for example and stay for an hour.  This is less and less likely to happen now and I think it is time for our school to explore other options.  - I would like to set up a shorter commitment period to get more parents back into the classrooms, especially in the older grades.  It might look like; Grade ___ is doing geometry stations every Friday in March.  Would you like to run a station or do you have a geometry activity to share?  Then a checklist of the dates so parents could sign up to volunteer one or more times that month.This is a place where I am looking for new ideas.  If you have a post or an idea about getting parents involved as classroom volunteers, please respond in the comments below!Want to check out all 6 parts, here they are!Part 1: Newsletters Part 2: Open HousePart 3: Parent Teacher ConferencesPart 4: HomeworkPart 5: Classroom VolunteersPart 6: Family Math Night! TweetI was working with a class of second graders the other day when I realized that one of them was not making the same connections and showing the same understandings as the other students were.  We were writing equations that totaled 300 and this little girl was really struggling.  I discovered most of her struggles were due to not understanding place value, so as the other students got started on their math stations for the day, I pulled her aside for a quick but effective lesson on place value.I really think this helped her connect all the pieces!Here is what we did.  I grabbed a small white board, marker and some base 10 pieces and a numbers to 1000 deck and started by showing her this.I put out 36 base ten pieces and asked her to write the number.  She wrote 36.  We then talked about what the 3 meant and what the 6 meant.  I then helped her write the number in expanded form.  We did the same thing with a few other numbers including 200.  What does that 2 mean?  Why do we need to write two zeros?We then went back to 36 and talked about counting by 100 starting at 36 as being the same thing as adding 100 over and over again.  We wrote the numbers we got as we did this on the board.First we were adding 100 (counting forward by 100) than subtracting 100 (counting backward by 100).  We discussed patterns we noticed and what was changing in the number each time.  To finish up, we did a quick activity using a white board and the numbers to 1000 deck.  She flipped the card, recorded the number and then wrote it in expanded notation.  Quick, easy and effective!  Looking for other ways to use these cards?  Check out this post!I will be using formative assessment to check in with her understanding this week!  I am hoping this mini-lesson helped catch up her understanding about place value!"},

{"title": "Estimating and Counting Routines Part 7", "date": "Sunday, February 2, 2014", "text": "TweetNew to my posts on estimating and counting routines?  Check them out.  They are quick and no prep lessons that get at a variety of important number skills and are easily differentiated to meet a variety of needs. Part 1Part 2Part 3Part 4Part 4.1Part 5Part 6This lesson took place with a group of four first graders.  These are students who need a little more practice grouping into tens and ones and who I wanted to expose to numbers over 100.  I also wanted to review reading and writing three digit numbers with these kids. Our material of choice this time was plastic bingo chipsI started by placing the bag of bingo chips in the center of the table and asking kids to decide if there were more than 100 or less than 100 chips in the bag.  They all agreed there were more than 100.  I asked them to make an estimate on about how many were in the bag. Despite them all saying there were more than 100, their initial estimates were just under 100 or just over 100. Then I dumped the bag onto the table, spread the chips out a bit and showed them what 10 bingo chips looks like.  From there, they were allowed to make an adjusted estimate. Once the bingo chips have been spilled on the table, most of the estimates increase quite a bit.  I then ask the kids if there is enough for us to each take 20.  They agree.  Then one girl says that she thinks there is enough for us to each take 30.  The other kids agree and we decide to each take 30.  Right away someone says they are going to arrange them into 10 frames so they can tell how many are there without having to recount.  The other kids jump on board with this and fairly quickly we each have 30 bingo chips in front of us. I take this opportunity to have the students figure out how many bingo chips we have pulled out by counting by 10's.  First graders should be able to fluently count forward and backwards by tens up to 120.  This obviously took us a bit out of that range but good practice anyways.  I also had several different kids start to see if we would always get 150.  I also had them count backwards by tens from 150 as well. Then students had one last opportunity to adjust their estimates.  One student mentioned that she thought we had taken half of the bingo chips and there were half left.  We had a great discussion about what this meant and how it would help us estimate.Final estimatesThen the students decided we could each take 10 moreNow we each have 40.  I had one student write 40 on the board and we discussed why we write four zero to mean 40.  Then one student decided we should each take 20 more. This worked out very well and we only had 8 left over. One final time we counted by 10's to see how many we had.  This time we started at 60 because we already knew one person had 60. When we figured out we had 308, I gave each kid a marker and had them go to the board and write the number 308.  As you could predict with first graders, I got several responses.One students' attempt to write 308Another students' attempt to write 308.We rearranged the bingo chips a bit so that we had groups of 100.  Then we made the connection between the symbols for the number and the pieces being arranged in groups of 100, 10's and ones. We also had a great discussion about how we had 30 groups of 10 on the table and even when we arranged the 30 groups of 10 into 3 groups of 100, we could still see the tens.

With that being said, we do have school and district policies surrounding homework and it is pretty clear that students should not be getting more than 10 minutes per night per grade level.  (Third grade gets 30 minutes max, etc) So here are my golden homework rules if it has to be given.1. My Number 1 rule for homework is that I never EVER send home something that we are working on developing a conceptual understanding of in class.  For example, in second grade we spend a great deal of time developing conceptual understanding of double digit addition and subtraction.  I never send home double digit addition and subtraction practice with second graders for homework.  If a kid asks their parents for help, they will most likely be taught the traditional algorithm which is not something I wan my second graders exposed to.  Instead I give homework such as addition and subtraction facts or geometry games we have been playing in class.  The same thing applies in subsequent grades as kids first start learning multiplication and division.  As soon as I send it home, I invite the algorithm into my classroom so I wait until I am ready for that to happen. 2.  I believe all homework in elementary school should be due weekly and consistently.  A teacher should have a routine that homework folders go home Friday (or any consistent day) and are due back a week later. 3. I love the idea of math games and centers that students have already done in school going home for extra practice, reinforcement and to show parents the type of thinking their kid is doing in the classroom.  I know there are kids who do not have families who will do this type of homework for them and so I try to pull in an older student or classroom volunteer that each student who does not have home support gets to show the game to.  It is really great if this can be a consistent person.  4.  If homework is important enough for you to assign and require, there should be a natural consequence of not getting it done.  If our goal with homework is to teach students to take responsibility for their own learning, we need to make sure their actions have consequences. 5.  I love the idea of a homework diary for kids of all ages.  This works very well in a planner format once kids are in grade 3 or 4 but including a homework diary in folders of younger students can be a great way to open lines of communication with families.   How does homework help get families involved in your classroom?  Please respond in the comments below.

{"title": "Someone took the 11 card!  A Teachable Place Value Moment", "date": "Tuesday, January 28, 2014", "text": "TweetSomething amazing happened today.  I was about to start a whole group lesson in first grade when a student shouted out \"someone took the 11 card.\"  Now a student in first grade shouting something out when they are not supposed to is not the amazing part.  The amazing part is that we are a few days into a unit on geometry and I was planning to use my whole group instruction time to look at attributes of shapes and do some 2-dimensional shape sorting.  Quite often with first graders I will have a first grader who speaks when it is not their turn and usually I go on with things, but this time was very different.This students' interruption caused me to change my plans for the first ten minutes of class.  Completely changed. Here is what the student was talking aboutThese are arrow cards.  I use them to help kids learn to read and write numbers (and much more!) If you have not seen these used in the classroom, check out my guest post at Kid's Math Teacher.  Anyways, I noticed last week when I did some formative assessment that 5 students in this first grade classroom were having a hard time seeing the teen numbers as ten and some more.  The student who shouted out that the 11 card was missing was one of these kids.  I decided right then and there to seize the opportunity and see where it would go.  I am so glad I did!I jumped right on the comment and asked her how she knew the 11 card was missing.  She replied \"because I don't see it.\"Not exactly what I meant so I tried again.  \"Where does the 11 card belong up here?\"After a 10 second pause she says \"It goes right after the 10.\"By now most of the rest of the class has their hands up and are wiggling in their seats.  She can tell that they know something she doesn't.I ask other students if they have seen me show the number 11 on the arrow cards and they all agree that I have.  I then ask students to give a hint about what might have happened to the 11 card.  A very nice young lad tells her so kindly, \"you need to use 2 of the other cards to make the 11 card.\"She thought about that for a bit and then I could see the light-bulb moment of her getting it.  With great enthusiasm, she rushes up to the board, grabs the 10 and 1 cards, put the arrows on top of each other and proudly exclaims that she found the 11.  I then wanted to push it a bit farther for her and the other students who showed difficulty with the teen number last week.\"I notice that the 17 is also missing.  What do you think happened to it?\"Without hesitation, she grabbed the 10 and 7 and made 17.  She said \"10 plus 7 equals 17\"I asked her to sit down and quizzed a few more selected students on what happened to the other teen numbers.  They did amazing.  I will follow up with more formative assessment later this week, but I think they all got it now!  Apparently today, the kids knew better than I did what they needed to learn next. Have you ever had a lesson go completely off track but really help your students' understanding?TweetIf you are new to this series, we are taking a look at this book:Getting Your Math Message Out to ParentsToday we will look at the authors suggestions for parent conferences and I will tell you about how I use parent conferences to get families involved in my school.Litton, the author starts by giving some great advice on scheduling and preparing for conferences.  She then gives these suggestions and many others to ensure a successful conference.    - Start on a positive note- Ask parents to tell you what is going well and what their concerns are- Show specific examples of student work that illustrate what you are saying.  - Go over assessment results including individual interviews- Plan ahead for conferences by regularly collecting student workThe chapter ends with a WONDERFUL appendix that shows many examples of student work that would be useful to share and gives ideas about comments you could make that illustrate current understanding and what their next steps are.Clip art by IllumismartParent Conferences in my own school      As the math specialist I get invited to attend the difficult conferences.  If a student is behind or in some cases very ahead of their peers, I will often be asked to join the conference.  Classroom teachers also invite me when they know parents have specific concerns or when it is a student I have a lot of contact with.  Sometimes I am asked to sit in on a conference because the parents are very difficult or have expressed opinions about their students math learning that do not show understanding of how or why we are teaching math as we do.  Depending on the reason for the conference and what the concerns are, I have many approaches but here are a few things I always do in conference situations.- I like to start on a positive note by sharing a recent piece of student work that illustrates something they can do well or something that shows how far they have come.  Because I do so much formative assessment, I have a lot of student work samples available to choose from and can always find something positive.- I then like to have parents share how they think their child is doing and any concerns they have.- I am all about data driven decision making so then I will share any assessments.  For primary students this often includes individual interviews, especially if a student is behind.  I go over the current assessment results and show their progress over time if applicable. - I show other student work and point out specifically how the work illustrates them progressing or not progressing toward meeting the standard.  I also like to explain what the next steps are in terms of what we are working on next.- I prepare myself to answer the hard questions.  Why are you teaching it this way instead of that way?  These big questions parents have when they are new to my school or my way of thinking about math used to really challenge me.  As I have become more experienced and read more research on math education  I have been better prepared to answer these questions.  I like to show parents that it isn't MY way of teaching that I am going for but rather what the research says works.  - I focus on the big mathematical ideas for that grade.  For each grade level I can think of 3-5 things that are the most important things kids have and understand in order for them to be successful in the next grade.  If a student is behind, I focus the conference on the most important skills and make sure my discussion focuses on how to move a student forward with these big ideas.I sometimes have parents at conferences who want to be able to understand the math their kids are doing but need to brush up on their own skills or have a reference to use as their students' math gets more challenging.  I have several copies of these books that I lend to parent and also many parents who have purchased their own copies.Grades 3-4Grade 5Grades 6-8How do you get your math message out to parents during conferences?Want to check out all 6 parts, here they are!Part 1: Newsletters Part 2: Open HousePart 3: Parent Teacher ConferencesPart 4: HomeworkPart 5: Classroom VolunteersPart 6: Family Math Night!"},
{"title": "Monday Math Literature Volume 28", "date": "Monday, January 27, 2014", "text": "TweetIf you missed last week's post about a great book to challenge early finishers, you can check it out here!Recently, I have found that Amy Axelrod who is the author of one of my favorite books for teaching time, Pigs on a Blanket: Fun With Math and Time has an entire series of Pigs will be Pigs books that are great stories that also deal with math content.  I have been on an ordering frenzy since this summer and have started using these books with students.  Here are a few of my new favoritesPigs at Odds : Fun with Math and GamesIn this story the pig family heads of to the carnival for some fun on rides and playing games.  It is a great light way to introduce concepts about fair games, luck, chances of winning,  and odds.  The last page of the book goes into a definition of probability and talks about what makes a game fair.  There are some follow up questions based on the story that are a great way to see what students' current levels of understanding around probability are.  The book also shows the pigs spending money so I have also used this story with students who are working on money.  It is fun to keep track of the money they have spent so far.  I have used this book in grades 2-4.Pigs on the Move : Fun with Math and TravelIn this story, the Pig family is traveling for Christmas and misses their flight.  Being a mellow pig family, they hop a plane that is scheduled for several detours.  They finally make it to their destination after traveling for quite a few hours.  Mr. Pig's watch doesn't seem to match that of the Taxi driver's when they arrive at their destination.  This story has been a great follow up to the one I reviewed a few weeks ago about time zones.  Because the students I used this book with had already been introduced to the idea of time zones, they really understood what was going on with the clocks not matching Mr. Pig's watch.  This book is also great because it is a good way to look at reading and writing numbers in the thousands and even adding numbers of this size if your students are ready.  There is also an element of proportional reasoning and some rate problems you could get into with the relationship between speed, time and distance.  There are many levels of math concepts in this story and I have used in in grades 2-6. Have you used any of the pigs will be pigs books in your classroom?  Head to volume 29 to see a few more of my favorites!"},
{"title": "Teaching Math with You Tube Videos: Counting", "date": "Saturday, January 25, 2014", "text": "TweetClip art by Whimsy ClipsOne of my newest tools this year when teaching math is You Tube videos.  I have always been a big fan of Intelli-tunes, Fun with Math and Music and other math music CD's.  They have some great songs that kids are really engaged with.  Although I still LOVE these CD's and use them often, I have added some You Tube videos to my repertoire this year. I work in many different classrooms in a given day and now most of them are equipped with a SMART board or at least a computer with a projector.  Even when I work with a small group, I have an iPad that I can pull these videos up on.  Now that they are so accessible and easy for all students to see, they have found a place in my teaching practice. They also provide a nice movement break for kids.  I often have kids get up and dance/sing along.  My students love making up dance moves or doing jumping jacks while they sing.  It gets them moving around for 3-5 minutes while still practicing math.I also like to use them as a transition from one thing to another.  If I need 2 minutes to put out materials or get things ready to go for the next part of the lesson, it provides a quick way to keep the kids engaged and learning while I take care of housekeeping tasks. Here are a few of my favorite counting videos. Let's Get Fit Count to 100A great way to practice counting by ones, this video incorporates counting and movement.  The movement changes every 10 number and is a great way to add some activity into your math time or transitions. This one is by Jack Hartmann who offers a huge variety of educational music. Counting Super Hero This is another counting to 100 by 1's video with a fun superhero theme.  My students like to make up their own dances to this one.  This one is is by Pete from Harry Kindergarten Music which has excellent videos and songs to use in your classroom on a variety of topics.I Can Count to 100A favorite of my students' for it's catchy tune this is one that will stick in your head!Counting By 2's SongA fun monkey themed way to practice an important skill.  For other ideas about working on counting by 2's a to grab a few count by 2 freebies, check out this post.  Count by 5'sClimbing Up This Mountain (Counting By 10's to 100)Another great video from Harry Kindergarten!  I love the way this video shows the count by 10 numbers along with a base 10 representation.  Counting With a Leprechaun A favorite in March or any time of the year, this catchy song is a great way to practice counting by 1's, 2's, 5's and 10's. Do you have a favorite You Tube video to help kids with counting?  Please share the link in the comments below!Count to 120With the Common Core putting the responsiblty of numbers to 120 on first graders, it is great to have a song that goes up to 120! You might also be interested in checking out these great counting books!Looking for other You Tube videos,  here are my favorite songs and videos about shapes, time,  multiplication, coins and area and perimeter."},
{"title": "Getting Families Involved in Math Education Part 2", "date": "Friday, January 24, 2014", "text": "TweetIn this post, we will be taking a look at getting families involved at back to school night or open house.We will look at some big ideas from chapter 2 of this book and then I will give my take on how we apply these ideas and other things we do at open house to get families involved in math education. Getting Your Math Message Out to ParentsIn this book, the author acknowledges how challenging it can be to speak to parents and get a year's worth of ideas into one night but offers a few easy to do tips that can get you started.1. Choose manipulatives.  Having manipulatives out for parents to see how they are used to develop big math ideas makes them feel much more comfortable with their use.  2. Choose student work: Think about including work samples from a previous class that illustrate some of the big ideas students will be learning that year and some of the strategies and approaches they may have to the problem. 3. Prepare the environment.  There are many ideas in this section to help make parents feel more comfortable such as making sure there are enough seats and materials.  4. Think about what you want to say.  What are the big ideas you want to get across about how and why you teach math? Clip art by IllumismartHere is what happens in my school on open house night     Our families have about half an hour to walk around classrooms, check out student work and have their students show them around.  The second half hour each classroom teacher prepares a presentation about the year's curriculum and expectations for homework etc. For part one of open house when parents and kids are mingling and looking around each classroom has around 2 math stations or games out that kids show their parents.  These are things from their current rotation of math stations that they already know how to play.  We usually try to make sure they are math games because the students really love playing against their parents.  We also might put out manipulatives for free explore, especially if that manipulative is new to that grade level.  These games are set up in each classroom. Second graders demonstrate a math station to their parents.  This game is about finding pairs that make 100 using place value decks.  In the hall by the main entrance, I like to set up a math information table.  Year to year it varies on what I present at the table.  If we have a new math program for a particular band of grades, I might have more information and sample materials from that program so that parents who have questions or what to know more can access this information.  Other years I have set up handouts about helping kids learn math at home or given demonstrations on alternative ways to solve problems besides using an algorithm.  I have also had copies and supplies for easy to make games that work on skills such as multiplication facts that parents are always asking me for new ways to work on these ideas with their kids.  As the math teacher this makes my presence known at open house, gives me a chance to interact with parents and makes me available for questions, comments and concerns.  During the second part of open house when teachers make their presentations to parents, they try to highlight the big ideas of math learning that will happen that year and explain that students will be learning and creating strategies to solve problems that parents will not be familiar with.  Our math program has some very parent friendly handouts on what to expect in each grade level as well as a parent support website.  This information is available for parents to take home on paper.  If there is a new teacher or new program, I might present with them but most of the current teachers are quite comfortable with this part.Also during the second part if at all possible, we like to have student work samples available (usually from a previous year with student names removed) so parents can see what types of math thinking their kids will be engaged in.  I do have to say that this can be tricky to get to on this night and if we don't get to it we try again during other parent interactions throughout the year.Student work samples are great to display during back to school nightI like to find my way back to the front door as families are leaving, especially now that I know most families and they know what my role is.  This gives them one more opportunity to connect with me.  When I was first starting out, it was one more chance for people to figure out who I was.  How do you get families involved in their students' math education at open house?Want to check out all 6 parts, here they are!Part 1: Newsletters Part 2: Open HousePart 3: Parent Teacher ConferencesPart 4: HomeworkPart 5: Classroom VolunteersPart 6: Family Math Night!"},

I will be writing a series of posts that answer these questions and more.  I am hoping to give you the big picture of how I have changed the school and community climate around math over the past 9 years.  I will share some of my favorite resources with you that helped me get started and describe how things work in my school now.  Please remember that it has taken me a long time to get parents this far and if your school has a long way to go it is fine to start small. Here is a book that I read when I first started teaching math all dayGetting Your Math Message Out to Parents: A K-6 ResourceOver a series of blog posts, I will be sharing ideas from some of these chapters and telling you how I took what was in this book and applied it to my own school situation.  If you are looking to make a change with how math is addressed with the parents in your school community, this is the book I would start with.  It is fairly comprehensive, the ideas are easy to apply and there are tons of examples.  Today we are going to look at Chapter 1: NewslettersNancy Litton, the author of this book identifies three reasons you might want to send a newsletter.1. Explain what you are doing in math class.  This tells what is happening, what is being studied, what games or activities are being used and what homework will look like. 2. Explain why you are doing it.  This goes into more detail about the pedagogy behind the math.  It explains why kids are learning math different from the way their parents did.  If you teach multi-digit addition for example it might go into detail on other strategies their kids might be using and why they have not learned the traditional algorithm.    3. Describe how math activities happen in your classroom. This recreates for parents some of the  activities and discussions had during math class and highlights the type of thinking you expect your learners to engage in. This chapter also has many examples that illustrate these points as well as several more examples in the chapter appendix.  Clip art by IllumismartHow we use newsletters to get families involved in my school community- School wide newsletter: We have a weekly school-wide newsletter that goes out via paper copies and email attachments to all families in the school community.  This is the ideal place to feature small pieces about using math at home or in the real world.  When things are running smoothly, it is great if this can be a weekly feature.  This is a great place to keep math in family life featured.  In the past we have done ideas about how to practice math while cooking, shopping, vacationing, etc.  We try to pick topics that have a broad enough appeal or ideas that can be applied to younger and older students.  - Grade level unit letters.  Our math curriculum includes pre-written newsletters to families that are intended to be sent out before each unit at each grade level.  With grade levels having between 7 and 9 units, these are something that go out just about monthly.  Many math programs have these now and if you can not find them in your curriculum materials, you may want to check the publisher's website as these may have been added or revised as more people purchased the program.  In the past, I have had teachers use parts and pieces of these letters along with their own words but as we have continued to use the program and they have made revisions, the pre-published notes to families have gotten quite good.  They explain both the what and the why of what kids are learning and even offer glances into the daily classroom routines which are all things highlighted by the Litton book.  These have made the newsletter part of getting families involved very easy for classroom teachers.  Some other books you might be interested in looking at as you think about getting families involved in math education:Family Math II: Achieving Success in MathematicsFamily Math for Young ChildrenWant to check out all 6 parts, here they are!Part 1: Newsletters Part 2: Open HousePart 3: Parent Teacher ConferencesPart 4: HomeworkPart 5: Classroom VolunteersPart 6: Family Math Night!"},

{"title": "Writing Fractions and Decimals as Percents ", "date": "Thursday, January 16, 2014", "text": "TweetIn sixth grade, we have been working hard on rate and proportion problems and have recently moved onto percent.  With the Common Core in place I find that I get to do a lot more proportional reasoning with sixth graders than I have in the past.  One part of proportional reasoning that I have always loved teaching is working with percent problems. We most recently have been working on converting between different forms of numbers.  My students have done a great job developing their conceptual understanding and moving between forms.  We are now working on fluency with these skills.  Instead of another worksheet, I created a QR code scavenger hunt. The students were very engaged and were able to practice an important skill.  They have put in several requests for other QR code scavenger hunts.  I even had kids who wanted to take the cards home to show their families how QR codes work.  This classroom has several digital devices that can use QR code readers and we also allow students to bring in their own devices.  This gives us enough devices that the entire class can do the scavenger hunt at the same time if kids work in pairs. A student uses a digital device to complete the scavenger huntI really liked looking at the record sheets when kids were done.  It helped me to see who was doing these problems fluently in their heads and who still needed to do intermediate steps. A look at a student who needed to do some conversion work on paper and even some sketchingA student who was able to do most of the problems in his head.Students will complete this at the beginning of class tomorrow.  It will give me one more look at which kids I need to target during instruction time.  I love formative assessment!Want to try this with your own students?  On sale now in my TPT store!TweetNew to my posts on estimating and counting routines?  Check them out.  They are quick and no prep lessons that get at a variety of important number skills and are easily differentiated to meet a variety of needs. Part 1Part 2Part 3Part 4Part 4.1Part 5I completed this estimation and counting routine with a mixed group of second and third grade students.  I wanted to work with numbers within 1000 so we used paper clips for our material.  It is something I have plenty of.I started by dumping the paper clips on the table and asking kids to make an estimate .  These initial estimates are usually way off.  At this point they have no point of reference and don't have experience estimating with paper clips.  Sometimes I will show them what 10 or 100 looks like first and then I get much better estimates. These are their initial estimates. I asked if there was enough for us each to take 100 (5 students and myself).  They all agreed that there were.  We briefly discussed efficient ways to count to 100 and how we could be sure we were accurate and then got to work counting.  At this point, this group has had a lot of prior experiences with these types of routines so this counting job was quick and easy for them. This is what the pile looks like after 600 have been taken out.  I now ask kids to go to the board and adjust their estimate if they would like.Adjusted estimates.  The orange marker to the side is what we started on next.  I asked student C why he thought it was 850.  He explained that he thought there were about 250 left in the middle pile plus the 600 we had already taken out.  After he said this, other students started seeing how they could have thought deeper about their own estimates.  We moved up to student MD and used a missing addend equation to figure out how many MD \"thought\" were in the middle.  When the class came up with 400+107 and asked her if she thought there were 507 in the middle, she said \"No!  There are way less than that in there, I guess I should have thought of that before I made my estimate.\"We looked at the other estimates in terms of how much bigger than 600 they were.  Some kids realized they made their estimate to large.I asked kids if there was enough for us to each take 100.  None of the students thought that was possible.  There were several suggestions and the number that got the most discussion was 50.  We each went to take  50 more being careful to keep the 50 in a separate pile.  They quickly realized that we were running out.  Folks had between 20 and 42 when we ran out.  One student suggested we try 30 so that we wouldn't have to put them all back.  We went around the table saying how many we had and how many we needed to make 30 or how many we needed to put back so that we would have 30.  This worked very well and quickly we each had 30 paperclips in addition to our pile of 100 and there was one left in the center of the table.The final count.  Each of the 6 people has a pile of 100 and a pile of 30.  There is one paperclip left in the middle of the table.  I then asked the students to think to themselves about how many we had altogether and give me a signal when they were ready. The five students came up with these 4 different numbers.  We had a great discussion about which one was right and how we could prove it.  The kids made some great connections between counting by 3's and counting by 30's.  When students who had the wrong answer tried explaining how they got it, it brought out a great many misconceptions and helped all the students think more deeply about mental addition and skip counting.  Our final number was 781.  Our time was up for the day.  The following day we brought this number back to the whole group.  I presented them with the context that I really wanted to have 1000 paper clips and needed their help deciding how many more I should order.  Students had a few minutes to think to themselves and then shared their ideas with a partner.  ALL of this was done mentally.  Then they shared different strategies with the whole class.  As they were sharing strategies, I wrote down equations that showed their thinking.  I was truly impressed with the variety of strategies and mental math that was going on.    Here is a peak at some of the ideas.  This makes me feel like my work with problem strings and helping kids develop their own strategies for addition and subtraction is really paying off!These students added up from 781 to 1000.These students subtracted from 1000.  They started by subtracting 700 and then subtracted 80 and then 1. This student used a fact they know about 100-78=22 to help them figure out 1000-780=220.  Then they subtracted 1 more.  This student used skip counting to add 100 more twice then 10 more than 9 more.  They added 219 in all.These students tried adding 300 but got to much so they subtracted the extra 81.  In their words, \"if you add 300 and then take 81 back it is the same as adding 219.\"Have you tried estimating and counting routines in your classroom?  How about problem strings?"},
{"title": "Counting to 120 and bridging the decade", "date": "Wednesday, January 15, 2014", "text": "TweetIf you teach Kindergarten or first grade math, you probably spend a lot of time on counting.  Me too.  Lots and lots of time.  At this point in the year in first grade I want my students to be fluent with their forward counting within 120 starting from any number.  The most challenging part for students is going from one decade to the next.  Here are some easy, low prep routines I use with my students to address this issue and work on a slew of other K and first grade skills.  Much of what I am going to show you took place this week  in a first grade classroom but I do many of these things with Kindergartners as well, just with a smaller set of numbers. Ordering Number Cards and Counting Forward and BackwardsIf I am working specifically on counting through a decade, I will pull out some number cards for kids to put in order that begin on one side of a decade and end on the other.  Here are some first graders who received number cards and had to put themselves in order from least to greatest.  These number cards are large sturdy and were found at the back of a filing cabinet.  They are from some assessment from 1966. There is probably a set like this in the back of a dusty cabinet in every school. Once I have the students up and they get themselves in order, we start from the smallest number and read to the largest to check if the cards are right.  This also gives us a chance to start counting from some number that is not 1 and count through a decade.  Then I might have the kid who is holding 38 start counting and we count to the end.  We also count backwards starting at the highest and going to the lowest. After doing some of this as a whole group, I send the kids to work with partners and then eventually independently. When we do this activity with partners or independently, I like to use base 10 number cards that not only display the number but also have pictures of base 10 pieces as well.  The kids who need the support of the visual image have it and the kids who don't tend to ignore the picture and focus on the number. Here a student has ordered the numbers from 67 to 72.  When they are done I have them read them to me counting forward and then counting backwards. Here a student works with cards from 99 to 107.  I love how I can differentiate this activity to meet all the needs in the classroom.  This is how I get the deck ready for this activity.  I put it in order by decades and then mix and match so each kid gets 6-12 cards in sequential order.  In this case I was making sure they had some below a decade number and some above.  Then I paper clip them together and put them in a baggie and they are ready to go.  I used a yellow deck and an orange deck of these cards.  That way I know what deck each card belongs to and I had 24 sets of cards which is enough for all the students in this class and a few extras.   As kids get more and more fluent with this, I find that if I want to keep doing it as a whole class activity, I need to recruit some helpers.  Kids who are particularly fluent with the full range of cards will sometimes get to help me and check other students ordering as they finish.  They do a great job of saying exactly what I say and makings sure kids are reading these forward and backwards.  I also will use this activity as a quick time filler when students finish before others.  I have also added it to my rotation of math centers. I also use this free app to do a similar activity and further differentiate for my students.I use these cards over and over again in the classroom.  When my students are fluent with this skill, I will remix these decks and use them for other things.Crossing the Decade ConcentrationMost first graders and many Kindergartners are familiar with the game concentration so this is a quick and easy one to get started with.  I pull the cards that are one less than a decade number (59, 79, etc) from a deck of one color and the decade cards from a deck of another color.  I place them in two rectangular arrays and kids get to turn over one from one color and one from the other.  They are trying to \"match\" the cards that are in counting order.  For example 59 goes with 60 and 29 goes with 30.  The set up for crossing the decade concentrationIn this game the students were ready for numbers over 100.  I also play this game using only 6 cards of each color and choose smaller numbers.  I love games that I can differentiate.  For kids who are not yet ready to play concentration, here is a modified version.  Put all the decade cards face up where kids can see them.  Put all the cards that are one less than a decade number in a pile.  Have them flip over a card that is one less than a decade and find the decade number that comes after it.  In this picture I had the students put the decade numbers in order and also practice counting forward and backward by 10's.  Having them in order makes it a bit easier.  When they are ready, mix up the order of the decade numbers.  When they have this down, they are ready to play concentration.  Counting StripsAnother great way to help kids with forward and backward counting is to use counting strips. These are easy to make for any level of counting you need to do.  I print the strips on cardstock, tape them together and have kids pull them through a card and count forward and then when they are ready pull the same strip backward though the card to practice backward counting.  The cards are made out of scraps of cardstock.  I just cut two slits in them about an inch apart.  You could also make them out of index cards.This student practices counting from 18 to 34 and then from 34 to 18.  This student practices counting from 107 to 123 and then from 123 to 107.  Kids usually whisper count aloud when they are doing this at a table group or even if it is a math station.  I love how I can differentiate this activity to any range of numbers my students need.  When they are done with one counting strip, they get another and get right to work.  Want to try these counting strips with your students?  Grab them from Google Drive for FREE!How do you practice counting in the classroom?"},

Extend number line diagrams and coordinate axes familiar from previous grades to represent points on the line and in the plane with negative number coordinates.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.6a Recognize opposite signs of numbers as indicating locations on opposite sides of 0 on the number line; recognize that the opposite of the opposite of a number is the number itself, e.g., –(–3) = 3, and that 0 is its own opposite.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.6b Understand signs of numbers in ordered pairs as indicating locations in quadrants of the coordinate plane; recognize that when two ordered pairs differ only by signs, the locations of the points are related by reflections across one or both axes.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.6c Find and position integers and other rational numbers on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram; find and position pairs of integers and other rational numbers on a coordinate planeIt is interesting to many people that these standards are not found in the geometry section but rather the Number System section.  I think they are placed exactly where they belong.  Most of the coordinate graphing as described in these standards is about understanding and using rational numbers and thinking about signed numbers.  Of course there is a little geometry understanding in there but the big idea is really about the number system.  I also love how more number line work shows up in younger grades in the Common Core.  A coordinate plane is really just 2 number lines that have been put together.  With younger students having more experience placing whole numbers, fractions and decimals on number lines, sixth graders should be coming into this ready to take the next step.  We started by graphing coordinates made up of just integers and then moved onto including fractions and decimals in our coordinates.  After some great work and whole group instruction, I started looking for apps that would provide the extra practice my students needed and would also provide a way for my students to re-visit these ideas throughout the school year.  My search lead me to Graphing Gala which is by Hooda Math.  It is FREE and walks kids through levels similar to the way I taught them.  They start with integer coordinates and progress from there.  It is also FUN.  My kids found it super engaging and loved that they were earning money for collecting the coins off the coordinate grid. Let's take a lookThis is what comes up when you first start.  Notice all the coordinates are integers.  It gives written directions and other clues such as arrows.  As you click on the right \"coin\" it deposits the money in the piggy bank and displays another problem.  If you click on the wrong coin, it gives you a hint about X coming before Y and turns the axis blue and red to correspond to the coordinate point.  Level 2 adds in points on the X and Y axis (pink)Level 3 has some fractional coordinatesLevel 4 has some decimal coordinates Level 5 is a race against time.  You try to collect as many coins as you can in 60 secondsWhen you finish level 5, it takes you to a street of stores where you can purchase items with the coins you earned.  The items are to decorate for your party.Here is where you can \"spend\" the coins you earnedHere are some of the things I purchased for the party!This buying/party stage takes only about 2 minutes and the kids really like it.  Sometimes they don't get there before time is up or we are moving onto something else but it is a relatively quick reward for doing all the work.Want to be the first to hear about my favorite apps?  Like me on Facebook!When and how are you teaching or practicing graphing on the coordinate plane?  Please respond in the comments below."},

The first grade standard looks like this:CCSS.Math.Content.1.OA.A.1 Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.1So first graders should be solving all 12 problem types for addition and subtraction within 20.  When I first looked at this table, I was shocked by how many problem types my first graders were not being exposed to.  By being more aware of the types and writing some problem sets that include all the types, I have assured that my first graders are seeing all these problems and they are getting much better at the problem types that used to be really hard for them.  (I know now that they were hard because they had never heard problems like that!)Since it is winter, we get a bit penguin crazy in first grade so here are some of the problems we are solving:I made these full page color images.  They take a bit of colored ink to print and but are really a great size for whole group instruction in a first grade classroom.  Mine are printed on cardstock and slipped into a sheet protector.  They were printed over a year ago and used in multiple classrooms twice now and still look brand new.  This problem is available as a FREEBIE in my TPT Store.  Check it out!Notice I wrote the problem type on the sun for each problem.  This really helps the teachers that use them become more familiar with the different problem types.  It also lets teachers see what types of problems their students struggle with.  This allows them to make sure more problems of that type get asked in the classroom.  This problem is available as a FREEBIE.  Check it out!My students had a very difficult time with problems like this when they first started.  Ready to see how your students do?  Check out the full set here!  You will get all 12 problem types. Compare problems can be tricky for young kids.  This is a great one to act out using students as penguins.  It really helps them see where the groups are the same and where there is more.  This type of problem can always use more practice!For the next 2 weeks, the full set of penguin problems will be on sale!  Get it today!How are your students doing with the 12 different problem types for addition and subtraction?  Please respond in the comments below!"},
{"title": "Working Toward Conceptual Understanding of Double Digit Subtraction ", "date": "Thursday, January 9, 2014", "text": "TweetI have a large class of third graders that I am working with this year and many of the students are missing some second grade skills that are essential for them to have in order for them to learn what they need to master in grade 3. Recently we have been working on this Common Core StandardCCSS.Math.Content.3.NBT.A.2 Fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction. We started with what I thought would be a review of double digit subtraction before branching into larger numbers.  I quickly found out that half the class had no concept or no strategy of subtracting two double digit numbers.  The lessons for the next few days had to take a major detour.  Second grade students should be FLUENT with adding and subtracting within 100 by the end of the year and should have some strategies for numbers within 1000.  These kids missed something! Here are the second grade standards I am talking about.CCSS.Math.Content.2.NBT.B.5 Fluently add and subtract within 100 using strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction.CCSS.Math.Content.2.NBT.B.7 Add and subtract within 1000, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method. Understand that in adding or subtracting three-digit numbers, one adds or subtracts hundreds and hundreds, tens and tens, ones and ones; and sometimes it is necessary to compose or decompose tens or hundreds.I had to do a major backtrack and brought out some of my favorite routines, games and activities that I ordinarily do in second grade, often do in intervention groups and now had to do with almost an entire third grade class.  Let's take a look.Whole group instruction, discussion and sharing of strategiesI am a big fan of problem strings.  I start with a problem I know all of my students can access and build from there.  We do this quite a bit and my students are VERY familiar with the procedure.  The basic idea is that I show a problem and kids give me a ready signal when they know the answer.  When most, if not all kids are showing the ready signal, I do one of three things1) Pick several kids to give me an answer.  Then I might ask if anyone else has a different answer.  I tend to do this when the problem is one I think will challenge students or one I think might bring out misconceptions.2) I might pick a kid to give me the answer and tell me how they knew they were right.  I tend to default to this option when I think the question is easy and most kids can quickly and efficiently get it correct.  3) Often I have kids turn and talk with a neighbor about what the answer is and how they know they are right.  It is amazing how many conversations I can listen to at the same time.  This gives me an idea of what kind of strategies are out there and which strategies I want shared.  I often will choose a pair to share and have one student tell me what the other kid's answer was and how they figured it out.  When I first started doing this, kids could often not tell me what their partner said.  Think-Pair-Share is a formative assessment strategy that I love but it works best when kids are held responsible for what their partner says.  This really makes them listen and try to understand.  Here is a look at some problem strings I did with this group over the past week. This was a concept a LOT of these kids were struggling with.  This is actually just one problem and the equations below show the strategy that different kids did.  Previous to sharing of ideas such as this, most of these kids were defaulting to counting backwards and which is fairly inefficient.  They often were off by one and they really needed a strategy that did not rely on counting!Here is a problem string that started out with something I knew everyone could be successful with.  After a few subtracting from 10 problems, I jumped to bigger numbers.  With this string, kids were able to see how subtracting 3 from 10 is similar to subtracting 3 from any count by ten number.  This skill will help them with their new strategies they came up with in the previous picture.    Another pre-requisite skill for double digit subtraction is the ability to subtract a multiple of ten from a two digit number.  Here I lead them though some problems of this type.  I often go back to subtracting 10 before jumping to other multiples of 10.  This allows even the lowest student an access point.  Games, Games and More GamesWhen kids are learning something new, bringing a game to it makes it more fun for everyone.  I will do these games sitting around a table with an intervention group or if using them for whole group instruction, I will show them under a document camera and then have folks play them with a table group.  I can assess so much understanding while watching these games.  The cards I used for all of these games are from the Numbers to 120 Place Value DeckThe first game I played with this group is easy and QUICK.  I want to make sure they are fluent with their combinations of 10, especially as they relate to subtraction.  I call the game 10 take away and the goal is to subtract each card from 10.  I pull out the cards under 10 and go through them a few times.  Kids love seeing if they can get faster with each pass through the deck.   See how this game relates to the problem strings and supports those concepts?Here we are playing take away 10 (or 20 or 30 or 40 or whatever number I choose).  I start by having them subtract 10 from each card.  I flip cards in the middle of the table and they shout out answers as they know them.  After they sound fluent with subtracting 10 from each card, I might have them subtract 20 from the next set as I continue flipping through the deck.  Sometimes I want to hear from individual kids so I will pass cards around the table and each kid will have to subtract the current number (10, 20, etc) from the card I give them.  This really shows me who needs more work and who has it.Here we are playing subtract 8.  I might change this to 7 or 9 or 6 as well.  Notice that this was a skill that needed a lot of work in the problem strings above.  These place value cards really support their developing strategies because they can see the tens and ones.  For those that don't yet have a mental image, this can mean the difference between having to count backwards and being able to think of a more efficient strategy.  Love these cards?  Me too!  Here are some other ways I use them in the classroom.Reinforcing What We have Discovered and Assessing UnderstandingAfter 2 days of playing these games and doing problem strings, I wanted to see where kids were individually and give them a chance to apply what they had learned.  I made this quick written assignment for them to do independently.  Here is the front.  Notice how the problems are similar to the problem strings we have been working on.  If you want to try this with your students, you can grab this FREEBIE at my TPT store or click here to get it from Google driveHere is the back.  Kids did this independently but were allowed to have help.  As they were working, I was roaming around the room with my trusty marker and correcting problems as kids worked.  This lets me see problems right away and help kids find strategies that work without giving them and opportunity to practice the wrong way.  Notice the last section on page 2 says Exit Ticket.  This is another formative assessment strategy that I use with kids.  Everyone had to do this all alone with no help.  Taking a quick peek at these as the kids were leaving let me know what my instruction needed to focus on the next day. Now these students are ready to move on to subtracting double digit numbers.  Head over to part 2 of this post to see what I did next with these students!I also have developed a fun winter themed QR code scavenger hunt to practice double digit subtraction that I will be using with my students next week! My new QR code scavenger hunt.  My students are going to love this!What skills do you find your students are lacking that keep them from learning what they need to in your grade?  Please respond in the comments below:)"},

{"title": "Multiplication and Division Word Problems and the Common Core", "date": "Tuesday, January 7, 2014", "text": "TweetIf you walk into any third or fourth grade classroom during math time, there is a good chance they are going to be working on multiplication or division.  One of the things I see third and fourth graders struggle with the most is the application of multiplication and division in story problems.  I also think that teaching multiplication and division in the context of story problems makes it comes alive for students.What are the Common Core standards for multiplication and division in grade 3 and 4?  Check them out:CCSS.Math.Content.3.OA.A.3 Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.1CCSS.Math.Content.4.OA.A.2 Multiply or divide to solve word problems involving multiplicative comparison, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem, distinguishing multiplicative comparison from additive comparison.1See that little 1 at the end?  That refers you to a footnote that asks you to check out Table 2 in the glossary.  Many third and fourth grade teachers have not yet had an opportunity to do this.  Especially if you are accessing the standards online, it can be tricky to find.  Here is a look:A look at Table 2 from the Common Core glossary.  It shows the 9 problem types third and fourth graders are responsible for under the Common Core.  Take not that grade 3 needs to master the problem types in the first two rows and grade 4 is responsible for all 9 problem types.   When I first took a look at this table, I noticed that most of the questions in my curriculum, most of the questions I write or ask my students and most of the questions my students write only represent 4 of these problem types.  I immediately printed this table and placed it on a wall in each classroom and area that I work with third and fourth graders in.  I immediately started trying out other problem types on my students.  At first they were challenging.  I had to choose numbers that were friendlier or easier to see the relationship between in order for them to access the problems.  Now that I am more aware of the different problem types, I do a much better job at making sure they are all represented in my curriculum and daily teaching practices. Even though the compare problems (third row) are not assessed until grade 4, I have made sure my third graders get exposure to these types of problems.  Especially by starting out with friendly numbers in the known fact range for these kids, I have helped them access these problems.  I wouldn't want them to come across a new problem type in fourth grade with challenging numbers. If you also teach multi-digit addition and subtraction you may want to read up on the 12 different problem types in addition and subtraction that your students should be familiar with. Because I have been more aware of these different problem types, we have spent quite a bit of time working on them over the past week months in grades 3 and 4 during whole group instruction and partner work time.  I wanted to see what students would be able to do on their own.  I created a set of task cards to use with my students in grades 3 and 4. I spread the cards out around the perimeter of the gym.  Each kid got a clipboard, pencil and record sheet.  Then they went around from card to card solving problems and recording answers on their record sheet.  It was great to see how engaged they were and I was quite impressed with the work they did.Check out these great action shots:A student works on card 17.  Notice the * by the card number?   I put a small * on each card that had a compare problem on it.  This helped me remember which cards third graders are assessed on versus which ones they are being exposed to.  When I did this with my grade 3 kids, I had a few kids who struggle a bit that had a more challenging time with these cards.  Several students were told to do the ones with out * and then I met with a small group near the end to do the ones with * together.  Contemplating a story problem I loved seeing how some students represented the \"division\" questions with division equations and others chose to set it up as a missing factor problem.  This is something I spent a few minutes talking about in the wrap-up discussion.  I put up several papers that had different equations but equivalent answers and we had a great discussion about the relationship between multiplication and divisionAs students finished, I had them have a \"math talk\" with another student who was also finished.  This consists of them comparing answers and going out to find any cards they disagree on.  If they can't come to an agreement they ask an adult for help.  It works great! As kids finish their math talk, I like to have some blank task cards for the early finishers to write their own problems on.  This gives me another measure of their level of understanding and gives other kids who are finished a chance to solve some more problems.  The early finishers often like to make a problem that is slightly more challenging than others and it is a great way for the speedy kids to challenge each other.  It also gives kids who need more time the opportunity to finish the problem set without being disrupted by their speedy peers.  Want to give this a try with your students? You can grab all 20 cards for one low price or grab a sample set of 4 for free!  Which problem types do your students see the most of?  Is there a problem type (or a few problem types) that your students need more practice with?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

{"title": "A Quick, Easy way to Build Multiplication Fact Strategies", "date": "Sunday, January 5, 2014", "text": "TweetAs second grade ends and third grade begins, I want students to start seeing multiplication.  One way I do this is is by using a subitizing routine similar to one I use with younger students.  This time, I use different cards that feature equal groups.  Take a peak.This one features six groups of five.  I made it using a bingo dauber and a half sheet of card stock.  I flash the card at students for a few seconds and ask them to show me when they know how many dots they saw.  I then have students share either with a partner or with the whole class (or both!) how many they saw and how they know they are right.  As we get more and more practice with these types of cards, I decrease the amount of time I show the card for.    For the card shown above here are some strategies I might hear.Student 1: I counted by 5'sStudent 2: There are three groups of 5 on the top which I knew was 15 and three groups of 5 on the bottom which is another 15 and 15 +15 = 30.   When a student shares a strategy like this one orally, I might record these types of equations on the board.           6 x 5 = 3 x 5 + 3 x 5 = 15 + 15 = 30   This strategy uses the distributive property!Student 3: Two groups of 5 is 10 and I saw 3 tens which is 30.This time the dots are arranged in an array.  The equal groups become columns or rows.  When I first start using array cards with students, I give them a few extra seconds to look at them.  As they have more exposure, I decrease this amount of time.  This card was made using colored dot stickers.   Here are some strategies I might hear about the above card.Student 1: I knew it was 15 because I saw three rows of 5.  I counted by 5's, 5, 10, 15.Student 2: I saw 5 groups of 3 and I counted by 3's.Student 3: I saw 5+5+5=15I have stacks of these cards in second and third grade classrooms and for use with intervention groups.  There are so many things that can be done with them.  They are quick, easy and inexpensive to make and after students have some exposure to them, they love making their own!Are your students ready for division? Here is an example of how I would use one of these cards to get at division facts.  Kids would have repeated exposure to these cards by the time I did this.This card was made using round mini-stickers.  It was made by a student!  The different colored stickers really help kids see the groups when the cards might not be perfect.  Mini-stickers make is so you can have more groups and/or more dots in each group.  If I am ready to build a foundation for division, I might hold this card in my hand facing me and tell the kids that I see 48 dots.  I will tell them that there are 6 equal groups and ask them to think about how many are in each group.  Or I will tell them there are 8 in each group and ask them how many groups are on the card.  Of course, I would pick an easier card when I am first starting this, but kids pick up on this very quickly.  Because they have already had repeated exposure to these cards and the ideas of equal groups they have mental images they can draw on when I ask this type of question.Ready to work on factors?Toward the middle of grade 3 when I am ready to introduce the idea of factors of a number, I might hold the card above and ask kids to predict what is on it.  I will tell them I have 48 dots and ask them how they might be arranged.  They will start brainstorming ideas like 2 groups of 24, 6 groups of 8, 4 groups of 12, etc.  I record these on the board using multiplication notation and it becomes a natural way to introduce the idea of factors.  When kids need more workI currently have a group of third grade students who are part of an intervention group who need continued work with the ideas and concepts that these cards present.  I want them to have more exposure but at the same time, many of the cards are becoming to easy for the entire class.  Recently I came up with an idea to give these kids a way to practice this independently or with a partner.  It is working REALLY well.A small group of students looks at some models of different cards that have been used with the whole group.  They are using these models and what they have experienced with these cards to create their own deck on index cardsI met with this group one afternoon and after doing some of the cards from the half sheets of cardstock, I invited them to make their own deck of these types of cards.  I gave them index cards,1 inch binder rings, and markers.  They looked at some of the models to get them started and created a pile of cards for their own use.  When time was up, I used my super 3-hole punch to punch a hole in the corner of their entire deck.  They placed the 1 inch binder ring through the hole and were ready to go. Here is a student's card showing 4 groups of 7A student makes some array models on her cardI reviewed their decks after-school and added a few cards of my own making to each deck.  Now these students all keep their decks in their math browse box (similar to the box many primary students have for reading full of just right books).  When they have a chance during their regular math class, during transition times, or when their intervention group meets, they can pull them out and practice a similar routine that we have done repeatedly in the classroom by themselves or with a partner.  It has been about 3 weeks now and their fluency with multiplication and concepts about multiplication facts have improved dramatically."},

Let me show you some of my creationsI used about a quarter sheet of blue construction paper and attached several snowman with a glue stick.  I have been working with some kindergartners on subitizing small quantities.  At this point in the year, I want them to see something like this and know it is 4.  I put more snowmen on some of the cards because I am also working towards getting K kids to estimate if a quantity is more or less than 10.  I flash the card and ask them if they saw more than 10 or less than 10.  Then I ask them about how many they saw.  Another example of a card I used with the K kids.  This time there are more than 10 on the card.  I used full sheets of construction paper to make some estimating cards for my first graders.  On this one, I might flash it and ask if there are more than 10.  When (if) they say yes, I might ask them if there are more than 20.  Once we have established a benchmark area, I will ask them about how many they think are on the card.  Then we can count and see how close we got!Another full sheet I used with first graders.  This time with more snowmen.  When first graders first see this many they love to guess 100.  I also used cards of this size with second graders this week who still need more work on making reasonable estimates.  My second graders have started looking at equal groups and laying the foundation for multiplication.  I created some snowmen subitizing cards for them featuring equal groups and arrays.  I also used some of these with several third grade intervention students that still need more intensive work with multiplication facts.  A look at a card featuring an array.  These are great to use to move kids towards laying the foundation for multiplication and getting a handle on basic multiplication facts.  I have use array and equal group picture cards all the time in the classroom and am working on a post in more detail so stay tuned!"},
{"title": "A Great FREE App: Find Sums", "date": "Friday, January 3, 2014", "text": "TweetIn the past I have written about some of my favorite apps including math slide, line 'em up, the number rack, ten frame fill and the subitize tree.  Today I want to show you another FREE and favorite app that I have been using with the iPad in grades K-3.Find SumsWhen I first found this app, I really liked it and was using it a great deal with my first graders at the beginning of this school year.  It shows a ten frame and you click on numbers that make pairs of 10.  A SUPER important skill for kids to be fluent with in K and 1.  It gives kids tons of practice with combinations of 10 and a visual image to support them.  At the beginning of the year, I thought this was the only thing the app did and I still loved it.  About two months ago, I was talking about combinations of 100 with a colleague and she suggested I use this app for some third graders who were struggling with this idea.  The most basic setting for Find Sums.  Students practice combinations of 10  with a visual image of a ten frame to support their developing understanding.I had no idea what she was talking about until she showed me the settings menu on this app.  It opened up an entire menu of possibilities that I didn't know existed.  All you do is touch the i in the upper right hand corner and you get thisA look at the settings menu.  At the bottom you can see that you can chose from apples or part whole.  If you choose apples you will get a visual image that is vital when students are just starting to work on a skill.  When they are getting close to fluency, chose part whole and no visual image will be shown.  Instead it shows a part-part-whole diagram.  (see pictures below for more detail).  Also you can change the sum target to any number between 5 and 20 as well as 100.  See how this game can be useful for K-3?  Let's take a look at some of the different settingsThis is sum total of 20 with apples.  The student has clicked on 13 and now needs to find what number goes with 13 to make 20.  See how this is a natural extension for someone who is fluent with combinations of 10?  I work on combinations to 20 a great deal during the end of grade 1 and the beginning of grade 2.This is sum total of 20 with a part-whole model.  See how they have to think about what goes with 8 to make 20?  There is no visual image, but at this point when I have kids working on this level, they would have enough experience with the visual models for this type of questions that they would most likely have a mental model they could pull from if necessary.  If this is to challenging, it is easy to switch them back to the apple setting.  This is sum total of 100 with an apple model.  This student has clicked on  75 and 25  which is a very important combination of 100.  When they are ready to move to the next problem, they just click on any number.  This is a skill I spend a lot of time working on in grade 2 and the beginning of grade 3 for kids who still need more practice.  Check out this blog post for more ideas on working on combinations to 100!Now I have changed the setting to sum total of 100 with a part-whole model.  I love that kids can feel like they are all playing the same game but that I can so easily differentiate it for each individual need.  It also has worked quite well for partners to play this game sharing one iPad.The best part about this app is that it is a fairly fast game yet still gets at important ideas and provides the right amount of support.  It is a great time filler between transitions or as kids finish other work with only a few minutes remaining in a class period.  I only have access to a few iPads so I also use some of these free computer games on the classroom computers and the smart board to work on similar skills.  How do you use technology to work on combinations of 5, 10, 20 or 100?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

The reindeer counters from this game have a picture of a reindeer on one side and are blank on the other so we used them like 2 sided counters.Students put 5 reindeer counters into a paper cup, gave it a shake and dumped it out.  They sorted into reindeer up and reindeer hiding.  They then wrote an equation to show how many reindeer they could see and how many were hiding. A student writes an equation to match how her counters landed.  We just made our own record sheets on white boards.  I already had the reindeer counters prepared from another game so this game required no prep work.  My favorite kind!At this point the student noticed that 1 + 4 = 4 + 1.  Gotta love when a simple game brings out the big ideas of mathematics.  This game would also work for combinations of 10 and 20.  Want to try it with your students.  Head over here and print out the reindeer counters.  FREE!"},

{"title": "Counting and Ordering Numbers under 1000", "date": "Friday, December 13, 2013", "text": "TweetA skill I notice many of my second graders (and some of my third graders!) struggling with is counting forward and backward and ordering numbers within 1000.  I want to share with you a quick and easy to manage activity I do with kids in the second half of second grade or anytime after that if they still need work on the concept. Here are the Common Core Standards addressed by this activityCCSS.Math.Content.2.NBT.A.2 Count within 1000; skip-count by 5s, 10s, and 100s.CCSS.Math.Content.2.NBT.A.3 Read and write numbers to 1000 using base-ten numerals, number names, and expanded form.CCSS.Math.Content.2.NBT.A.4 Compare two three-digit numbers based on meanings of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits, using >, =, and < symbols to record the results of comparisons.The hardest part with the counting and writing of numerals is when kids have to pull through a century.  I do this same activity with other numbers under 1000 but today will be showing you how I really focus work on pulling through the century. I pulled 4 kids out who were having a difficult time to do this activity.  The cards we made as a result of the activity will be used with the whole class.  All you need is a box of 2'' x 3'' flashcards or some cardstock or index cards cut to be around 2 inches. After some counting as a warm-up focusing on pulling through a century, I assign each kid a set of cards I want them to make and give them a starting number and an ending number.Here are the 4 kids I worked with today and the numbers I wanted  them to record on their cards.  This lets them practice writing some of the trickier numbers like 808 and 401.   They put the cards in counting order from least to greatest.  When they have all the cards made, I have them read them from least to greatest (counting forward within 1000) and then from greatest to least (counting backward within 1000). I have them write them in pencil and once they get approval that they are all correct, they go over the pencil with a marker. This student counts from 594 to 603.This student works on their card set.As kids finish, I have them read their neighbors cards and check with folks to see if they are correct.  Once these cards are made and we have agreed that they are correct, they mix them up and paper clip them together.  They are now ready to be used by other kids as a quick warm up, exit ticket or math station.  I love quick, focused activities that give you a lot of learning with little prep or directions needed."},

TweetI spend so much time in grade 2 working with kids on thinking strategies for double digit addition. First, I make sure they are comfortable adding and subtracting 10 from any 2 digit number we do many problem strings and spend time sharing strategies and ideas.  By the end of grade 2, I expect that kids will fluently be able any two double digit numbers in their heads.  I NEVER introduce the standard algorithm for addition of 2 digit numbers because it makes kids stop thinking about the math and just do it and because I really don't believe anyone should need the traditional algorithm to add two double digit numbers.  Everyone should develop the skill of doing it in their head.Why is it so important that kids are fluent with this by the end of grade 2?Multiplication.In grade 3 we get into strategies for multiplication facts and MANY of these strategies only work if students can quickly and easily add double digit numbers. Example 1: 4x9= ?The student decides to double the 9 to get 18.  They then have to do 18+18.  If this is easy and effortless and does not require paper it helps kids learn multiplication facts much quicker.  If they have to write 18+18 down and do the traditional algorithm or if they do not have an efficient and reliable method to figure out the answer, they are stuck.  They don't learn their multiplication facts as quickly as their peers and that will hurt them for years to come. Example 2: 6x8=?The student sees six groups of 8.  They know 2 groups of 8 is 16.  16+16 will give them 4 groups of 8.  32+16 will give them six groups of 8.  They just had to do 2 double digit addition problems.  See why fluency with this is important?So how do I get them there?  Here are a few quick, easy and low to no prep ways I have kids practice this skill at the end of grade 2.  I do these after a lot of whole group instruction around strategies for adding two double digit number.  I also pull these out just as we are about to head into our multiplication fact unit in grade 3 and add them to math stations to make sure ALL KIDS are fluent with this.  If I have to, I do a small group intervention with third graders to get them solid on this skill.  Since I started assuring kids could fluently add double digit numbers before introducing multiplication facts, kids have learned their multiplication facts faster and with less frustration. Flip and AddThis is one of the first ways I have kids practice independently or with a partner.  They just flip 2 cards from my place value to 120 deck.  The visual image of the  base 10 pieces supports kids who still need it.  I sometimes have them flip and add alone and sometimes with a partner.  I also sometimes have them make a simple record sheet like the one shown below.  I also use these cards as exit tickets.  I pass out 2 to each kid and they can line up when they know the answer.  I stand by the line and each kid tells me the answer as they line up.  Rolling Dice20 Sided Dice (level 1)I have a huge bucket of 20 sided dice and I like to use them for a quick, easy and no prep addition fluency game.  Students simply roll 2 dice and add the numbers.  They can do this alone or with partners. This student is adding 12 and 6.  See how having this skill will help support them when they learn 3X6?These students rolled 17 + 19.  They have to think about regrouping.  These kids ended up doing 17 + 20 = 37 and then subtracted 1 since they were only supposed to add 19.  37 - 1 = 36.  The Infamous 7 dice (level 2) Earlier this week, I posted about how I use the same set of  7 dice in classrooms from grades K-6.  I like to get 2 of these dice out once kids are fluent with adding the 20 sided dice and do the same thing.  The numbers are mostly in the 20's and many require thinking about regrouping. I often don't use record sheets for these games but occasionally do, especially if I have a large class or am unsure about how accurate they are.  With this roll, kids can just add the 10's and add the 1's.  Straightforward but important to make sure kids have fluency at this level.This pair brings up a lot of good ideas about thinking strategies and what parts to add first.  Bringing out the big dice (level 3)Once kids have shown me fluency using the last set of dice, I like to give them even larger double digit numbers to work with.  These will include some where the sum is over 100.  I have a set that I made out of card stock that I like to use to introduce this part to the whole group because they are REALLY BIG.  I also make my own double digit number cubes with higher numbers using blank dice. I made an origami cubes following these directions.  I have also made these cubes with students.  I find some second graders are successful but third grade and up is the best choice if you are making these with students. Students love rolling and adding with these big dice and it gives them the extra practice they need to achieve fluency.  What do you do to make sure your kids are fluent with double digit addition?  Please respond in the comments below!"},
{"title": "A Quick Review of Common Core Fraction Second Grade Concepts", "date": "Tuesday, December 10, 2013", "text": "TweetEarlier this week, I posted about how I pulled out a small group of kids from a third grade classroom to do a quick mini lesson on odd and even.  I got another chance this week to pull a different small group from the same classroom that is getting ready to do their fraction unit and has a small group of kids struggling with basic fraction concepts. Here is a quick review we did to remind them of the big ideas around fractions.  The cards I used for this are from my Fourths or Not Fourths game I use with first and second graders.  It is a freebie and available in this post if you want to try it out with your students. Here is the common core standard for fractions in grade 2.  These were the concepts I wanted to review and reinforce with my studentsCCSS.Math.Content.2.G.A.3 Partition circles and rectangles into two, three, or four equal shares, describe the shares using the words halves, thirds, half of, a third of, etc., and describe the whole as two halves, three thirds, four fourths. Recognize that equal shares of identical wholes need not have  the same shape.There were 4 kids in this booster group and we all sat around a table. I told them I wanted to talk with them about fourths and gave them each a card.  I asked them to think about if their card showed fourths or not and how they knew they were right.As we went around the table, each kid placed their card in the fourths or the not fourths areas and explained to the group why they thought it went there.  Through this, I got at the big ideas of equal pieces and fourths meaning four pieces.  After each kid had placed their cards, I gave them another one and we continued around the circle in this fashion.I saved the ones I consider the most challenging for last.  I wanted to make sure the big ideas were out there first before I brought up the idea that the equal sized pieces do not have to be the same shape. I saved this card for last.  I showed it to the entire group and had them give me a ready signal when they thought they knew where it belonged.  I had them turn and talk with a partner and then we shared with the entire group.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how well kids did with this card! A student explains to the group how he knows the pieces are equalWe had a few minutes left so we read one of my favorite fraction books to wrap up our review session.  I hope this will help these kids be successful during their fraction unit!"},

{"title": "A set of 7 Dice to Promote Additive Reasoning in Kids of ALL Ages", "date": "Saturday, December 7, 2013", "text": "TweetI have written before about how I use dice to promote fluency with additive reasoning in students of all ages.  Today I want to tell you about a set of 7 dice that I started using a few years ago and have totally fell in love with.  The only place I have found that sells these dice is NASCO.  They are $3.50 a set and worth every penny.  I purchased 12 sets two years ago and ALREADY have gotten my money's worth out of them.  I literally have used them in every single grade K-6 and even in several workshops with adults.  If you want a set, they are available here. (If you are a dice addict like I am and you type dice into the search engine at NASCO you will be in heaven.  They really have an amazing collection.)So how do I use these dice in so many grades?  Here are some pictures :)They come in these little baggies which are the perfect thing to store them in.  I put all of my little baggies into a standard pencil box when they are not in use.  The little baggies make passing out and picking up the dice very simple. With K and first grade students I might have them get one of the dice with numbers under 10 and roll it and then build that number on a ten frame.  I also might have them get 2 of the smaller dice and roll and add or roll and subtract.  As my first and second graders work at building addition fact strategies I like to pull the 3 smallest dice from this bag for them to roll and add.  I find it helps them with things like making 10, counting on and doubles.  As first grade comes to a close and second grade begins, much of my focus moves towards getting students to think about 2 digit addition.  I want my second graders to fluently add any two double digit numbers without using pencil and paper by the end of the year.  I use these dice to help give my kids the extra practice they need using their invented strategies and work on their fluency with addition.  I also might add in a smaller die to the larger ones and see what interesting combinations we can come up with.  In the roll featured in this picture, many kids would combine the 14 and 6 to make 20 and then add the two twenties.  My favorite way to use this set of 7 dice is to have students roll and add all of them.  NO PENCIL/PAPER!  If students have had experiences with inventing strategies, are fluent at making 10 and are given time to explore these ideas, I find that I can use the entire set as early as the last third of second grade.  I often start by rolling a set of dice under the document camera and seeing who can find some friendly numbers.  After we have practice some as a class, I set kids up with a partner and their own bag of dice and let them go for it.  Notice in the picture above how the dice have been grouped to make adding easier.  Here is another look at a roll.  Notice how friendly making tens, twenties, etc makes the adding.  I often find other teachers who are used to only using a traditional algorithm have a more difficult time with this than students do.  I know I was uncomfortable with this when I first started.  If you are going to use these dice with your students, spend some time with them yourself first.  Another rollHow would you use these dice in your classroom?"},

It is called Math Slide.  It is free for a limited number of game and 1.99 for unlimited play.  It can be played by 1-4 players and has 10 different games.Game 1     In game 1 they show place value pieces, money pieces or a number line and students have to figure out what number it represents.  If they have that number, they touch it with their finger and slide it into the middle.  Many times more than 1 kid will have the number and the first person who gets the correct number into the middle has their number disappear and they are one step closer to winning. A look at math slide being played by 4 playersMoney pieces from game 1 of Math Slide 1000A number line with a missing number, part of math slide game 1Game 2 Game 2 is very different from game 1.  The rules are the same but the context completely changes.  Now students are presented with a number written in expanded notation and have to slide in the number that is equivalent but written in standard notation.  Take a look:Math Slide 1000 game 2Another look at Math Slide 1000 game 2There are 8 additional games for your students to play that work on skills like writing numbers in different forms, finding 10 more and 10 less and 100 more and 100 less.  I have used this game in grades 2-4 with great success.If you have a tablet and teach in grades 2-4, you might want to check it out.  If you download the free version, you get unlimited rounds of game 1 and 2 rounds of games 2-9.  My favorite part is that 4 kids can play at once and they stay super engaged the entire time! One warning:  I did have to make a rule early on that each player gets ONE chance to slide a number in per turn.  Without this rule some kids were just sliding in random numbers as fast as they could without doing any thinking.  If they break this rule, they don't get to play!If you teach other grades, there are other versions of Math Slide you might want to try out!"},
{"title": "Estimating and Counting Routines Part 5", "date": "Thursday, December 5, 2013", "text": "TweetIf you are new to my estimating and counting posts, click here to start at the beginning.  I have explored many ways that I use estimating and counting routines in classrooms grades K-5 to improve a wide variety of math skills. Today I want to share with you an estimating and counting activity that I did with a group of 5 first graders.The manipulative of choice today was gemstones.  These are always a big hit with kids!  I bought a multi-colored pack of them years ago and have slowly been adding to the collection over time.  They are colorful and fun and flat so they don't roll off the table!I started by dumping out the gemstones and pulling 10 to the side.  Based on this, I asked each kid to estimate how many were on the table.  Because we have been practicing reading and writing numbers to 120, I had them each record their estimate on the whiteboard. Their original estimates are written in the column second from left.  Everyone estimated either 90 or 50.  I did have to enforce the no guessing 100 rule with this crew.  It is a rule I often have to pull out with young kids who estimate 100 whenever they see more than 20.  Next I asked the students if there were enough gemstones for each kid to have 10.  They all answered yes and I asked each student to take 10 gemstones. Each kid took 10.  When they were done, I asked them to look around and see if there was a student who I could just look and know there was 10 in their space.  These two students showed different ways to know there was 10.  One student arranged theirs into a 10 frame and the other put theirs into 2 groups of 5.  The other students quickly decided that they too needed to show their gemstones in a way that made it easy to see there were 10. After each kid took 10, we counted by 10's and found out that 50 gemstones had been counted.  I had a student write the number 50 and we discussed what the 5 meant.  This is a great way to connect the idea of 5 tens to concrete objects.  I then let each kid go to the board and adjust their estimates based on the information we had so far.You can see the estimates went up quite a bit.  Some kids needed to ask for help from their peers on how to write a number of this size.  I also noticed that kids were more confident and everyone chose a different number.  I then asked if there were enough left in the center of the table for us to each take 10 more.  The kids all thought there was and went ahead and took 10 more and again arranged them in a way that it was easy to know there were 10. We counted by 10's around the circle and found that we had 100 gemstones counted.  We also double checked our counting by counting by 20's around the circle.  The kids had never been asked to do this before but it went very well.  They quickly realized that they could think about counting by 10's to help them with this.  We also discussed the idea that it did not matter who started the counting or what direction we went around the circle, there would still be 100.  One little girl thought we should count by 5's as well (hers were arranged in more distinct groups of 5) we did that which was another great way to practice an important first grade skill. I then let kids make one last estimate. You can see that our numbers are getting quite large and technically farther than what is required of first graders.  I find the more kids get exposed to numbers over 100 the better they are in that 100-120 range.  If kids can do the numbers between 100 and 120 than they certainly can do the numbers up to 200.  I once more asked if there were enough for everyone to take 10.  They agreed there was and each took 10 more.We again counted by 10's (OVER 100!!!)  Our pile in the center of the table was getting quite small.  I asked kids if there was enough for everyone to take 10 more and they were sure there were not.  I asked for ideas about how many more they could each take.  After some discussion, we came to an agreement that 5 more would work. There were a few left in the center of the table. So we arranged them in a group of 10 as well.  The kids were having a tricky time figuring out how many altogether so we decided to push the groups of 5 into groups of 10. Here is a final shot of what the table looked like when we were finished.  We counted them all by 10's and then had 1 left over.  We wrote our final number and were out of time so we did a quick clean up and will continue working on these ideas as the year goes on. How do you work on counting and estimating in your classroom?"},

I gave each kid their own set and had them sort into odd and even.  When they were finished, their job was to check the sort of another person who was also done.  (not all the sorts use the same numbers.)A finished sortThis quick review of the ideas of odd and even really seems to have helped these students solidify their knowledge.  I followed up by adding some of my favorite odd and even literature books to their book boxes for them to explore during independent reading time this week.  How do you find time and staff in your school to give kids that little extra time or practice they need to be successful?  Please respond in the comments below!"},

{"title": "Double Digit Multiplication QR Code Scavenger Hunt", "date": "Thursday, November 28, 2013", "text": "TweetI have been working on 2 digit multiplication with my fourth graders over the last few weeks.  They have been doing a great job writing and solving story problems and developing strategies.  Their strategies have moved from modeling with base 10 pieces to sketching on base 10 paper and then finally using an open area model to solve these types of problems.  Last week, they were introduced to the idea of partial products and spent a lot of time examining how they connect to the open area model.  This week I wanted to give them one more chance to practice all they had learned before having 5 days off.  I designed a QR code scavenger hunt for them to get some extra practice with double digit multiplication.  I also used this same scavenger hunt with my fifth graders who have recently been introduced to the standard algorithm to help them become more fluent. Here are the Common Core standards for multi-digit multiplication for grades 4 and 5CCSS.Math.Content.4.NBT.B.5 Multiply a whole number of up to four digits by a one-digit whole number, and multiply two two-digit numbers, using strategies based on place value and the properties of operations. Illustrate and explain the calculation by using equations, rectangular arrays, and/or area models.CCSS.Math.Content.5.NBT.B.5 Fluently multiply multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithmTo get started you just need a smartphone or tablet or almost any digital device with a camera. (Update: we love using this app on our Chromebooks) Students begin with the START card, scan the QR code and get the first problem.  They then figure out the answer and go find it on another card.  If they can't find their answer on any of the other cards they know they have an error and need to fix something.A student uses a table to scan a card and solve a double digit multiplication problemThey had a great time working on this and were so engaged and excited.  I love how QR code scavenger hunts make routine practice feel like something fresh and exciting. Here is a peak at a student record sheet.  This is from grade 4 and they are using partial products for some questions and an open area model for others.  One student needs more space for their calculations so they made up their own record sheet!When I make or purchase a new product like a QR code scavenger hunt I like to put it all together in a folder so it is ready to use when I need it!Here is peak inside the folder.  I have the scavenger hunt cards printed on cardstock, cut apart and put in a baggie.  I also copy the answer key onto cardstock and make multiple copies of the record sheet.  Now when I want to use this, it is always ready to go.    Want to try this out?  It is available at my TPT store!Looking for more information on QR code scavenger hunts?  Check out my other posts about using them with my own students.Fraction OperationsDecimal OperationsIf you work with middle school students I also have QR code scavenger hunts for solving 2 step equations and inequalities!  You can check out the entire collection of QR code scavenger hunts here!"},
{"title": "Using Technology to Practice Combinations of 10 ", "date": "Wednesday, November 27, 2013", "text": "TweetAnyone who teaches a primary grade will tell you how important it is for kids to know their combinations of 10.  It leads to much more efficient strategies for addition and subtraction and will help a kid be more fluent with math.  Let's see where combinations of 10 shows up in the Common CoreIt first shows up in Kindergarten!CCSS.Math.Content.K.OA.A.4 For any number from 1 to 9, find the number that makes 10 when added to the given number, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record the answer with a drawing or equation. In first grade it talks about kids using making 10 to help with addition and subtraction within 10CCSS.Math.Content.1.OA.C.6 Add and subtract within 20, demonstrating fluency for addition and subtraction within 10. Use strategies such as counting on; making ten (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14); decomposing a number leading to a ten (e.g., 13 – 4 = 13 – 3 – 1 = 10 – 1 = 9); using the relationship between addition and subtraction (e.g., knowing that 8 + 4 = 12, one knows 12 – 8 = 4); and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding 6 + 7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13).In second grade it is not mentioned by name but the little 2 has a comment on the bottom that says see the first grade standard above for a list of strategies  CCSS.Math.Content.2.OA.B.2 Fluently add and subtract within 20 using mental strategies.2 By end of Grade 2, know from memory all sums of two one-digit numbers.Because of its importance, combinations of 10 is something you will see me working on in grades K-2.  I spend a lot of my intervention time with second graders (and sometimes older students!) who do not have strategies for addition facts working on combinations of 10.  I have written about how I use double flap cards, a simple double sided chip game, and how I use 10 frames to work on this very important skill.  I even wrote about how I extend this idea and work on combinations of 100.  Today I want to share with you a few of my favorite computer games that can be used on any PC or on a smart board that work on this idea of combinations of 10.Math LinesThis is a student favorite and for a very good reason.  It is so much fun!  It also has multiple levels and is a race against time to complete a level before the balls all drop off. Here is as look at level 1.  You shoot the ball in the center at one of the balls on the outside that  pairs with it to make 10. That makes both balls disappear.  The object is to get rid of all the balls before they make it around to the hole and all disappear.  If you do that successfully (and it takes a few times to get there when kids are first starting out) you get to move to level 2!Level 2 gets more challenging in the sense that there are some balls you can not reach.  By the time kids make it to level 2, they are getting fairly fluent with their combinations of 10 and the game gets to be really fun and helps give them that extra push to fluency that kids really need.Level 3 builds a great deal of excitement over the 2 holes that the balls may disappear into.  This is the level that is very tricky for kids to beat!Missing NumberI often use this game for combinations of 10 but it can also be changed to use for combinations of other numbers as well.  I LOVE that this game represents equations and uses a missing addend.You will see my target number at the top middle is set to 10.  I can choose to set this number anywhere from 1-20 which makes it a VERY versatile game.  Kids click and drag the correct answer into the box.  I love the format of the equations.  Number Bond MachineThis one is less game like but still fun for kids and very effective at getting at the concept.  I have posted about this before but I do use it all the time for combinations of 10.  (it also has an option for combinations of 5 and 20 so it gets a lot of use in various grades)Simple but effectiveSave the WhaleThis is another student favorite.  It is from ict games which is just a great resource in general.  The object of the game is to get a long enough pipe (10 units) to bring water to the whale who is a bit land locked and help him escape to the ocean.  I love that it has the units displayed for kids who still need to count.  I often use this game for kids who still need some support with combinations of 10 although kids who are more fluent still benefit from playing as well.  The pipe at the top says 8 and is 8 units long.  I can see that I need 2 more units to get to 10.  See how this supports kids who are new to this concept?I successfully put a 7 pipe with the 3 pipe to make 10.  Now the pond fills with water and the whale escapes to the ocean.  Ten Frame FillI have previously written about an iPad app that is very similar to this but this is the one I go to when I am on the smart board or a PC.  This game actually does several things, so to work on combinations of 10, you need to click on fill along the left hand side.  Then it simply asks you how many more counters you need to fill the frame (get 10).  It is a very supported way for young learners to begin their work on combinations of 10.  How do you use combinations of 10 in your own classroom?"},
{"title": "Estimating and Counting Routines Part 4", "date": "Tuesday, November 26, 2013", "text": "TweetNew to my estimating and counting routines series?  Check out part 1, part 2 and part 3!This week, I knew I wanted to work with a group of first grade students on their counting and estimating skills.  We have been working on counting by 10's in class (going over 100!) and these kids still needed help with that as well as needing a great deal of help with estimating quantities. I decided to pull my Teddy Bear Counters for this group.I place my tub of counters on the table and asked kids to think about how many bears might be in here.  I asked them if they thought there were more than 10? (everyone said yes)  More than 20? (everyone said yes)  More than 100? (only one kid said yes)Then I dumped the bears on the table and spread them out a bit.  I again asked them if they still thought there was more than 20.  (all said yes) Is there more than 100?  (all said no!!!)I then pulled 10 off to the side to give them an idea about what 10 looked like and asked them to think about how many teddy bears in all.  A student recorded everyone's estimates in the middle column of this white board.  You can see that the estimates ranged from 25 up to 65.  I asked, is there enough so that we can all take 10?  They all said YES- even the kid whose estimate was 25.  Once we each had 10, one of the kids suggested we arrange them like they were sitting on a 10 frame so that we could \"tell just by looking\" that everyone had 10.  I then had kids think about the fact that 50 bears had already been removed and there was still quite a pile if they wanted to make another estimateThe new estimates are recorded in the third column.  You can see some kids got the idea that they needed to increase their estimate and some really still need a great deal of practice.  Notice one child chose 53 even though 50 had been removed and a large pile still remained.We each took 10 more bears.  You can see here that the students continued to arrange them as if they were sitting on 10 frames.  They really bought into this idea and it really helped them keep their counting organized.  We counted each group by 10's and found we had 100 bears and STILL MORE in the pile.  The students got SO EXCITED that we were going to go over 100!  After we each had 20, I again asked them if there was enough for us each to take 10.  Most kids agreed there was, so I let each of them take 10 but waited to take my turn.  When they each had 10, there was only 3 remaining bears so my last group was a group of 3.  We counted by 10's a few more times to confirm that we had 140 bears with some left over.  I wanted to make sure kids got repeated exposure to counting by 10's over 100.  Then we decided to count on by 1's to figure out how much 3 more would be.  We had 143 total and the kids had a great time.  I learned that this group of kids needs a lot more experiences with counting and estimating.  If you want to read more about the importance of counting in the classroom, there is a great article called Counting Collections that was published March 2007 in Teaching Children Mathematics.  A Google search should lead you to a copy of it!Click here to head to part 5!"},

The students did not do nearly as well as I had hoped.  There were several students who got most or all of the answers right but many other students demonstrated that they are still not sure about how to use the equals sign.  I tried some of these activities but still felt like they needed more.  It is all well and good to provide whole group and small group instruction around these ideas, but I wanted another way for students to use these ideas during our math stations.So I created a set of equations on cards that can be physically sorted into true and false piles.  We worked on this as a whole class and I will be using the cards as part of math stations and partner/individual work time during the month of December.  I will give another formative assessment after a few weeks and we will go from there.Here is a peak at us trying it out as a whole groupI used a pocket chart to hold the cards so everyone sitting in the discussion area could see.  We only got through 8 of the 18 cards on our first attempt at this because we had so many great math discussions along the way.  I pulled out the math balance during this whole group lesson and students loved using it to prove their thinkingLater last week, I pulled a small group who I felt needed more practice either due to the formative assessment or what they were saying (or weren't saying) during the whole group lesson.  We worked on sorting some other cards.  (I made the cards at 2 different levels to meet the needs of ALL my students).  Level 1 is addition facts to 10 and level 2 is addition facts to 20.  I held off on subtraction for now but will be addressing equality around subtraction in January.  I want my students to be solid here first.  This was small group work so we put the cards on the carpet.  Starting Monday, these sets of cards and the record sheet that goes with them will be added to my math stations for the next few weeks.  If you want to grab these for your own students, they are available here!Here is a look at the record sheet for use during math station timeHow do your make sure your students have a good understanding of equality?  Please respond in the comments below."},

This is what is written on the back of each double-flap cardHere is the 3+7 card with both flaps open.  We can use this card to generate all the facts in the fact family for 3+7=10I might open one flap and ask kids how many they see.  I then might ask them how many are under the other flap.  I vary my language a bit and ask other questions such as, \"how many do we need to add to 6 to get to 10?\"  I also might open both flaps and ask what will be left if I cover up the 10 (or take the 6 away etc)"},

With the coming of the Common Core Standards, I have had way less time to spend on fraction operations with my sixth graders.  Because I knew this ahead of time, I definitely spent more time with them last year as fifth graders making sure they mastered fraction addition and subtraction and has some basic understandings of fraction multiplicaiton.Over the last few weeks, we have been hard at work making sure ALL of the sixth graders have mastered addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of fractions.  They have worked really hard and are doing a great job!  As one final review before taking our unit test, I created a QR code scavenger hunt for them to get one last practice with all that arithmetic.  I purposely made it just number computation because over the week, that is what they seemed to need the most.  They really seemed to have mastered story problems but needed just a bit more practice with computation.Here is what a QR code scavenger hunt looks like.  I simply print this in color and cut it apart along the thin lines and it is ready to go!  This one has 16 cards and was a great way for my students to practice fraction operations.  The kids had SO MUCH FUN doing this.  After weeks of thinking about fraction operations, they were getting a bit tired of it and this really seemed like something new and exciting.  Even though they were practicing the same skills, they were very engaged and excited and were literally running from card to card.  I love seeing kids excited to practice math!  There will be a lot of QR code scavenger hunts in their future!We decided to use the gym for this activity and really give kids a chance to move around.  I put the start card by the door and had the students spread the rest of them around the perimeter of the gym.  (I made sure they were good and mixed up first!) The students worked in groups of 2-3 so that each group had a digital device.  We used a mix of iPads, iPods and other tablets.  Any digital device with a camera and a QR code reader app works great!  (there are free QR code apps- we have had great success with Scan).  We used a mix of school owned and student owned devices.A peek at a student record sheet.  You can see there are a lot of mixed numbers and a good mix of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  After scanning the start card, students get a problem.  They use their record sheet, pencil and clip board to figure out the answer.  They then look for the card with the answer on it.  When they find that card, they scan it and continue around the room until they scan the final code.  When they scan the final code, they get a message telling them they are finished.  If students get an answer wrong, they won't be able to find the answer they got on a card and quickly figure out that the better check their work.  It is a great way for students to self-monitor.Several students work on solving a fraction operation questionsReady to try this out with your students?  It is available here!  If your students are working on decimal operations check this out!Here are a few more picturesBack of the record sheetHere is a screen shot of the final answer key."},

{"title": "Winter Themed Addition and Subtraction Word Problems Task Cards", "date": "Tuesday, October 29, 2013", "text": "TweetIt is official!  My second and third graders need A LOT MORE HELP with all of the different addition and subtraction situations they are supposed to have mastered under the Common Core.  I wrote about using my fall themed task cards to work on these ideas here, here and here.   Despite the hard work these kids did with these fall themed task cards, they still need more practice.These addition and subtraction situations that I am talking about come directly from Table 1 in the Common Core glossary.  If you haven't yet seen this check it out below!  First graders are also responsible for all these problem types, but with smaller numbers.  Check out these great penguin themed problems representing all 12 problem types for help meeting this standard with first graders!  Second and third graders are responsible for all of these using 2 and 3 digit numbers.  It is a big job and requires some practice, especially if your students are not used to so many different situations.   When most teachers write story problems for their students, they tend to only represent 2-3 of the problem types.  I think I was guilty of this several years ago so the kids I currently have in second and third grade probably didn't get the exposure to all the different types of problems they should have when they were younger.  Now I do a better job with younger kids and hope it will pay off down the road! Anyways, here is what I have been working on for my current second and third graders to give them more practice with these ideas. Winter Themed Addition and Subtraction Word Problems Task CardsThere is something about a seasonal theme that works with this bunch of kids so I am sticking with it.  I wrote 16 different task cards representing all 12 of the Common Core addition and subtraction equations.  Take a look!Check out this post about how I use task cards in the classroom!I also like to follow up task cards with some formative assessment so I created some follow up questions to see how kids are doing independently on these types of problems. Of course I like my task cards ready to use so there are several options for record sheets and a full answer key.

Two weeks ago I wrote about some of my favorite candy math books.  This week, I want to tell you about a few more of these.Again these candy math books seem to go in and out of print so they are not always available in the new market.  I have found over and over again shopping for used ones on Amazon to nearly a sure bet of getting one for under 5 dollars even if it is currently out of print. (Sometimes they are as low as $0.01)The Hershey's Milk Chocolate Multiplication Book I love using this book with second, third and fourth graders.  It is a great way to introduce multiplication in a friendly way and does a good job of showing different ways to represent multiplication including the equal groups and area model.  It is definitely best used at a fact level and I ALWAYS read this book to third graders during our first big intro to multiplication unit.  Hershey's Kisses Addition Book I often use this book with Kindergartners, first graders and second graders.  It has some great ideas about adding 1, adding zero and turn around facts.  I often pick parts and pieces of this book to read to a whole class or small group.  I rarely read the entire thing from start to finish all at once. Hershey's Kisses Subtraction BookI love this book because I find kids often need more help with conceptual ideas around subtraction than they do around addition.  Teachers and programs tend to spend more time on addition and this book does a great job of helping kids conceptualize subtraction.  Also who doesn't love the idea of subtracting chocolate kisses, by eating them of course!"},
{"title": "Adding and Subtracting 10 from any Number", "date": "Sunday, October 27, 2013", "text": "TweetIn the Common Core Standards for first grade there is this little standard about students being able to find 10 more or 10 less than any two-digit number. CCSS.Math.Content.1.NBT.C.5 Given a two-digit number, mentally find 10 more or 10 less than the number, without having to count; explain the reasoning used.I find this standard an important one to make sure first graders can do.  It forms the foundation for important work thinking about adding and subtracting two digit numbers later in grade 1 and into second grade.  The strategies and ideas kids share when adding or subtracting two and three digit numbers start with making sure your students master this important standard.Here is a quick and easy routine I do with mini ten frames to ensure students have this important standard down.  The ten frames I use in this activity are available as free downloads here and here.  The first link takes you to a sheet of full mini ten frames and the second to a sheet of partial mini ten frames.  I use one vertical strip from each sheet for each kid.  This gives them each a 1-9 mini ten frame and 10 full mini ten frames. I start by putting out one of the partial ten frames.  I ask kids how many dots they see.Then I place a full ten frame next to the partial one.  I ask kids how many dots they see.  Some kids will instantly know it as a teen number and others will need to count on from one of the numbers.  Kids who are very unsure might count all the dots one by one.  If they need to count each dot by ones, I know they need more practice with adding ten to a one digit number and will go there instead of going farther with this routine.  I place another full ten frame next to the first one and ask kids how many dots they see.  Some kids will know immediately and others might need to count some or all of the collection.  I continue placing another full ten frame next to the previous ones.  I vary my language some and use a few different phrases as I do this.  Sometimes I say \"Now how many dots?\"  Other times I might say \"Add ten\" as I put down the card or I might also say \"What is ten more.\"  Kids need to hear the same question asked in different ways.  Once I have gotten as high as I wanted to go with that student.  (which is often in the 100+ range) I pick up one ten frame card at a time and ask questions such as \"Now how many?, What is 10 less? or Subtract 10.\"  By doing this, kids are getting the idea of 10 less and also the idea of counting backwards by tens starting at a non-decade number.  Varying the start number will give your students more practice with these big ideasHow do you work on this important standard with YOUR students?  Respond in the comments below!"},

If you missed last week's post about my favorite candy math books it is a great one to check out!Today I want to share with you 2 of my favorite books to use with students in grades 5-8.  When I first introduce decimal or fraction multiplication, there is a big idea that I also must introduce with it.  When students' experience with multiplication is limited to whole numbers, they are used to the product being bigger than either factor.  For several years they have been under the impression that multiplication always makes numbers bigger.  When we start talking about decimal and fraction multiplication, that idea needs to to change and needs to be addressed directly.My favorite way to address this?Multiplying Menace: The Revenge Of Rumpelstiltskin  This is a book by Pam Calvert who also write the Princess Peepers series.  It is based on the story of Rumpelstiltskin and is a very funny look at what happens when a wild man runs around multiplying by fractions less than one.  Things keep disappearing and Rumpelstiltskin causes a great deal of havoc before he is stopped.  Once he is stopped they have to figure out how to use his multiplying stick to turn everything back to the way it was.  This leads to a great discussion about how multiplying by a fraction less than one makes the product smaller than one of the factors and how to undo fraction multiplication.Much to my great delight, several years ago another book was written for this mini series. The Multiplying Menace Divides    In this story, Rumpelstiltskin returns along with his evil accomplice the witch.  He has a division stick and is going around the kingdom turning things into frogs and dividing by whole numbers and fractions.  When the witch gets her hands on the stick, she tries to divide by zero.  This is an AMAZING way to introduce kids not only to fraction division but also to the idea of division by zero being un-defined.  Some really BIG mathematical ideas can be addressed with these fun stories!  Click here to head to Volume 16 where I have reviewed some of my favorite Hershey's chocolate math books!"},

This summer I started using an iPad and playing around with QR codes.  I spent some time learning how they are used and how to generate my own.  I decided to design a QR code scavenger hunt and since I am loving this fall weather (and the fun fall clip art I have!) I made them fall themed.  We did the scavenger hunt in the gym last week and the kids had so much FUN!!!  They acted like it was a great and interesting adventure when it was really just routine practice.  I see a lot of QR codes in their futures!  There are even a few students who have been making up their own scavenger hunts using QR codes and are having a great time sharing them with their classmates!I decided to do this activity in the gym and really get kids moving around.  I would have liked to do it outside as track math but the weather did not cooperate with me.  I spread the cards out on the floor around the perimeter of the gym.  Kids grabbed clip boards and pencils.  I created a record sheet to go with this activity that I absolutely love but ended up not using it because my pile of scrap paper (copy paper that is printed on one side and no longer useable for whatever reason) had really been piling up and I like to recycle when possible. I borrowed a few iPhones and a student brought their iPod touch as well as using my iPad and a few other tablets.  The kids got into groups of 3-4 and got busy.  I did stagger their start times a bit so that they wouldn't all be crowded around the same card at the same time.   Students work on the QR code scavenger hunt while getting great practice with decimal operations. The kids had a great time and did a fantastic job of working together.  When they disagreed on an answer, they worked together to check each others work and come to a consensus. They thought this was amazing and keep asking to do it again.  I have already started creating more QR code scavenger hunts for these and other students.We went green and recycled scrap paper instead of using our record sheet.  These are very honest kids and not to large of a class so I was still able to monitor their progress very nicely despite not using the record sheet I created.A student scans a QR code while group mates look on.  The person with the digital device got named team captain and took their job very seriously.  I did not have to take a device away from any student.  My folder with everything I could ever want with this product.  I have record sheets, an answer key and my follow up homework as well as a check-in/quiz all copied and ready to goHere is my QR code scavenger hunt organized and ready to go in its own folder.  Check out this post for more ideas about keeping task cards and similar items organized and ready to go.Ready to try this with your students?  Head over to TPT and get yours right now!

{"title": "Addition Double Facts", "date": "Wednesday, October 16, 2013", "text": "TweetWhen I am working with first, second and third graders on addition fact fluency, one of the first things I push for is fluency with the double facts.  There are always some kids in any class that struggle with these so I make them a custom set of flash cards with picture clues to help them. Here is a set I made for a group of second graders I work with.  The facts they were struggling with were 6+6, 7+7, 8+8, and 9+9. I give them either 2 bead sticks or a 2 string rekenrek (you can also take a picture of them with the virtual number rack).  This day we were using 2 string rekenreks so that is what you will see in the pictures. I chose 1 student to model each addition fact on their number rack and take their picture holding the number rack with the fact modeled.Here are a few close ups of what I meanThis student is showing 7+7.  See how the rekenrek helps students see  different ways to  calculate the answer.This student is showing 9+98+86+6Then I print the pictures and use sheets of construction paper to create a large set of flash cards.  Fold the paper in half the hamburger way and glue the picture inside.  On the outside, write the fact on the front and the answer on the back.  Front ViewInside ViewBack ViewFront and back of another cardInside viewI show students the flash cards and if they don't come up with an answer within 3 seconds, I show them the picture for a few seconds to remind them of the visual image.  After a few days of using these for a couple of minutes per day, there is a great increase in students' ability to recreate the image themselves and figure out the answer without peeking at the picture or counting on.  It really helps them transition from using a counting strategy to using a thinking strategy."},

Also give them the cardstock with a line down the middle which will be their blank domino for building on and a handful of counters. Step 2: Student flips over a domino and builds what he or she sees on one side and then the other.Step 3: Student finds the matching numeral cards and places them below each side of the domino.Repeat the steps until all the dominoes are used!  Simple, fun and effective!  Click here to check out this post about the games I used leading up to this activity!"},

I am featuring some of the sweetest books in this installment of Monday Math Literature.  Quite a few years ago, I received a beautiful hard cover copy of Hershey's Weights And Measures Book from a student who was graduating and began my collection of chocolate and candy themed math books.  After all these years and MANY books later, the Weights and Measures Book is still one of my favorites.  Today I want to share this book and a few other favorites from this very sweet collection with youHershey's Weights And Measures BookThis is such a cool book to use when talking about standard units of measure.  I will often bring it into a classroom to use a few pages with the whole group to discuss measuring distance or weight and we end up looking through the entire book.  I also love how accessible and engaging this story is and how many different ideas around measuring are packed into one book.  I have used this book in grades 1-6 sometimes just a few pages and sometimes in its entirety.  There are also some great random facts about Hershey in this book related to weights and measures.  Did you know they sell a 5 pound chocolate bar?  Hershey Fractions BookI LOVE using this book with fourth and fifth graders.  It is best done when you can buy some Hershey's bars in bulk and have the students act out the book as you go along.  It covers some big ideas about equivalence and magnitude and even gets into fraction operations.  It is a super fun way to reinforce the big ideas of fractions with kids and since a Hershey bar is broken into 12 smaller pieces, it is the perfect way to reinforce other models of 12 such as egg cartons, rulers and clocks.  M&M's Count to One Hundred BookThis is a great story to use with K-2 students and I often find myself using it on or around the 100th day of school.  It covers ideas around counting by 1's and 10's and 5's and 2's.  With second or third graders, I often get into writing multiplication and division equations based on how the M&Ms are grouped and even do some basic fraction work.  If you are going to use actual M&M's along with this book, go ahead and spring for one of the larger bags because you are going to need 20 of each color.  I am sure you can think of something to do with the ones that are left. A final word on all of these books is that they seem to go in and out of print.  There have been times when I have been unable to purchase one or another over the years.  I find that even when they are out of print I can find a gently used on Amazon.Do you have a favorite candy math book?Want to check out more math literature books?  Click here to check out Volume 15!"},
{"title": "My Favorite Computer Games Activites for the Smart Board  or Independent  Practice", "date": "Saturday, October 12, 2013", "text": "TweetI am finally getting to work in a primary classroom with a smart board this year and am finding myself using it again and again.  Other primary classrooms I am in do not have smart boards so I have found using these same activities at student computers by showing a small group how to play and then leaving it open for partner or individual practice time.  I also have teachers who are incorporating these activities into their center or choice time as well with great success.  All of these games are FREE and do not require an account, a log-in or other time wasters.  I am currently using these games in primary classrooms but many of them have quite a range of skills.Fairies in the Fog  Count by 10This game is a great way to get kids to practice counting by tens and not always starting with 10.  The start number changes with each turn in this fun game!  Students have to find the fairy that has the number missing from the flower.  I also love this game because it goes over 100 and the common core has first and second graders adding 10 to any number over 100.  Fairies in the Fog Count by 5Works just like the count by 10 version but allows students to count by 5's.  The start number pictured is 0 but that changes just as it does in the count by 10 versionButterfly 10 FrameThis is a great game to practice subitizing on a ten frame and combinations of ten.  Some butterflies fly away and make quite a sound.  My students think it sounds like a haunted house sound and LOVE it.  We make sure the volume is turned up all the way.  They are then asked how many flew away and then how many are left.Raceway Number ValuesThe common core is very specific about students using the symbols <, > and = to compare numbers at various levels and grades.  The work with these symbols needs to begin in grade 1 and I always find kids need more practice with these ideas.  Here is a fun way to give them that practice.  The numbers at level 1 start out very small and by the time you get to level 2, you are comparing many different types of numbers and they get quite large as well.  I have used this game in grades 1-5.Here is a look at one from level 2.  If you have first or second graders, start with level 1 which begins by having you compare 2 one digit numbers.  How do you use a smart board or computers to help your students develop numeracy skills?"},
{"title": "A Few Simple but Effective Games and Routines for Preschool and Kindergarten Children", "date": "Friday, October 11, 2013", "text": "TweetI have had the privilege of spending some time with some very sweet kindergarten children this week who have not had a great deal of school experiences and are not comfortable with recognizing or writing numerals to 6 or even recognizing small quantities without counting by ones.  I am working with them on a few simple games with a few simple materials that will hep students instantly recognize small quantities (subitize) and recognize numerals.These games and routines would also work very well with pre-school students as they are preparing to enter Kindergarten.Match numerals and dot diceThis is a great game for kids to play on their own or with a partner if they are ready for partner workI start by giving kids the first 6 cards in my numbers to 120 place value deck.  I hand them to them in a random pile and ask them to spread them out and put them in counting order.  This helps kids practice orienting the cards so the numerals are all facing the right way and lets me see which kids can put the numbers in order without counting the place value pieces by ones and which kids still need to count to figure out what the numeral says.  Once kids have the base 10 cards in order, I give them a dot die and have them roll it.  (I really do take time here to teach how to roll a die if this is the first time they are using them!!!) If they roll a 6, they get to flip over the card with the numeral six on it.   They continue playing by rolling a die and turning over the corresponding card until all the cards are turned over.  If they roll a 2 and the 2 card has already been turned over, they just move onto the next roll.  This can take longer than it might seem because one number very often stubbornly refuses to come up on the die.  If the game is going on and they keep rolling, I make sure they are still saying the number they rolled and often make them do something like show me that many fingers.I change this game up just a little to practice going the other way from numerals to picture representations.  I simply use a 1-6 numeral die and a set of dot cards from 1-6 that I made using index cards and dot stickers.  The procedure is the same.  Kids roll the dice and turn over the corresponding card. Another variation of the game where student rolls a numeral dice and turns over the matching picture.  I also use these dot cards that I made as flash cards and flash a picture at them and ask them to tell me or show me on their fingers how many they saw.What early numeracy activities do you use with students who are just starting to think about number?Want to read about the next activity I did with students to extend this one?  Check out THIS POST!Here is a sneak peak at the picture of the activityWant to know more about what is going on here?  Check out this post!"},
{"title": "Estimating and Counting Routines Part 4", "date": "Thursday, October 10, 2013", "text": "TweetNew to my estimating and counting routines series?  Click here to start from part 1!I did this estimating and counting routine with a group of second graders who need a bit more practice with some early numeracy ideas.  I also knew that they would be beginning to work on counting by 25's in class as they got into their money unit and wanted to give these 5 kids a head start on this idea.To do this counting and estimating routine, I used my bucket of buttons.  Kids love using these for math because they are super engaging and you can keep adding to your set as you find unique buttons.  I have even had kids bring in more buttons to add to the collection.  I also read them The Button Box when we first start using the buttons.  I dumped out what I estimate to be more than 125 but less than 200 buttons.  It took me some practice to be able to do this because the tiny buttons can make it tricky!After dumping out these buttons, I gave kids about 20 seconds to look at the collection and make an estimate about how many buttons they thought were there.I then pulled 10 buttons aside and asked kids to think about if this is 10, how many are there alltogether.After doing this, I let kids adjust their estimate if they wanted to.Here is a look at each student's initial estimate and their adjusted estimate.  As you can see most students increased their estimate after seeing what a pile of 10 looked like but one kid actually decreased their estimate.  I then asked the kids to think about how many we could each take from the pile without running out.  They looked very unsure so I did some further prompting. \"Is there enough for us to each take 10?\"\"Yes!\"\"Is there enough for us to each take 20?\"\"Yes!\" (I thought this was funny since none of them estimated the quantity was over 100 yet they were sure that we could each take 20.  Six of us at the table X 20 each = 120. \"Is there enough for us to each take 30?\"(mixed words of uncertainty)\"So if there is enough for us each to take 20 but you are not sure there is enough for us to each take 30, how many should we each take?\"\"20\"\"25\"\"yeah 25 sounds good\"Hmmm.... let's see, one of my goals for this lesson was to introduce the idea of counting by 25's and here I have a few students suggesting that we each take 25.  BRILLIANT! We decided to each take 25.  We briefly talked about how to take about 25 into our own area and then quickly count and confirm how many were actually there.  We also talked about taking turns and not grabbing.  Then I turned them lose to each take 25.Kids working on taking 25 buttonsOne student's collection of 25 buttonsOnce we each had 25 buttons, we needed to figure out how many buttons we had altogether.  I started and we worked on counting around the circle.  Having the buttons as a visual model was VERY helpful as kids thought about putting fives together to make tens.  One particular student was very stuck and needed to use a 100 bead string to help her.  After using it she was able to connect what she did back to the piles of beads. After counting by 25's around the circle a few times we recorded the numbers on the board and looked for patterns in the numbers.  A great way to get kids to practice counting by 25's multiple times is to have them check and see if it matters what person starts the counting.  Of course they quickly realize it doesn't matter at all but in the meantime they get some extra practice.  After we each had 25 buttons, there was a small pile remaining in the middle.  A student suggested we count them by 2's (which is another important second grade skill!)A student lined up the remaining beads and counted them by 2's.  I had another student do it after to check her work, and of course give one more student some practice with this skill!All we had left was to figure out 150 + 18.  I recorded this equation on the board and gave kids a few minutes to think about it and asked them to give me the ready signal when they knew the answer.  I then had kids turn and talk to a partner about what they thought the answer was and how they knew they were right.  We then talked about different strategies kids used to figure it out.  The most popular strategies were counting on by 1's and  the idea of adding the 10 and then the 8 ones.  This was a great time to discuss efficiencies of strategies and the difference between counting and thinking strategies. Stay tuned for more in my counting and estimating series. Ready to read more?  Check out part 1, part 2 or part 3!"},

{"title": "Multi-Digit Addition and Subtraction and the Common Core Part 2", "date": "Tuesday, October 8, 2013", "text": "TweetIf you missed part 1 of this series where I look at subtracting 2 and 3 digit numbers click here to check it out!Over the next week and half, I will be seeing a class of third graders 3 separate times for about 40 minutes each.  In this time, my goal is to help move them from subtracting from 100 to subtracting from 1000.  I will be taking lots of pictures and sharing how I use problem strings to move kids forward in their thinking about place value and their own development of strategies for multi-digit subtraction.    Day 1I started day 1 with a string of problems related to subtracting from 100.  The first few were subtracting just tens and the next few subtracting just ones.  I have done a great deal of work with this group as second and third graders with combinations of 100.  I started at this level to be sure kids were building on their prior knowledge and to make even the lowest students feel like this was something they could do.  The first problem string.  At this point in the year with these third graders this went very quickly without much discussion.  My students were showing me they were ready quickly and fluently.  If I was doing this same string at this point in the year with first or second graders, I would expect a great deal of discussion around these problems and strategies for finding answers.   I expect third grade and up to be fluent with these ideas.  I quickly moved onto a second string of problems.  These were subtracting tens and ones from 100.  We had a bit more discussion about how kids knew they were right.  The two most common strategies in this class are subtracting tens and then ones or adding up.The second set of problems.  I expect third graders to be fluent with these problems as well.  Check out this post on how work with kids towards achieving fluency at this level.  After making sure kids were thinking about previous subtraction strategies they had developed, I upped the ante and we looked at a problem string that was all about subtracting from 1000.Our 1000 take away problem string.  Notice I start with just subtracting hundreds and then just tens before I start combining them.  Our first problem was 1000-200.  Some kids required a lot more think time than I was expecting to come up with the answer to this so we had a great deal of discussion about how various kids knew the answer.  I really liked that one student connected it to what he knew about 10 - 2 = 8.  He said, \"I know 1000 is 10 hundreds and if you take 2 hundreds away from that then it is 8 hundreds.\"  I had him write this using words and numbers like this on the board10 hundreds - 2 hundreds = 8 hundredsAnother kid wanted to come up to the board and added this:100 - 20 = 8010 tens - 2 tens = 8 tensWOW!!  I loved this idea so I had to add my own to it10 - 2 = 810 ones - 2 ones = 8 onesThis discussion REALLY helped kids get the big idea and further reinforced how important it is for kids to be fluent with combinations of 10.Moving onto the next problem, we tried 1000-500.  The kids were much faster with this and were easily able to connect it to the last discussion so I decided to move on to subtracting some tens.We looked at 1000 - 80.  Students were fairly fast to get this idea and several students talked about how they looked at 1000 as 900 + 100 and took the 80 out of the 100 part leaving 900 + 20 left.  Students were so quick with this idea, I decided to jump right to subtracting hundreds and tens. We tried 1000-180.  Most students subtracted the 100 first and then the 80.  There were a few students who had some errors in their thinking such as thinking about 1000-100=900 and then subtracting 80 from 900 and coming up with 980.  Other students were quick to see and correct these mistakes.We tried another problem subtracting tens and ones 1000-350.  Fifty is a really friendly number for kids and all students were able to agree on the correct answer for this.I ordinarily would build up a bit more to my ultimate goal of subtracting a 3 digit number where none of the digits is zero but I was running short on time.  This entire lesson had been very teacher driven with lots of partner and whole group discussion and I was afraid I was losing the students' focus and they were due to leave for P.E. in about 6 minutes.  I decided to go for it and see how they would do with 1000-738.  This would give me a good idea of where kids were with their strategies and who could extend their previous understanding to a more challenging problem.  Students had about 4 minutes to think about this problem and as they were finishing up, I had them whisper the answer to me which is one of my favorite formative assessment strategies.  About half of the class got it correct and another fourth of the class was off by either 10 or 100.  The final fourth of the class was either way off or unable to come up with a solution in the time given.  This quick check in as students were lining up gave me good ideas about where to start the next lesson and who to target my instruction at. Make sure you are following my blog so you will get to see what happened in the next lesson!  On the right hand side of the top of the page there are many different ways you can follow my blog and stay up to date on my latest posts!

I like to sit with a kid and ask them how many they see and how many more they need to make 10.  We also talk abut the different equations we could write to represent the situation.  It has really helped my students work on subitizing, addition, subtraction and the all important combinations of 10.  What are your favorite apps to use with primary students?Here are a few more of my favorites for primary students!Here are few penguin themed apps to work on addition facts!"},

{"title": "Estimating and Counting Routines Part 3", "date": "Sunday, September 29, 2013", "text": "TweetClick HERE to start at part 1 or HERE to check out part 2!Today's estimating and counting routine was done with students who are about 1 month into grade 3.  This is also an excellent routine do with kids from K up to grade 4.  The strategies and efficiency will vary greatly among the grades but there is something different you can bring to each level. This routine was not done as a whole group lesson but rather in small groups of 2-3 students.  I gave each students a scoop of dominoes and asked them to spread them out on the table in front of them with the dot side up.  I gave them about 15 seconds to look at the dominoes and come up with an estimate about how many dots they think are there.  Then one person in the group covered the dominoes with a student sized white board and each person wrote down their estimate.The dominoes awaiting estimationA group of students record their estimatesOnce students were done estimating, their job was to figure out how many dots there actually were.  I did not provide parameters about how this had to be done or make suggestions about ways to do it efficiently.  It was late on a Friday afternoon however, and they knew if they had any time left before end of the day pick up, they got to play with the dominoes so they were super motivated to do this task efficiently.Here is a look at some of their strategies.This team was grouping by 10's but had several dominoes that did not fit into their schema.  The black and blue one in the upper left corner got pushed together to make a group of 20.  The two black and one yellow one above those they figured out by imagining breaking apart the dots on the center domino and giving one to each of the top and bottom of the domino on the left and 2 to the yellow domino.  then they had 30 and 5 left over.  From 35 they simply counted on by tens touching the group of 20 twice. This group had some simple combinations (silly teacher forgot to put some double 9 dominoes into this cup!)  This activity done this way without the double 9's would be great in K or grade 1 as a way to practice combinations of ten and counting by tens.  You could even contrive exactly which dominoes go into a cup and really push on the idea of 10.This group started by putting some dominoes together to make 10's but had more that could not make a friendly ten and they did not think about going farther and trying to make 20 or imagine moving dots to make tens.  They pulled out the 100 bead strings to help them when they got stuck adding unfriendly numbers. Here is a look at a group of 2 kids estimates and the real answer.  As you can see, kids still need more practice with estimating.  My next question as usual when they finish is how far were you off by?  This often leads to a lot of discussion about adding up versus subtracting.  On this particular day we were running behind so this part got a little shortchanged.I closed this session by having each team share their strategy for figuring out how many dots and telling how well their strategy worked and if they thought it was an efficient way to do it.  I am always amazed at how perceptive kids are about their own struggles and successes.  Want to make sure you see part 4?  Check the upper right hand corner of this page for ways to follow my blog so you will always stay informed!  What is your favorite math manipulative to use for estimating?  Respond in the comments below!Click here to head to part 4!"},

For example, which of the following equations are true and which are false? 6 = 6, 7 = 8 – 1, 5 + 2 = 2 + 5, 4 + 1 = 5 + 2.They are also having a difficult time with addition and subtraction facts so that is what I decided to tackle first.  We were working on fluency of addition facts using a dice game and our 10 bead sticks when the opportunity to work on this idea about equality presented itself. A pair of students had just rolled a 9 and an 8 and were talking with each other about how they found their answer using the 10 bead sticks to help explain their thinking.The student whose sticks are in the top of this picture said, \"I put 9 on one stick and 8 on the other but then I took one from the 8 stick and gave it to the 9 stick and made it 10 and 7.\"  I asked this student if he thought 10 and 7 was the same as 8 and 9 and he said yes.His partner then said that she showed 9 on one stick and 8 on the other and said he saw 8+8+1.  I asked him if he thought that was the same as 9+8 and he said yes.Here is where I stopped the whole group and had these two students share what they had noticed.  I recorded their ideas as equations on the board.We talked about one equation at a time and kids shared ideas about whether or not they thought the equation was true and how they could prove it.  There were some kids who were not convinced that these equations were true, so I pulled out my math balance and the kids who thought the equations were true used it to convince the other kids that they were right.The left side is showing 9 + 8 and the right side is showing 8 + 8 +1 the  bar is parallel to the table which means the equations are equalAfter discussing the equations 9 + 8 = 8 + 8 + 1 and 9 + 8 = 10 + 7 a student pointed out that we could write 17 = 9 + 8 so we added that to our list of true equations.

There are a lot of expectations about how kids are supposed to use multi-digit computation in addition and subtraction.  Notice the STANDARD ALGORITHM is not used in the standards until GRADE 4!!!!!So what does all this other stuff mean?  I think it means we need to help kids learn to think about math rather than just doing it.  I have shared some ideas around this on my blog before but I will be taking a closer look at this important idea and providing a lot of examples of how I am attacking this issue in grades 1-4.  Today we are going to take a peak at some strategies being used by students a few weeks into third grade.  This was done as a warm up to another lesson and took about 10 minutes.  I started kids off with a problem string culminating in the problem I wanted to discuss in further detail.  Here is what the string looked like195 - 10 =195 - 30 =195 - 6 =195 - 9 =195 - 68 =I pose the problems in the string one at a time and give kids a few seconds of quiet think time.  When they are ready they give me a signal and when most if not all kids are ready I ask for an answer and how they did it.  We obviously spend more time discussing different strategies as the problems increase in difficulty.  By the time we got to my culminating problem, I had kids turn and talk to a neighbor when all students were ready.  While kids are talking with a neighbor, I get a chance to listen in on different strategies.  I then know what kids I want to call on during our full group discussion.  When I call on a student, I often have them explain their partner's strategy to me.  This does wonders for student engagement and makes it so that they actually listen when their partner is talking.  As we have the whole group discussion, a student or myself will record the speaker's thinking on the board.  Here is a look at the three most common strategies used by my students.  The most popular strategy and the one most apt to be suggested by the problem string  was to subtract the tens and then the ones in 2 steps.  Some kids provide further detail into their thinking and describe decomposing the 8 into 5 and 3 more and talking about how they subtracted 60 and than 5 and than 8.The students who used this strategy decomposed 195 into 190 +5.  They then put the 5 to the side for a minute and subtracted 60 to get 130.  Then they put the 5 back before subtracting the 8.  This strategy led to a great discussion about when to add a number back versus when we need to take more away.This student thought about adding up.  Because of some hard work on their part last year, these kids are fluent with combinations of 100 and were easily able to follow this students' thinking.  He started at 68 and added 32 to get up to 100 and then added 95 more to get to 195.  Then he added 95 and 32 by adding the tens and then the ones.  Be sure to follow my blog so you can see part 2!!!  Coming sometime next week:)How would your students solve these problems?Want to read more?Here is a post about fourth graders subtracting money amountsHere is a post about multi-digit subtraction in second gradeHere is a post about extending fact strategies into multi-digit subtraction in grades 2 and 3"},
{"title": "Fall Theme Decimal Task Cards", "date": "Thursday, September 26, 2013", "text": "TweetOver the last week, I have been working to create a set of task cards to use with my fifth and sixth graders around decimals.  I decided on a fall theme and we were able to get outside and use them for track math!  We are really getting spoiled with all the nice weather and I have to take advantage of it while it lasts. Here are my fall themed decimal task cards: organized and ready to use!I created this set as a review of some fourth grade Common Core standards and to really target fifth and sixth grade standards, I added in operations and numbers to the thousandths place.  There are 20 task cards and some blank ones that I also include so that kids who finish early can write their own problems for other early finishers.Here is a peak at one of my cardsCan you tell how much I love fall?My favorite part of this experience is looking over the follow up questions.  I use these as a formative assessment to see who is getting it and what types of strategies they are using.  Here is a peak at 3 different answers to one of my follow up questionsBased on this evidence, I can see who needs more support tomorrow and which successful strategies I want to highlight.  If you are interested in these task cards you can click here to get the free preview or click here to purchase the full set.TweetBrowsing through the bookstore this summer, I happened to see 2 books that I had never seen before.  The words math interventions, differentiation, games and formative assessment caught my eye.  Of course when I got home, I had to look them up on amazon and find out more about them.  You know how this can lead to buying more books, and sure enough, I decided I needed to buy them both. Here is one for preK-2Here is one for grades 3-5So now that I have had them and used them for a few months, here is what I have discovered.PeK-2 book    This book defines 4 goals for math understanding.     Accuracy    Efficiency    Flexibility    FluencyThese goals align with what I try to do so I was excited to jump farther into these books.  This book is also almost completely game based which is something I love when doing intervention.  Terrence are games designed to work on counting, cardinality, subsidizing, place value, basic fractions, composing and decomposing numbers and addition and subtraction facts.  All of these things support the big ideas of mathematics at the preK-2 level. Throughout the book there are also problem strings and other things to use as formative assessment to see where your students are and how much they are learning from your interventions.  Overall, I think this is a great book for someone who teaches at preK-2 level who wants to differentiate instruction for their students or help their students catch up on important math concepts.  For special educators or para professionals who work with kids struggling in math this book would be a step in the right direction towards the type and quality of intervention kids need.  Even the veteran math specialist can learn a new trick or two from this book. 3-5 book     The 3-5 book picks up with some of the same games and activities around addition and subtraction facts that the preK-2 book leaves off with.  Even though this is a double of what I had in the last book, I think the placement in the 3-5 book is absolutely appropriate.  I often begin the year with third grade intervention around these very concepts.  It is important that kids have a solid foundation of additive reasoning before moving onto multiplicative reasoning.  This books also talks a great deal about efficiency of strategies which is paramount to my own math teaching.       In addition to the addition and subtraction fact activities, this book includes ideas and games around multiplication and division facts as well as multiplying and dividing with larger numbers, fractions, decimals, number theory and place value.  It is a nice sampling of activities that can differentiate learning and help kids catch up in math.As with the k-2 book, I can see this books being beneficial for classroom teachers, special educators, para professionals and math specialists.  There is a great philosophy behind this book and it is packed with useful and engaging lessons.Way resources do you use for kids who need intervention in math?"},

How to make- Cut colored cord into sections about 1 yard long.  Fold over a few inches and tie off one end.  I like to leave a loop on the end so that I can hang them up when I am not using them.- Once the ends are tied off, I like to have pairs of students make these.  Working together, they alternate 10 reds with 10 white beads until they get to 100.  Once there, I have them re-count to check and/or I have them put their bead string up against one I already have made to see if their sections match up with mine.- Once we have checked the bead string, it is time to tie off the other end.  Older students can sometimes do this themselves but I often end up tying off all of them myself in younger grades.Now your bead strings are ready to use!  The possibilities are endless:)How do you or would you use a 100 bead string in your classroom?"},
{"title": "Beautiful fall day? Time for Track Math!", "date": "Thursday, September 19, 2013", "text": "Tweet  Yesterday was one of those days where the weather was perfect and the kids were wiggly.  With the count down to winter getting closer and closer, I have to take advantage of days like this and get outside.  Only I am supposed to be teaching and the kids are supposed to be learning.  Enter track math.  A fun and engaging way to practice a variety of skills.  I have used this idea in grades 1-6 and it has always been very successful.

I started by dumping out my entire tub of 2 color counters.  The container says 1000, but it has been around for a few years and I recently lent a handful out to another teacher so I knew there was short of 1000 remaining in the container.All the kids and myself are sitting in a circle on the floor and the materials get dumped in the middle.  I ask kids to think about how many are there and then turn and tell a partner what their estimate is.  This is a VERY challenging estimate for students to make and I heard estimates ranging from 200-1000. I then asked kids to share ideas about how we would figure out how many we had.  Most ideas centered around us each taking some.  Many kids thought we could take 50 but some thought we should just start with 20 each.  (There were 15 of us in the circle) One student suggested that we each take 25 and since I know there are kids in this group who need practice counting by 25's I agreed that we should start there.I modeled how to estimate 25 counters and pull them into my own space.  I then asked for ideas about how to organize them so that anyone in the circle could just look and know I had 25.  The consensus was putting them in piles of 10 with 5 left over.  I then sent half of the kids into the circle at a time to estimate and pull about 25 counters out.  Then the other half the kids got their chance.A peek at several students' piles of 25When kids all had 25 counters in front of them, we went around the circle counting by 25's to figure out how many we already had.  This was a great way to practice counting by 25.  We started at several different spots in the circle to see if we would get the same number every time.  We did of course :)  The number we got to was 375.  I asked kids to think about their estimate and perhaps change it based on what they had seen so far.  Again they shared their estimates with a partner and this time they were much more reasonable. I then asked the students to think about how many more we should each take.  Many kids suggested 25.  I asked students how many counters we would need altogether if we each took another 25.  This lead to a great discussion about how to figure out 375 + 375.A look at a students' pile of 50 Once each student had 50 counters, our pile was MUCH smallerWe decided to each take 10 more.  Once we all had 60 total, there were only 14 left in the circle.Each person ended with 60 in front of themSince these students are just starting third grade, they are not quite ready to count by 60's.  They are also not able to think about 15 X 60.  Later in third grade, and if I do this routine in fifth grade these are both ideas I would pursue.  Instead we counted by 50's and then each added 10 more  (adding 10 to any number under 1000 is also a big idea in the common core)Our grand total: 914The next question: If there are supposed to be 1000, how many are missing?I gave students about 3 minutes to think to themselves (no pencil and paper!) and then had them turn and talk to a neighbor.  When we came back together, I had kids raise their hands if they did it a different way than their partner.  I then called on certain kids and had them explain how their partner solved the problem.  Here is a peak at a few of the students' strategies as I tried to capture them on the white board.This student pretended that 914 was 915 because \"it is a friendlier number\".  He said, \" it is easy to know that 915 + 85 = 100.\"  He then used the idea of compensation to take one from the first addend and give it to the second addend.  This is a big idea in addition and I was so happy to see one of my students using it!This student thought about how 900 + 100 = 1000.  She then knew she had 14 of the last 100 to make 1000 so she did 100 -14.  When I pressed her for details she said first she took away 10 from 100 then she took away 4 more.  This student used two equations to add up from 914 to 1000.  First he added 6 to get to a \"friendly 10\" and then he added 80 more.  He knew in all he added 86.This final strategy was given by a student who really struggles with math.  She was able to identify that she needed to find what went with 14 to make 100.  She used the 100 bead strings available in the classroom to figure out what went with 14 to make 100.  Do you notice that all of my students used counting up or adding up strategies?  None of them subtracted.  I think (hope!) that the reason they chose this over subtraction is because the numbers 914 and 1000 are close together.  If the numbers are farther apart I am curious to see if they would solve it differently..... something I will try to work into my lessons this week!!!Click here to head to part 3!How do you use counting and estimating routines in your classroom?  Let me know in the comments below!"},

Head on over to Kids Math Teacher and check out my guest post!  It is all about using arrow cards to help kids read and write numbers.  Everything you need to do the lesson with your students is included in the post.  I wrote about how I use arrow cards with second graders and gave some ideas on how I use similar routines but with a different set of numbers in K, 1 and 3.Here is a sneak peek at one of the pictures!TweetThe teacher book that really opened my eyes to the fact that many elementary teachers do not understand the mathematics they teach was Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics by Liping Ma.  This book looks at teachers' understandings of fundamental mathematics concepts in the United States and China. Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics.In this book, Ma examines the difference in conceptual understanding of math between US teachers and Chinese teachers.  Despite having less overall education than US teachers, Chinese teachers demonstrate a much deeper understanding of the mathematics they teach which may in part be why China outperforms the US in math over and over again.  According to Ma, \"even expert teachers, experienced teachers who were mathematically confident, and teachers who actively participated in current mathematics teaching reform did not seem to have a thorough knowledge of the mathematics taught in elementary school.\"  If you teach subtraction with re-grouping, or if you have kids who you think should be able to accomplish this important skill, you may want to look at chapter 1 which goes into great details about how US and Chinese methods on the subject vary and how you might help your students conceptualize this topic rather than trying to remember steps in a procedure.If you teach multi-digit multiplication, chapter 2 is where you want to start.  Ma takes a deep look at how Chinese teachers use the concept of place value to help students understand multiplication.  This chapter can seriously make you a better teacher.The chapter that changed my teaching practices the most was chapter 3 which is on fraction division.  Ma has some scary statistics about the number of US teachers who can not write a number story to go with a fraction division equation.  By generating representations and focusing on the reciprocal relationship between multiplication and division, Chinese teachers have a very different way of teaching and learning about fraction division.   The book also includes ideas about the relationship between area and perimeter and how and when teachers attain profound understanding of mathematics.  If you want to better understand the math you teach, or are curious about how to help your students who are struggling in subtraction, multiplication or fraction division, this might be a book you want for your own collection.How does the way you learned math effect the way you teach math?TweetA book that I picked up last summer that I really enjoyed using with students this past school year is Whole-y Cow: Fractions Are FunIt is a great way to introduce fractions in grades one, two and three and is a fun way to help out kids who are struggling or just need a little more practice.Whole-y Cow: Fractions Are FunThis story is all about a cow who does some strange things like wearing a swimsuit when she goes swimming and painting her hooves different colors.  It is silly and very engaging for primary students.  It also does a great job of introducing or reinforcing fractions.  It starts out with unit fractions such as one half and one third and as the book progresses, it gets into other fractions such as three fourths and two thirds.  All of the fractions in this book are the ones primary students really need to know.

{"title": "Estimating and Counting Routines Part 1", "date": "Saturday, August 3, 2013", "text": "TweetOne of the BIGGEST ideas in the common core for K and 1 is counting and cardinality.  I use whole group, small group, and partner estimating and counting routines to give kids lots of practice with these big mathematical ideas.Here is a peak at the common core standards from Kindergarten addressed by these routines.  (There are quite a few!) CCSS.Math.Content.K.CC.A.1 Count to 100 by ones and by tens.CCSS.Math.Content.K.CC.A.2 Count forward beginning from a given number within the known sequence (instead of having to begin at 1).CCSS.Math.Content.K.CC.B.4 Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities; connect counting to cardinality.CCSS.Math.Content.K.CC.B.4a When counting objects, say the number names in the standard order, pairing each object with one and only one number name and each number name with one and only one object.CCSS.Math.Content.K.CC.B.4b Understand that the last number name said tells the number of objects counted. The number of objects is the same regardless of their arrangement or the order in which they were counted.CCSS.Math.Content.K.CC.B.4c Understand that each successive number name refers to a quantity that is one larger.CCSS.Math.Content.K.CC.B.5 Count to answer “how many?” questions about as many as 20 things arranged in a line, a rectangular array, or a circle, or as many as 10 things in a scattered configuration; given a number from 1–20, count out that many objects. We start with a container of items like glass gems, counters, bears or pretty much anything! I show the students the container and ask a question such as \"do you think there are more or less than 100 gems in here?\"  I have kids turn and talk to a neighbor to share their answer and then dump the container out on the floor or tableI have a student take 10 out of the collection and put it off to the side a bit.  This gives them a frame of reference and gets them thinking in tens.Then we talk about if this small pile is 10, about how many are here altogether.  I give kids about 10 seconds to look and then cover the collection with a cookie sheet or a large book.  If kids have an unlimited time to look at the collection, I will see them moving their eyes and counting to themselves.  My goal in this part is to get them to estimate, not count.  I have kids turn and share their answer with a partner and have a few partners share out their thinking.  Then I uncover the collection and ask students to help me figure out how many are here.  With a collection this size, a student will often suggest grouping by 10.   Once it is grouped into 10's, I have the student count by tens.  We then write the number (in this case 85).  We talk about what the 8 means and what the 5 means.Then I often tell kids we are going to give out all the gems before we count them by ones and assure them that I want each kid to have the same amount.  In whole group instruction,  this results in each kid having less than 10 but this day I was doing small group and each kid ended up with quite a pile. They shared the tens first and knew each kid would get 2 tens and then they shared the ones.  This is great conceptual development and life experience that is important for them to have when they start learning about division.   Once each kid has a pile, I ask them to count how many they have.  Then we count by ones while we place each item back in the container.  Sometimes I will stop the counting to make a comment, and then say something like \"how many were in here?\"  A student will answer 27.  Then we will count on from that number.  This stop and start counting helps kids be able to count on from any number which is a very important skill.  There are many vaiations on this routine that I will be sharing as the new school year gets underway.  Make sure you are following my blog so you are kept up to date!One of my favorite purchases for back to school is a few of these lidded paint cups that I am thinking about using for some estimating and counting math centers.  They are cute and come in different colors and have a lid that doesn't pop open when kids throw them in a tub.Click here to head to part 2!How do you work on counting or estimating with your students?

TweetThe book that changed how I look at kids' thinking and learning around multiplication isYoung Mathematicians at Work: Constructing Multiplication and Division  This book is by Catherine Fosnot, one of my favorite teacher book authors.  She is one of the people I would love to talk math with someday. This book is built on solid research around the way students learn about multiplicative reasoning.  Her \"landscape of learning\" is a graphic that shows the paths students take to learning multiplication and division.  It shows where students start and the intermediate steps they need to get to being fluent in multiplication and division.  There are also mini-lessons in the book that really demonstrate good mathematical practices.If you are a busy second or third grade teacher and don't have time to read an entire book, you must read chapter 3.  Chapter 3 is all about developing multiplication fact strategies.  I really think all teachers (and parents!) who work with kids on multiplication fact strategies should read this first!  It really helps make connections for kids and includes some great mini-lessons using pictures and looking at arrays.The other must read chapter (who am I kidding, the whole book is a must read!) is chapter 6.  It is about algorithms versus number sense.  It presents some great examples of each and how they are very different.  Reading this chapter has helped me be prepared to talk to parents about why we are teaching math the way we are more than any other book.This is a great book for anyone who teaches grades 2-5.  It will transform the way you think about and teach multiplication and division. If you teach older or younger students, Fosnot also has written two other books I love that I will be discussing in a future postYoung Mathematicians at Work: Constructing Number Sense, Addition, and Subtraction: This book is great for K-2 teachers and is one of the first books I ever read on additive reasoning.Young Mathematicians at Work: Constructing Algebra: This book is a great book for all elementary math teachers particularly those in grades 3-6.  It gets at the big idea of how arithmetic connects to algebra.As you can see, I love this series of Young Mathematicans at Work.  The only one I haven't read is the  Fraction, Decimal and Percents book.  I have a feeling it is as good as the rest.Have you read any of these books?  What did you think?

I often find this is a skill that needs to be revisited at the beginning of second grade as well because it REALLY supports adding and subtracting 2 and 3 digit numbers.  I often have kids make their own record sheet for this because it is simple and straightforward.  I start with 1 less and 1 more in Kindergarten.  I might start with just the cards up to 10 and as individual kids become fluent, I give them more challenging cards.  The visual images on the cards really support kids thinking about  1 more/less or 10 more/less because they can cover up a piece or think of adding another piece.  Using these cards leads to a mental image that kids can access whenever they need to.  You will know your students have met the standard when they can use deck C and  flip through and fluently identify 10 more or less than any number under 100. Second graders need to be able to do the same thing but by the end of the year need to be able to identify 1 more/less and 10 more/less up to 1000.  If your students come in to second grade not able to fluently do this up to 100, than you will want to start here!  If you do work with second or up you also might want to check out my numbers to 1000 place value deck.Close to 100This is a game I introduce toward the end of grade 1 and play a lot the last month.  I also bring this game out again at the beginning of second grade because it relates so many ideas of place value and addition and subtraction of 2 and 3 digit numbers. This is another game where I have kids make their own record sheets.  They simply flip over 2 cards and find the sum.  Their partner does the same and the winner is the person who is closest to 100 (under or over).  The winner of each round circles their sum to indicate they won (see picture on left).  Another variation is to have students figure out and record exactly how far away from 100 they were (see picture on right).  Students often use a 100’s chart or a base 10 hundred grid when starting out with this game for support in finding distance from 100.  The visual images on deck A or B really support students who struggle with 2 digit addition.Pairs to Make 100Make 100 Concentration Game.  Get it for your students!Many programs deal with pairs to make 10 in a big way in Kindergarten and first grade which is great. However, as important as pairs that make 10 can be for addition and subtraction facts, pairs that make 100 can be just as powerful when kids are exploring multi digit addition and subtraction in 1st and 2nd grade. Here are 2 ways I use these cards to work on this BIG idea. Click here to see other ways I help kids with pairs that make 100 Make 100 concentration I play this like a classic memory or concentration game. A “match” is found when 2 cards add to 100. You do have to go through your deck and find pairs that make 100 before giving kids this game to play. I do this on occasion and other times have kids find pairs that make 100 and make mini-decks from there. Any of the decks work great for this game Make 100 Pair Match As kids are coming into the room or transitioning between activities, I often use this game. I preselect pairs that make 100 and mix them up. I hand each student a card and it is their task to find a person whose card goes with theirs to make 100. Make 100 Pair MatchMulti-Digit Addition and SubtractionIn first and second grade multi-digit addition and subtraction becomes very important.  I will often hand each kid 2 cards and have them find the sum or difference between the cards.  This can be done during transition times or as an exit ticket or kids can make a simple record sheet and play a game.  It also works quite well as a compare/war game where they flip 2 cards, find the sum or difference and the winner is the person with the largest answer.

These decks are great for practicing ordering sequential and non-sequential numbers.  I  use deck A to do this until kids show some fluency with the activity and then move to deck C.  Some kids in one classroom might still be working on deck A while others work on deck C.  Another thing to consider is the number of cards  you give each student.  Starts with 3-4 and gradually increase until you are giving them around 10. When kids have the cards in order (especially the sequential ones!) I often have them read them to me from smallest to largest and then from largest to smallest.  If they are sequential, this is great counting practice (both forward and back) and is particularly useful when you are having them pull through a decade number.  If they are non-sequential it is still a great way for them to practice reading numbers. Do your students need more practice with this skill?  If you want to have these decks be a part of your math instruction, you can head to TPT to pick up your own copy (THEY ARE ON SALE!).  There is a large sample file you can download for free to get a better idea of how you will use these in your classroom.

Part 1Part 2Traffic LightingThese darling little table tents have gotten a lot of use in my classrooms and are a wonderful way to manage a whole group instruction.  They are double sided so you can see them from anywhere in the room and they are a great way to see who needs help and to prioritize assisting kids.  It takes some initial training of students to help them use their table tent instead of raising their hands, etc but it is well worth it if you can commit to using these!  Each table tent has 3 traffic light colored parts that can be flipped between.  They are relatively cheap to buy and last about 2 school years before they look really shabby.  The last set I bought made it through 3 school years but they were pretty much falling apart by the end of year 3.  I have had the most success using these in grades 3 and up.  Snowball TossWant a quick way to see what kids know at the end of a unit or before you start a new one?  A snowball toss is a super fun way to activate prior knowledge or to review at the end of a unit.  All you need is some scrap paper.  Here is how I do a snowball toss1) Have kids think about some things they know about a topic.  For example before a unit on fractions, I might have students brainstorm things they already know about fractions2) Give kids a few minutes to think independently then have them turn and talk with a partner or the kids at their table about what they know.  (giving kids a chance to share with neighbors lets you see who knows what and assures that everyone will have something to write down in the next step)3) Give each kid a half sheet of scrap paper and have them write down one thing they know is true about the topic.4) Have students crumple up the paper and on the count of 3 have them all throw their snowball at a designated target.  I often have them use the screen at the front of the room or draw a quick target on the white board.  5) Everyone goes up and gets a snowball after the toss.  Stand in a circle and have students read the snowball they picked up.  This gives kids a chance to read another person's idea.  6) Record true statements if desired on a piece of chart paper.  (If you often use KWL charts this is a fun way to do these as well) If someone wrote something that is not true, this becomes a great time to clear up misconceptions.  I also sometimes do a snowball toss in math class with equations that all equal the same thing.  For example on the 100th day of school, we will often do a snowball toss with equations that equal 100.  When we are learning fraction operations in grades 5 and 6 we often do a snowball toss with equations that equal 1/2 or 2/3.Parking LotA great way to answer lingering questions or to get back to kids' ideas during the next class period is to have a designated parking lot space.  You can use a part of your white board or a piece of poster paper and some sticky notes.  It is a place where kids can leave lingering questions or requests for help or extra practice.  It also can be a place where kids share observations or things they notice or connections they made.  It gives the teacher another measure of how kids are doing and what they are thinking without taking up too much time.  It is a great way to make sure ideas get revisited and questions get answered before the next day's math lesson begins.If you are looking for more ideas around formative assessment check out these booksHere is a great one for K-2  Great one for grades 3-5"},

If you have ever taken a course or sat through a workshop where they were using call sticks you will understand how much it keeps you on your toes.  The ones in the picture are fancy kid shaped sticks that I made when I was feeling particularly creative but regular craft sticks work just fine as well.  Individual White or Chalk BoardsGetting a class set of individual white boards is a great investment.  I have used mine almost daily for 5 years and they still work great.  Individual white boards are like having your whole class raise their hand and answer a question all at once.  They are great to use when you are trying to figure out what skills kids have.  Ask a question, give them time to answer in on their white boards and then when you give a signal, everyone shows their answers at the same time.  It is a very quick way to see who is getting it and who needs a little more of your time and attention.  ABCD CardsThese are simple to make, very cheap and work great.  All you need is 4 index cards per kid, a whole puncher and some binder rings.  You can have kids as young as second grade make them with no help from an adult in under 10 minutes.  You simply write an A, B, C and D, one letter on each of four cards, hole punch and put together on a binder ring.  Done!  Then you use them whenever you are doing anything with multiple choice questions.  You simply ask or show the question and answer choices and on your signal the kids all show you their letter at the same time.  I use these most often in the fall when we are reviewing for our state assessment.  Throughout the year, I pull them out occasionally when we are doing other work with multiple choice questions.  I store them in a recipe box so they are always ready to go. Which of these strategies would work best for your students?  Are there any of these ideas that you could try out this fall?   CHECK OUT PART 3!"},

{"title": "Using Formative Assessment in Math Class Part 1", "date": "Tuesday, July 16, 2013", "text": "TweetWhat is formative assessment?  I was first introduced to the idea of formative assessment when I read this book:Assessment For Learning: Putting it into PracticeHere is what amazon has to say about this book\"The starting point of this book was the realization that research studies worldwide provide hard evidence that development of formative assessment raises students' test scores. The significant improvement in the achievements of the students in this project confirms this research, while providing teachers, teacher trainers, school heads and others leaders with ideas and advice for improving formative assessment in the classroom.Assessment for Learning is based on a two-year project involving thirty-six teachers in schools in Medway and Oxfordshire. After a brief review of the research background and of the project itself, successive chapters describe the specific practices which teachers found fruitful and the underlying ideas about learning that these developments illustrate. Later chapters discuss the problems that teachers encountered when implementing the new practices in their classroom and give guidance for school management and LEAs about promoting and supporting the changes.This book offers valuable insights into assessment for learning as teachers describe in their own words how they turned the ideas into practical action in their schools. \"Since reading this book, I have taken a course on formative assessment, used it in my master's degree thesis and taught workshops to other school districts on the concept.  It has completely changed the way I teach and look at student work.  Much of what I use are quick and easy things that you can create yourself.  I also highly recommend a series of books by Paige Keeley who I first heard of from a science teacher friend but have recently picked up her book Mathematics Formative Assessment.  It takes some of her ideas from her science books and applies them to math.  A great resource if you are just getting started or are looking for more ideas around formative assessment. How I Use Formative Assessment in the ClassroomExit/Entrance Tickets When I plan a math lesson for any grade, I often think about what the essential skill is I want kids to get out of the lesson.  I then write a question that students can answer in under 2 minutes that would show me who does or does not have the essential understanding.  I give this question at the end of a lesson (or at the beginning of the next one if I run out of time!).  I have kids hand it to me on their way out the door or as they transition to the next activity.  If time is up, I just collect what they can get done in a limited amount of time.  Then I simply sort the set of work into two piles.  One pile is for the students who got the essential understanding and the other is for students who didn't.  I admit I occasionally have 3 piles when a question or a response warrants an almost got it or a got it with error pile.  The size and make-up of my piles tells me if I can move onto a new topic the next day, if I need more whole group instruction on the matter or if I need to do some small group work around different ideas.  Here are a few examples from various grade levels on exit tickets. Here is a formative assessment prompt I wrote to follow up a game from my first and second grade fraction unit Fourths or Not Fourths?.  It is given after the students are finished playing a game and helps me see who has the big idea and who needs a little more instruction or practice.A 2 question prompt that follows my set of second and third grade fall themed task cards.  These help me see what strategies students have for solving 2 digit addition and subtraction word problems. As much as I would have loved to create these fancy looking exit tickets for every single lesson I teach, there just isn't enough time in the day.  I often will just think of a problem and write it and place it under the document camera.  I keep a basket of scrap paper around and often have students just grab a piece of scrap paper and write their answer and name down on that.Check out Part 2 where I discuss call sticks, white boards and ABCD cards How do you use formative assessment in your classroom?"},

{"title": "Fall Themed Addition and Subtraction Word Problem Task Cards", "date": "Monday, June 17, 2013", "text": "TweetI love back to school time and all the energy it brings to teachers and students.  It is a time to start fresh and try new ideas.  It is also a time to review what kids should have learned in previous grades and begin constructing new understandings.  To keep this fresh feeling going into October, I like to do fall or Halloween themed problems and games with my students.  For my third graders, I am looking to be sure they are VERY solid with double digit addition and subtraction and can read story problems and find the answers.  I created these Common Core aligned task cards to help me with this goal.Here is a peak at some of the task cards.  You can grab this set of 4 as a freebie in my TPT store!  Click here to grab the freebie or click here to look at the entire product!I was thinking about fall and Halloween, but there is a student in this class who does not celebrate holidays so for the most part, I made them fall themed rather than Halloween themed.  I looked closely at the Common Core Table 1 of different addition problem types.  Students in the fall of grade 3 should be able to solve any of the problem types for addition or subtraction with any 2 digit numbers.  So that it what I made.A look at table 1 from the Common Core.  It shows the 12 different problem types that second and third graders need to be able to solve.I also used these task cards recently with second graders.  We had a full week of school to end the year after all of our fun end of the year stuff was done.  To make this week more fun and still learn and practice math, we \"celebrated\" different seasons each day of the week.  For our fall day, we used these fall themed task cards and played scoot around our soccer field.  We have a gravel track that runs around the soccer field and we clipped 3-4 task cards to each of 5 different clip boards.  The kids each get a clipboard of their own with a record sheet on it.  They scoot around the track and solve one task card at each of the 5 clipboards.  They go around and around until time is up or they have solved all of the task cards.A look at the record sheet the kids used to play scoot.  I like different record sheets for different purposes so this set of task cards has 3 different record sheets.This was a fun way to get the kids outside and getting a little exercise while still practicing math!  We have also used these type of scoot games right in the classroom.  The kids love it!As kids finish up, I have them get with another student and compare answers.  Anywhere where they disagree on an answer, they have to go find that task card and work out the answer together.  If they can't come to an agreement on the correct answer, they come to me for some help.  When they are done having their \"math talk\" and all their answers agree, I can quickly check their record sheet against the answer key.  Then if other kids are still finishing up, I often give them a blank task card so they can write their own problem.  Then other early finishers can solve their problem or we can use them for warm ups or homework over the next week.When I make task cards, I always include a blank set so that kids can write their own problems.  It is a great way to extend the activity! There are so many fun ways to incorporate task cards into your classroom practice.  How do you use task cards in your classroom?  Click here to see the entire set of task cards!"},
{"title": "Compare Problems and the Common Core", "date": "Thursday, May 23, 2013", "text": "TweetAre your students good at compare problems? My first and second graders (and sometimes third) often struggle with this concept.  Here is a peek at the Common Core Standards that specifically address compare problemsFirst GradeCCSS.Math.Content.1.OA.A.1 Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.1Second GradeCCSS.Math.Content.2.OA.A.1 Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.1CCSS.Math.Content.2.MD.A.4 Measure to determine how much longer one object is than another, expressing the length difference in terms of a standard length unit.CCSS.Math.Content.2.MD.B.5 Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve word problems involving lengths that are given in the same units, e.g., by using drawings (such as drawings of rulers) and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.CCSS.Math.Content.2.MD.D.10 Draw a picture graph and a bar graph (with single-unit scale) to represent a data set with up to four categories.

Solve one- and two-step “how many more” and “how many less” problems using information presented in scaled bar graphs. For example, draw a bar graph in which each square in the bar graph might represent 5 pets.As you can see there are a LOT of common core standards that address the importance of being able to do compare problems, especially comparing distances!Here is a fun and easy way that I help my students with comparing lengths.  It has great tie-ins to science and we can go off on huge tangents about force, friction  etc but in this post, I am going to focus on the math related questions I ask during this lesson.It is a VERY engaging lesson, so I usually save it for those hard to plan for, full of wiggle days like the day before a vacation or holiday or the days leading up to summer vacation.  I have done this lesson or a similar one with a few tweaks in first grade up through sixth grade.  I will be showing you pictures of a second grade lesson and at the end will give you some ideas about how I adapt it for older and younger kids.The set up:I use unifix cubes snapped into groups of 10 and alternate colors going down the track.  I use a binder as a ramp.  In the picture you see a 1 inch binder but I have used smaller and larger binders depending on how far I want the balls to roll (I also use matchbox cars in some cases).  I often use a long sheet of paper that is about 12 inches wide underneath so that there is less friction and the balls go farther.  I line both sides of the track with unifix cubes to ensure the balls stay on course.   A look at the set upI set the track up ahead of time or have a kid help me set it up.  Having a kid help who needs some more work with groups of ten is a great way to kill two birds with one stone.  I also write the name of the ball on a sticky note ahead of time so we are ready to record their distances. My collection of balls/marbles for this particular lesson.  I go to the teacher in our school who loves science the most and she can provide me with 9 different balls in under 2 minutes.  If you don't have an impressive ball collection check with people who love science.  Better yet get them to co-teach this lesson with you for a great science/math double whammy!Then we establish some rules together.  We talk about things like where we will release it, how to release it (no pushing) and how we will decide how far it went.  Then we start rolling.  As each ball is rolled, I have kids figure out how far it went and record it on a sticky note.  (this is a huge focus when I do this with K and 1 kids.  Counting tens and ones and writing the numbers is exactly what they need practice with)The first two balls we rolled were the steel ball and the large marble.  We stop and ask how much farther did the marble go than the steel ball?  Kids give me a ready signal when they are ready.  They then turn and talk with a partner about what their answer is and how they know they are right.  This lets me hear a lot of answers all at once and gives me a good idea about who should share with the whole group.  I often ask a kid to explain their partner's answer to me.  This gives them practice looking at a problem a different way and ensures that they are actually listening when their partner is talking.  Our first two balls went 91 and 103 cubes.  We pay attention to these labels.  Notice how we move the balls to the outside of the track but leave them in the same place they landed.  This supports kids who need to use the cubes as a visual model when answering my questions. We keep rolling balls and the kids quickly take over generating compare questions.  They get very excited to figure out how much one ball \"beat\" the other ball by. One section of our track got REALLY crowded this time!    When all the balls have been rolled, I finish up with some compare questions.  I also often ask questions like how much farther would the ping pong ball have to have gone to get to 100?  This is similar to asking how much farther did one go than the other but can sound very different to kids.HERE IS THE VERY IMPORTANT PART!!!!!We just spent half and hour working as a whole group doing some really fun and exciting math that gets at the big idea of compare problems.  I want this fun and excitement to continue so I preserve our game board by having a few students help me turn it into a number line. Check it out!I have kids make a mark at the end of each unifix cube, alternating colors every 10.  This turns our race track into a number line that I can put on the board and talk about with students few times the following week.I have a few students help me to make marks where each unifix cube is and we then take the sticky notes and show where different balls went.  We do this right on that long piece of paper we used as the race track.  Now I have a record of our work and we can talk about it and answer questions about it the next day and the day after.  It is a great way to keep talking about compare problems. The next day, I met with 6 kids that I noticed were struggling a bit with the whole group lesson.  We sat right in front of our number line record and talked about what happened and how much farther some balls went than others.  They got more practice doing compare problems using a visual model (the number line) to help them.The day after that, I created a written practice sheet that had compare questions on it about how far various balls went and used it as a station in our math rotation for that day.  I was doing some end of the year assessments and had several workstations set up around the room.  This one was a big hit and kids kept the excitement they had about doing this activity and were happy to be digging back into it.  Their very favorite part was writing their own questions for their partner to answer about what happened. Using this activity with K/1 kidsSince I had all of this stuff out, I also used it in K and 1 this week.  With these younger students, I did do some compare problems but the students relied heavily on the cubes to help them figure out the answer.  My focus shifted a great deal to multiple ways to figure out how far the balls went.  Some kids in this age range always go back to zero and count forward.  Others are able to use a previously placed sticky note and count on from there.  Having these discussions with kids was very valuable!  Also we focused on writing numbers up to 120 and what each part of the number means.  Example: When a student wrote 82, I could ask them what the 8 in the number meant and how they could see the 8 in the cubes.  This led directly to the seeing that there were 8 groups of ten or eighty.  I also wanted the marbles to go a bit farther so I had the \"start point\" be at the top of the binder.  This ensured a lot of the balls were falling in the 100-120 range which is where these kids need the most practice at this stage.Using this activity with older kidsBy changing the value of the cubes, you can easily extend this game into fractions and/or decimals.  I have used it for decimals by making each group of 10 cubes worth 1 unit.  Then each cube is a tenth and you get a lot of great connecitons that way. The compare problems become a matter of adding up or subtracting decimals.  GREAT PRACTICE!  Very visual and supported by the materialsWhen I want to work on fractions with this idea, I often snap either 8 or 12 cubes together to make 1 unit.  This gets kids into thinking in eighths or twelfths and their related fractions.  It also gets kids thinking about fraction addition and subtraction in a fun and supported way.  Next time I do this with fractions or decimals, I will take a lot of pictures and write a post about it.  It is a great experience to give your students!How do you help your students with compare problems?"},

{"title": "Data Standards Common Core Style Second Grade", "date": "Friday, May 17, 2013", "text": "TweetOne of my favorite Common core standards is this data standard that runs from grade 2- grade 5.  I have already posted about how I addressed this data in standard in grade 4 and grade 5 if you want to check them out!  Here is the standard for second gradeCCSS.Math.Content.2.MD.D.9 Generate measurement data by measuring lengths of several objects to the nearest whole unit, or by making repeated measurements of the same object. Show the measurements by making a line plot, where the horizontal scale is marked off in whole-number units.Compared to the grade 4 and 5 standards, this seemed like a piece of cake!  Off to a bad startSo I decided that since it was so nice and sunny outside that we would go outside and collect some fun data.   We measured how far each second grader could do a feet together forward hop.  After a few practice hops, each student had their official measurement done by hopping the length of a yard stick (actually 2 yard sticks end to end).Although the hopping was a lot of fun, the results were disastrous when we went back into the classroom and tried to construct a line plot.  The problem was that the results ranged from 31 inches to 72 inches.  Also only 2 people jumped exactly the same distance.  We did learn together that a line plot is not a good choice to display such data.  I wanted to quickly save the lesson so we measured each kid's height to the nearest inch instead.  MUCH BETTER results.A line plot showing the heights of second graders constructed during a whole group lessonA strong finishThe class results based on height look much better!  Their is enough spread and variation to make it interesting but small enough to keep it manageable.  Here are some questions we came up with that could be asked about our line plotHow many kids were measured?What is the most popular height in second grade?How tall is the tallest student? (this is great because when kids look at line plots without ever having constructed one themselves, they will often look for the tallest column of x's and respond with 51 inches.  Even after building this as a group I still had kids that went there.)How tall is the shortest student (another question easily answered wrong.)How much taller is the tallest student than the shortest student?This was a good first look at line plots with my second graders.  I need to make sure we do a few more lessons like these before the end of the year.  Any suggestions on good measurement data to use for second grade line plots?TweetWe have been hard at work in second grade this year on combinations of numbers that make 100.  Having students who understand how to combine numbers to reach 100 expands their repertoire of strategies for solving addition and subtraction problems.  It makes them much more fluid in their reasoning around operations and place value.  Having this concepts supports a huge chunk of the common core standards for grade 2.  Here are the main standards this supports Use place value understanding and properties of operations to add and subtract.  CCSS.Math.Content.2.NBT.B.5 Fluently add and subtract within 100 using strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction.CCSS.Math.Content.2.NBT.B.6 Add up to four two-digit numbers using strategies based on place value and properties of operations.CCSS.Math.Content.2.NBT.B.7 Add and subtract within 1000, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method. Understand that in adding or subtracting three-digit numbers, one adds or subtracts hundreds and hundreds, tens and tens, ones and ones; and sometimes it is necessary to compose or decompose tens or hundreds.CCSS.Math.Content.2.NBT.B.8 Mentally add 10 or 100 to a given number 100–900, and mentally subtract 10 or 100 from a given number 100–900.CCSS.Math.Content.2.NBT.B.9 Explain why addition and subtraction strategies work, using place value and the properties of operations.1Here is a peek at some of the activities, routines and manipulatives we use to support this important idea.Base 10 PiecesWe use our base 10 pieces and a deck of cards from 1-100 to make a simple practice game for students who are learning about combinations of 100. Kids flip over a card and find what goes with that number to make 100.  Once they place the number of pieces they flipped over the 100 mat, what is left is what they need to get to 100.  Kids start noticing patterns right away and some move quickly away from needing to use the manipulative while others spend a lot of time at the concrete stage with the manipulatives.  I will sometimes do this as a warm-up, a math center or even as a whole class activity.  Sometimes we use record sheets and other times we just share our answers orally.100 Bead StringAnother manipulative to work on combinations of 100 that we use often is our 100 bead strings.  We purchased some plastic lanyard material and beads from the craft store and made a set of bead strings.  We alternated colors every 10 beads so that the groups of 10 would be highly visible.   We use some of the same routines/games with the 100 bead string that we do with the base 10 piecesThis student has pushed 41 beads to the left and uses the beads on the right to figure out what goes with 41 to make 100Sometimes we use record sheets.  My students like to make their own on an individual white board.A simple game where students flip a card and find out using the bead string or base 10 pieces or mental math what goes with that number to make 100.And we extend it to subtracting from 100Almost the same game as above but instead of thinking about the missing addend, the students are thinking of subtraction.Are your students fluent with combinations of 100?  What experiences do you provide for kids to practice this important skill? Check out this lesson on how my students apply this skill to three digit subtraction.Here is a fun, free app to work on combinations of 100!Need a computer activity to work on combinations of 100?  My students love this one!TweetI have been working hard with my first AND second graders on fractions over the last week.  Here is a look at the Common Core standards for grades 1 and 2 around fractionsCCSS.Math.Content.1.G.A.3 Partition circles and rectangles into two and four equal shares, describe the shares using the words halves, fourths, and quarters, and use the phrases half of, fourth of, and quarter of. Describe the whole as two of, or four of the shares. Understand for these examples that decomposing into more equal shares creates smaller shares.CCSS.Math.Content.2.G.A.3 Partition circles and rectangles into two, three, or four equal shares, describe the shares using the words halves, thirds, half of, a third of, etc., and describe the whole as two halves, three thirds, four fourths. Recognize that equal shares of identical wholes need not have the same shape.Yup.  The fraction standard is found in the geometry section and it is all about partitioning into equal sized pieces.  It also gets to the HUGE idea that the pieces do not have to be congruent to be equal.  Notice what is not there?  There is nothing about using symbolic notation.  Awesome!  I have found that using the numerals 1/2, 1/2, 2/3, etc do nothing to promote understanding of fractions and actually hurt kids when they learn them to early.  Seeing the numerals for 1/2 and 1/4 at an early stage lead a lot of kids to reason that 1/4 is larger than 1/2 because 4 is bigger than 2.  This is called improper whole number reasoning and our instruction can really reinforce it if we are not careful.Because of the move to the Common Core standards, I was not happy with the materials we had been using around fractions, so I decided to create some of my own.  I really wanted kids to use the language and words of fractions and stay away from the symbolic notation.   After creating things and tweaking the way I used them, I couldn't be happier with the results!  Both the first and second graders did a great job on the assessment and they have this amazing conceptual understanding of fractions.   Here are some highlights from our week of fractions!Playing Fourths or Not Fourths (Scoot Version) Have you played scoot games with your students?  They are so much fun and a very engaging way for kids to practice all kinds of skills.  For this game, I spent some time making a set of 18 cards where some show fourths and others show things that sometimes kids think are fourths.  We looked at a few of these pictures as a class and really talked about how we knew something was fourths.  Then the kids headed out to play scoot using these cards.  They rotate around the room with their record sheets and fill in fourths or not fourths (some used the word fib instead) When they finish, I pair them up with another person who is done and they have a \"math talk.\"  This is where they compare answers and anywhere where they disagree, they go back to that card and try to come to a consensus.  This brings up some great conversations and is a place where a lot of math learning can take place.  2 kids compare record sheets while playing the scoot version of fourths or not fourths.  The kids changed the rules slightly and made it fourths or fib.    When most kids had finished their math talk, I brought them back to the discussion circle and we further discussed two cards that caused a lot of discussion among pairs.2 of the fourths or not fourths cards that caused a lot of discussion between kids.  These cards really get at the idea that the pieces do not have to be the same shape, but have to bee the same size.  Talking about these two cards and having kids construct arguments to support their thinking really got at the big idea behind fractions.Formative Assessment on FourthsI ended the class period with a quick formative assessment sheet on fourths.  This let me see who got the big ideas and who needed a little more help.  There were a few kids who didn't seem to have it and I met with them for about 15 minutes in a small group at the beginning of class the next day.A quick formative assessment check in that kids do on their own.  This lets me see who has the big ideas from today's lesson and who needs more instruction.   I really love the question on the bottom of the page that says \"How do you know you are right?\"  This really lets me see what their ideas are around fractions.  Check out some of these responsesThis kid really understands what it means to be one fourth!Here is another oneAnd one moreThis kid has been exposed to some symbolic notation around fourths and uses it in his responseSecond Graders need to move onto thirdsWith the second graders (and a few first graders who were ready for the challenge), I made up another set of cards almost exactly like the the last set.  These have thirds or not thirds.  We played scoot and used them for warm ups and such.  We used a similar record sheet and process.  Here were the 2 cards that were brought to the rug for our final discussion at the end of the game.  Notice how the pieces are eight oriented differently or not congruent.  Many kids still had disequilibrium around these 2 cards.  We again had a great discussion and had kids had to construct arguments and try to prove their thinking to their classmates.  The 2 cards from the thirds or not thirds deck that prompted the most discussion.We also followed up this scoot game with some formative assessment.  The students in my class did very well identifying which shapes had one third shaded.  They did not do so well at shading one third of the picture.  We spent the next day doing a lot of practice with partitioning squares, rectangles and circles into thirds.  With some extra practice, all of the second graders got much better at this. We finished off the week with a quick assessment to see how students have progressed in their fraction understanding.  I made up 2 different assessments.  One was for grade 1 and the other for grade 2.  The kids did fairly well and we will continue to use some of the other worksheets I made up for extra independent practice or homework.  We put the cards from the fourths or not fourths game into a math center for extra practice during partner work time as well. The materials I made for this unit turned out great!  I have posted the entire unit including games, worksheets, answer keys and assessments on Tpt.  Click here to check it out!The entire fraction unit aligned to grade 1 and 2 common core standards is available on Tpt.  Click here to check it out!I posted Fourths or Not Fourths as a freebie on Tpt.  Click here to check it out!Click here to grab this freebie from my Tpt Store!How do you teach fractions to first or second graders?  You might also be interested inA great book for introducing fractionsMore fraction work with second gradersPaper folding fractions with first gradersFraction You Tube songs and videos"},
{"title": "No Prep Differentiated Fraction Game", "date": "Monday, May 13, 2013", "text": "TweetThis morning I was working with some fifth graders who needed some intervention in the area of fractions.  The Common Core has a great deal of expectations for fifth graders around conceptual understanding of fractions and fraction operations.  I grabbed my 2 sided counters to create a quick game for these intervention students.  After about 20 minutes, I had the intervention students join the other students and we invented level 2 and level 3 of the same game to work on fraction operations.  I love low prep games that get kids working on important concepts without requiring the teacher to spend hours prepping materials.  Kids make their own record sheets!!  You can get your whole class started on level 1 and then introduce levels 2 and 3 as pairs need.  Or pick just one level if your kids are in a specific place!For all levels-Play in pairs or groups of 3- Each pair/group needs 12 2 sided counters- Each person needs a piece of scrap paper or a small whiteboard and a pencil or marker- Each game has 5 rounds. If pairs/groups finish one game and were fluent, move them onto the next level, otherwise have them play another game at their current level.Level 1The kids who needed more work really needed some more conceptual development around equivalent fractions.   Here is a look at a record sheet from round 1Shake the counters in a small cup and drop them.   Sort into red and yellow. Record as many equivalent fractions that you can find  using the counters.  We made the rule that you couldn't split the counters into pieces therefore the largest denominator possible was 12.  When both partners are done round 1, switch record sheets.  Check your partner's fractions.  If you agree with them, circle them.  One point is scored for each correct fraction.  The winner is the person with the most points at the end.I love level 1 for 4th graders and intervention/early 5th graders because it can be very hands on and there is a great deal of visual support.  Take a lookThis student is proving to their partner how 4/12 is the same as 1/3 by moving and re-grouping the countersNow the same pair is showing how 4/12 is also equal to 2/6 by moving and re-grouping the countersNow if you change the number of counters in this game, think about all the different equivalent fraction practice kids would get!  Changing the number of counters is a great way to keep the game fresh.  It would make a great math center!Level 2The fifth graders are also working on adding fractions.  For level 2 I had them each take 5 turns and record one fraction each time.  Then they had to find the sum of the 5 fractions they rolled.  This was great because even though the recorded some in twelfths, some in thirds, some in halves, etc, they had just practiced finding equivalent fractions and were able to quickly convert between equivalent fractions in order to find the sum of 5 different fractions.  Take a look at a record sheet from level 2I loved that they were finding the sum of 5 different fractions and that the sum often went over 1 and sometimes even over 2.  It was a great way to practice (with hands on materials as a back-up) a lot of the skills that fifth graders are required to have.  Each student played several games on level 2.   Level 3This level was for my advanced students and some students who had been exposed further to fraction operations.  They had to shake and drop the 12 counters and figure out what fraction of the counters were red.  Then then had to come up with equations that equaled that number.  In round 1, they had 1 equation, round 2 required 2 different equations all the way up to round 5 which had 5 different equations.  I LOVED this version because they had the answer and had to come up with the problem.  Depending on their comfort level, the equations varied quite a bit in complexity and uniqueness.  Here is a peak at 2 different record sheets from this level.A record sheet from level 3.  Notice each equation got circled as their partner checked it.  The partner circling the equation meant that they agreedAnother record sheet from level 3I love activities like this!  No prep required, minimal materials and completely differentiated to meet kids below, on and above grade level.  The best part is that the kids really think everyone is playing the same game.  Because the materials are the same and some of the rules, they don't see how much they vary in difficulty.  This series of games will become a math center during Guided Math time later in the week!How do you differentiate learning for your kids?If you want to see how I use these same counters with K-2 kids, check out this post or this one"},

I started by giving them each a small handful of two sided chips (pennies would also work!) and having them figure out how many I gave them and how many more they would need to have 20.  (I always underestimate.  This gives them one more chance to practice a combination for 20).  Once everyone had 20 chips (actually today we did pairs) we put our chips in a cup and shook and dropped.  We then sorted into yellow and red and had kids count how many of each color and write an equation to match. 20 two sided chips.  Sorting the chips into yellow and red and counting them up.  This led to a lot of practice with counting by 2's and counting by 2's then adding one more when the numbers were odd.  A very nice side benefit because that is another skill this group has been struggling with.A look at the record sheet of one pair.  Record sheets are great to bring back to the whole group to have kids share things they noticed.   After playing for about 10 minutes, I pulled the group back together and told them I wanted to share what happened when I was playing.  I gave them examples such as I had 8 red chips, how many were yellow?  OR I had only 3 yellow chips, how many were red?  This is a great way to use the context of the game to help kids think about missing addends.  I wrote a question on the board and asked kids to write an equation that went with it.I wrote this question on the board and asked kids to find an equation that went with it.  As you can see in the picture, they came up with 13 + ___ = 20.  Then one little boy said, I actually got 20 - 13 but I think they are the same thing.  This led to a great discussion about fact families and the relationship between addition and subtraction.  The kids in this group really understood the idea of compensation and how an equation like 12 + 8 is related to an equation like 13 +7.  They were readily able to demonstrate this with the materials so we moved on from here and talked about how the make 10 facts helped us with the make 20 facts.I still had 5 minutes left so I asked if any group played the game long enough to find all the possible equations.  The whole group was not sure but one little boy was convinced that there was no way they had enough time.  They started sharing different equations and one student decided to organize the equations so that we would know if we had them all.  Check out his work below!One boy's list of the combinations of 20.  Writing this list out himself really helped him process what he had learned and pull together all of the little pieces of knowledge we used in this game.  As the kids were lining up at the end of class, one little boy noticed that the 2 numbers were either both even or both odd.  He said, \"it is just like when we were playing if the number of red chips was even so was the number of yellow chips.\" What a great notice for the end of class.  I took a picture and wrote his idea down so that we can explore it more and he can prove why it is true to his classmates next week.  If only I had 15 more minutes with these kids today......Are your students fluent with combinations of 20?  Can they extend what they know about combinations of 10 to combinations of 20 or even 100?TweetDo you know how to use partial quotients to teach long division?Let's take a look at the common core standards for long divisionGrade 4CCSS.Math.Content.4.NBT.B.6 Find whole-number quotients and remainders with up to four-digit dividends and one-digit divisors, using strategies based on place value, the properties of operations, and/or the relationship between multiplication and division.

{"title": "A Quick but Effective game and lesson for combinations of 10", "date": "Wednesday, May 8, 2013", "text": "TweetSo today was one of those long hot days where kids would rather be anywhere but in school.  I knew I needed something fun and engaging to do with my K and 1 kids at the end of the day.  These are all kids who I have pulled for some small group work because they need more practice with their combinations of 10.  I have played variations of this game over the years but here is what we did todayMaterials needed- paper or whiteboards and pencil or markers for record sheet- 10 small objects that have two distinctive sides.  I have used pennies often in the past because they are cheap and readily available.  You will see my fancy 2 sided counters that I got this year in the pictures. - A small cup (this is not necessary but it got so hot in here this afternoon that the chips were sticking in their hands so we shook them in the cup and spilled them out rather than shaking them in our hands.Make sure each player (or pair) has a cup and 10 objects.  Have them shake and dump the objectsThe materials needed for one student (or a pair of students)Have students record how many of each kind they got and write and equation that shows how much altogether.  (you see we used red and yellow in the pictures.  If you were using pennies, you could do heads or tails.)A look at a student record sheet.  Having students keep a record can help move kids' thinking forward and can be a great jumping off point for discussions about big mathematical properties.  The students who were doing this record sheet noticed that 3 + 7 was the same as 7 +3.  When they shared this during whole group discussion, other kids started sharing similar ideas that they noticed from their own record sheets. The kids played for about 7 minutes and then I brought them back together in a discussion circle and had them bring their record sheets with them.  We started sharing things that groups noticed.  Our biggest discussion centered around this ideaWe recorded student equations in order.  They noticed that the numbers to the far left were going up by one as the  other number was going down by one.  This was the big idea I wanted to get to with the students today.So the first thing kids notice when we write the equations on the board in this way is that one number goes up while the other number goes down.  This is a great first step but DO NOT STOP HERE.  I have seen so many classrooms where kids notice this and the discussion is over.  If you do that, you are missing the big idea of compensation in addition.  You are taking one from one number and giving it to the other number.  I have kids pair up and use their counters to explore this idea further.The student on top is showing 8+2 and the student on bottom is showing 7+3.  They  talked about how one chip got flipped over from the yellow side to the red side and that is why one number got one bigger and the other number got one smaller.The kids have the counters out so have them model what is going on and prove why it works.  Try to get to the big idea that if you take one from one number and give it to the other, the total amount doesn't change.   If kids get this big idea in the primary grades, it will come in handy when they are doing something like 99 + 69.  They could take one from the 69 and give it to the 99 and make 100 + 68.  That looks like a much friendlier problem.  This is also very helpful with money.  You will see kids in grade 3 need to add $8.99 to $7.55.  If they understand compensation, they might think of it as $9.00 + $7.54 which is a much easier problem for kids to do mentally.Want to go farther?  Click here to see how I extended this game to pairs of 20How do you teach the idea of compensation?"},
{"title": "Comparing Fractions with Fourth and Fifth Graders", "date": "Tuesday, April 30, 2013", "text": "TweetOne of the biggest changes for my school as we move toward the Common Core is that we have a lot more work to do with fractions in fourth and fifth grade.  I have been working with a mixed group of fourth and fifth graders on comparing fractions recently.  Here is what the common core says in regards to comparing fractions at grade 4:CCSS.Math.Content.4.NF.A.2 Compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators, e.g., by creating common denominators or numerators, or by comparing to a benchmark fraction such as 1/2. Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two fractions refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with symbols >, =, or <, and justify the conclusions, e.g., by using a visual fraction model.I created this little fraction compare worksheet and chose fractions that I thought would elicit some of the different strategies suggested by the Common Core Yes this is the entire thing!!!! I really wanted to focus on strategies used to compare these fractions.  Let's look at some of the strategies my students used for each one.  It is simple, but very effective!  I have made it available for free for anyone who wants to try it!  Click here to grab a copy!The first one is 3/16 and 3/15This questions is obviously written to illicit ideas about common numerators.  We spend so much time on common denominators that sometimes common numerators get completely ignored!The majority of my students used unit fraction reasoning on this one.  They reasoned that we had 3 pieces for each one and since fifteenths are larger than sixteenths, 3/15 would be larger than 3/16.A few of my students tried drawing a model for this.  Because these fractions are really close, it was hard to tell from their models which was larger because of the inherent margin of error with drawing models.  Model drawing is an important first step for kids who are still working on developing conceptual understandings of fractions.  It is not where I want to leave students at the end of grade 5, but it is an important first step!Let's look at 5/9 and 3/7The strategy I was trying to elicit with this one was comparing to the benchmark of 1/2.  Here are the four strategies used by my group to compare these fractionsHere was the strategy I was thinking of when I wrote the problem.  This student compared both fractions to the benchmark of 1/2.  Since one fraction is just  below 1/2 and the other just above it, this is a great strategy for this problem.This student drew a model.  As far as model drawing goes, this is fairly good.  This can not be the only strategy kids use to compare fractions but it is a great place to start and really helps build conceptual understanding of fractions.  This student used a common denominator strategy to compare the fractions.  Common denominators will of course be something you want your fifth graders to be solid on, but please remember that it isn't the ONLY was to compare fractions and often times it is not the most efficient way. This student surprised me by using a common numerator strategy.  It is actually very efficient for this problem.  I didn't write the problem purposely to illicit this strategy but it works quite well.How about 5/6 and 7/8? This student used reasoning about how far away from 1 these fractions are.  They used what they know about unit fractions to help them with this comparison. This student used a number line model to compare the fractions.  If you look closely, you will see the partitioning done in red was done to make sixths and the darker color was used to make eighths.  The number line is a model that I have found really effective for helping kids move forward with conceptual understanding around fractions.The Last OneI chose this problem because it was really easy to create a common numerator for these numbers.  That is what this student did and it was very effective and efficient!This student used a common denominator strategy to compare these two fractions.  You can see that in this case it is much less efficient than finding a common numerator.  This took an entire class period but I got such great ideas and strategies out of the students.  I love days like this when kids have a lot of time to share strategies! A GREAT resource if you want to really help your kids excel with fractions is this book A Focus on Fractions.  Reading it completely changed the way I thought about teaching fractions in grades 1-6.What strategies do your students have for comparing fractions?"},
{"title": "How a second grader got me to stop teaching and start listening", "date": "Saturday, April 27, 2013", "text": "Tweet Last year, I had a second grader who came in having no concept of subtraction.  In my beginning of the year assessment, he could not answer questions such as 7-6 = or 10-5.  After a great deal of work on conceptual development and hands on practice, he was doing a great job with his subtraction facts.  Except for some of the most challenging \"facts\" that our program teaches as the up to 10 facts.  (basically a teen number take away a 6, 7, 8 or 9.  Despite repeated attempts to \"teach\" this student \"how to do it\" he just wasn't making any progress.  After backing off on \"teaching him how to do it\" for a few weeks and doing more exploring of lots of different solution strategies with other students, he suddenly could answer all of these types of questions and the best part was that he was doing it fluently.  Could he explain the up to 10 strategy to me?  NOPE!  He invented a strategy of his very own, and I think he had been doing it all along.  I think my teaching him to do it my way was all symbolic to him and gave no meaning to the problem.  Let's take a look at his strategy and see how he has used it as he has moved into grade 3 and more complex subtraction problems.At the Fact LevelThis is where this student first invented this strategy.  See the picture below for this example (17-8) He sees a number such as 17 as a ten and seven ones.  GREAT!  He knows he has to take away 8 ones.  He says to me, there isn't enough ones to take away 8, so I am going to take the 8 ones away from the ten.  That leaves me with 2 plus the 7 ones I ignored.  2 + 7 = 9.  He does all this mentally and fluently!!!  He is able to explain his thinking to me in a clear and concise manner. Another example: 15-7.  You can't take 7 ones away from five ones so take7 ones away from the 10. That leaves 3 ones left from the ten plus the 5 I ignored.I can't tell you how much of a breakthrough this was for him (and me!)  I really wonder how long he had been solving problems this way and I was thinking he wasn't doing them right!  Did he try to explain this to me before-hand and I told him it was the wrong way to do it?  I don't know.  I do know that a current second grader has been solving problems like these the same way!  How many years have I had kids doing this without even realizing, or acknowledging their strategy?Taking it up to the next levelBy the end of grade 2, I was working with this student on a lot of 2 digit minus one digit type problems like the ones shown below.  To my surprise (and delight) this student extended his fact strategy and it worked very well for these types of problems.Look at the example of 23-7.  \"I can't take 7 ones away from 3 ones so I am going to ignore the 3 for a minute and take 7 ones away from 20 which is 13.  Now I put the 3 I ignored back with the 13 and that is 16.\"Did you follow that?Another example.  42-8. \"I can't take 8 ones from 2 ones so I am going to take 8 ones from 40, which is 32.  Then put the 2 back I ignored and it is 34. Of course, this student does these problems mentally and writes down just his answer.  The horizontal number sentences you see off to the side are just my notes about his strategy.  This kid is a tier 3 kid in math and needs a lot of intervention.  It is pretty amazing that he invented this strategy and that it works so well.  Moving onto the very end of grade 2 and a lot of grade 3 is more multi-digit subtraction.  When we began working on 2 digit subtraction, he continued to use his strategy.In this example, he says \"I can't take 46 away from 2 ones but I can take it away from 80.  80-40=40 then minus 6 more is 34.  When I put back the 2 I ignored, it is36.\"Three digit computationHere is a look at how he uses his strategy with 3 digit numbers.  See picture below.  The red example is 138-79.  He takes 79 from 100, leaving 21 and then puts the 38 back and gets 21 + 38 = 59.  Still doing these completely in his head.Another example.  Take 176 away from the 200 which leaves 24.  Put the 40 back with the 24 and that is 64The Pinnacle of Third Grade SubtractionAs we head towards the end of his third grade year, we have been spending time with four digit subtraction. I was thinking he would abandon his strategy on this but it actually works quite well for him even with very large numbers.  Take a look at the picture below. 5350-1995.  Wow.  This is a problem I see much older students getting wrong all the time.  This student did it in under 30 seconds without using a pencil or writing anything down.  \"5000-1995 is like 5000-2000 but then you have to put 5 back so it is 3005.  Then I add back the 350 I ignored and it is 3355.\" Wow!  Did you follow that?  Isn't that a great way to do this problem mentally?This is traditionally seen as a triple borrowing problem and causes kids a lot of headaches.  The traditional algorithm can get messy and kids really need to understand what they are doing when they do all that borrowing.  This kid's strategy uses place value and combinations of 10 and 100 and can all be done mentally!The big take away from working with this kid for me has been stop trying to teach strategies and let kids invent them!  This gives them ownership of their learning and helps them develop really strong conceptual understandings that will take them a lot farther than learning a trick.  See how his idea works for all subtraction problems?Have you ever had a hard time understanding a student's strategy?  What did you do about it?  Please share in the comments section below!  TweetHave you read this book?It is Share & Compare by Larry Buschman. I have heard this book mentioned over and over again at workshops and other teachers always say that I should read it because it reminds them about my ideas around problem solving.  Well, spring break gave me the perfect opportunity to dig into this book.  I can see why it is so highly recommended.In the early chapters, he sites a lot of research about how teaching kids problem solving strategies (especially kids under grade 3) does not do much to improve students' abilities to solve problems.  I have found the same thing in my own practice.  I used to spend at least one day a week teaching kids how to solve problems.  It always seemed like it was working until I would give them a new problem that was not similar to one I taught them how to do.  He also sites a bunch of research that has found that kids are quite capable of inventing their own ways to solve problems.  Over the last 5 years, this is the direction my own practice has taken and it has made a huge difference in my students' ability to be good problem solvers.  I really had to stop teaching and start listening in order to make this change.  I am so impressed with the ways kids invent to solve problems if  you let them.In chapter 2, there is a great discussion about how to teach problem solving strategies and how they should be taught as additional ways to solve problems as opposed to the only way to solve problems.  The author recommends holding off on direct instruction of problem solving strategies until after grade 3.  In my own school, this is the direction we have headed in as well.  In grades K-3 we spend a lot of time sharing kids strategies and talking about which ones are most efficient for which problems.  By holding off on teaching strategies, kids are really able to solve new and unusual problems on their own.  I hear a lot less of kids saying \"I don't know how to do this.\"  We do teach a few strategies by the end of grade 3 such as making organized lists, and organized guess and check if they don't come up as kids invented strategies.  The level of problems we get to sometimes requires more organization to a solution and this is really the only part we have to \"teach.\"Chapter 2 also is filled with lots of examples and dialogue between teachers and students.  If you have not tried this approach to problem solving before, there are some great insights in this chapter.The later chapters detail the structure of share and compare lessons.  They start out with a warm up which is often mental math and gives kids practice in some underlying skills that they might need to solve the day's problem.  The kids solve the problems on their own and share their answer with a partner.  We do this all of the time in my school and it is VERY effective.  I find it especially effective if students who share with a partner are responsible for explaining how their partner got the answer!The second part of this model is the problem of the day.  This is the main problem solving task that kids are asked to complete.  The author discusses where his problems come from and gives some great examples.  Kids have about 20-30 minutes to solve the problem using any materials, manipulatives, drawings or a combination to figure out an answer.  They are then responsible for showing and telling how they got their answer.  I love the idea of kids showing and telling (in words) how they got their answer.  It is a great way for them to practice talking about their solutions and a great way to integrate writing across the curriculum.  This is an area I will be working on with my students for sure!The third part is the Mathematicians Chair where students get to share their solutions with the class.  It is the teacher's job during part 2 to select students to share in the mathematicians chair that have the types of solutions you want your kids to be thinking about and comparing.  In my school, we have done more and more sharing of students' solutions each year but we do not currently use a Mathematicians Chair.  I think this will be something I would like to do.  We have the space for it and it would add a fun twist to kids' sharing.The final part is Compare.  This is where students compare different solutions or methods of solving the problems and talk about how they are alike and different.  This is where I really like to talk about efficiency as well and figure out how efficient various methods were for the problem that day.  This is a very important step, so make sure you leave time for it!  I used to be very guilty of running out of time and not getting to this part, but now I make sure I get there even if I have to set a timer to remind me of when it is time to move on.The appendix has some great ideas about using cartoons and children's literature to make problems.  There are a few I have marked to try out after spring break.  I think this book is definitely worth a read for anyone who teaches K-6 math.  It could help you develop or refine the way you present problem solving to your students.I loved this book enough to head over to Amazon and look up the author.  It turns out there is a newer book by Larry Buschman called Making Sense of Mathematics. I decided to order it and will be writing a review sometime in the future!What teacher books have you been reading?"},
{"title": "Using dice to promote fluency with additive reasoning", "date": "Saturday, April 20, 2013", "text": "TweetI work with kids from kindergarten right up through grade 6 and there is one activity that I do with kids in all grades.  It is simple, fast and very effective.  It is a simple dice game where kids are rolling and adding or rolling and subtracting.  There is not record sheets to copy or materials to prep and the kids love it.  If you want kids to keep a record of their rolls, it is quick and easy to have them make their own record sheet.  Let me take you from K up through the grades to see how this rolls out.Kindergarten and Early/Intervention Grade 1I use dot dice or my large foam dice and have kids start with 2 and roll and add them.  We add more and more dice as the kids are ready for more challenging numbers.  In the beginning, kids count each dot one by one.  As the year progresses, they start counting on and even adding two together before counting on the rest. In this picture are my over sized foam dice.  VERY ENGAGING for small kids, especially kids  who need more movement.  In this example, kids could count all the dice, count on from one number or do some combination of counting and adding.  Using the dot dice puts the game at a reachable level for all K kids.Grade 1/Advanced K/Intervention 2The next step in this game is to use the 1-6 numeral dice.  Same rules and regulations apply.  Students start by rolling and adding the 2 dice.  When they show proficiency with this, I change the game in one of two ways.  I have them roll and add with more dice (grade 1 common core has students adding 3 addends up to 20) or I have them roll 2 dice and find the difference.  Here is the 1-6 numeral dice with a 5-10 numeral dice thrown in to challenge students.Here is an example of a time where I wanted first graders to create a  record sheet to go with their game.  They just record the sum they got and draw a line on a small white board.  When they get that number again, they write it beside the first one.  I have used this simple record sheet idea over and over again at all these different levels of this dice game.Grade 2/Advanced 1/Intervention 3I start the year in grade 2 with a lot of work on the 12 sided dice.  I give each pair 2 and they do a lot of practice with roll and add and roll and subtract.  As they show proficiency at this level, I give them additional dice until they are rolling a small handful.  This is when they really begin anchoring on 10 and spend a lot of time moving dice around and making tens.An example of a student rolling 5 12 sided dice.  They might pull the 8 and 2 together to make a ten and then the other eight and the two fours together to make 16 and then add 16 + 10.  All of this is done mentally and it bridges nicely into the work second graders have to do with multi-digit addition in the common core Next we move into adding some small 2 digit numbers.  I have a few dice with 2 digit numbers but have purchased a bunch of blank dice and made my own.The next step for second graders is adding small 2 digit numbers with other small 2 digit numbers.  You can see in this shot, one of the dice is one I chose the numbers for.  I highly recommend hat teachers have a few bags of blank dice at all times.  You can custom make games for your students so easily if you start with blank diceFollowed by adding in more diceHaving 3 addends brings out all kinds of strategies!And more dice......You can see this student is grouping some of his dice.  The 15 +5 is a nice chunk that makes 20 and the 28 + 2 makes 30.  I see kids doing this (making friendly 10's) a lot as I add more and more dice.  Being able to roll and add this many dice is my goal for the end of second grade.Another important second grade skill is counting mixed coins.  Do you see how these dice can keep kids practicing counting mixed coins?Third and Fourth GradeWe continue to refine strategies for adding multiple 2 digit numbers mentally.  We play this game as a quick warm-up at the start of math classes a few times a month.  Sometimes we will add in a dice with 3 digit numbers on it to keep things fresh.  (It really helps to have a big bag of blank dice so that you can customize your games as you go!)How would you find the sum of these 8 dice?Grades 5 and 6This game keeps on coming with more practice with additive reasoning but the numbers have changed a great deal by this point.  In our school (and in the common core!) there is a lot of focus on fraction and decimal operations at fifth grade and by the end of grade 6, I want them to be very fluent with these ideas.  Being fluent with fraction operations is a very important cornerstone to kids developing proportional thinking in middle school and manipulating fractions becomes very important as kids delve into algebra. I love using fraction dice with kids this age because it is a fun way to promote fluency. Fifth grade students playing a simple roll and add game with a self made record sheet.  Sixth grade students rolling and adding a variety of fractions.  As more dice are added, kids think more and more about combinations that make one.  This time the kids are playing with no record sheetFifth and sixth grade students work on adding a combination of fractions and decimals.  This game is also easily adapted to roll and find the differenceKids who have been working with percents fractions and decimals roll and add all three types of dice.  It is very interesting to watch this and see which students think in decimals and which think in fractionsThese games make great warm-ups in fifth and sixth grade and would also benefit plenty of older students!  One more version of the game I use with sixth graders is with my integer dice.  The common core moves some of the emphasis on integer operations up to seventh grade, but I find this dice game a nice match for sixth graders as well.  Especially those sixth graders who are really proficient with fractions and ready to try something new.  So sometimes while some sixth graders are still playing these games with fraction or decimal dice, I give these integer dice to kids who are ready for the next step.Integer dice roll and combineDo you use dice in your classroom to promote fluency?  How else do you use dice in your classroom?Looking for more ideas?  Check out this post about how I use a set of seven dice to work on double digit addition and subtraction."},

For my very early finishers, I have a few blank task cards and I hand them one of these and have them create a task for their peers.  They also have to show me that they know the answer!  This helps to assure it is a task at a doable level for the kids in the group. When more than a few students finish, I start pairing kids up with other kids who are done.  They then get to have a \"math talk.\"  What that means is that they go over their answer together and on any where they disagree, they go back and find that task card and solve the problem together.  They do this until they agree on all of their answers.  Occasionally, I will need to step in and help them with a problem that they can't come to an agreement on, but it is pretty rare.  I also created an answer key so I can quickly check students work as they finish their math talk.The papers of 2 of my students involved in a math talkI love task card days because kids get such great independent practice and they think they are doing something really fun!  All the kids were very engaged, even though today is our last day before spring break!Here are a few other ways I use task cards- Track math: When the weather is nice, I love to head outside with kids and use our one eight mile gravel track for math.  Check out this post for more information.- Warm-ups or transitions.  Put one of these task cards under your document camera and students can solve it as they are getting settled down for math class- Formative assessment: Give one, two or more of these task cards to students to see how well they understood the concepts in your lesson.  This is a quick way to check in with kids and one of my favorite formative assessment strategies. - Print and give for homework.  You can print one page at a time and give for homework as you move through your unit or send the whole pack at once with a longer due date.- Review/games/test prep: These are a fun way to review for local and state assessmentsBlank task cards for early finishers.  Having some of these on hands gives your early finishers something to do and kids LOVE creating things for their classmates!These task cards are available in my Teachers Pay Teachers store.  Click here to go check them out!How do you use task cards in the classroom?  Please respond in the comments below!TweetAs we transition from our state standards to the common core, I keep hearing teachers ask, \"Do we still have to do this\" or \"What grade is that in?\"One thing that hasn't changed for our state is when we need to teach telling time.  Here are the common core standards for telling time at grades 1-3CCSS.Math.Content.1.MD.B.3 Tell and write time in hours and half-hours using analog and digital clocks.CCSS.Math.Content.2.MD.C.7 Tell and write time from analog and digital clocks to the nearest five minutes, using a.m. and p.m.CCSS.Math.Content.3.MD.A.1 Tell and write time to the nearest minute and measure time intervals in minutes. Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of time intervals in minutes, e.g., by representing the problem on a number line diagram.So grade 1 is time to the hour and half hour, grade 2 is time to the five minutes and grade 3 is time to the minute.We have been working hard in second grade on telling time to the five minutes (and even some time to the minute thrown in there!)  What kids were still struggling with was when we gave them a blank clock and asked them to draw the clock hands for a given time.  The hour hand in particular was never in the right spot.    I wanted to give kids more practice with placing the hands on a manipulative based clock before going back to drawing hands on paper.  So I got out the mini geared clocks and some time dice I had on a shelf and made up a simple (but very effective!) game.First I demonstrated with our large floor clockThe time dice get rolled and then students use their clock to build that time.  Here is a simple exampleThis game is great played with the whole class at first and also after they know how to play as a partner or center game.  Here is an example of what I was seeing on their paper practice and why I made this gameThe time is 10:30.  Look at where the hour hand is placed on each clock.  A lot of my students were placing it where it is on the clock on the right; pointing directly at the ten!  This game has helped them so much with where to place the hour hand.Examples like these when we played with the entire class brought forth great discussions about where the hour hand goes.  Now my students are paying attention to this detail.Some of my students breezed through this game and were ready for more of a challenge.  I changed their dice so that they were playing to the minute.  Here is a lookEven though time to the minute is a third grade standard, many of my students were ready to go there.  This is such an easy game to differentiate!We played this game as a whole class and with partners and then as a warm-up to math one day.  To make the leap from this game to pencil/paper type tasks, the final time I asked kids to play this, I gave them a sheet of blank clock faces to use as a record sheet and after they and their partner agreed on the positions of the hands using the Judy clocks, they recorded it on their record sheet.  This morning, students were asked to do a similar task to the one that inspired this game and they did very well!   I will definitely be adding this game to my centers for the end of the year and will be using it again next year!I also use these number puzzles to practice telling time and many other skills!Here are some ways I get first graders to meet Common Core standards for telling time.Here are some You Tube videos and songs I use when teaching timeWhat activities do you use to help your students learn time?"},
{"title": "Using Meter Sticks for a Decimal Number Line", "date": "Friday, April 12, 2013", "text": "TweetLast week I wrote about how I use a 100 bead string as a decimal number line.  If you haven't already read it, you may want to start there.In grade 4, I have been working hard with my students on decimals and fractions.  We have talked a great deal about number line models for whole numbers and fractions and done a bit of work with a decimal number line that goes from 0 to 1.  Today, I wanted to make some strong connections for my students and decided to use a meter stick (actually 2 meter sticks) as a decimal number line.  I find that kids need to start doing number lines on something that has a scale given.  Only after they have had some experience with number lines with scale can they make the jump to an open number line. I started by writing some lists of decimals and fractions on the board.  I put them in three different colors so that we could tackle this job one step at a time. I had them start with the numbers written in green (see picture below)  I put the kids into groups of 3 and had them use their base 10 pieces to build each number.  Then they used scraps of paper to label the collections and put their collections in order from smallest to largest. These are the 3 sets of numbers we started with.  Kids first built and placed the green numbers followed by the blue and then finally the black.Part of a collection.  Students labeled the collections with at least one decimal and one fraction nameThen after the collections were built, I had each group put one of the numbers where they thought it belonged on the decimal number line.  They had to show us where they put it and convince us they were right.  The kids did a great job with this and it brought out a lot of great connections between fractions and decimals.  Very cool!We then moved onto the next set of numbers (the blue ones in picture 1) and built and ordered them at table groups before placing them on the number line and finally did the same with the black numbers.  Check out the pictures to get a good idea of what the number line looked likeThis is the full number line after we were done with all the follow up questions.  To attach the meter sticks to the board, I used the little magnetic men.  If you don't have a magnetic board, you may have to use tape or suspend with string.  A close up of the left side of the number line (0-1)A close up of the right side of the number line 1-2You can see some numbers in the pictures above that did not appear on the board originally.  That is because we got into some extension questions.  The first thing that I knew I wanted to address at this stage going into the lesson was the idea of density on the number line.  So I had kids find 1.3 and 1.4 on the number line and then asked them to tell me a number that was between those two numbers on the number line. I used the <, > symbols and words to ask kids to find a number between 1.3 and 1.4 .  1.32 was one of the numbers they identified.  They also identified a few others before I asked the next questionsI asked this questions to get at the big idea!!!!  The kids were so funny because  when  I asked for answers, they were convinced that there were either 9 or 10 numbers between 1.3 and 1.4.  Then one kid got really close to the number line and said, \"what about those tiny lines between the hundredths?\"  This question sparked great thoughts and ideas from the rest of the kids and they took off from there.  Some of the numbers kids found between 1.3 and 1.4.  Notice the millimeter lines are visible this close up and think about how they could help your students with thousandths.  A \"zoomed in\" part of the number line a kid created to prove to his classmates that there are an infinite number of numbers between 1.3 and 1.4.  Notice the multiple colored partitioning happening between 1.38 and 1.381.  In the students' words \"you can just keep cutting the sections into tenths but you will need a microscope\"This was another idea that kids were inventing as we did this activity.  They were thinking about  what fractions or decimals added up to a given number as a way to prove that they had placed it in the right position.  We had a few minutes of follow up time before the end of our math block so I had kids grab their math journals and wrote a few questions on the board for them to answer in their journals.  They did a great job!How do you use number lines in your classroom?

TweetIn grade 3 we have been working hard for the last two months on multiplication and thinking a lot about multiplication facts.  The common core standards say that by the end of grade 3, students need to know the product of all one digit numbers from memory.  Here is where this standard is discussed in more detail.  To facilitate kids getting to this point, I have been starting grade 3 math each day by having kids do one multiplication fact problem in their head.  When they are ready, I have them give me a signal.  When all students are ready, I have students share different strategies with the class and as I try to capture some of their thinking in equations and diagrams on the board.  From start to finish, this warm-up took us 12 minutes.  This was time well invested in getting kids to think flexibly and to have them really use what they know about multiplication.Today's problem was 7 X 8Below are some pictures and explanations of the strategies kids used to tell me how they know 7 X 8 = 56. They are not aloud to say that they have just memorized it.  If they have memorized it, that is great but I still want them to be able to prove it to me.This student said he saw a picture in his mind of 8 groups of 7 and knew that was the same amount as 4 groups of 14.  He then knew four groups of fourteen was the same as 4 groups of 10 and 4 groups of 4.  He finds 40 and 16 as the partial products and adds them to get his final answer.This student struggles a great deal in math but given time to think, he often comes up with really interesting strategies based on what he knows.  Here he said he knew 2 groups of 8 was 16 and 3 groups of 8 was 24.  Then he said now I have 5 groups of 8 so I need 2 more groups of 8 which is another 16.  Then I just added 16+24+16=56. Click here to read more about strategies for multi-digit addition and subtraction.This student knew 5 groups of 8 was 40 and 7 groups of 8 is 2 more  eights.  I find a lot of kids who love this strategy because it builds off from the five facts which kids are so comfortable with.This student built off from 6 x 8 by adding another group of 8.  This is an example of a student who has  the fact 7 X 8 memorized but \"proves it\" to me by doing something like this.  It helps me see that this student understands the concept of multiplication and is not just spitting back memorized facts.This is the strategy that our program \"teaches\" kids to use.  Only one student out of the 12 I was working with did it this way even though that is what they have been \"taught\".  It is a fairly efficient strategy but as you can see based on all the other strategies, students invent many ways that make sense to them without ever being taught how to do it.This student figured out 9 X 7 by doing the \"finger trick\" and then they knew 8 X 7 was one group of 7 less. What kinds of strategies do you see kids using to figure out or prove multiplication facts?TweetI have been thinking a lot lately about multi-digit addition and subtraction.  A few weeks ago I wrote this post about work I am doing with my second graders around addition and subtraction strategies.  This week, I have moved onto decimal addition and subtraction (in and out of the context of money) with my fourth graders.  Today we did some problems pencil and paper free to start class.  They were subtraction of money problems. It was so interesting to see the some of the same misconceptions and some of the same strategies that I saw in grade 2 with whole numbers. Let's take a lookThis was the problem and the four solutions that kids gave me.  When asking for answers, I never acknowledge the correct answer, I just keep asking \"does anyone have a different answer?\"  REMEMBER that the kids did not have pencil paper for this task.  They did all of this \"in their head\".  The things I wrote on the board were an attempt to capture different strategies.   Some kids were able to correct their answer while explaining their thinking!This person decided that $3 was really close to $2.95 so they subtracted $3 from 10.  They took 5 cents to much so then they add it back.  Very efficient strategy for solving this type of problem where the amount of cents being taken away is almost a full dollar. This kid did a number line in his head.  He thought about adding 5 cents to get up to $3, and then needed to add $7 to get up to $10.This young lady decided to subtract $2 first and then subtract the 95 cents from the result.This student did the opposite of what the last student did.  She took away 95 cents and then took 2 dollars from the result.  I was really impressed by how many different strategies my students had to solve this problem!  I also loved how by explaining their thinking aloud to the class they were able to find and fix mistakes (either alone or with the help of classmates).I was loving how this was going, so I posted another problem.Check out the answers I got to this problem.  You can see where the misconceptions are  based on the way they answered!  Below I am going to highlight a few different strategies that students used.This student used adding up to find the answer.  He started at 55 cents and added 45 cents to get up to $1.  He then added the $1 to the $4 and then knew he needed to add up 5 more dollars.  This student subtracted in parts.  First she took away the dollars and then the cents.This student also subtracted in parts but first took away the cents and then the dollars.This student used the visual model of the number line to add up in his head.  He started at $4.55 and added 45 cents to get to $5.  He then had to add 5 more dollars to get up to 10.What strategies do your students bring to decimal subtraction?  Are you giving students a chance to think for themselves without paper and pencil?"},

This works great with 20 frames with K and 1 kids who are working on teen numbers!!!!  Then have kids count forward and backwards using the numerals and frames to support them as needed.  When kids are getting pretty proficient with this routine, have them take the frames and numerals and play a memory game with them.  Make 10 (or 11 or 12 or some other number)You need a deck of 10 frame cards to play this game.  You can also just use 4 sets of whatever 10 frame cards you normally use shuffled up.  Two or more players can play this game.  The first player takes a card and turns it face up.  If this card is a ten, they get to keep it.  If not, it goes next to the draw pile, face up and becomes community property.  The second player flips a card from the draw pile face up.  If they can make a ten using their card combined with any cards from the community pile, they do.  If not, their card also becomes community property.  The next player flips over a card and tries to use and/or any of the community cards to make a ten (2 card combinations are the first that kids see but 3, 4 or more card combinations are also acceptable)  The game continues until the draw pile is gone.  After kids are comfortable playing with make 10, you can change the game to make any number of sums.  (SIDE NOTE: the game also works with 5 frames as a make 5 game and with 20 frames as a make 20 game.)Adding Ten Frames (and comparing to a partner)In this simple game, students are paired up with about 40 ten frames.  They each flip 2 ten frames over, and find the sum of their numbers.  Then they write simple equations that compare their numbers.  Example 1: player 1 flips over a 6 and a 7 which is 13.  Player 2 flips over a 9 and a 3 which is 12.  The students then work together to write a compare equation such as 13 > 12 or 12 < 13.  I often just have them make a simple record sheet on a slip of scrap paper or on individual white boards. Mystery Card (An addition and subtraction facts game!)This game is best played in groups of 3.  Two players sit facing each other with another player sitting off to the side where they can see both players' faces.  The two facing players pick up a ten frame and without looking place the ten frame on their forehead.  They can see their partner's ten frame but they can not see their own.  The third person adds the 2 ten frames together and tells the group the sum.  Then each player has to figure out what card is on their forehead based on the information they have about the sum and the other players addend.  This is a great game because one kid in each triad is practicing addition facts and the other two kids are doing missing addend or subtraction facts.  I hope you are learning a lot about 10 frames!  Stay tuned for part 3 of the series!  If you have any questions,   or great ideas about how to use ten frames with kids, please leave a comment below!"},

{"title": "Using 10 frames! Part 1", "date": "Tuesday, April 2, 2013", "text": "TweetI love ten frames!  They are a great way to build early counting, number sense, addition and subtraction skills. Some of the ways I use 10 frames (I also do many of these same routines/activities with 5 frames in early kindergarten and 20 frames up through second grade!  Same routines, just different cards)Flash a 10 frame  Ask kids how many?  Give a second flash if needed. (flashes should never be longer than 3 seconds)  It is my goal that Kindergartners have this game down cold by the end of the year.  I play it again in the fall of first grade a lot. By the middle of first grade, I play it with the pictures in all kinds of different places.  The goal of this game is to get kids to use subitizing (the ability to see how many without counting).  It is a great way to help students learn to count on.  I ask kids to tell a partner how many they saw and how they know they are right.  This leads to a lot of discussion about addition and subtraction sentences that \"prove\" they are right.  (examples: I knew it was nine because one was missing and 10-1=9, or I knew it was nine because there were 5 on top and 4 on bottom and 5+4 =9, etc) (Giant side note: This a great time to introduce how to use the equals sign to show equality between two expressions.  Like in the example above, I would write 10 - 1 = 5 + 4 as one equation and the kids would have the picture on the ten frame card to refer back to.)Build it I give kids a blank 10 frame and 10 objects.  I say \"build the number 5\" or \"build the number 8\".  Then the kids compare the different ways the number was built on the ten frame.  For example one kid might do 5 on the top and 3 on the bottom, while another kid does 4 on the top and 4 on the bottom, while another kid might say I filled up all 10 and then I took 2 away.  This brings in the topic of combinations (addition facts) that make a given number.  It is fun to see all the creative ways kids think!How many more do I need?  I use this as an extension of both the flash and the build games.  I either flash a card or have students build a certain number and then I ask them how many more do I need to make 10.  Here is a picture of some spring themed 10 frames we were playing this game with today.I see 6, I need 4 more to make 10Here I was using the just the top half of the 10 frame as a 5 frame for a Kindergartner who  is really struggling.  This is such a great game to help kids practice combinations of 5 and 10. Actually I used this same idea again in second grade today with kids who are working on combinations of 20.   I took a full 10 frame and placed it with a partially full one to make a 20 frame.  Then they could see how many they had and how many they needed to make 20.  One game used in 3 different ways at 3 different grades.  You can tell I am loving these spring themed 10 frames!Addition Facts I have kids use their 10 frames to practice addition facts to 10  (first graders need to be FLUENT with these facts)  I hand kids 2 10 frames and ask them to find the sum.  We get into a lot of big ideas about making a ten with some leftovers when we do this activity.  I really like to push onto adding three or more numbers with these ten frames.  I put out 3 ten frames like 6 + 9 + 4 and ask kids to figure out many total dots.  Kids will add these in such diverse ways it is amazing.  We talk about which strategies are most efficient and we get into the very important discussion of how you can change the order of the numbers you are adding (communicative and associative properties) Adding 10/Adding 9/Adding 8 by playing compareI love compare or \"war\" games because kids usually already know how to play so you can get to the math right away.  To play this game, I have a deck of 10 frame cards and we pull out the 10 card to start with.  This is our common card.  Then we each take half of the deck and take turns flipping over a card.  We add our card to the 10 card to get our sum.  The person with the largest sum wins.  This is called round 1.  When kids are sounding fluent with round 1, I move onto round 2.  For round 2, we switch the common card from 10 to 9.  Now we add our card to 9.  This is a great way for kids to make the connections between adding 10 and adding 9.  The ten frames are there supporting their thinking and providing a visual model that helps move them towards a thinking strategy.  If/when kids are fluent with adding 9, I move into round 3.  For round 3, we switch the common card from a 9 to an 8.  This game can be adapted in endless ways (try using 7, 6, or 5 as your common card)  I also sometimes have students grab a sheet of scrap paper and create a record sheet of their work.  It is a 3 column t-chart with a partners name on the left and a partners name on the right.  In the middle column, I have them use the <, >, = symbols to show the relationship between their sums.  Stay tuned for part 2 of the 10 frame series.  As you can tell, I have a lot to say about these little guys!  I also will be posting a list of my favorite online games that use the 10 frame!  How do your kids use the 10 frame (or 5 or 20 frame)?Head to part 2!TweetOne of the ways I use my frog and flower equality cards in the classroomI am so excited about my new spring stuff!  I have been working hard at creating some new materials to meet Common Core standards in grades 1 and 2 and keep going back to this frog and flower themed stuff.My newest creation is an equality true/false game.  I loved the first version I created for my first graders so much, that I created more difficult versions for my second and third graders as well!This common core standard for first grade seemed very intimidating to me.  CCSS.Math.Content.1.OA.D.7 Understand the meaning of the equal sign, and determine if equations involving addition and subtraction are true or false. For example, which of the following equations are true and which are false? 6 = 6, 7 = 8 – 1, 5 + 2 = 2 + 5, 4 + 1 = 5 + 2.Here is a look at the true card for level 1!I do this with kids grade 2 and up all the time but this would be the first year of really tackling this with my first graders.  This game has really helped!  Tackling this idea early on has really made a difference.  First graders have a lot fewer pre-conceived notions about what the equals sign can and can't do.  I think the common core was spot on with putting this into first grade.  I would say my second and third graders had more confusion around ways the equals sign could be used than the first graders did. Here is how I use them:Choose the level of cards you want your students to work on and then choose which activity you want them to do from the list below!-Whole class activity: Choose one true and one false equation. Show one equation to class and have them think about if it is true or false. Pair share their responses. Ask them to tell a partner if they think it is true or false and how they know they are right. Repeat with second card. Pass out remaining cards to pairs of students. When it is their turn, have them come to pocket chart and place under true or false. Have them show or explain how they know they are right. This will bring out a lot of ideas about equality and will address some misconceptions kids have.- Partner game: After you have played the whole class version of the true/false sort, have students play it with a partner or add it to your rotation of math centers. It also makes a great warm-up or 5 minute time filler for students who need something to do.- Hopping down the frog path. Take all 18 cards from one level (or mix the levels if you are feeling adventurous). Place them around the perimeter of your classroom (or the gym, or outside, or down the hallway) Have students take a clipboard, a pencil and a recording sheet and “Hop” down the frog path. They find any place to start and go from card to card, recording the ones they think are true under true and false under false. As kids finish, pair them up and have them discuss their answers and come to a consensus on any they disagree on. If any are tricky for many students, discuss them as a class as a wrap up.This is what the record sheet looks like!Want to try this with your students?  Get it here!How are you addressing this Common core standard with your students?"},

I wanted to know how many I still had (it has been at least 7 years!)  I really didn't know how many were there.We started by trying to estimate how many cubes there were.  This was REALLY hard!  It helped a lot when a student suggested that we take out 100 as a benchmark.  The estimates ranged from 500-1001. The kids organized them into 100's 10's and 1's and we figured out that there were 658 cubes.  We wrote the number in expanded form and talked about how that matched the picture and what it meant.  Then......A student said, \"Wow! You are missing a lot of cubes!\"and another replied \"I think it is over 400!\"and then they all wanted to figure it out.  YESSSSS!!!!!I gave them a few quiet minutes to figure out how many they thought were missing.  They had no pencil/paper etc during this part.  After everyone was giving me the ready signal, I gave them white boards and had them record what they thought the answer was and how they knew they were right.  WOW was I impressed!  It is amazing how many strategies they had and how many correct answers I saw.  And this is all before anyone has \"taught\" them how to do 1000-658!Let me show you some of the strategies!This student added the 100's, 10's and 1's separately and then knew 900+90+10=1000This student started by adding 2 to 658 to get to a friendly 10 (660) and then added 40 more to get up to 700 and then added 300 to get up to 1000.  This reminds me of how we \"Teach\" kids to use the number line to add up at our school!This student used sketching of base 10 pieces along with horizontally written number sentencesThis student (and several others) got the answer wrong.   They added up to 10, 100 and 1000 but forgot to take into consideration the tens and hundreds that get traded up.  They looked at 658 and wanted to add 400 + 50 +2.  Their final answer is 110 off and you can see why!This lesson really opened my eyes to the importance of letting students create their own strategies and letting them share those strategies with neighbors and the class.  This lets everyone learn and compare and contrast strategies.  I think even I learned a thing or two!"},
{"title": "Represent and Interpret data: Common Core Style ", "date": "Sunday, March 17, 2013", "text": "Tweet Measuring to fractions of an inch and making line plots It was a busy week!  I finally got to tackle one of the new common core standards for grade 4 that I have been waiting to sink my teeth into!CCSS.Math.Content.4.MD.B.4 Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Solve problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions by using information presented in line plots. For example, from a line plot find and interpret the difference in length between the longest and shortest specimens in an insect collection.That's it.  That is the represent and interpret data standard for grade 4.  Big change for me.  I used to do an entire unit on representing and interpreting data.  I love that this standard is so focused.  I love that it connects directly to fractions.  In fact it really is a fraction number line!!!!So... here is how I addressed this standard with my fourth gradersWe measured pencils to the nearest quarter inch (I know the standard wants 1/8ths but we were not there yet) I divided the class into 4 groups, gave each group a pile of pencils a bunch of rulers and some scrap paper.  They were told to measure their pencils to the nearest quarter inch and record their results.  Here is one groups results   Several groups got really into making sure they were putting the measurements in numerical order and ended up arranging their pencils from smallest to largest before beginning.I drew a line plot on the white board and as the groups finished, they came to the board and plotted their resultsHere is what it looked like when it was done!  Each group decided to use a different color.Here is where the fun began!We gathered around and I started asking questions, focusing on interpreting line plots, fraction equality, scale, and fraction addition and subtraction.  Here is a sampling of some of the questionsWhy did I chose to start and end the number line where I did?What do the small marks between the numbers mean?What is the most common pencil length?How many pencils did we measure?How much longer is the longest pencil than the shortest pencil?If I put the three shortest pencils end to end, how long would that be?This led to a GREAT discussion.  I can see lots of applications to this in science class.  We MIGHT do this again and measure something to the nearest 1/8 of an inch but we will probably try to tag team this lesson with science class and make a line plot of measurements and data that are important for scientific purposes.  We shall seeTwo more picturesHow do you plan on addressing this new data standard?To read more about how I took this lesson to the next level, click here to check out my guest post on Minds in Bloom about taking this standard to the nearest eighth of an inch."},
{"title": "Multiplication Fact strategies ", "date": "Friday, March 15, 2013", "text": "TweetIn grade 3 over the last few weeks, we have been working on developing conceptual understanding of multiplication and division with small numbers.  Now we are at the point where we want to work toward a level of fluency with computing multiplication facts.  We do this by spending a lot of time sharing different strategies.  We gather all the kids together and make sure they are sitting next to someone who will be a good neighbor.  We put a fact on the board and ask kids to think to themselves and give us a signal when they are ready.  (we like to do thumbs up or thumbs up and bring to lips)  When most (or all) kids are ready, we have them turn and talk to their neighbor.  We have them share their answer and how they know they are right (aka how they solved it)  We listen in to these conversations and then bring the entire group back together.We call on a student to either share their strategy or their neighbors strategy.  Having students share their neighbors strategy is a great way to increase student engagement and have them experiences another way of thinking.  We then ask if anyone else did it that way.  Then we look for a student to share a different strategy.  We then look at how the strategies are the same or different.  By listening in on the conversations when they were sharing with a neighbor, we have a good idea who we will be calling on beforehand.  Sometimes we will share a third or a fourth strategy before moving on.When we go onto another fact, we repeat the process.  After 2-3 facts, we ask kids to try a different strategy (or their neighbors strategy)  Today we worked on the x 8 facts.  Here are some of the kids strategiesI started with 8x8Some kids knew the rhyme \"8x8 fell on the floor, when I picked it up it was 64\"Many other kids did the Double, Double, Double strategy our math program teachesSeveral kids said they knew it was two groups of 8 x 4 so they added 32 twiceThe next fact I put up was 8x7Right away, many kids were ready.  The majority of kids used the fact that we had just done 8 groups of 8 and 7 groups of 8 would just be 8 less.Some kids did the double, double, double strategy Another young man said he knew 5 groups of 8 was 40 and he needed 2 more groups of 8 which was 16 and 40+16=56I was pleasantly surprised by all the different strategies   Now I have to move these kids towards computational fluency.  I think talking about strategies over and over is a great way to expand a students' thinking and help them develop conceptual understanding and fluency simultaneously.  How do you make sure your students learn multiplication facts?TweetCommon Core, Place Value and Numbers under 1000This year I am working with a challenging group of second graders.  Their range of abilities in this one group is incredible.   There are several many students who need a lot of support in terms of visual modeling and other support when dealing with numbers.  The Common Core for second grade says that these kids need to be pretty proficient with a lot of skills with numbers up to 1000.My second graders have been struggling with this idea, so I created a place value deck for them.  The goal of the place value deck is to support them in some of these skills using a visual model.  I purchased some great clip art from Teachers in Love.  The deck I created consists of 54 cards showing numbers ranging from 100 to 1000.  This is what the cards look likeThese are currently my BEST SELLING item in my Tpt store.  Teachers love them and they are getting great reviews:)  Check them out!I copied the deck on to card stock and chopped it apart.   I think I will end up using this deck in so many ways.  Here is what I have done with it so far:Compare Game using Greater Than and Less Than SymbolsThe common core for second grade expects that students will use the greater than and less than symbols.  I created this simple (and fun!) game board for kids to use to show inequalities.  The rectangular strips are attached with brads and can move back and forth between a greater than, less than, and equal to sign.The kids love it.  I walk around and have them read the inequalities to me.  I sometimes have students use whiteboards to record their inequalities after each turn.   This provides a record that lets me check for understanding.  It is formative assessment without feeling like an assessment. Ordering Numbers Under 1000     My students need a lot more practice with this!  For the students who struggle the most, when I gave them just numerals, they would focus on the hundreds or the tens or the ones and not consider all parts of the numbers.  When I first began with this place value deck, I would have students just order the picture cards.  Now that they have had more experience  I am having them write the corresponding numeral underneath.  Eventually, I will have them order just the numerals and then they can check with or fall back on the picture cards.10 More/10 less AND 100 More/100 LessThe common core has a heavy emphasis on 10 more and 10 less for second graders.  Beyond that, it is really helpful when you move into trying to develop conceptual understandings of 2 digit addition and subtraction if subtracting 10 and adding 10 is second nature to kids. I have them create a record sheet on a whiteboard or a piece of scrap paper and they pull a card and record 10 less and 10 more.  The pictures REALLY support kids who need it.  When they have filled in their whiteboard with 10 less/10 more, I have them erase and change it to 100 less/100 more and do the same thing.  While I am sitting here writing about this activity, it doesn't seem like it would be very fun, but my students LOVE it.  I don't know if it is the white boards, or making their own record sheet or what but they think this is super fun and have been asking when we can do it again. I am getting so much mileage out of this deck already!  I am working on creating a similar deck for my first graders focusing on the numbers 0-120.  What uses can you find for this deck?  Want to grab a copy?  Head over to TPT and grab the deck and activity list.  They may even be on sale ;)  You WILL be glad you did!Looking for a deck of cards for younger kids?  Check out this post about my numbers to 120 place value deck!Here is how I use this deck in a place value intervention and to work on expanded notation."},
{"title": "Integers with Sixth Graders", "date": "Monday, March 4, 2013", "text": "TweetSo today in grade 6, we jumped right into our integer unit.  In the past, the focus of our sixth grade integers unit has been on number line placement and on developing strategies for adding and subtracting integers.  I have always enjoyed teaching integers and have exposing kids to using manipulatives such as chips, virtual chips on the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives  and number line models.  So last Friday, as I was finishing up the school day, I pulled up the common core standards to see what they said about integers.  Here is what I found.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.5 Understand that positive and negative numbers are used together to describe quantities having opposite directions or values (e.g., temperature above/below zero, elevation above/below sea level, credits/debits, positive/negative electric charge); use positive and negative numbers to represent quantities in real-world contexts, explaining the meaning of 0 in each situation.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.6 Understand a rational number as a point on the number line. Extend number line diagrams and coordinate axes familiar from previous grades to represent points on the line and in the plane with negative number coordinates.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.6a Recognize opposite signs of numbers as indicating locations on opposite sides of 0 on the number line; recognize that the opposite of the opposite of a number is the number itself, e.g., –(–3) = 3, and that 0 is its own opposite.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.6b Understand signs of numbers in ordered pairs as indicating locations in quadrants of the coordinate plane; recognize that when two ordered pairs differ only by signs, the locations of the points are related by reflections across one or both axes.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.6c Find and position integers and other rational numbers on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram; find and position pairs of integers and other rational numbers on a coordinate plane.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.7 Understand ordering and absolute value of rational numbers.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.7a Interpret statements of inequality as statements about the relative position of two numbers on a number line diagram. For example, interpret –3 > –7 as a statement that –3 is located to the right of –7 on a number line oriented from left to right.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.7b Write, interpret, and explain statements of order for rational numbers in real-world contexts. For example, write –3 oC > –7 oC to express the fact that –3 oC is warmer than –7 oC. CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.7c Understand the absolute value of a rational number as its distance from 0 on the number line; interpret absolute value as magnitude for a positive or negative quantity in a real-world situation. For example, for an account balance of –30 dollars, write |–30| = 30 to describe the size of the debt in dollars.CCSS.Math.Content.6.NS.C.7d Distinguish comparisons of absolute value from statements about order. For example, recognize that an account balance less than –30 dollars represents a debt greater than 30 dollars \"WOW!  That is a lot!\" was my first reaction.  My second was, \"where is the adding and subtracting integers?\"  I had to look again.  Nope.  Not there.I opened seventh grade Common Core standards.......There is is!So...... I don't have to teach integer addition and subtraction?!?!?Hmmmmm..... I guess my self designed unit needs a major overhaul.  I have to design new items to go with these new standards.  But I really want to share my stuff around integer addition and subtraction with seventh grade teachers so I will be posting it as a freebie in my TPT store.  Check it out.For those of you looking for stuff on integers to help meet Common Core Standards for grade 6... Stay tuned.  I am working on developing materials and will let you know how it is going.What has been the biggest instructional shift for you as you move towards the Common Core?"},
{"title": "Common Core Glossary Table 1", "date": "Thursday, February 28, 2013", "text": "TweetPenguin Problem Solving and a Very Important TableHave you looked at table 1 in the glossary of the common core standards?  If you haven't (or you have and need a refresher)Go here Go to page 88.  Side Note: If you teach multiplication/division you really need to check out page 89Here is a screen shot of the table I am talking aboutThis table shows all the addition and subtraction situations that your students need to be familiar with.  The grade level standards specify which ones each grade is responsible for and the size of the numbers involved.  I looked at our math program and the problems we were currently using.  Oops! We are missing some of those.  We seem to have a lot of add to, result unknown.  We also had a lot of compare, difference unknown problems. The rest of the problem types either did not exist or where not in an appropriate number range.  Time to create some new ones. Because I have been so involved with the penguin theme, I decided to stick with it.  I created a series of picture problems that represent the different problem types in the glossary table 1.These picture problems are available at my teachers pay teachers store.  They are sold on their own and as part of the ultimate penguin pack.  Check them out!On each problem, I wrote the problem type on the sun.  This helps me keep the terminology straight and gives me a chance to expose myself to these different problem types.  I used numbers in the first grade (up to 20) range for these problems.  I ended up using some of them with kindergartners as well.  At the end of this week, I am planning on using some of them with an intervention group of second graders.  They really aren't familiar (or proficient?) with some of these problem types and I think I need to back down to smaller numbers and give them more concrete experiences.Here is another example Here is a type of problem I hadn't ever thought about presenting to kids.  They had a lot of fun with it, were very engaged and practiced their combinations of tenAnother favorite problem is the put together/take apart: addend unknown problemThe kids had some really interesting strategies!Does your math program expose students to all the problem types?  If not, how do you give them the exposure they need?Head to Tpt to grab your copy:)"},
{"title": "Penguin Mania!", "date": "Monday, February 25, 2013", "text": "TweetFirst Grade Common Core Standards Penguin Style!Penguin Themed Subtraction Game I have really been on a roll with creating these new penguin games!  As I have been working with my first graders lately, I have noticed that some of them need a lot more practice with subtraction.  Our math program has many more games for practicing addition facts than subtraction facts.  I created this game to help a specific group of kids practice subtraction facts with a heavy emphasis on counting back as a strategy.  Help!  An Orca is Coming!This game has been very engaging!  Each student who is playing (usually in pairs sometimes in groups of 3) gets a game board (the one with the picture of the whale) and 6 penguins (if I run out of penguins or they become distracting to kids, I give them bingo chips and they pretend they are penguins).  They place the 6 penguins on any of the numbered icebergs (more than 1 penguin can be on each one) The students then take turns spinning the spinner and figuring out the answer.  If they have a penguin on the iceberg that has the answer, they get to move it to safety. There are dots on the spinner to support counting backwards as a strategy.  You will see some kids relying heavily on them at first but the more practice they get, the less they need them.  Kids who are ready will not use the dots at all.  I created a record sheet to go with the game. Depending on my intentions when I have kids play this game, I sometimes opt not to use the record sheet.  This is especially true if I have kids who are really struggling and I am going to be sitting there with them for most of the game.  I also will have kids play this game without the record sheet when I am pushing for fluency.  The game is over when a student gets all of their penguins to safety.  After playing this game a few times, kids start to notice which differences appear more often and start being very intentional about where to place their penguins.  I love that this is a subtraction game but probability is also stuck in there as well.I have a few more penguin ideas.... stay tuned!!!"}
