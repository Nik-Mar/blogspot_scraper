{"title": "Happy New Year! 2022 for the win?", "date": "Sunday 2 January 2022", "text": "homemade-gifts-made-easy.comHappy New Year to you all! Hopefully, this year will be a bit kinder and gentler to us. I think we all deserve it, don't you?I wound down 2021 quietly. The cold that had been lying in wait for a couple of weeks finally showed its face last weekend, so I spent a few days feeling run down and sapped of energy. It was very mild - a bit of a stuffy head and a scratchy throat - and then it was gone, fortunately. A couple of nights of Lemsip helped (not a favourite, but it did the trick). I hate being sick, so am very glad it didn't morph into something bigger and more debilitating. I did take a test just to make sure, and it was negative, so that was good, although it did feel *a bit* different than a regular cold. Anyhoo. All gone now, whatever it was, fortunately.So Christmas & New Year were very quiet, and I postponed my two walks. One because I was feeling low, and the second because the weather was wet and not much fun for walking in. Both are going to be rescheduled so am looking forward to getting out and about again with my friends. So I've basically spent just over a week in my flat, puttering, sleeping, resting, and relaxing. I must be an old woman now because I keep dozing off on the sofa in the evening (and sometimes not even the evening!). Haha! But I'm going with it because I obviously need the rest. My holiday to-do list is barely touched, but whatever. I got a few things done and that's fine. The rest will have to just move to my regular to-do list, and I'll tackle them another time. Nothing was/is especially urgent, it's just nice to have big chunks of time for them.My sister, brother & SIL had a video chat on Christmas Day which was good, and I got a tarot card reading from my sister yesterday which was excellent! Back in September/October-ish, I looked up my numerological number for this year - a 3. It means a year of activity, creativity, self-expression - but with a lot of hard work at the emotional/spiritual level now in order for it to actually bloom. The seeds of all this were planted last year, so this year should be the reaping of that. It depends entirely on how willing I am to do all that yucky stuff of 'clearing the (mental/emotional) clutter'. Yikes. But, yay! I'm 55 this year and I'm honestly fed up with just drifting along. That's fine for a while, but not an entire lifetime. I have to get out of my head and out of my own way, which has always been my problem.So, otherwise, what have I been up to the past few months? Not all that much, honestly. The excitement, if you want to call it that, only started in October, and is all work-related.My colleague P retired 1 October. A modest affair, she only started clearing out drawers and cupboards that day (?) and we have stumbled across about a million and a half things since that really don't need to be there. Anyway, same with drawers that retired colleague, J, gone since the end of last January, left behind. The problem is, who has time to go through that kind of stuff once they're gone? It's going to have to be a work in progess starting this year.Once P had gone, T, H & I carried on well enough for, oh, a week or so, and then T went off sick rather suddenly, a couple of days before H was due to go on holiday for a week. So, fine. That rather abruptly left me to do all of the work. P was in the background typing reports (something she was always happy to help with), and I called in our part-time typist, S, so I could at least have someone at the office with me. S is not fast, but she's steady and doesn't do anything but type, so at least that was covered.Anyhow, long story short, T never did come back. She kept extending her sick leave, and then she found a new job and resigned instead. I had a funny feeling she wasn't going to come back, so wasn't entirely surprised when my boss told me. There were some shenanigans in the background, her new job offer was withdrawn, she threatened to sue (which would have had no legs), essentially got paid off, but burned her proverbial bridge to an absolute crisp. Good riddance we said.So, it was just H & I for about 6 weeks, me essentially running the office and throwing H into the learning fire for the job bookings. She did fantastic considering it was unplanned and unwelcome. S was in quite regularly helping out and by the time I was at the office on 23 December, our typing folder was empty. Amazing!Â What it meant for me, however, was a nice bonus at Christmas (on top of what we normally get), and a new job title. I will essentially be the Office Manager/Sr Administrator (yet to be confirmed) because I was basically doing it all once T left. To be fair, it's also by attrition, as I'm really the only 'old guard' left, the one with the most experience at the office. It will also mean another raise, so I have that to look forward to at some point as well. We have a new colleague starting, we assume, in January sometime, so I'll be doing some training and have to organise bits & pieces for that as well.So, phew! I was ABSOLUTELY exhausted, stressed, etc. I was going into the office at 7:30 most mornings and putting in an overfull day, not taking the time I needed to unwind properly once I got home, and then just spending my weekends too tired to do anything of note. I wasn't eating properly, just shoving easy stuff (aka carbs) into my face, and that definitely didn't help when I was already feeling exhausted so obviously I put on weight, too. Ugh.It all means a bit more of a struggle to get going this year, particularly as I'm so content at my flat. It's warm and cosy and I've arranged my plants just so. I bought three jigsaw puzzles at thrift shops before the holidays, but haven't looked at them since. But they're there if I want to pursue them later. I've been reading and watching movies and shows over the holidays, and I more or less feel ready to go back to the office (I guess? :P).What have I been watching?Schitt's Creek (brilliant series)Hoarders (thought provoking)Hoarding: Buried Alive (as above)Obsessive-Compulsive Cleaners (as above, but the complete opposite end of OCD - the pandemic must be an absolute nightmare for these folks)Thunder Force (silly, verging on ridiculous, but Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman are excellent)Expedition X (suprisingly good; all my other paranormal shows have no new episodes yet)Red Notice (fun. I love The Rock, and Ryan Reynolds, although his character has a few too many one-liners)RIPD (Ryan Reynolds, fun)Kingsmen: The Golden Circle (not as good as the first, but entertaining and have waited a long time to see it on TV)So, plenty of mindless stuff, entertaining and fun. Just what I need. As for reading, I managed to find a few more NetGalley reads but have managed to slow that down a bit and actually read some of the ones I own now (you can see my list over there ---->). I think one thing I need to do this year is broaden my reading horizons. As much as cosy mysteries are fun, there's a lot more out there for me to discover. I at least seem to be getting my reading mojo back, ticking 81 books off for last year.Anyway. I don't have any particular new year resolutions - perhaps to be kinder to myself, get out of some bad habits (to that end I deleted Candy Crush from my iPad yesterday!), and spend more time in nature. I don't really have an excuse, a bird-watching paradise literally across the road. But a daily walk at lunch (or as often as possible) definitely won't hurt my head or my waistline!Wishing you all a healthy, happy, safe and fun 2022!"},
{"title": "Merry Christmas everyone!", "date": "Friday 24 December 2021", "text": "socent.ieWishing you all a happy, safe, and restful holiday, whatever you're doing, and with whoever you're doing it with.Stay well, stay safe, and best wishes for a safe and happy new year.Here's hoping that 2022 has fewer (unwelcome) surprises for us all!All is well here, I'm just tired. I've already been on holiday for a week and am not back at work until 4 January. It's been pretty hectic since October - a blog post will (hopefully) be forthcoming at some point over the holidays - and I'm taking advantage of the time to unwind, rest and relax.So far, that has been a writing group get together (all of us taking lateral flow tests prior), getting my booster, visiting and catching up with my cousin, a long Skype call with a friend quarantining in Hong Kong, 'collecting' six more plants for the flat (think I've honestly hit my limit now!), a more or less full day at the office to tidy away some things before we closed, and marathoning 'Hoarders'. The Christmas lunch I usually have with my friends is postponed until January - Ex-Roomie E is stressed, exhausted, and not feeling particularly festive at the moment, so we're having a post-Christmas Christmas lunch sometime in January. This is absolutely fine with me.I've also arranged a six-mile walk with a friend, a pub lunch at the end of it, on the 28th, and another walk on the 30th (with another friend, the first friend's sister). This, of course, is weather-dependent, as the rain has started in earnest now and is forecast pretty much for the rest of the month. So we'll see; I'd be happy to walk, and equally happy not to.I have a list of reasonable tasks to complete over the next ten days and am not going to stress or worry if not everything gets done. I need to go back to work clear-headed and ready to focus because things are changing again, and I need to organise my thoughts and procedures. I've stocked up on everything I think I need, so don't have to leave the flat unless I absolutely have to from today. I've made a minestrone soup and am planning some roasted veg & sausages later on, as I wanted to utilise my time a bit more to cook properly.So, Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Feliz Navidad, Buon Natale, Frohe Weihnachten, and Seasons Greetings to you in all your corners of the world!edie.net"},
{"title": "How are we already halfway through this year?!", "date": "Saturday 26 June 2021", "text": "inflexion-point.comIt must be all the changes that have gone on since January; that's the only explanation I can think of to how fast the last six months have gone! Phew!But here we are, summertime at last (well, England's version of it at least - warm and rainy). Restrictions are still in place to 19 July - 'restrictions' being mask-wearing and social distancing when inside, so mild at best. People still fuss. Anyhoo. We're getting there, and I think are just going to have to get used to living with variants. Mother Nature will always be several steps ahead of us, no matter how smart we think we are. We've unbalanced everything so shouldn't be surprised when nature fights back.Otherwise, all is still well. I've had zero side effects from my second jab (to the point where I've actually forgotten I've had it until reminded!), which is great. There's some noise about a potential booster for the autumn, but I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens with that.I'm down to 'fumes' in my account again, despite trying to work hard to not be. Payday is Tuesday, so I've had to 'borrow from Peter' again (not a CC this time!) to see me through, food-wise. That's okay, as I'm expecting a (modestly) hefty cheque then, so plan to replenish + some extra. I started using cash for groceries a couple of weeks ago, which worked reasonably well, but I still fell short. I *think* this may be because I scoop my change out and save it, rather than continuing to use all of it as designated funds. It means that my change bowl is looking much healthier than it has in quite a long time, but also means I'm short in my food budget...which means I'm borrowing from where I shouldn't.Perhaps if I only kept my silver, rather than my Â£1 & Â£2 coins? Hm. On the other hand, I DO redeposit my coins once I've got enough to do so, so it's not all bad, just means I'm not really paying attention as closely as I need to be. Anyway, something to bear in mind going forward.Work is fine. H has been coming in three days a week and mostly is just helping with the typing (which is fab!), but has also been taking the time to learn about what T & I do in our jobs. It's a lot to take on board and she's struggling a bit at the moment, but it's very early days yet and there's lots of time to get everything straight in her head. Plus, the more she does it, the better and easier it will get. She and I had a rather long chat a couple of weeks ago and I was relieved that all my concerns about T are actually spot on, and not just something in my head. Saying that, T does know her job well and is busy showing H all about it.Â I actually said 'no' to something the other day that she tried to get rid of. It's just little things like I've said before. She & I share taking the post to the post box at the end of the day. It's not an onerous job - not even a daily one anymore - and means we get to leave a few minutes early to make the collection time of 5:30. T joked that I'd have to do it all now because the car park where she now parks is the wrong way from the post office and she couldn't be bothered. I was tempted to say 'yes', because who doesn't like to leave the office a few minutes early, right? But, on the principle of it, I said that when I was driving I always parked where she now parks, and it was (usually) always me who ended up taking the post anyway. So, a roundabout 'no', but a 'no' nonetheless. It sounds SO petty when I write it out, but honestly. Just, no.Otherwise, H and I are on the same page about how things can work going forward. It's too early to put any nails in the proverbial coffin about things, but H's job description has a lot of stuff on it that's not necessarily onerous, regular or difficult (photocopying, for example, and typing reports, etc.). It's the few things that only P knows which will be probably the most difficult for her, but it's also a matter of finding her own way of doing it. P has a tendency to overcomplicate stuff and is a great fan of spreadsheets that don't make sense to anyone but her. Ha ha!Anyhoo. Work = people and all their quirks that you wouldn't necessarily see if you were 'only' friends, right? I've never won any 'employee of the month' awards and have done some Very Dumb Things, and it's not like I'm always easy to get on with. I certainly have my own way of doing things/expectations of how things should be done (after many years of not being a great employee). I just want things to be fair, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.Â My first volunteer shift at the cafe is 24 July and once a month through to September. I'll need a proper refresher, as I'm not sure how much I'll remember and things will have changed since last year, too, with all the precautions and changes to service. Still, it'll get me out of the house for a few hours and will be nice to see the manager again. Plus, it's a lovely village, and the pet food shop there sells fantastic bird feeders. I'm in the market for a couple more, so will try to stop in and have a look to see what they've got. There's also a great little charity shop, where I've found several fantastic things, and I've got a box of bits & pieces to get rid of (like everyone else, I'm sure).Next week I'm going to get some petrol for the car at long last. What remains of last October's petrol is old and needs a refresh. I might also take the car for a spin up the dual carriageway if it's quiet as it's been a few weeks since she's had a good run. She'll have a good, solid 2.5 hour run in mid-July, though, when I go to see my sister in Devon. Long overdue.One thing I'm bringing back from Devon is my bike, which will make my travel to/from the office about half of what it is now. :) I've got somewhere to keep it safe and dry at the farm, so will have to check where I can put it at the office, as there's no designated bike lockup. Anyhow, one thing at a time.On the reading front, I am finally at the end of my NetGalley review books (apart from a few that I've not, for some reason, yet read and which are at least a couple of years old in some instances). And, now I'm at a bit of a loss of what to read! I can read literally anything in my Kindle library or from my (limited) RL shelf, and I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT TO READ. This has never happened to me before. Ha ha! Guess that's the problem with having 900+ books to choose from: do I want to read about writing? Some non-fiction? Something light? Or something a bit darker and police procedural-ish? It's like having satellite TV...too much choice. Yeesh.First world problems, eh?I did write a fun thing for writing group last week. One of the members sent a photo as a prompt and while I sort of followed it as a prompt, it was actually the email it arrived in that was the actual prompt. Because she hadn't written anything along with the photo, my email read 'no body'. THAT turned into a few hundred words of a murder mystery that the rest of the group is using as a prompt for next week's meeting - how does the story end? I honestly don't know where it came from or how I'm going to resolve it, but it will be fun to try. I had a lot of fun writing it and had great feedback on it, so want to see if I can pick away at it a little bit and make it into something a bit meatier.Anyway, that's it from my corner of the world. I hope you're all well and safe and have a wonderful weekend!"},
{"title": "All jabbed up!", "date": "Sunday 13 June 2021", "text": "medicalbag.comHooray! I'm finally all done and feeling quite relieved about it. I took the bus to Salisbury yesterday for my second jab, and was in and out of the vaccine centre in about 10 mins or so; I was even early and as there was no lineup, there was no issue about going straight in. Plenty of people to help direct you where you needed to go, and it was super efficient. The only difference from last time (so far) is that there was actually quite a pinch when the needle went in. Otherwise, last night I slept 10 solid hours (!), which is unheard of.That, I think, is a combination of the heat (it was about 23C), the jab, and 'all the activity' I had in a day, which mainly meant being amongst more people than I've been around for more than a year. Exhausting! I've not been to Salisbury before, so did spend about an hour or so poking around afterward, but the longer I was there, the more I just wanted to go home. I have decided that it's going to be a 'destination visit' for me when I'm on holiday next month, as it's a beautiful city and there's so much to see. I was reconnoitering shoe shops, charity shops, etc., and I will aim to loosen the purse strings a bit next month and update a few bits & pieces.It sounds silly, but I fussed about what to wear. I ended up in jeans & a t-shirt, which is pretty standard for me, but part of my worry was that on Friday I was wearing shorts and found a tick on my upper thigh (somewhere you'd only discover during a trip to the bathroom, which is how I found it)!! EEEEEYYYEEEEWWWW!!!! It was a very tiny one, and I got it all out, but that's why I was worried. The walk to the bus stop is through, in some places, knee-high grass and I just didn't want to risk another tick. So, instead, I was just too hot...Anyway, it's all done and I know for next time. I'll probably wear a skirt, particularly as cities do tend to get hotter and risk the stupid ticks... cannot for the life of me figure out the purpose of ticks, despite knowing that everything has a place in nature. Gross.Anyhow. Today I woke up at 7, after going to bed and falling asleep before 9 last night. I am otherwise feeling fine and trying to decide what I want to do today. I'm content to stay inside, if I'm honest, and read, as it's much cooler in here. I've got all the windows open and am trying to decide what I want for lunch now. :)Â The bonus I got at my review will actually be on my paycheque at the end of the month (along with a 5-day 'bonus' of my new wage which took effect from the date of review), so nothing changes this month. So far, though, I've been doing well, and have everything covered to the end of the month. I'm being really strict with my food budget, but it somehow feels easier to do that in hot weather, because you don't want to eat heavy, meat-centred meals all the time.For the past couple of weeks, I've basically been eating a big salad (I'm boring and eat the same kind every time), plus some sort of protein and an apple mid-afternoon. I'm trying to keep everything reasonably simple. I don't like cooking anyway, so this is a pretty straightforward, tasty and healthy way to go about things. Plus, in the summer you just lean towards salads anyway, so it's not too big of a stretch. I'm still wasting an awful lot of food, though, despite my best intentions, so that's something I need to change.Otherwise, nothing too exciting this update. A lot of folks waiting to hear the G7 news re: travel, I imagine, but I don't think much is going to change. Not with our numbers increasing again with yet another variant. My new colleague, H, is desperate to get to the US to see her son & granddaughter this summer, but I'm not sure Biden is going to allow travel, not with having made so much progress in the right direction now. Plus, she'll have to spend 10 days in quarantine when she gets back, which she'll have to account for in her time away. She's not particularly hopeful about today (when Biden and Johnson have their confab) but will accept the result whatever happens. Obviously, if travel is given a green (even amber) light, then she'll go as soon as she can get everything organised. I'm resigned to visiting Canada next year, as I don't think I can this year anyway (think they're closed to outside travel?). Part of my plan for my RSP money next year is to get myself organised for that, as I need to get a new Canadian passport anyway, and I can't imagine flights are going to be cheap, etc.But that is not for now. Today I'm going to rest and read and just pay attention to how I'm feeling. I literally have zero to stress about, so am just going to enjoy my time. The bird feeder is full, the windows are open, the breeze is delightful and I've got 900+ books on my Kindle to choose from.Hope you are are well and safe and having a wonderful weekend."},
{"title": "A few budgeting thoughts...", "date": "Sunday 30 May 2021", "text": "thepsychologygroup.comSomething I didn't mention in my last post is that one of the reasons I'm *so* pleased with my bonus is that I've been rolling around the very slight possibility of having to ask my friend/ex-Roomie E to move back in with her. Things are tight and I've been struggling a bit to the point thatÂ I had to take a Â£100 cash advance from a CC to make to the end of May (I can hear the horrified gasps from here). Trust me, I know. I haven't done that since the '80s and was an even bigger idiot with money. While I'm glad I had the resource to hand, it's not ideal by any stretch.Saying that, however, I had a gander at my food budget last month and saw that I'd DOUBLED it (my monthly grocery budget, FYI, is Â£130). No wonder I'm feeling so squeezed! Geez.I don't want to move back in with anyone. I'm not kidding when I say that this place was meant to be (I legitimately said 'no' to it, and I still got it), so to give up because I can't, for some reason, stick to my own budget is admitting defeat to my lifetime of bad habits. I'm better than this, I just know it.Also, next year I turn 55. I can access my locked-in RSP in Canada, for better or worse. I had a plan to dip into my LOC (again - I'm still paying this off) and use the funds from that to cover/clear some payments, bolster a savings account or two, etc. Then, once I could access the RSP funds, I'd clear everything. Again. And start over. Again.But having had a chance to faff endlessly the past couple of days with my budget, now that I have an extra Â£800 (I took a couple of hundred for taxes, etc. for now) to work with, I now have a loose plan that does not involve dipping into my LOC.HOORAY!Basically, I'm not going to use it to throw at any one debt, but to help me to carry myself from month to month.This is my new June budget. This incorporates my current salary + overtime + bonus (selling surveys, not my review one).Â The Visa and Barclaycard payments are sort of 'one-offs', as I want to round down the balances.Any leftover each month will roll over to the following month.The numbers for July (new salary TBC, but I don't think I'm too far off with my current guess) are below because the flat deposit, Visa, Barclaycard and car categories will differ. I want the initial numbers to give me a good reboot on my savings. Obviously, some of the items are flexible.I recently also got a limit increase on my Barclaycard. This is the card that allows me to balance transfer for 0% interest.So. My plan, which if I'm very, very careful with and which will see me comfortably through to next year without touching my LOC (ideal), is as follows. It's a bit 'borrowing from Peter to pay Paul'-like, but gives me breathing room, plus increases a couple of payments a bit.Transfer my outstanding Visa balance to the Barclaycard. There is currently an offer that'll allow me to have 0% to 1 June 2023. I want to take advantage of this for that debt, and this is why the Visa line is blank in the July budget.You'll notice I've increased my food budget a bit as well. I will try to move to cash only for this, and stay out of Waitrose...!The Canadian debt amount will go up Â£30 and the Barclaycard Â£30 as I continue to pay over the minimum for those. The Lendable payments are fixed (I can pay more if I choose, however) and I'm happy leaving that alone for now. I've got two more years on that.Saying that, I can claw back overpayments a bit if I need to adjust elsewhere and eliminate the flat deposit option altogether.Currently, I pay Â£30 a month towards charity: cats, cancer and the RSPCA. The Post Code Lottery I joined on a bit of a whim, so not as invested in that as the others. But this is something I am able to continue to do for these charities, so all is staying as is.Those are more or less the changes I want to make at the moment. Then, everything that's left over at my birthday next year will get wiped clear when I cash out my RSP.While I'm able, I want to take advantage of not paying bills over and above my rent (which are all included). I won't be as lucky at the next place. Having debt in addition to paying all of that simply wouldn't be possible for me. Not that I have any plans to move (!!), it's just a reality that I need to bear in mind, and this seems like the best, most comfortable scenario for me.I resent having to pay so much for the car when I'm not really using it, but getting rid of it isn't an option, unfortunately. I simply can't get to all the places I want to go on the bus or train, and having a car is an expensive convenience. At least I'm not still paying Â£85 a month for petrol! I'm not quite at the of the tank I had when I moved in here in October - 8 months is a pretty decent run for a tank, eh? I'll have to fill up next month, however, as I'll likely be going to visit my sister in Devon.So just wanted to put this down 'on paper' while I thought about it, and so I have somewhere to be kept accountable. It seems a reasonable plan too, so fingers crossed!"},
{"title": "End of May - and sun. Finally!", "date": "Thursday 27 May 2021", "text": "medikeeper.comPretty much how everyone in the UK is feeling right about now, I think! May has been absolutely sodden: wind, rain, chilly weather. The heating has only just been turned down/off, and this weekend we are finally, FINALLY, getting sunshine and proper warm temperatures. Hooray! I opened all my windows early this morning so the place will have a lovely airing out.And, I'm off from today through Tuesday. I certainly timed that well, I have to say. I'm SO ready for a break and having some lovely weather to look forward to definitely helps.I don't have any particularly grand plans, although I've made a to-do list to clear up a few things that I put off during the week: a proper clean and tidy of the place being at the top of the list. I'll do this in stages over the next six days, but it'll feel good to finally get the windows done, the floors swept and vacuumed, the window sills wiped, cupboards cleaned, etc. I've got a colleague stopping by for tea and a walk later this afternoon, which will be nice, and am visiting with my cousin on Tuesday morning. There's a garden centre in her village so I'll pick up what I need to do some repotting. My poor plants are desperate for more breathing room; I'm years overdue for this, and it makes sense to do it while I've got the time and motivation. If another couple of plants happen to find their way into my basket, well, that's not something I can fight...I had my review on Monday afternoon. I always get nervous with these and of course, it's never bad (well, not so far!). Basically, I had an opportunity to vent (per last post) but opted to essentially say 'it's a work in progress', which, let's be honest, it is. There is alwaysÂ adjustment with new people starting and who would have thought to plan for working/hiring around a pandemic? It's just what it is, really. But, as I also said, it's not up to me to say whether or not T is happy in her job, or if it's what was expected, etc. That's up to her at her annual review.I also had a bit of a moan about the new surveyor (which, I think, they're mostly already aware of, too). It's mostly frustration that someone who is supposed to be a professional and have experience of this sort of thing has to be constantly chased and eats up a lot of admin time because of it. I used the words 'I'm not his wife or his mom'... ha ha! It just popped out, but it feels a bit like that. Stuff disappearing into a vortex and chasing, chasing, chasing to get it back. It's exhausting and annoying.Anyhow. It's a good thing I was sitting down because they surprised me with not only a pretty stonking raise (a hair over 10%) but also a Â£1,000 'bonus'! Holy cow!! Basically, it's to say 'thank you, sorry we're late with this, and we're very grateful you've stayed.' Wow. Totally unexpected, and I'm very, very pleased I can tell you. Of course, now I'm rolling all kinds of things around in my head with what I can do with my bonus when it should be a no-brainer: throw it on my debt! I only moan about it all the time. I'm taking a bit of it (say, Â£200) for me. I really want a massage, some new (thrift shop) duds, potting soil and pots, and maybe new shoes for walking to work. I'm going to sit on most of it for a bit and figure out the best place to put it. I can wipe out a credit card balance with it BUT will that save me the most in the long run, you know? Anyway. I don't want to rush into anything and will give myself some time to plot out a couple of options.My new, slightly higher paycheque will help too, as I can raise my monthly payments on everything to get on top of things faster. What a great surprise that was!I got out for a walk with my friend last Sunday - at last! - albeit a short one. We had a two-three hour window of reasonably clear weather, so we took a chance. We took a turn around the reserve, which is about two miles, and took us just under an hour. We hadn't planned on a proper hike, it was to catch up and clear our heads more than anything. It was great to finally see her. It meant, though, that I missed my writing group, which had moved from Saturday, so that was a shame. Our next walk (with three of us) is scheduled for 6 June and will be a longer one around the area, and I'm looking forward to it.I confirmed my week's holiday in mid-July too, so hopefully that will take in a visit with my sister in Devon. Otherwise, a week off is a week off! I took that week purposely as my boss has taken that week off and it means that it won't be quite so manic at work. It just made sense. So, that's something else to look forward to. :)Otherwise, I finally finished my Intro to Forensic Science course. Not entirely sure it was relevant to what I wanted, although it was pretty interesting and gives me an idea of some basic things to keep in mind when setting up a crime scene. I've not delved into the other three again (yet), but have plans to do so this weekend as well.Anyway, that's more or less it from me again. Hope you are well and safe out there!"},
{"title": "Mid-May update (and a bit of a moan)", "date": "Saturday 15 May 2021", "text": "elevate-church.co.ukMid-May already! Is it just me or is the passing of the year speeding up? I suppose it doesn't help that we're still so busy at work that I've done overtime the past two weekends (not as much as last month, but still!) and many of our survey appointments are teetering dangerously close to JULY now. We've also had to put a hold - twice in two weeks - on receiving any new work, outside of private jobs, from panel managers as my colleague couldn't keep up with booking the appointments! We're always looking ahead, it seems.Anyway, it's good for business and the push is on now, as the stamp duty for properties up to Â£500k comes to an end at the end of June and everyone needs their surveys 'today'. We've had a number of cancellations because people want/need it completed faster than we can do it. We can always fill the space but it's a larger number than normal, simply because of the pressure of the market. The next relief falls to properties up to Â£250k, through September. There'll be a lot of flats, I imagine. After that, furlough comes to an end, stamp duty comes to an end, and I think the work will become more manageable.I have my work review on 24 May. I'm going to ask if I can adjust my working hours a bit from 9:00-5:30 to 8:30-5:00. I've been getting there for 8:00 since February, so it's not a big stretch. I feel that, as one of the office 'elders', I should be allowed some consideration, particularly as there are now two of us who work until 5:30.Our office manager (P) is back in the office two days a week now but is retiring in September. We've hired someone to take her place (H), but it's a bit complicated as H is off to the US to see her son in June for several months. H is coming in a couple of times a week to train with P until she leaves, then once H is back, she'll be coming in more regularly until P leaves for good. So many changes!Adjustment is ongoing with my colleague (T). Things have been better, but there are still questions (why this/that/the other, etc.) and there was a discussion the other day with the accountant about her role and admin generally. In a company with 500 employees, it's going to entail different things than in a company with less than 10, just like it's going to entail different things in every single office you work in. A lot of what you do depends on how the office runs, their guidelines, policies and procedures, so you have to be flexible and be prepared to work differently than you have previously. Adapt to your environment, not the other way around. 'Administrator' in our office encompasses a grey area - it's both reasonably specific and whatever is asked of you, really, and with only three of us, surely it means helping each other where you're able and pitching in to get stuff done, rather than moaning about it? Part of me admires T for setting strong boundaries and being confident enough to do so, but at the same time, I'm getting incrementally more work because she keeps questioning how is one person expected to do 'so much' and then little suggestions are made that suddenly add to my workload and make it easier to do hers. How P doesn't understand how busy she is. ð She doesn't know that I've taken on doing part of her job already. I'm not bothered by it, as it actually helps me get organised for the day. But as and when I'm on holiday for any length of time once P leaves, there's going to be some hard, sharp learning curves.I don't have any more time in my day than she does, and I'm the one who's been doing overtime so that we can stay on top of the typing (perfectly aware this is my choice). P is typing even on her days off, so not feeling any sympathy.The problem stems, I think, from the fact that she says she didn't get a job description. I'm not sure I got one either if I'm honest (don't actually remember). Also, when she was trained, she wasn't told about all the stuff that she's (apparently) supposed to do, nor, she says, was she told about it all in the interview. I don't know. There was supposed to be a job description written up, but it didn't get done (no surprise). And that's her area of questions.Â She feels she's being taken advantage of.Â But if there are questions/concerns/etc., about what she believes/feels she was hired to do, I'm not the right person to speak with. She needs to discuss her concerns with the people who hired her - the MDs. Certainly, Mrs MD will have no qualms about reviewing the interview with her and what was said during it.We're unprecedentedly busy. But, it will slow down and be easier to manage. When it was mentioned that it's been so quiet in the past that there have been days when no work at all came in, there was a moan about that. Apparently, there's no win!The accountant, after the administrator discussion, regretted engaging. 'If she doesn't like it, she can find another job,' she muttered. This from a straight-talking Northerner!Yikes! Obviously a much-needed vent. Sorry!!On a lighter note, I enjoyed the Welsh Crime Festival very much. So much, in fact, that I'd like to go next year. Aberystwyth is a town I've wanted to visit since Hinterland (a point noted in the opening ad), so I think the opportunity to visit/attend the 2022 Festival and see the town is something I need to plan for. I've already had a brief, post-festival chat with my sister about it so we'll see where it goes. Five days in Wales would be lovely and something to really look forward to (assuming it doesn't rain. Ha ha!).Along with my Intro to Forensic Science course, I registered for four others: BBC Good Food 'Learn How to Bake', Forensic Psychology (witness interviewing, etc.), Start Writing Fiction and a Mindfulness course which starts at the end of May. Phew! Feeling like I may have taken on a bit too much, seeing as I've already fallen behind in the Intro to Forensic Science course. Oh, well. I've got this weekend to dip into it and try to get caught up. I'm not sure it's all relevant, but it IS interesting and will help me to be able to paint a slightly more realistic forensic picture in my book - I hope!The BBC baking course is like a mini-Bake Off. It's pretty basic, but you learn about baking processes, ingredients, tools, etc., i.e., salted v. unsalted butter, baking soda v. bicarbonate of soda, different baking tins, the process of baking powder v baking soda on a cake, etc. Good stuff! A Victoria sponge was the first item we made (mine was reasonably successful). We're also learning to make bread, brownies, shortcrust pastry and meringues. Yum!I haven't yet started the writing course or the Forensic Psychology course, but need to start making some inroads before they become inaccessible (I don't reallyÂ want to pay to continue access). Anyway, one lesson at a time and I will do what I can.Tomorrow I'm supposed to be going on a walk with a friend, but the weather for the weekend is rain. It's supposed to have been raining all week, but we never got the forecast weather. We're forecase the same all next week. It's not especially nice to walk in the rain, but if it's just around the reserve it might not be too bad. All just a big 'wait and see'.I took a bit of holiday around the bank holiday on 31 May and I'm hoping to see my cousin and Roomie E. Loose plans at this point. It will be nice to catch up. Hoping the weather will be nicer as well so we can get outside.I've also pencilled a week off in July to visit with my sister. I suggested some time down there and then she can come here for a few days. She's got a housesit booked for July so is waiting to confirm dates, but I'm reasonably flexible. Will just be nice to have a good length of time off. Plus, I need to get the car out for a good, proper run (three hours on a dual carriageway should do it) and collect some things of mine that she has - my bike and my camp bed (which she'll need for her stay here). She's also got a set of dishes that she's giving me, so it's a trip I needed to do anyway.Hospitality reopens on Monday - hotels, B&Bs, etc. - and indoor dining can begin again. I think hugs are also officially allowed again too. Hooray!I was asked if I was able to start volunteering again at the coffee shop. I think it's been almost two years since I gave it up 'temporarily', but I had said that I would start again eventually. I don't have the 'excuse' of the shop anymore (I stepped back because it was getting to be too much to do both in one day)Â  but I always enjoyed it when I was there. My short answer was 'yes', but only once I've had both my jabs - second due 12 June - and that because our writing group is currently bi-weekly, I would have to send some available dates (Saturdays). That seems to be fine, so I will send available dates starting in July. I like to work up to these things! Ha ha!Still rolling the thought of erasing/halving my debt around in my head. It's pride that's keeping me from making the decision to take that first step. It's hard to admit you're struggling and need help, especially financially. I keep rolling it around in my head and thinking I can manage - just 11 more months until I can cash out my RSP in Canada, but then I realise that we're only halfway through this month and despite a bigger paycheque last month, I only have Â£30 left for groceries for the next two weeks. The rest is earmarked for debt. I'm hoping to see my accountant colleague for tea and a walk around the reserve while I'm off at the end of May. She's eminently sensible and always has good advice about stuff. I have mentioned it to her, and how I'm struggling, and she said it's definitely something I should do. I just need to decide...Anyhow. That's it for me this go round. I hope you're all well and safe and having a great weekend!"},
{"title": "(Nearly) spring update", "date": "Saturday 17 April 2021", "text": "elliswhittam.comMid-April (already), the weather is glorious, if still on the cool side, and it's been a very busy week and a half.After my extra-long Easter weekend, I did some overtime last weekend. I've always said that I'm willing to do it, so I was happy to finally get some - it's just that I'm no longer the age where my body is so glad of it! Ha ha! It doesn't come on offer very often - this is, in fact, only my second time doing it in five years - and I put in 16.5 hours! We were falling behind on our report typing so I hammered out six or seven reports, including one that took me about 4.5 hours to type (house worth Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£Â£ in London). I got a few other bits & pieces sorted out as well, so it was well worth it. Feeling less stressed now, although I'm POOPED! Friday couldn't come quick enough and it felt like three days in one with all that was happening. What a very weird day it was.It means, though, that I've got a chunk of overtime pay coming to me at the end of the month, which I'm pleased about, and I'll put a little extra towards my debt. I'm not feeling quite as pressured about it all at the moment for some reason. Stressing about it doesn't help it get paid any faster and just makes things much grimmer than they are. Slow and steady is the only way I can do it, although I *am* doing some research into ways of writing it off or at least reducing payments. There are options out there, I'm just torn about it all as it would ruin a credit rating I've worked really hard for. And, as it's all my own fault, I feel a sense of responsibility to get it sorted the same way. You know? It's something I've been rolling around in my mind for a long time - have even gone to see someone already about it, and is something I keep coming back to. The psychic advised (I asked specifically about money) to take an option of writing some off if given the opportunity, so that lined up nicely. She said - which makes a lot of sense - that the Government is going to have to do something because once furlough ends in September, there will be a LOT of people who have incurred incredible debt who are going to need help with it. That much collective debt can seriously damage a country's economy, so they'll have to offer something.Anyhow. I added up my debt the other day and was surprised, and rather pleased, to see it wasn't as much as I thought, which is good, although it's still more than I'd like. The slow and steady approach is good, it's just...slow.To that end, I have also chased a review at work. I wasn't going to be narky about it this year simply because last year was so weird, but because things have changed at work I feel I need one (and deserve one), so I asked. No set date, just when there's time. So, that's something at least.I signed up for a free online forensic course through the University of Strathclyde. I've done a genealogy course through them as well, which was excellent. I thought this might help with my writing. If I can figure out HOW a crime is solved via forensics (obviously, the course is basic and we don't get the magic of the background scientific work to work with), then perhaps I can build a crime working with those aspects. It's a six-week course, released one week at a time. Last week, week one, was the foundations of the course, what we could expect and reviewing a crime scene that is the basis for the course. We'll be building on that as we go, taking each part of the process bit by bit to see how it all works together. It's so interesting! Week Two is on my to do list for this weekend.I've also registered for about a million talks at the Welsh Crime Festival. The first official one is planned for next year in Aberystwyth, but they've gone online this year as a precursor to that. Lots of discussions about writing and ideas and finding your voice, etc. Fantastic - and entirely free. So, honestly, have signed up for most of the talks (I think 15 out of 18 - and I might just go back and join the rest!). My evenings from 22 April are going to be busy! :)I was awake early (not unusually) this morning and by 8:00 had already done my laundry and had a cheesecake in the oven! Today is a beautiful day, but I really just need to spend some time here and get some rest and a few things done around the flat. Tomorrow is more of the same, weather-wise, and I'm going to take myself for a nice walk at the reserve. I'll cobble together a lunch and take myself out for a couple of hours.All our 'non-essential' stuff re-opened on Monday and it's been like kids in a candy store. Absolute madness. Not necessarily a bad thing, but nothing will really change for me. The holiday let portion of the B&B is back open and already busy, pubs, bars, restaurants, charity shops, hairdressers and barbers, etc. I'm glad for them, this last lockdown was a tough one - felt like it lasted forever.Â Here's our current guide:Business and activitiesStep 2, which will be no earlier than 12 April, will see the opening of non-essential retail; personal care premises such as hairdressers and nail salons; and public buildings, including libraries and community centres. Indoor leisure facilities such as gyms will also reopen (but only for use by people on their own or in household groups); as will most outdoor attractions and settings including outdoor hospitality venues, zoos, theme parks, and drive-in cinemas. Self-contained accommodation such as campsites and holiday lets, where indoor facilities are not shared with other households, can also reopen.Hospitality venues will be allowed to serve people outdoors at Step 2 and there will be no need for customers to order a substantial meal with alcoholic drinks and no curfew, although customers must order, eat and drink while seated (âtable serviceâ). Wider social contact rules will apply in all these settings to prevent indoor mixing between different households.EventsWhile funerals can continue with up to 30 mourners, the number of people able to attend weddings, receptions and commemorative events such as wakes will rise to 15.Next step is 17 May.And then, assuming all goes well, we're back to 'full normal' from 12 June. My colleague says she's pretty sure we'll be back in lockdown again come autumn, and I agree, but at least we can maybe have a good summer. Optimistic, or what? Ha ha!Really, the Government is damned if they do, damned if they don't. I'm marginally more optimistic with this new 'slow release' plan, but I still maintain that shops and pubs and restaurants and every place where people gather in crowds can put every single possible measure - and more! - in place to make/keep their staff and patrons as safe as possible, but if people don't give a shit and don't want to follow the rules, then THAT IS THE REASON WE'RE STILL HERE. Businesses can only do so much. Pubs were already in trouble, and this past year has been particularly devastating to the industry. There are plenty that simply won't have been able to make it, along with many, many other businesses - some of our big High Street names, a few of which were in trouble prior to the pandemic, have had this underscore their issues and they've closed their doors or some of their shops. I'm not surprised that pubs and hairdressers were full to bursting on Monday. It's actually quite nice to see life back to relatively normal, although we still have a little way to go yet. I've been far from perfect, but I'm looking forward to getting back into the charity shops for sure.It's affected me differently because I've only really had one lockdown - I've been working since last July and have effectively missed the last two. I've been 'back to normal' a lot longer than most, so nothing will change for me, even with more things reopening. My colleague is astounded by that - she's already got plans to eat out, go places, see people, do stuff, get her hair done, get her nails done, etc. There are almost 25 years between us, however, so our normals are already very different! I'm very much a homebody generally, and only eat out when I meet up with my cousin or something. I'm looking forward to at last getting together with friends for our monthly walks, though.Anyhow. Here we still are to a degree. But at least the weather is good again - that, I'm sure, is why the last lockdown felt harder, dreary winter weather - and we can get outside more easily. People are feeling better too now, with things open and the sun out, even if it is still relatively cool. That helps a lot.I hope you're all as well as you can be under our various circumstances and can have a restful and enjoyable weekend. x"},
{"title": "Easter laziness", "date": "Monday 5 April 2021", "text": "HAPPY EASTER!It's been, so far, an excellent weekend for the most part. I had a somewhat stressful day on Thursday, worryingÂ about the chat the office manager was aiming to have with my colleague and texted her to find out how things went. She came back to me later to say not to worry because it hadn't been a day especially conducive to chats. Phew! I imagine she'll try to have a chat tomorrow instead when there isn't anyone else in the office. Hopefully, all will go well.The weather was glorious so I sat in the reserve reading for a couple of hours until my friend came to collect the lamb and a couple of other things necessary for yesterday's meal. He was on his way home from 10 days working in Essex and detoured here for an hour. It was good to catch up as I hadn't seen him since Christmas.On Friday, my birthday, the weather again was beautiful and while I wanted to be outside, I didn't want to walk, so I took myself to the closest shop, bought a picnic of sorts, and headed back to the reserve where I spent most of the afternoon reading. I initially couldn't figure out why it was so busy (comparatively), then of course remembered that it was a holiday, the good weather driving folks outside now that restrictions have eased a little. I didn't have to go far to find a bench to sit on. There's one not far inside the reserve, a little way down the 'wrong way' path (the reserve is open and has set up a system of one way routes). I can set myself up and hardly see anyone. There were loads of birds around, too, so it was the perfect relaxing spot.Saturday I met up with my cousin for a walk and a birthday lunch. We took her dog, Bonnie, off to the forest and spent over an hour getting caught up and getting in a decent walk at the same time. Cows and ponies aplenty, as well as others out getting some proper exercise. The weather was cooler than I had anticipated, so it was good to get back to her place although her boiler isn't working so it wasn't a whole lot warmer there either! Ha ha! She'd made a Moroccan Tagine which was delicious. I've never had one before, but it's super easy to make and is something I need to add to my recipe cache for cooler weather.I finally posted a parcel to my sister too, that I've had hanging around for a few months (because I can't be bothered to go to the post office...). I posted it at the village post office near my cousin's house. It's nothing too exciting - a blanket and my knitting bag/bits that I don't use and are just taking up space here. My sister said she'd take them off my hands, so it was just getting around to posting them that was delaying everything. It's good to have done it and have three fewer things cluttering my flat.I'm probably not the only person who's been decluttering during lockdown. I imagine, much like last time, the charity shops will be overrun with things. Some of them had requested appointments be made for donation offerings and I imagine it will be much the same this time. I know I've got a box and a couple of bags of things to get rid of. Not sure what they're doing about books - many were not taking these - so will have to see. Maybe there are some options online to get rid of them. It's part of the reason I don't buy books anymore and just read on my Kindle. Some libraries aren't taking donations anymore, and the thrift shops are regularly overwhelmed with them. Anyway, only a few more days until re-opening and I'll get an appointment if I need to. I'm getting desperate for some new duds, too, so keen to have the thrift shops open again!Yesterday's lunch was excellent. There was aperitifs, lamb, salmon (for me), a beef broth with homemade tortellini, salad, lentils, roast potatoes, cabbage, wine and lemon mousse cake. The five of us did very well to get through a sizeable portion of it over about three hours. I had my usual 'inch' of wine to start and that was it for me. It was a dry white wine, quite lovely, and now that I'm thinking about it, I'm not actually sure I even finished it! Ha ha! I remember putting the glass on the window sill behind me and then simply forgot about it.The cake I made was a hit - a lemon mousse cake. I've never made one before, never mind just a mousse, and wasn't sure it would work, as when I took it out of the tin in the morning it started to 'melt' a little so had to put it back in (!). It went into my friend's freezer for an hour or so when I arrived for the meal, then into the fridge for a couple of hours after that. That seems to have worked as, while it was a bit softer than it was supposed to be (a volume issue, I think), it hung together well and was quite delicious, although sweeter than I was anticipating. One of the guests had two pieces and is apparently still talking about it this morning, so I'm pleased it worked out so well. Fortunately, there are some leftovers in my friend's fridge so he's welcome to them.The warm temperatures of last week have halved today, and it's cool and cloudy. I'm not sure what I'm feeling like doing and how motivated I am to do it.Â  Reading, probably, now that I'm fully re-engaged with it. I finished reading a book this morning - the Dales Detective Series, by Julia Chapman, if you're interested - and now have to wait another year for the next one. It's one of my favourite series and the biggest annoyance is that it takes so long to write! Ha ha! Characters, story, plot, and multiple threads of intrigue, mystery, romance and glorious descriptions of the Yorkshire Dales.I've whizzed through a decent number of books in the past couple of weeks (you can see them there on the right-->), some good, some not as good. I'm trying to read more non-fiction, but I don't always get it right. Obviously reading is subjective (writing is an art form after all), and not everyone will agree with my assessments, but I still have a long list of reviews to get done this year. I'm not one, however, to keep reading something that I'm not enjoying - life is too short for that. I used to, but now it's simply not worth it, not when there's so much that I really want to read. I've sadly given up on about four books already this year, while others have surprised me.I hope you're all enjoying your long weekend as much as you can."},
{"title": "Taking a little break... :)", "date": "Thursday 1 April 2021", "text": "Happy April all! No, not taking a(nother) break from blogging; I have a few days off work. Obviously, part of it is the Easter holidays, but I've got today and Tuesday off around that as well. I'm really feeling I need a good rest, and this worked out well, seeing as tomorrow is my birthday anyway. The holiday gods organised that nicely! :)I've not been sleeping especially well the past couple of weeks, and work has been a bit of a roller coaster so I've got very little motivation to do much of anything, although feel I need to be reasonably productive as there are still things I have to do. I'm going to see my cousin for a walk and a birthday lunch on Saturday, then have an Easter/birthday lunch on Sunday... and that's it! I need to do a grocery shop in there somewhere too as I'm making something for Sunday (thinking along the lines of a lemon mousse cake). There's going to be five of us. We're having an Italian Columba cake for dessert (hooray!), and there will be plenty of wine and food.I've registered for a number of online writing retreats and festival discussions this month. There's a new Welsh Crime Writers' Festival, and as this is their first year, and it's an unusual one, they're offering loads of talks and discussions online for FREE! So I registered for most of them the last week of April through to May 3. I've also registered for an online writing retreat via The Guardian's Masterclass offerings, 'Finding Your Voice', which is hosted by Kate Moss, Abi Dare, and Kishani Widyaratna. It was only Â£32 and sounds fantastic. I attended Sleurthfest two weeks ago - my first online conference of any kind - and got a lot of great information from it. They had an exceptionally scaled-back version of the annual conference, with only about seven talks compared to a number of normally about 40 talks, presentations, discussions, booths, etc., so for what it was, I enjoyed it. Some of it didn't apply - the marketing of your published book, for example - but I got a lot out of the editor/agent query letter and synopsis talk, as well as the Clues and Misdirection talk, which is why I originally signed up.If I'm not actually writing, gathering information and ideas is still part of the process, so I'm pleased I'm at least making a more concerted effort around it. It's easy enough to sit and listen to someone talk, take notes and process. And there is always, always, something to learn, or that might give you that little spark of inspiration you need to get started again.Work is beginning to get to me a bit. My new colleague is lovely, sweet and funny, but I'm not sure I have an emotional and empathetic/sympathetic well deep enough to continuously prop her up and calm her anxiety. Actually, scratch that: I know I don't. She came back on Tuesday from a couple of days off and was so upset to find emails and work to do she was crying (I cover her job while she's gone, but I focus on the priority stuff - getting jobs booked, etc. - and will leave some of the less urgent items for her. This is a carryover from my previous colleague). I got the impression that she seemed to think that because there were jobs waiting to be booked, I was apparently NOT doing her job. Never mind that on Friday I cleared up what she hadn't completed to that point, booked the jobs that came in on Friday and then cleared/changed/booked jobs on Monday. I couldn't get to everything, so I left what was left for her return. About 10 jobs?I think it boiled down to a mixture of her assumptions that everything would be cleared and she'd start with a folder empty of jobs - I can do nothing about her personal email inbox - and me perhaps saying 'I cover your job' without being specific. I don't know. Anyway... I tried to explain things as best I could, then took about three hours to help clear stuff up, which took time away from things I needed to do...Should I have helped? There are actually two answers.Yes, because otherwise it wouldn't get done. She struggles to get all the jobs booked over the course of a week. She's painfully slow because she's so focussed on not making a mistake, they start to pile up, she gets stressed and frustrated, people start calling to chase booking dates, her anxiety increases and I have to soothe and support and then I help because otherwise it wouldn't get done...AndNo, because it's not my job. All this is taking time away from work I need to complete, leaves the office manager literally typing reports all day and taking time away from tasks she also needs to complete, leaves the accountant having to do filing that isn't her responsibility and taking time away from what she needs to do. Realistically, as the accountant says, let her get on with it and deal with the consequences.To be fair, it is reasonably busy. People are anxious to get surveys booked with the clock winding down on the stamp duty holiday, which ends in June, and it can feel relentless. I understand that. Our surveyors are struggling to keep up, our booking dates are sitting at a minimum three weeks ahead, we have a new surveyor who's just started and finding his feet, and we're all feeling the pressure. It's not where we were six months ago - or even three months ago - but it can be pretty overwhelming. So, it's not that I don't have sympathy for her. I do, and we're still in a weird time where there's no full complement of staff in the office. The office manager is in today, though, and is going to have a chat with her about...stuff...and I hope everything (at least as much as possible) is sorted out. I commend her for not wanting to feel taken advantage of, nobody should feel that, but at the same time, she needs to recognise how it's affecting the rest of us. I think a lot of it goes back to the (lack of) training she had. If I or the office manager had been able to at least be there while it was happening, I think things might be a bit different. I have said this to her.She has also had no previous experience with surveying and starting a new job is always a struggle for a little while. It's a very big learning curve, so I'm trying to be as supportive and helpful as I can.Anyway. I'm complaining too much - I've never won an employee of the month prize, and know I have a tendency to slack off if given the opportunity. Perhaps this is payback. I'm just frustrated because I want her to succeed and be happy but right now it's very uncertain. She has her three-month review at the end of next week, so I guess we'll see how it goes. If she's unhappy, she needs to say so. If she's feeling taken advantage of, she needs to say so. Ultimately, I feel it's entirely her decision whether she stays or not.I had a blog writing trial with the proofreading company which I thought might work into some part-time income but unfortunately wasn't successful. I was initially disappointed, as I thought it would have been a nice part-time gig, but after a little thought, I realised that I would have been quite resentful of the time needed to focus on it and that it wasn't quite my niche. So, I'm okay with that.I had my first vaccine jab last week and it went very well. Quick and painless. I was very tired the next day, but otherwise, I've been fine apart from a tender arm. They were super efficient too, and the whole process took less than 10 minutes from arrival to departure.My full bloodwork got done the week before that and my chat with the nephrologist the following Tuesday was very positive. Everything is right where it should be: cholesterol is spot on, all the numbers and whatever else they needed to see is excellent, so I'm very relieved. It means only an annual check to monitor things now, and she said to just keep doing what I'm doing (mind the salt!) as it was all looking good. I did tell her that I get quite fatigued and have taken to taking an OTC iron pill (14mg = 100% daily iron requirement) and she was fine with that. And yesterday I had a health check with my new surgery which, I didn't realise, was to do an intake to see what sort of health issues might need to be ascertained. Whoops! Apparently, because I'm already aware of specific issues and on it, it was a bit of a waste of time, although I now know my blood pressure (low) and they have some notes on my file. Hopefully, all the bloodwork information will arrive soon and they'll have all the information they need.Otherwise, have polished off two more books and am most of the way through a third. Hoping to clear at least one or two more this weekend. The weather is slated to be warm, so maybe the best place to read will be the reserve. That would be a treat!Have a safe and enjoyable Easter weekend!"},
{"title": "The end of March is nigh", "date": "Sunday 21 March 2021", "text": "So, when did that happen? We're crawling towards the proverbial light at the end of the proverbial tunnel as Lockdown Exit 3.1.1 inches closer. Schools have gone back already, and each stage appears to be in bi-weekly steps, which is quite sensible, seeing as we're moving forward with the vaccinations quite well.Â I have my first vaccine jab booked for 27 March, the second for 12 June.What have I been doing otherwise?Â I had the onboarding session with the proofreading/editing company I took my course through, but have yet to find any jobs on the portal. Because we're currently limited to a max of 750 words while we get our editing feet under us, there's not a lot of work in that range available, and quite a number of new people who are likely all in the same place as me. I think part of the problem for me is that I'm only really available on weekends, but I do check during the week on occasion and have only seen one item - which was due three hours from when I saw it! Yikes! Not enough time for me to proof as a newbie.They have since approached all editors with an opportunity to write for their blog (two posts per week), so I've thrown my hat into that ring and we'll see what happens there. If you get on board with them, it's a great fee so would be really worthwhile. All I can do is try, right?I rearranged my flat last week. For some reason (spring?) I was itching to do it, so cleared it with my landlady (watch the floors!), and off I went. Two hours later, I had changed a few things around and it feels SO much better in here, bigger somehow. I took down a wardrobe in the bedroom, too, and moved my plants to the living room. It now feels more open and fresh. Much better. Helped a little, of course, by the sweeping and tidying I did as I went along.I've been reading again! Quite a lot. I struggled with this for a couple of years and it's been so frustrating. I love to read (L.O.V.E.) and while my TBR pile and choice of reading material isn't the latest high-brow, literary, or award-winning type stuff, it's meant I can get back to do something that gives me great pleasure, no matter what I'm reading. To that end, I've veritably 'whizzed' through 14 books since January. Compared to last year's total 23 books, I'm definitely on a roll which I hope continues.My new colleague is settling in slowly, which is good. We had a new surveyor start and then abruptly leave only a week later (a record, I think), but already have a new one replacing him next week! I'm adjusting to a somewhat new role (although not officially) and trying to keep my personal feelings about the situation within that to a minimum. They're rattling around in my head regardless, but it's because I know something I'm not supposed to, and there's nothing to be done about it at the moment.I registered for an online writer's convention this weekend - Sleuthfest - out of Florida. It was only $20 and has been quite good. Considering it's my first ever writer's convention, I guess it's what I was expecting, but also not what I was expecting. Ha ha! Sort of like my very first glimpse of Stonehenge on the Salisbury Plain, way back in 1996 (?): 'What, that's it?' (It's changed A LOT since then, and not necessarily in a good way).It's hard to explain, but it's exceptionally truncated: only six or seven forums, as opposed to more than 40 (from what I understand) that would be there in Normal Times, so I guess the main thing is at least it's going ahead and the organisers are doing it as best they can under the circumstances. I'd never heard of it before (no surprise), but thought it might be worthwhile. And the talk I 'attended' last night was very interesting, 'Clues & Misdirection'. I made lots of notes! :DI've got a couple of days holiday coming up around the long Easter weekend. It's my birthday on Good Friday, so took 1 & 6 April as holiday days, so I could have a proper long weekend. I'm going to have an Easter/birthday lunch with my friends at the old address which I'm really looking forward to. They're having lamb. I don't eat lamb, so I'll have to get something else.I had some bloodwork done on Friday (long overdue - me not being organised) and have a telephone appointment with a nephrologist on Tuesday to see how things look. I'm feeling reasonably good lately - stopped eating so much bread. What a difference (sadly)! - so hopefully everything looks okay from their end. I took the bus down to the hospital, and six vials of blood and a urine sample later I was all done. I was back in the office just over an hour after I left. Not bad!Yesterday, I had an online reading with a psychic I've seen before. My new colleague's mum is her best friend (!) so put in a word, and I got a slot yesterday because she'd had a cancellation. Lucky me! This lady has a HUGE waiting list. I saw her a couple of years ago and was really impressed. Yesterday's reading was excellent - several things cropped up that were the same/similar to my last reading with her, which I thought was interesting - and I'm feeling quite positive and pleased with it all. The underlying message is to take things slowly this year. This is already something I've been told to do, so that was interesting. Whether you're a believer or not, sometimes it's just nice to have some confirmation that you're on the right path, you know?I'm still walking to work every day. According to my pedometer app, I've now walked 450 miles - Boston to Philly - so that's quite an accomplishment I'd say! I average about 6,000 steps per day, which is still a bit less than I'd like, but I'm consistent, which I think is the key right now, and I'm hoping to head into the reserve in the evenings, once it stays light later. It's a half-hour walk around the 'short' route, and that's sufficient before or after dinner.Otherwise, my immediate future plans include such exciting things as repotting all my plants, something which is DESPERATELY overdue, weeding (more) stuff out of the flat for either selling or donating, buying another bird feeder, possibly going to see my sister in Devon at some point, and making - again - serious adjustments to both my eating and spending habits. The food thing cropped up in yesterday's reading, as it did two years ago, so it's obviously something I need to take to heart.So that's about it from my little corner of the Kingdom. I hope this finds you well & safe where you are!"},

And it's definitely me, not you because others are able."},
{"title": "February notes", "date": "Sunday 7 February 2021", "text": "I was awake at stupid o'clock this morning and I've spent the morning, so far at least, on a number of things, including scrolling Twitter (I'm not even ON Twitter) to see how the arrests post-insurrection are going. One by one, they're getting there, and are now at 200 arrests. Plenty more to come, I imagine (I hope!). Following that is pointless, but somewhat fun.Probably not the way any of us expected to start the new year, eh?But I really do need to give up the mindless, time-killing scrolling. I moan about 'not having the time to ________', yet can somehow magic away two, three, four hours doing nothing of value like that. I know it's a carryover from last year when scrolling FB and Twitter were ... 'lifesavers' is a heck of a stretch, so 'sanity savers'? No, not even that. Useful distractions. That's probably the most accurate.But now, being a year into this pandemic, understanding (more or less) what we need to do to stay as well as we can, and making such an enormous life change for myself, I have to start picking away at the things that no longer work to keep me well - mentally, physically, emotionally, etc. Being constantly on my phone is definitely one of them. My sister now logs off her electronics at 8pm each night and doesn't come back on until 8am. This is an easy thing to do for the most part. I can shut my phone off without too much of an issue. I can turn off my streaming at 8pm, but because I then read, and all of my reading is now via the Kindle app on my iPad, I can't completely shut down. But I can definitely limit phone usage and streaming on the iPad.So. Done.I've also rejigged my budget, paid a bit towards two credit cards and set up a payday payment on one of them, cancelled a direct debit I no longer need and adjusted another one, as well as transferring some money to Canada for my LOC payments. Oh, and once again I've taken a payment card off my Amazon account. Honestly. Am I going to read almost 1,000 books? ðð Eventually, perhaps, but it's this little frittering away of 99p here, and 99p there that's part of the overall problem.Also noted that one CC min payment has increased Â£27 (!!) from this month, the LOC has gone down a bit, but the others remain more or less steady. I'm generally pleased with the slow and steady progress but unhappy with how much I still owe overall. Quite ridiculous, really, but I can only make one payment at a time. I'll be 55 next year and able to cash out (what's left of) my RSP. I don't want to use it all to pay off debt which is why I want to focus this year on the steady downward push of that. I know some will end up going there, but I'd like that to be as little as possible.At the moment I've got veggies boiling for a minestrone (should have been done LAST week when the veg was fresh, but the soup is a good use for soft veg), and will be making a cassoulet in the Instant Pot later on. I'm trying Toulouse sausages in that this week (garlic and parsley). Along with a couple of chicken kievs from the butcher, I'm set for meals for this week.Overall, January was quite good. I passed my course with 80%, which is the minimum pass rate, but queried a point that I'd had deducted and wound up with 82% instead! Very pleased about that. So, now I'm registered for a group onboarding session on 22 Feb to go over the program that the company uses for editing/proofreading, get some questions answered, expectations, etc. After that, I can actually start taking on paid work. I start at 500 words and as my work is assessed, they will either move me up a level or say 'thanks, but no thanks'. I'm hoping it's the former, as I know I just need some practical work to make all the information make sense in my head.One of my colleagues retired on 29 January. She's been with the company for about ten years, and I've worked with her for five. The young lady who replaced her started early in January and had three weeks' training with her, which went okay. There's a lot she doesn't know and she's slow (obviously), but it's absolutely fine. She'll get there. It means I'm doing more work, but work has tapered off slightly right now, so it's manageable between us, and we've made it through our first week without too much difficulty. She doesn't work at breakneck speed like my old colleague, which is great, as it means far fewer mistakes.Last weekend was also the RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. This is my first time doing it, and it only entailed one hour of birdwatching in your garden. I didn't see many, a few blue tits, but it was fun, and this morning I saw a long-tailed tit at the feeder! What a beauty!ebird.orgHe hung upside down at the feeder with one foot and nibbled at a seed he was holding in the other.I also reconnected with a friend in Germany. We'd lost touch a few years ago, but a couple of weeks ago I got an email out of the blue from her! I'd been thinking of her and lamenting only the week before how sad it was that we'd lost touch. And just like magic, there she was! There were some serious health issues her end, but she's on the mend now, so that's very good news.I did, however, lose my writing somehow. I've been working on and off (mostly off the past few months) on a book for about three years, and several weeks ago I went to review it and it was gone. Just vanished!! Along with all the notes and other bits and pieces I had with it. I keep it on a thumb drive and I'm absolutely confounded about where it would have gone, as that's literally the only stuff that's disappeared from it. I would not consciously remove it and delete it. I did a scan, but no luck. I've rescued some sections of it via my writing group and various emails I've sent with parts attached, but I have no record anywhere of my 13 pages of vignettes I had. Nuts. If I'm honest, I was kind of sick of looking at it and hadn't worked on it for months, so I think it was the Universe's way of saying 'FOR GOD'S SAKE STOP FAFFING ABOUT AND JUST GET ON WITH IT!!'Â So. Second draft it is (actually third, because somehow the first second draft disappeared too, sooooooo...).Anyway, that's about it. I putter about at weekends, getting little bits and pieces done at the flat, tidying, dusting, sorting paperwork, catching up on TV shows. Yesterday I discovered some black spot mould and blistering paint in one of my windows, which I immediately told my landlady about. Yikes! She came right over to have a look. There's a bit of work that needs doing, as it means there's a bit of penetrating damp somewhere, but I felt a bit bad too, as the last time I called her over there was a potentially big leak over the bathtub! But she assured me I would never be wasting her time for things like this.Hope you are all as well as can be in our strange times. We're looking at May for the 50+ vaccine (hooray!), but am unclear about the end of lockdown now: when we shut down in January it was until 16 Feb, then it was extended to end of March, then I'd heard it could be July, but yesterday I heard there was talk of potential tier-type openings for pubs and restaurants come April. SO WHO KNOWS?Stay safe and well!"},
{"title": "'Bye 2020! Don't let the door hit you on the way out!", "date": "Friday 1 January 2021", "text": "HOORAY!!goodmenproject.comI think we're all glad/relieved/thankful/etc., to see the back of it, too, aren't we? Holy cow.So, I will take this moment to wish you all a Happy New Year. Here's hoping for a brighter, lighter, more hopeful year. I wish you all health, wealth and some magic.Â So, what did I do last year?Â In February I got a stonking raise: 10%!! In truth, it was two years' worth of raises in one go, but who am I to argue? A good start.(End of) March - July: lockdown. Had grand plans to utilise the time productively. The only thing my flatmate and I managed was a 5,000 piece puzzle. Otherwise, it was full of frustration, anxiety, etc. I couldn't read, I couldn't write, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Mind you, I've not slept so well in YEARS. Like the proverbial log, for weeks. It was amazing.July 1: returned to work. It's been absolutely mad since. We've never been so busy. This is good for us, but also trickles down/over into estate agents, solicitors, movers, etc. The backlog - thanks in part to the stamp duty holiday, which runs through until March - is tremendous. People are reasonably understanding, but some still want what they want when they want it, and we're at the point where if someone cancels, it's not a problem, because there are probably a dozen more waiting.20 July: I registered for an online proofreading course. I thought it might be a good way to eventually bring in a little extra income.September: my last month at the corner shop, because...October: I MOVED! Again. This time, however, it was on my own. Finally! I had a list and it checks EVERY. SINGLE. BOX. I honestly hadn'tÂ intended to move again so quickly, but this showed up and I literally could not say 'no' (there's a bit of a long story around that). I'm now walking distance to the office (1.4 miles/25 mins) and have walked every (work)day but one since I moved in.I look onto a converted stable yard. The property is set up as a B&B/holiday let, and my flat is actually a holiday let, but they utilise two flats to bring in regular income: mine and a slightly smaller one-bed above me.There are four holiday lets around the stable yard. The B&B is run out of the old manor house, which is behind my flat. The owners are lovely, and there are a number of animals on-site too: three miniature donkeys (Paddington, Rupert and Teddy), eight Soay sheep (rescues), fourteen free range laying hens, six show chickens (Buff Orpingtons, etc.) and four goats, two Boers and two miniature. There is apparently a cat, too, but I've only glimpsed him once since I've been here.These are several months old, when I was moving in (and before my plants arrived), but give an idea of it. Very compact, not much storage, but that's not a bad thing. It just means I need to be certain about what I'm keeping, etc. The rent includes all costs (utilities) and it's a *smidge* tight, but I'm happier paying one cost than scattering all my bills throughout the month. It's not cheap to live on your own, but I am so happy. The setup is perfect for one.I live directly across the road from a reserve which is beautiful and home to a plethora of birdlife. The road itself is probably the only drawback. It's a direct route to Salisbury and therefore is very busy. I'm on the opposite side of the road to the pavement, so need to use extreme caution when I'm crossing. The driveway to the property is on a slight bend, so a bit nervewracking to negotiate, but fortunately I can walk a short distance to a much easier crossing spot.I've spent the last several months settling myself in and still have a couple of boxes and bags to work on. But the flat is warm, cosy, compact, quiet, modern. It's wonderful. I've recently added a bird feeder outside my living room window, and now have some blue tits and robins feeding on seeds. Lovely!As for my course, I've finished it and sent the final assignments several weeks ago. I got 60%, but need 80% to pass in order to get any work with the affiliate company. There are three opportunities to pass, and I've spent some time chatting with one of the staff to go over what I did wrong. I *should* be able to pass the second time. The trouble is that it's mostly academic stuff, and I'm not academically inclined. Having said that, though, it's just a matter of practice. The more I do it, the better I'll get. I can take as long as I need on the final assignments, too, which is great, so I just have to 'fine tooth comb' it and be patient. I know I rushed a bit the first time.I go back to work on Monday after two weeks' break. One of my colleagues is retiring at the end of January, so we'll be breaking in a new one. There will be some big changes, I'm sure. I've been resting, reading (finally), cleaning, organising my thoughts, and have done a couple of walks at the reserve. The weather hasn't been great - wet and mild mostly - but from Monday, I'll be walking daily again and that helps clear my mind for the day.So that's my year in a nutshell, really. I haven't decided whether I'll be regularly updating or not at this point, but I'd like to. Perhaps monthly. Regardless, I hope this finds you safe and well, and that 2021 is easier for all of us, in as much as it can be."},
{"title": "First run!", "date": "Sunday 5 January 2020", "text": "lanarkmarathon.comObviously, that's totally (not) me. But a girl can dream. Realistically, my best physical days are behind me - if I ever really had any - but I can work with where I am and do my best.Yesterday I received the last part of my running 'puzzle' - fresh, new running socks. All quite timely, really, seeing as I'd stated I'd be starting today. Good timing, no?No excuses.I went for my first run this morning and it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Mostly because it wasn't raining or very, very dark. However, although I don't have a suitable waterproof jacket, there are streetlights around here and the area is comfortable and safe, so running in the dark mornings (for now) shouldn't be an issue. It's just the getting out of bed part...I will have to be out and back by 6:45 most days in order to get ready for work afterwards. I've found in the past that I prefer running in the mornings, so I'll continue that routine for now.Anyway, it did feel good to be out there again and I was paying attention to how I was feeling. It's a cool but dry morning -Â  a very, very light drizzle on my way back, but nothing to deter me, perfect for running actually.So far (and knowing that the first couple of weeks are much more walking than running), apart from being stiff from lack of any form of exercise for far too long, I feel okay. My breathing wasn't too bad and once I stop thinking about how my feet should land, where my hands should be, how I stop my nose running, etc., and get my rhythm, I'll be fine.It was my dad's birthday yesterday. He would have been 89 and will have been gone 39 years in February. He was a runner, started later in life (40's I think), and I'm not sure why I feel I need to run this year, but as I said yesterday, it just feels important. So I will.My first Mindful Chef box gets delivered this morning! I tried this last year at this time, but only made it a couple of weeks (it's a bit pricey, although absolutely fantastic ethics and recipes). I got a huge incentive to try it again, so I re-signed up for January. This should cover the majority of my lunches and dinners for the month, although I'll have to organise breakfasts and weekends. I get a 10% discount from the shop and often come home with wasted items ('expiring today' kind of stuff) for free, so that helps a bit.One of our regular customers (a serious alcoholic) bought me a gift box of 4 huge chocolate bars yesterday (post-holiday price of Â£2). Awkward. This fellow keeps saying that when/if he wins the lottery, he'll take me to dinner. I mentioned to a colleague that if he was serious, why wait for the win? Joking aside, it's a bit uncomfortable, but it's the only thing that I don't enjoy about the shop. I left the box (seriously, it's HUGE) at the shop because I honestly can't eat that much chocolate (I'd be sick), and I'm not happy taking it home. My colleagues are more than welcome to it.Some of the joys of being a woman, eh ladies? ð¬Otherwise, have a shift at the shop this afternoon and back at the office tomorrow. I'm trying to decide how I feel about that. I guess I'm glad to be back in a routine? Regardless, I'll be there. Have a good first week of January, and let's try not to let the current world chaos and politics beat us down too early."},
{"title": "Getting organised", "date": "Friday 3 January 2020", "text": "friendsofln.wixsite.comWord(s) for January: Indulge AbundantlyWell, in trying to keep some kind of 'beginnings of change' moving forward - if slowly - today I took the car to Halfords (a chain more or less dedicated to cars & bikes) to get a bulb replaced in the front headlight. I noticed it had gone yesterday and instead of being my usual 'can't be bothered right now' self, I made a point of driving the almost 3 miles to my closest outlet and having the bulb replaced. Apart from a dumb move on the large roundabout I try to avoid (for just that reason... *ahem* ...), I made it without incident. It cost me Â£16.90: Â£8.90 for the bulb, and Â£8 for the fellow to replace it. Well worth it as far as I'm concerned as, starting on Monday, I'll be driving home through the dark again and need both headlights.Ten minutes and I was all done. Fab. One less thing to worry about and as far as car costs go, exceptionally reasonable.I mentioned on the first how I felt it was important for me to run this year. These are the new bits & pieces I bought last week and which arrived about an hour ago. I bought them online from a site called Sweaty Betty. I'm planning to try my first run on Sunday morning. Because I'm still unsure how I'll be able to breathe (have been having some similar issues to my anaemia issues from several years ago), I thought I would give it a go and see how I feel. I probably need to follow up with my doctor anyway, so will wait until next week to arrange a call with her, just to see is she recommends more blood tests, etc.I also need to pay attention to my knees & hips and see how they feel after a few days of running.7/8 length leggings - they feel glorious! I kept running my hands up and down my legs. Ha ha! Have some compression to them, as well as a 'bum sculpt' feature. Will let you know how/if that actually works.A new, proper running bra and shirt for warmer weather ('beetle blue').Â Lovely and soft, if a bit revealing around my post-Christmas, face-stuffing-for-two-weeks tum.A yoga bra/top (made of bamboo). See description above about the fit.I signed up for my online yoga site yesterday, too. I bought a year's worth of access via Groupon for Â£12 sometime in June or July, and have waited until now to redeem the voucher (new year enthusiasm/anticipation and all that).I also bought some lightweight, cheap-ish walking shoes which are more suited to evening walks. Not sure they'd take me too far without issue, but a couple of miles should be okay.Overall, while I haven't done anything I had set out to do, I feel rested, relaxed and ready to go back to work (I guess...). Although I've slept well, I've eaten far too much and feel heavy and bloated, but that will change starting on Sunday when my first meal delivery box arrives. I've got meals for 5 days in it (my first 4 deliveries are 25% off, plus I somehow had a Â£14 credit, so took advantage), going down to 4 per week for the rest of the month. I know the food is delicious and the portions on the large side, so ideally they'll work out for two meals each for me - a dinner, and lunch the following day.I'm working on my new bullet journal along with thinking of 100 things I want to do this year. I only managed to list 65 items last year and accomplished only half a dozen of those, so intend to do better this year. My items include completing the Couch to 5k (running programme), sorting out my car insurance (it's double what it should be because I have a 'claim' from three years ago, when I really don't), baking, visiting London (because I haven't recently - two years? More?), reading 52 books this year (one a week seems doable, more than that feels a bit 'urgent', and books should be enjoyed not rushed through), etc.I was a 'bit' profligate with my credit card before Christmas and bought myself a few things: a new stand mixer for baking, an Amazon Alexa, a subscription to a writing magazine, and all the items above. The mixer is brilliant and I've already made two cakes with it, a carrot cake for my neighbour's birthday (turned out very well if I do say so myself, and he was very pleased), and a salted caramel chocolate cake which was delicious. It really makes a difference, time-wise, having a mixer to do the hard work for you. It's brilliant.Alexa has a huge variety of things it can do, but at the moment I'm using it just for the sheer variety of music. Roomie E is starting to understand how to use it now, rather than just shouting at it. Ha ha!We had our neighbour over last Sunday for an Italian Christmas dinner, which was absolutely delicious. There was wine, cotechino (a sausage), mashed potato and lentils. We had home-made panettone (pear and dark chocolate) and the salted caramel cake for dessert. We were visiting for about 6 hours - so much fun! He's a really lovely guy. He and I now have to think of things for an 'international' night - pondering what South African (him) and Canadian (me) dishes we can contribute. Poutine and Nanaimo bars? Mmmm. Yikes!So, already a bit of financial advice required. I currently have Â£1200 set aside for a flat deposit/move, but am wondering if it would be more beneficial to wipe the CC off (again) and re-save for the flat? Ideally, I'll do both, but think not having the debt is more beneficial in the long run really, particularly since we have no idea what's happening in respect of Brexit (which has now apparently been pushed back to 31 Dec 2020?!

So, 'yes!', I'm going to buy some nice running gear, and start the Couch to 5k again.'Yes!' - I've arranged meal delivery for a month, starting on Monday, which I'm hoping will kickstart better eating habits - 4 meals a week (hopefully, the meals I make for dinner will be enough to carry over to lunches the following day - that's my plan).'Yes!' - I'm going to set up some achievable goals to accomplish over/by the end of the year.I'm very much looking forward to this year, the beginning of another decade, with you all and sharing achievements, challenges, thoughts, progress, and 'yes!', continued friendship."},

{"title": "6 weeks to Christmas!", "date": "Sunday 17 November 2019", "text": "every-tuesday.comAgain I say, where does the time go? I've been terribly slack the past several weeks and November has crept up on me. I've not updated my journal but can do that tomorrow at some point, although it means I don't have a word of the month to share (yet).My visit with my sister went very well. We have our moments where we try each other's patience (just two people used to living alone, and my dire memory), but overall it's always good to see her. She lives in a very tiny one-bed bungalow overlooking some green hills, about one mile outside Totnes. There's a railway line running past the bottom of the very tiny rear garden but it's not overly disruptive, the trains passing roughly once per hour en route to and from Penzance in Cornwall.We found room for all the bits & pieces I took down with me (she has a garage so that's useful for things like the bike and vacuum cleaner), and we stocked up on heavy things like tins of soup and cartons of almond milk to take advantage of having the car for a few days.She had to work most of the time I was there but that was no problem. Totnes has a lovely high street, compared to some I've been on, and I spent a decent amount of time poking around the charity shops, the independent retailers, and the usual high street names. I found two pairs of trousers at one of the charity shops (!) for myself and bought Roomie E a couple of seahorse-themed things for her birthday & Christmas (she loves them). They seemed to be everywhere! Totnes isn't even a seaside town...Anyway, the rest and relaxation were good, despite the fact that my sister only has a coffee table and we spent our time sitting on the floor. I got a bit tired of that, but at least my camp bed was relatively comfortable and I slept well. It makes me appreciate my sofas at home! Ha ha! She's collecting bits a little at a time and a friend has promised her a proper bed from the sale of her house, so that's definitely going to be welcome. In the meantime, she's got my camp bed so is at least a bit more comfortable when she's sleeping.She has borrowed money for groceries from me twice this month already, however, which I'm okay with (money for food is fine, anything else is not), but leaves me a bit concerned. The jobs there seem to be contracted 'x' number per week, not full-time, so it's a bit of a struggle, although her Saturday job has morphed into an extra two days a week now, so that's positive. She's also applying for the manager position at that job which would be a real coup. I know she wants to focus on and build her business but if you're not able to take care of the basics of living, it's hard to focus on anything else and justify putting so much effort into that, especially if it's not viable yet. But, if you don't, then you don't have any chance of getting to that point! It's a bit of a tough place to be, but if anyone can do it, she can.Anyway. This month I finally got my back pay from my Saturday job (14 hours from when I first started), so that was good to see. I've also picked up the Sunday afternoon shifts through December and put my name down for Boxing Day (albeit a split shift). This pleases me and I'm planning on doing this until I can't or just don't want to anymore. It's a little bit of a bonus really, so I will take proper advantage whilst I can and try to pay down my debt and plump up my flat deposit account. Everything else seems to be okay - our utility bills are modest at last, which helps immensely, and I now need to just be cautious with my 'miscellaneous' and food spends.This week I decided I needed to bake a cake - two, actually - so have invested in some tins, a cooling rack, and a few other necessary bits & pieces, along with the ingredients. Fortunately, there's a surplus/hardware store near the office and I got a few things there for cheap, so that's checked that box. Our oven, however, isn't working quite right, so I appealed to our friendly neighbour for use of his. He was happy to oblige (fortunately), and cake is the 'quo' of this 'quid pro quo' arrangement. First cake tastes fine but looks absolutely awful - it will need a redo. The other one I'm going to try today before work at 3:00. It's a Red Velvet recipe I found and would like to try, using buttermilk...hm!Someone is coming to look at our oven on Saturday. I don't think the thermostat is working properly, it burns things even at low temperatures so we're either doing something wrong or there's a problem with the oven. We'd just like to know.I have a friend visiting tomorrow for a few hours. She's arriving around 10:00 and we're going for a walk and lunch out (hooray!). I had wanted to make the cake to offer her with tea, so hopefully one will work out like I want.UPDATE (ONE WEEK LATER):cakes were more or less a success - hurrah!our oven was fixed yesterday. I was correct - it was the thermostat! It's been replaced and is good to go now. Hurrah!Cake!!think I might try a salted caramel chocolate cake next. ðð5 weeks until I'm on holiday for two weeks. Hurrah!currently thinking about what I what to accomplish during those two weeks (book-wise, writing-wise, new year-wise, etc.)I am obsessed (!!) at the minute by the impeachment hearings happening in the US; unsure this is healthy, as I'm neglecting my reading and writingI have, however, despite this, moved forward a little on my bookspooling up for YET ANOTHER general election on 12 December. This will change nothing, and I'm not sure who to vote for (apart from 'never in this lifetime' conservative). 'Free broadband for all' (Labour's rallying cry) is hardly motivating. I need a little think...relieved beyond measure that Canada retained its sanity and voted the Liberals in again, however, although glad there is a coalition with the NDP which will hopefully reel in some of those disastrous environmental decisions (KEYSTONE PIPELINE) made previously. Do better this time, Mr Trudeau. Please.have some Vit D and Folate supplements from the doctor to see if that helps my hair issue; another blood test end of November for some slightly low kidney numbers and then six-monthly after that. Hoping both will sort themselves out, but believe I need to make some drastic dietary steps in the new year. Have given up caffeinated tea (apart from one first thing), and that has the added benefit of helping me sleep a bit better, so there's that at least. Nothing will happen overnight, but incremental changes add up over time, so have to do some serious thinking over the holidays and then implement (and stick!) with decisions. Commitment is not my strong suit...ahem...I already know what next year's word is going to be. Hurrah! (But you'll have to wait to find out).Time to sort out Christmas cards (yes, I still do them!) and will take a few to the office with me this week. The international ones I will send second-class to save myself a little Â£Â£ this year. I do enjoy sending them, and having a franking machine at work means I get a little discount. Doesn't mean postage won't go up again next year, and there's a strike threatened for December, so would ideally like to get them in before that happens. Poor, beleaguered Royal Mail - a Christmas strike and Â£50m payout in fines...yup, definitely at least one rise next year.Off to the shop shortly, so hope you've all had a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Off on a little holiday!", "date": "Sunday 13 October 2019", "text": "gothinkbig.co.ukHeading down to Devon for a few days to visit my sister. Packed up the car yesterday with all kinds of things to take with me - what a great way to declutter a place! ðð Packed my bike, the vacuum we found when we moved in, a bag of household-y things that I bought, the camp bed, pillows & sheets, all my magazines, a set of candlesticks, a few old towels, a kettle (new), and some excess cutlery. Phew! She'll bet set for awhile.Â It's going to be a wet trip -Â I think there's one day of 'mostly cloudy' forecast - but 'tis England after all, and I should be used to this by now. It's what it does. We've got the tail end of a hurricane (is it Lorenzo?) and, well, that's pretty much it. Wet weather gear is ready to go. Regardless, a few days away is a nice break.I borrowed a sat nav from a colleague which I'm pleased about. I was debating about buying one but as I don't generally go too far afield, there didn't seem to be much point expending the Â£Â£ before I knew how often I'd need it. I don't go very many places I don't know these days. Is that wrong? Ha ha! Anyhow, a loan is the cheapest option, so I'm pleased it worked out.It's just going 7:00 and I'm going to leave within the hour, I think, only because I'd like to potentially get a bit of a head start on the rain if possible. I will 'drive dirty' and shower when I get there.I know a massage is on the agenda, mine at least, but sadly, no goat yoga! Maybe it's the wrong time of year (no kids)? Anyhow, my sister says she has all kinds of things planned, lots animal-related, so I'm sure we'll have a great time.Will update (with photos) next week! 'Byeeeeeeeeeee ð"},
{"title": "Autumnal October has arrived", "date": "Sunday 6 October 2019", "text": "coolasleicester.co.ukWord of the month: AwarenessOctober's had a reasonable start, all things considered. Monday (although technically still September) I took my car in to get the rear brakes done and it was spot on the quote I'd been given at the beginning of the month when I had my MOT done: Â£341.51. Fab.A bit of adjustment with my budget and I paid for it in cash and this, all being well, takes care of car-related concerns until the insurance comes due in January.I had some bloodwork on Thursday morning. Along with 'general' menopause-related complaints, my hair is thinning and I want to see if there is something that can, if not stop, at least slow and potentially reverse this. My hair has never in my life been those luxurious, frothy locks in shampoo ads. I've been 'blessed' with very fine hair, naturally wavy (until I lived in the Yukon, where it went more 'Laurie Partridge' than 'Roseanne Rosannadanna'), and, like everyone, lost hair generally over the years. It's only been in the last six months or so that I've noticed MORE hair than normal, and my scalp feeling more sensitive than normal (to hot water, cold, etc.) that I realised there was an issue. I've been taking some supplements which are intended to help but thought a visit to the doctor wouldn't be a bad thing anyway.The results should be back in the next day or so, and depending on what is/isn't found we can have a follow-up to see if anything can be done. Is it thyroid-related, dietary, etc.? If it's genetic, there's little that can be done, and it's obviously connected to the hormonal chaos happening, but changing my diet certainly can't hurt either (removing caffeine, non-complex carbs, possibly dairy, sugar, etc.). There are some OTC products that can help and I'm trying hard not to obsess or get overly self-conscious about it, but it is a bit hard to come to terms with on some level because women's hair is so intrinsically connected to them on so many levels.I am becoming aware that this is not uncommon. In fact, now that it's happening to me, I am becoming quite obsessed with looking at women's hair. From my desk above the high street, I look down on a lot of people during the day and can see that, actually, it's quite prevalent. Like that car you get that you've never noticed before, and suddenly everyone is driving one.Hair works on three-month cycles, so it would take at least that long for any 'cure' to show results.Â But one step at a time.Otherwise, work is work, and I won't bore you with all the excitement that happens there on a daily basis - you've heard it all before! ðððThe shop is going well, although yesterday someone walked out (unintentionally) without paying for cigarettes. I need to pay more attention. Anyway, hopefully that's the last time that happens to me!My writing group met yesterday at a seafront cafe for our THIRD anniversary! It was absolutely lovely. We had a great meeting and discussed all the works that were presented, gorgeous food and, as always, wonderful company. I'm plugging away at my book and have made some forward progress in the past several days which pleases me, as I've been a bit stuck for a few weeks (again). I still need to go back and add some layers to the front so that characters and situations are more obvious and fleshed out, but at this point, I also think that moving forward is the way to go so that I can just get it finished and then start the first revision.I'm off the week after next, a visit to my sister in Devon on the agenda. I'm really looking forward to it. Hopefully, there will be some good weather and we can get out and do a few things around the area while I'm there. I'll be leaving early Sunday morning and returning on Friday, after a visit to the market. I want a few hours at home before I have to work on Saturday.It looks like the lad we thought was leaving, isn't, so I have my Sundays back, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I have to remember that I do need time to rest and write and it might as well be Sunday!Then there's Brexit (again. Still.). Hallowe'en deadline - appropriate, no? Latest (and first by BoJo) has been rejected, but of course, he's still convinced - he has to be, doesn't he? - that the EU will 'wave us happily good-bye on the 31st', with or without a deal. This has entirely consumed Parliament for three years, cost us millions (billions? Remember, we still have to pay a hefty 'divorce bill' of around Â£39bn regardless of whether we leave with a deal or not), and bulldozed over literally everything else that the country needs to worry about (jobs, housing, the environment, pensions, the NHS, etc., etc.). But here we are, the democratic process rolling along on square tires towards 'the end'...Everyone's like, 'we'll be fine'. Perhaps, but how long will it take to recover? How will we be fine? What will people do? Banks? Insurance companies? Investments and real estate?How will travel be affected? Hospitality? Tourism? Goods and services being imported and exported? Farming? Manufacturing (what's left of it)? Fishing (what's left of it)? Security at the borders? The Irish border? Gibralter? Anyone?I'm visualising the PM seeing himself as the proud captain at the helm of the newly launched 'Titanic'.'Get ready for Brexit' is the rallying cry. But how? NO ONE KNOWS.I'm just assuming it's going to be a surprise for everyone, including Parliament. There's so much in-fighting and quitting and intimidation and arguing and changing of parties happening it's ridiculous. Not that death threats and intimidation need to be added to the mix but apparently, MPs on both sides are getting them, and that's quite appalling, regardless of which side you sit on. I hope the perpetrators are caught.Anyhow, onwards. It's all we can do, really. Most people are just sick and tired of hearing about it; apathy is high, although the Tories have lost their majority since the last bi-election and over the past few weeks when BoJo had a bit of a temper tantrum and fired a few of them. The Welsh elections lost him yet another seat, and I think there was a defector in the last couple of weeks, so they are now a minority government and it's unlikely that anything to do with Brexit will pass a vote. Anyone else seeing the iceberg yet?Yet, still, no one has been able to answer my question of, 'What does Britain have to trade as a single market that the world will be lining up to get?'Anyway, I am looking forward to my holiday in Devon. I've got a few things to take to my sister and picked up a couple more practical household items in the Sainsbury's discount section the other day, so they were good finds.Hope you're all having a lovey weekend!"},
{"title": "A few days off :D", "date": "Friday 27 September 2019", "text": "metro.co.ukI have some holidays to use up before the end of the year, so randomly chose this week to take some time off. Because, why not?We went to Solihull on Monday for our training session which, apart from stupid start times, wasn't too bad overall. I was up at 4:45 and at the public car park at the office by 6:00. The MDs had hired a driver (I say!) which was actually a great idea because no way would I have wanted to tackle that drive either before or after the training session. The session was pretty much what you'd expect for a new programme, the basic walk-through of how it works, what we can do, what it does for us, etc. Five hours' worth...We actually finished by 3:00 which meant we could get back earlier than we originally anticipated. Phew! The driver was great, actually, an interesting guy (and devoted dad to a 12-yr old girl), so all in all the 2.5 hours (each way) wasn't as bad as it could have been.I got home not much later than I normally do, fortunately.I was at the office on Tuesday until noon then had a hospital appointment. I've been going back and forth for about three years for the same procedure (dealing with hypoplasia) and the consultant wanted to make sure that the pathology was 'all clear' before signing me off. I've finally reached the point that he's happy enough to sign me off, but he said if I have any concerns to come backÂ to themÂ (\"concerns\" being a period, actually, as I've - hopefully, finally - stopped). I'm relieved. It was due diligence, as the risk of cancer was extremely low (5% over 20 years), but it's still one less thing to worry about. Hooray!So, as I'd taken the afternoon off for that, I decided I might as well take some of my holiday time, too. It's been nice, actually, although I haven't yet really done anything that I planned. I took an extra shift at the shop on Wednesday night, and have Saturday and Sunday to work as well, so that will boost my next paycheque a bit. Apparently one of the lads is leaving, so it means that there are some shifts up for grabs which is good news for me. And Christmas is coming, too, which means plenty up for grabs, hopefully!I spent yesterday doing a whole lot of nothing for the most part - fussing with my budgets endlessly, scrolling Twitter (I'm not even ON Twitter!), watching various ghost shows on YouTube...that's about it, actually, and somehow the hours melted away.I planned to do more today and have so far checked 'groceries' off my list. It's now 11:20 a.m. So, yeah, hopefully, more productive than yesterday!I'm reviewing my 'book' and finding all the things that need to be re-written/replaced, etc., but figure I'd best just 'get the words out' (as Roomie E says) before starting the next draft. I have to have something to re-draft after all! I've previously made some changes that mean the current iteration doesn't make any sense, but the point, I suppose, is that this is all part of the process. One word at a time...My next holiday is in mid-October when I'm taking a few days to visit my sister in Devon. I'm taking her my bike, the bits & pieces I've bought for her, and I'll have to take my camp bed and bedding, as it's only a one-bedroom bungalow and she sleeps on an air mattress at the moment. I'll need somewhere to sleep, and I can leave the bed behind. She's booking massages in for us (hooray!), and we're going to a yoga class or two. She's going to check into goat yoga, as we're both hoping there will be a class available while I'm there. I'm looking forward to it, although I'm hoping I can borrow a sat nav from somewhere for the trip. I don't know my English geography well enough to just make a stab at it. Ha ha! I flap far too easily if I get stuck driving (because driving in the UK \"kinda\" sucks...).Anyway, today I had planned to do some writing (of some kind) so I had best get on with it. The book will not write itself. At least it's raining, so I don't have to feel guilty about being inside. ðð"},
{"title": "Aaaaaaaand, done!", "date": "Saturday 21 September 2019", "text": "nandq.comIt's all done! And so quickly, too.I got my bank transfer on Tuesday, immediately paid off my 0% interest card (Â£1100), and part of my 29.9% card (Â£790.45). Once the latter payment had cleared a couple of days later, I shoved the remainder (Â£1700) onto the 0% card, along with a small fee of Â£40.80, and that 'cleared' on 19.09.19.For some reason, the date really pleased me - maybe it's all the 9's!This did increase my Canadian LOC by $3300, but because I send Sterling on a reasonably regular basis and the exchange rate generally isn't too dire, I do get a bit more 'bang for my buck' so to speak and it allows me to pay an extra $10 or so here and there.It means I can adjust some savings here a little bit, and free up a bit of cash to perhaps do a class of some kind one evening a week.Â Or not. Regardless, I'm feeling much lighter for having made this decision and even more so because it all happened so quickly and so smoothly.Of course, now I'm fussing with my budget well into next year when I really have no idea what NEXT month is going to look like! I need to save a flat deposit and pay down/off my Visa. Those are my two financial priorities at the moment. It means I need to try and get a few extra shifts at the shop over the next few months, too, but that shouldn't be too difficult with the students now heading back to Uni. Hopefully, a few extra slots will be up for grabs on days that I can actually do them.I've made a little bit of overtime this month (4 hours so far), and am going to rack up some more on Monday when we head north to Solihull (nr Birmingham in the Midlands) for a day of training for ANOTHER new system that we'll have to start using in the office. To say that we're not really excited about it would be 'a bit' of an understatement, but whatever. It will add to my paycheque next month too, so I'm pleased about that.I bought my sister a fridge the other day, although not as a gift. She is going to pay me back for it. A fridge and washing machine are required items when you move into your own place here (at least it's not like Germany, where you have to supply your own entire kitchen!), and she's been eating convenience foods since she moved in. The little fridge wasn't that much and it's more or less a necessity. She doesn't have the funds for it, so I put it on my CC for her. Obviously, she'll be paying the interest on it as well.Roomie E and I were talking last night about the flat. Lately, I've had this feeling of great anticipation, an almost physical reaction, to SOMETHING. Roomie E is hoping it's not bad, but it doesn't feel that way to me - it feels terribly exciting and HUGE, and like it's going to affect both of us, but in very different ways. But it's just out of reach at the moment.I gave her and my neighbour a copy of my 'book' to read and I think my part of this 'thing' has something to do with that; hers is related to work and her career. She's given me some really great feedback on one of the characters that she's actually helped me createÂ (a sommelier - weird! Ha ha!). I know there's a kernel of a really good idea there, so I've decided that if I'm going to do this, I need beta readers. I trust both of them to give me genuine, well-thought-out suggestions and comments on the story (which is a complete and utter mess at this point, basically stream of consciousness rubbish). I've learned that you cannot get better as a writer if you're not willing to take criticism/critique and take on board suggestions that will ultimately make your writing the best it can be.Strangely, two of my current neighbours are actually characters in my book (even down to the same names)! They were written long before we moved in here, however, but I find the similarities quite spooky...I've also taken a bit of a break from the cafe. I'm finding it a bit tough going now that I've got the shop on Saturday afternoons. I only have an hour in between the two to sit down and relax and eat, and it's a bit much. I've been at the cafe for two years, however, and am not ready to leave for good, just for a few months. I was really dreading going in this morning and that's not how I want to feel about it, because it's a lovely place to be. Thankfully, the manager understood, so while I was sorry to do it, it's the easiest thing to let go right now.Today is supposed to be our last lovely day before a week of rain! It's been a lovely September so far, so I suppose, it being England, it was only a matter of time before the rain returned. At least it's still on the warm side.Hope you all have a lovely weekend!"},
{"title": "Update...", "date": "Sunday 15 September 2019", "text": "elegantthemes.comWell, I went ahead and transferred money from my Canadian LOC yesterday. I re-read the offer I got, and although the transfer needs to be done by the end of September, the 0% extends to March 2021, which is definitely doable.The transfer will clear the 0% interest CC, plus take Â£790.45 off the Visa whichÂ will then bring me to below the 90% maximum required for transferring the remainder to the 0% card (plus fee) and shave 29.9% interest from my monthly outgoing payments!Even with the increase in my LOC, the interest rate is 'only' 11% (less than half the CC interest rate). I'll continue to pick away at it as I have been doing forever, but I feel this is a good solution. This 0% balance transfer offer is a one-time-only deal, so I feel I would be remiss in not taking the opportunityÂ (speaking of signs, Treaders?).I've made some o/t this month, the manager at the shop is going to look into my pay shortage (I believe I'm still owed 15 hours), I can cancel my Â£135 auto payment to my MC and leave my Â£40 auto payment in situ for the 0% card.Â I believe this will put me slightly ahead this month, and I'm hoping that with all the savings/shuffling of cash/overtime, I will be able to pay for my brakes without depleting my savings accounts.It may require a slight increase in the monthly minimum payment on the 0% card but I foresee only about Â£10 if that's the case. That'll leave me more to put towards the LOC and my flat deposit. Plus, the satisfaction of knowing that every single (extra) penny that I put towards the 0% debt WILL BE BRINGING IT DOWN IN REAL NUMBERS.It seems to make the most sense all 'round, really. Plus, this clearing of credit cardsÂ shouldÂ help boost my credit rating. It's been quite soft the past few months, which is not ideal.I actually got a set of keys for the shop yesterday, too, although I'm sharing them with someone and have to drop them off on Wednesday night for him. He apologised for forgetting about us last week and bought me a chocolate bar to make up for it (I chose a massive Galaxy bar, one of those that only the English have - 360g for Â£2).Like I'd say 'no' to that? Ha ha! Anyway, there weren't any issues (thankfully!) and we were out of there before 9:15. So, at least I know what I'm doing now, although it's still frustrating to work with someone who struggles with knots...he does, however, know the till and lottery really well, so that's exceptionally helpful! We all have our forte, right?"},
{"title": "Time does fly", "date": "Saturday 14 September 2019", "text": "lebanoninapicture.comIt's been a bit of a week or two...One of my colleagues has been away since the beginning of the month, more or less, and we've gone 'live' with a new appointment booking system. It's the same system as the old one, just web-based rather than in a virtual server within our server. So adjusting to that and being one person down has been a bit stressful, although by yesterday we were definitely feeling better about it all. It's just a matter of using it and getting familiar with all the changes. It's actually a better layout and once you get to know where you need to go to find things, it's a bit easier as well.I did, however, begin and end the day by sending snippy emails to a surveyor. The second email was snippier because I had to placate a client who phoned to chase a report that should have been sent that morning and wasn't even typed yet. I believe there could be the potential to lose a house because of this. I sent an email stating that I was very angry about having to apologise and make excuses for her, copying in both the office manager and the managing director. The office manager was aware and spoke to our director (her son) about it. I am not hopeful that the reports we need will be waiting for us on Monday, but will have to deal with that on Monday.I lost no sleep last night over my email, however. I am a very even-tempered woman for the most part and it takes a lot to wind me up to even get to 'snippy', but I refuse to take the hit for someone who is supposed to be a professional and has said she can do work that she obviously can't. I'm not paid enough to do that. On top of that, this is the sort of thing that can damage the company and its reputation.So. I'm glad the week is over. Although I did make a bit of overtime, so there's that! :DI bought a few practical bits & pieces for my sister and her new place - a set of mugs, some tea towels, a can opener and a little rubbish bin for the bathroom. They were all on sale, and I'll take them with me when I go to visit in October. I just have to confirm dates there.My car did not, in fact, pass its MOT. It needed a rear registration light and a new coil spring on the front passenger side (it helps to keep the car at a proper height above the road)! I was shocked and disappointed until I remembered that I had hammered through a pothole in the spring. When I asked about it, the mechanic said that would definitely have done it. You look for immediate damage to tire or wheel, but don't think about anything that's not visible. The force of going through the pothole obviously snapped it, which accounts for the creaking that followed for the next few months. It's all fixed (Â£226) but the rear brakes need replacing desperately, which I've got booked at the end of the month (another Â£350. Yeesh). Cars. ð©ðOtherwise, she's in good shape for a 12-year old car, so that's good. This is also why I want to be within walking distance to work - bills like this.I THINK I have thought of a way to 'downsize' my debt but I have a few numbers to crunch and a couple of phone calls to make before I make any drastic decisions. The ultimate decision would increase my Canadian debt (but at a much lower interest rate, 11%) and I'd be able to clear the zero interest CC here, plus part of the second and move the remainder of the second (29.9%) to the zero-interest card. It would save a lot of interest, but I just want to see what the minimum payment will be. I got an offer in the post about a balance transfer and it seems like it could be a good decision in the long run. Particularly if it saves me so much in interest payments. I have to make a decision by the end of September, and any transfer has zero interest until March 2021. A decent offer by all accounts. I think I need to make a decision by the end of this weekend, as it can take a few days for the balance transfer to happen.I got 'trapped' at the shop last Saturday night. You know how I've said that there isn't a senior keyholder on Saturdays? The fellow who was supposed to come back didn't, and I had to call the manager. I think I woke her up, but as a manager, this is the sort of fire you are paid to fight, right? She was understandably annoyed, partly because she lives too far away to come herself, and so was the fellow she managed to find to come back and close. As was I having to resort to that. I got half an hour's extra pay though. No way was I signing out until everything had been taken care of. What a pain! No idea what's going on tonight. I don't expect anything to have changed, though.Ah well, the weather is lovely this weekend and I plan to enjoy my time off. :D"},
{"title": "September arrives", "date": "Sunday 1 September 2019", "text": "hellowoodlands.comHere we are, the cusp of another month - my favourite one! Pleasantly warm days, cool evenings - what's not to love? Well, traffic, now that the kids are back in school, but apart from that, it's all good. :DAnyway, my word this month is actually a phrase, and in Italian:Affronta il mondoIt feels appropriate somehow. Like I need to get laser focused and move forward on things, take charge, make decisions - that kind of thing.I haven't been sleeping that well the past week (thanks, hormones), and Friday I woke up feeling particularly self-doubting (according to my sister, this is also due to a transition of a new moon into Virgo) and couldn't shake it for most of the day. It didn't help that my boss was in the office for about an hour that afternoon and was being kind of a bitch.It's not like this is unusual/out of character for him, but is just something I was particularly sensitive to that day. I'm keeping a note of all this stuff so that when I start looking for a new job next year, I can leave with no guilt. I'm committed to this flat for the next 12 months, so once this starts winding up then I'll be looking for both a new place to live AND a new job. Roomie E is (more) disgusted with her workplace as well but, like me, says the commitment to the flat has to keep her focused before looking for something else.So we're feeling a bit stuck, but all is not bad.My part-time job is enjoyable enough. Like I said, not something I can maintain for the long term, but right now is absolutely fine. I seem to be scheduled every Saturday night with no senior staff member to close up, which is kind of ridiculous and not particularly well planned on the parts of the manager(s). It means that someone who's already worked all day has to come back for a half-hour to lock the doors, take off the tills, set the alarm, etc. I'm also missing half my hours on my first paycheque, so have to find out what's going on there.Wish me luck... ð Not the most auspicious start, but there we go. Gift horses and looking in mouths and whatnot.I've taken three days holiday at the end of September because I just really need a break and have holiday time to use up (use it or lose it). I've picked up a few extra hours at my second job but am really hoping to just read, rest, relax, write, etc. Then potentially a week mid-October when I might go see my sister in Devon for a few days. I'll see.I've had no response to my email to a thatcher, but have seen a thatcher en route to work the past several days, so am taking that as a sign that I need to send another email to follow up. I do need to speak with one. However, I have heard back from the genealogist I contacted and I'm meeting her next Monday for a drink and a chat. I'm so excited (and very nervous)!Car is going for her MOT tomorrow, and I'm hopeful that she'll pass with flying colours.I have a bit of a crush on my neighbour (who, I've discovered, is actually older than I thought - and older than ME). Just enjoying it as it's been a very long time since I've had one. It's a bit of a surprise, actually - he's shorter than me, smokes, is kind of a workaholic and overweight. We have some good conversations, though, and it's nice to have someone 'my age' to talk with. He seems like a good guy. I told my sister I'm working really hard to not get way too far ahead of myself and just enjoy it for what it is.Well, I have a bunch of stuff that needs to get done today before I go to the shop this evening. I actually have a proper list that I'm crossing items off of to feel a bit accomplished today.Have a lovely weekend!"},
{"title": "Long weekend - hurrah! :D", "date": "Sunday 25 August 2019", "text": "It's here at last! The long weekend. Aaaahhhh...An extra day to sleep in, an extra day to putter about the house and hopefully get some writing done, an extra day to recover from my part-time job. Ha ha! Holy cow - only five shifts in and I'm already wondering what I was thinking... it's not the till work, or the tidying (which I quite like), it's the rushing about and doing the physical work of refilling shelves, etc. It exhausts me. But the staff are great, and I have a feeling that I'm going to be in charge of closing the shop sooner rather than later. The colleague I'm now working with on Saturday nights isn't ... um ... capable (?) of taking on that responsibility, so apparently I'll be it. Great?But, I'll deal with it as it comes. As is was, we were really busy last night so I was trying to get the evening tasks done while also helping with the customers. I forgot how physical retail can be. Despite having a list, it's quite challenging to make sure everything is done within time. Three bodies are infinitely better than two, but there we are.Anyway. It's fine, just not something I can manage long term, I know that already, but I'll go through the holidays and review in the new year. As long as I have time to recover between shifts, it's generally not too bad. And the extra paycheques, when they finally arrive, will be most welcome!Otherwise, it's been a pretty good two weeks, actually!Treaders: before I forget, here is the link to the Nanaimo bar recipe I used (not quiteÂ like the real thing, but I don't think anyone will complain! Walnuts are optional):Â  https://www.elizabethskitchendiary.co.uk/nanaimo-bars-canadas-national-confection/.Â I sent my sister a container of bars, too. It was her birthday yesterday so I included a card. She's left the place where she was staying (the landlady is a loony) and has moved into an AirBnB while she looks for something else. I'd like to say I have the funds to assist, but I don't and I said no more loans (unless it's for food) so she's on her own. She saw a little bungalow yesterday and is viewing a studio flat today.Â I'm still waiting to hear from \"my\" thatcher, but I HAVE heard back from the genealogist, which I'm really pleased about! She said she'd be happy to answer some questions, so we're going for a drink one evening in September, once school hols are done and she's caught up on some of her work. So, hooray! This will give me some time to think of some questions to ask.My Canada talk went well. I had a very loose plan which got even looser when some of the photos I was going to use didn't even show up, so I wound up spending a lot of time just talking about the Yukon and showing my own photos. It's not a place even most Canadians know about, so I'm happy to ramble on about it. The ladies seemed to enjoy it so that's the main thing.I went online yesterday and bought a couple of dresses from a website I haven't used in AGES. I've been shopping second-hand for so long and am a bit over it right now. In April, I gave myself Â£100 for my birthday to buy some new clothes. I spent Â£60 so have been sitting on Â£40 since, not feeling motivated or interested in getting more stuff. I found these two items (one item heavily reduced) and thought, 'the heck with it!' They'll be arriving sometime next week (with free returns if they're not quite right, so that's good to know). I've already filled my virtual shopping basket with more items...*ahem*One of the issues I've been fighting for several years is bloat. By the end of the day, I can be up to five pounds heavier than I was when I woke up and it's been frustrating and uncomfortable for several years. I know I'm always experimenting with food, but I decided to see what would happen if I didn't eat as much bread (I have \"a bit\" of a love affair with sourdough). I am happy (yet sad) to say that I have balanced the scale at more or less 10 1/2st for almost two weeks now (still marginally more than I'd like, but better!). My belly has shrunk considerably and I'm less grumpy because I'm feeling generally better. I just have to remember to keep drinking lots of water, which I'm terrible at.So I can eat sourdough, just not as often as has been my habit. I've not bought store bread for a couple of years, and buy my sourdough from a proper bakery. All the same, it's a bit of a sad realisation that carbs are not my friends anymore. Particularly not those delicious sourdough ones. And do you know how hard it is to find good sourdough?!Ah well. Probably not a bad thing.I sat in the living room yesterday afternoon pondering what I can do with it. There's actually a reasonable amount of space to play with. I've got a lot of plants that I'm still trying to find the right places for, and they're currently in front of the living room windows which I'm not sure is exactly the right place. There's too much direct sunlight and they're getting sunburned and not at their best. At the same time, it's taken a couple of months for them to adjust so they're doing okay considering.I'm going to take a cabinet out of my bedroom - hopefully leaving me more space - and put it in the living room to use as both a plant stand and storage. This does mean, though, that the bits and pieces that are in the cabinet need a new home. Hm.Anyhow, it may or may not work like I hope it will, and may lead to me moving my room around again although I don't really want to do that. But there's so much potential, so who knows!Have a lovely weekend, whatever you're doing!"},
{"title": "Halfway through another month", "date": "Sunday 18 August 2019", "text": "bravogroupvoice.wordpress.comFigured it was time for another update, seeing as the month is flying by. They all seem to these days, leaving me a bit of awhirl.have figured out motives for my both my prime suspect and the murderer (not the same person)! Quite a breakthrough, and most helpful when writing a murder mystery. Now to actually start writing again...sent an email to a thatcher last week. I took myself off FB on Sunday, told both my colleagues (separately) on Monday that I needed to speak with one, did a bit of Googling and found a fellow who's not only a master thatcher but the Chairman of the Dorset Mast Thatchers Association and who lives only 5 mins from me! As I was struggling to compose a suitable email, I glanced out the window to see a thatcher parked on the street outside the office!! Message received. I sent the email, although I'm still waiting for a response.I also sent a query to a genealogist as I need to speak with one of those as well. Again, I'm still waiting for a reply. I'm trying not to get too anxious, as I know it's summer holidays so it's quite possible they're away/busy/etc.I'm giving a talk about Canada on Tuesday to the women's group I used to belong to. I'm not particularly motivated but have put something together and hope they will like it. It's been years since I've learned anything political/geographical/historical about the country, and I'm mindful that these are intelligent women so don't want to dumb it down too much, but am still trying to make it interesting. The problem is that I just 'lived' there, you know? When you have to try and condense information or details, it just expands exponentially and I don't want to cover loads of stuff and get mired in minutiae. I'm using some of my own photos, as well as cadging info from the internet. I'm learning a lot! Ha ha!I'm making Nanaimo bars to share. Found a recipe by a Canadian woman living in Shetland, of all places. They don't really taste like the 'real' ones but will be fine for their purpose.I've had a few shifts at the shop too - not yet been paid, though, as details weren't sent (my original paperwork got lost or misplaced (O_o!!) so I had to do it all again...), but it means I'll get a reasonably decent paycheque at the end of the month, I hope. I've decided to put my first paycheque towards boosting my depleted flat deposit account instead.I can't figure out why I've run out of grocery money and am using funds from other accounts to cover the shortfall. I think it's probably the car repair at the beginning of the month. I've also had to shuffle money around to cover my rent and internet payment. ð©ðGot the car washed today when I went to the grocery store. She's all nice and shiny and blue again. They really do a fantastic job for Â£5. It's a helluva bargain for that price.I didn't get too distracted when I was shopping, although I bought a new (metal) bowl and loaf tin that were on sale. I put back a clock I picked up, as well as tried to keep my costs low. My sister wanted some Nanaimo bars, so I doubled the recipe and it's more or less used up all the ingredients already. I tried to keep it as cheap as I could, but I still spent almost Â£40. I haven't baked in a while, so it's been fun but I do need to be more mindful of costs.I've been reading some books on quitting sugar and am trying to get myself focused & motivated to just do it. It will help in so many ways. Also, looking at starting the Couch to 5K again, so doing some reading before tackling that as well. It's the motivation I lack and trying to get some inspiration.The weather is improving after a few days of heavy winds and rain, and the next few days are supposed to be quite pleasant.I still don't feel settled. It's going on two months now. I go from sofa to sofa to table, back to a sofa. It's really strange. I think it's the fact this place is more suited to a couple or a single, and I just feel that while it's a lovely spot, it's not 'mine'. I'd like to make enough to afford it on my own, but I don't (right now). So, until I can get myself sorted in that department, I work at the shop and to pay down my debt and save for another move in 12 months or so.Roomie E bought herself another car at last - an Audi A1, a nice sporty compact. The other day she asked me, 'where do I get diesel?' (she prefaced it by saying 'stupid question, but...') Ha ha ha! I just told her wherever she likes. But she's really happy to have a car again, and one that's so nice.Hope you all have a lovely weekend!"},
{"title": "Thoughtful advice", "date": "Sunday 11 August 2019", "text": "wearecouch.comWord of the Month: ReleaseA HUGE 'thank you' to all of you who sent me such excellent, thoughtful and well-considered advice. It's hugely appreciated! I've had loads to think about and have more or less come to the conclusion that I really need to tackle the card with the highest interest first - it makes the most fiscal sense, although hammering down the lowest balance makes a lot of sense to me too.But realistically, at the end of the day, the reason I'm struggling so much is that I just don't have the extra cash to do things for fun/learning, and that's extremely frustrating. Throwing so much money at a card with such a high interest rate and making only incremental inroads into paying it off is getting to me.To that end, I've done a little searching online this morning to look for zero-interest balance transfer cards. How did I not think to do this before?! (Thanks, FT!) There are several available, but I might give it a couple of months and bring my current balance down a bit before I apply. Doing a free eligibility search is fine, but anything deeper will affect my credit if I'm not approved after all that, so want to lower it as much as I can. I need to check my credit rating, it wasn't very good the last time I checked, so despite their claim I'm 90% eligible for several cards, I don't want to leap into a quaqmire.This is also why I wonder if focussing on getting rid of the smallest debt might be worthwhile, to both lower the amount I owe and to allow a potential application for MORE credit to go through. Anyway.See? This kind of thinking is what stops me moving forward - my decision making process sucks! Ha ha! 'This is great! Oh, but that's a good idea, too. Hmm. I wonder if I can do both? No, that's not effective. Oh, that other thing is good too.' It's exhausting...Anyhoo. Regardless, I'm making some extra money and I'm looking forward to my first 'new' little paycheque which should be next Friday. I'm not sure what's going on at the Spar - I've not yet got a sign-in for the till, haven't watched my training video (so technically shouldn't be selling booze & cigarettes and can only assume that my details are at HQ and have been sorted out and that I will be getting paid), but it's fine for a p/t job. Mindless and appeals to my sense of order, as I've said before. I got to do date checking yesterday and cleared a bunch of 'expiring' food from the shelves. Strangely satisfying, but what a waste. :( Still, I get a superb deal on buying some of this stuff PLUS 10% off and spent less than Â£3 on a pizza, some buns and two chicken meals, so pretty decent really.I've just realised I haven't added my Word of the Month to either July or August. My word for July was 'clear' and I don't yet have one for August. It just didn't appear. I have to write up my journal today, though, so hopefully I'll get one.I deactivated my FB account again this morning, for how long I don't know. I took myself off for a few months at the beginning of the year and made great progress with my writing. Since I've been back on, I've struggled to focus. I had a breakthrough for the murderer's motive on Thursday and now that that's organised, I can move forward. Can't have a murder mystery without a proper motive! I already feel better, and my friends understand so nothing to worry about there. I've been feeling prompts to do it recently, and today was the day. Besides, I'm fed up with US politics, UK politics and finding things to be sad/angry/helpless about. Seeing what friends are up to is nice, but so much in the feed seems to be 'sponsored' by one thing or another these days, it's just distracting.I asked another (male) friend in the US to ponder a reason for a motive (the same one I asked my neighbour), so I'm looking forward to hearing what he comes back with. I still need to talk with a thatcher, though, as that's key to building one of my main characters. One of the ladies in my writing group is kind of, sort of, but not really acquainted with one, who said that he'd had an 'out of the blue' call from someone (else) writing a book with a thatcher in it. Why do I feel I need an introduction - how old-fashioned is that?! Most people love to talk about their jobs, particularly if they love what they do.Â What the hell am I waiting for?!I'm going to have to make some phone calls/send emails...geez. The problem is that I keep hearing my Mum's voice in my head - 'oh, you don't want to bother them.' (The implication being they're too busy and important to bother with nobodies like me) But the world has moved on considerably since then and if I am 'bothering' them, they'll tell me so and I'll keep trying. It costs nothing to ask.Holy crumb, can I procrastinate or what?Anyway, lots of 'aha!' moments the past few days, so I know that I'm on the right track at least (at last?).Hope you're all having a lovely summer!"},
{"title": "Another month rolls in!", "date": "Sunday 4 August 2019", "text": "timeanddate.comDay 4 of August and I seem to be at it again - spending money before we've even made it through a whole week! What's with that?I had the car in for its minor repair on Friday and had anticipated about Â£100 for it. The final cost was Â£130.80, so a bit more than I'd have liked, but there we are. I had a little bit more done than was originally needed so overall, not bad. I DO have the money (in other accounts) but before I start moving funds from already-funded accounts, I'm collecting my coins and hoping to bring down the amount I need to transfer a bit. I'd like to at least cover the Â£30.08. As I already have Â£15 worth of coins, I'm well on track for that. I just need to ensure the money is there for rent on the 22nd!Plus I have the MOT next month. I have Â£55 in the car fund so far, and hopefully, it won't be too much outside of that, although I still have August's paycheque to look forward to and that will up it Â£20-Â£30, which really should be sufficient. An MOT shouldn't cost much more than Â£40-Â£50 - I'm confident this car will pass first time without any issues.And, I know, why not just use the Â£55 currently in there to cover part of last week's cost? I'm considering it but still would feel better paying for the MOT in full with that.I've had two shifts at the Spar. I went in on Tuesday evening last week for a couple of hours and spent it all at the till - amazing how long it took the time to pass! Ha ha! The ladies I worked with were lovely, though, and yesterday after my writing group, I had a 'full' 6-hour shift. I did hop on the till several times but spent most of my time facing and tidying the shelves - a surprisingly satisfying job. It appeals to my love of straight lines - ha ha! I put my name down for a 3-hour shift on a Friday night in a couple of weeks, so it's nice to see there are opportunities for me to pick up a few more hours here and there. It may not be the most intellectually stimulating job, but it's close to home, gives me much-needed extra cash and the staff all seem very nice (that's what they're all telling me, at least!), so it could be a whole lot worse.This brings me to my request for help. I'm going to lay out what my debt is and what I'm currently planning for it but would welcome further suggestions. I know the preference of pay down is different for everyone, but I THINK I have a reasonable plan in place.Visa #1: Â£2,414.05 (int 29.9%). Paying Â£135 p/m.Visa #2: Â£1,135 (0% APR). Paying Â£35 p/m.Loan: Â£5,346.85 (15.4% APR). Paying Â£164.28 p/m.LOC: $9,075.92 (11%-ish APR - this seems to fluctuate so I'm putting it at the high end). This is approximately Â£5,600 (rounded up a smidge). Set aside Â£50 p/m for this, but it's not enough to cover monthly CDN payments so needs to go up. I've currently got 3 months worth of payments left in the bank for this, so am saving up to throw another three months' worth at it at the moment.Total: Â£14,495.90This is actually lower now than when I did it at the beginning of the year, fortunately, but still unsustainable as it stands, in my view, seeing as it's more than my take-home pay. O.oThe order of payment is what's frustrating me. Highest interest rate first, for obvious reasons? Or lowest balance, to clear it and continue the motivation to continue?I'm leaning towards the highest interest at the moment because it's the payment that will help me get ahead the most as a snowball payment. Â£35 a month is neither here nor there as a snowball at this point, and ultimately IS making headway on that card, as it's Â£10 above the minimum.I know I can't ask if this is the 'right' decision because it's my decision, ultimately, but it seems the most sensible and what will save me the most money in the long run, and I think that's what it boils down to in the end.Â I'm just frustrated that I'm STILL in this situation, that's all. I have no one to blame but myself, obviously, but am trying not to be too hard on myself about it all. It is what it is. I am also considering, once I reach January or Â£2500, whichever comes first, applying for the loan offer through the bank, paying off the CCs and snowballing from there. I'd have a second loan payment, but it would be Â£120 a month less than I'm currently paying out. That's a decent snowball. But I'm not going to do anything until I get to January and see where I stand after the holidays. It would be silly to do anything before that. I'm going to play with my budgets again and see what I can manage for any extra payments until then too. This is also why I'm hoping for some extra shifts at the second job. A colleague yesterday was taking what he could as well, as he has a son in med school to pay for. And he works f/t for a local council!Anyway, please weigh in with any thoughts, suggestions, options, etc. More than happy to hear from you!"},
{"title": "New job!", "date": "Sunday 28 July 2019", "text": "ndcn.co.ukWell, a new part-time one, at least! I mentioned in my last post that I was considering applying at the local Spar, as they have a 'staff wanted' sign posted on the doors. So, before I talked myself out of it, I called and spoke with the manager briefly and dropped off a CV the next day.I followed up a couple of days later and had my 'interview' this morning at 9:00 (yes, on Sunday). It was much less an interview than a 'welcome to the team', and I have a new, 6-hr per week job. I will be working 3-9 on Saturdays, with the potential to gather a few more hours if people are on holiday, over bank holidays, etc. I estimate that this will give me an extra Â£175 (after tax) per month, based on a steady 24 hours per month. This is quite reasonable as, along with what my sister is currently paying me back, I should be able to save/pay down my debt substantially through December.Â I've of course added these estimates to my budget and fiddled mightily with numbers, but the numbers will change depending on how I feel and what I actually receive. We get paid bi-weekly too, which was nice to hear. I think I need to think of it as 'extra' and make sure it goes to the right places (CCs, for example).I'm quite pleased, actually, as this still gives me some time off on the weekend which is important, but also a bit of flexibility if I'm able to take on some extra hours. And I'm also very happy that I won't be putting any extra mileage/wear & tear on the car.Hooray!I took my car into the garage on Friday for a bit of an investigation - I'd spotted some oil and a puddle of water on the floor of the garage several days before and wanted to get it checked out in case it was the precursor to a larger issue. I took it back to the guys I got it from and they put it on the hoist for a look-see. No problems with water - levels were where theyÂ should be, so it was most likely condensation from the air con (although I rarely use it). I haven't seen any since so that's not a concern any longer, but the oil was because of a small leak with the seal around the part where you do oil changes (the mechanical term escapes me) and some seepage around the block in the engine. They're going to repair it next Friday, so that's good stuff. Hopefully, it will be a reasonable expense, but I wanted to get it done more as a preventive measure than anything - if I can spend Â£100 to save Â£1,000 down the road, it makes sense to me. Otherwise, I've had zero issues so far. It really is a pleasure to drive that car!I've roped my neighbour into my book plotting/character motivation. I need a male (or maleS) perspective on a couple of things, so I picked his brain the other night. He had some good suggestions but said he'd ask around and see what he could get from other men. I'm really like one of the suggestions he made, however, and I'm very interested to see what will come back. He stopped by yesterday when he got home to give me something to chew on that his friend had suggested - I don't love it, but it's something to consider and I've written it down so I have it at hand. I think he's quite enjoying it, actually! Ha ha!Otherwise, it's payday tomorrow (hooray!) and I hope my budget this month isn't as far off as it was last month! I have no idea what was going on with that, but I've made it through and here we are.Have a lovely Sunday everyone!"},
{"title": "To apply or not to apply? This is my question.", "date": "Saturday 20 July 2019", "text": "how2become.comI woke up this morning frustrated at my continuing situation of languishing in the pit of debt. One that I have, I admit, dug freely and enthusiastically by myself.With Brexit looming (again. Still.) at the end of October - that ship being helmed and steered in some kind of direction (potentially straight into the 'no deal' iceberg) by the figure of, most likely, Boris Johnson ... *ahem* ... -Â and pundits and 'experts' on both sides of the aisle expressing concerns about food shortages, empty shelves, jobs disappearing, etc., I am starting to pay a lot more attention to what I currently owe (better late than never, I hope?). Taking on another loan in order to pay off my current ones somehow doesn't seem the best route at this point, but as I owe more than I make in a year, it's raised its head more urgently the past several weeks.I could get a new job that pays me what I'm worth (or at least somewhat better), but despite my moaning, I'm not quite ready for that just yet, nor will it really free up a lot more money for me each month. While I enjoy my weekends, for the most part, I don't do much because I simply can't afford to. It's why I spend so much time reading. Apart from enjoying it so much, it's a cheap/free hobby and what I can afford.To that end, I'm considering a second job. I've applied several times at the bookstore in Ringwood without success, unfortunately. Not necessarily a bad thing, as I found it a bit of a dangerous place to work before, what with decent product discounts. They are hiring a weekend bookseller again, however, 13.5 hrs a week, every weekend. I am reluctant because, a) my writing group meets on a Saturday, and I enjoy that far too much to step away from it even occasionally unless I genuinely can't avoid it, and b) the drive to Ringwood on weekends as well as during the week. It's only a half-hour, but wouldn't it be better to not to have to drive every single day, too?So, with that in mind, I was fairly pleased to see a 'help wanted' kind of sign in the local Spar (a small convenience-store kind of place) which is a five-minute walk from the flat (!). Various hours which I'm sure I could work around without too much of an issue...hm. The minimum wage for those of us aged 26+ is Â£8.21 as of April (sadly, almost what I make in my f/t job if I break it down), which is fine for a second job. But do I want to kill myself for Â£300 +/- a month? Will it be worth it? Yes, IF I put the money I make towards hammering down my debt. There's no driving involved, so no extra petrol or wear and tear on the car; the shop is only open until 9 p.m. so just about my bedtime. I'm going to tweak my CV and call in at some point to see if I can talk to someone about it.I want a flat and a cat(s) and some savings and be able to travel a little bit/have some fun. I don't have any of that at the moment. If it takes me six to eight months to clear the majority of my debt, then so be it. Will it absolutely suck? It absolutely will. But as I have no social life now, it will make no difference in that respect at all. I'm feeling very 'sacrificial' at the moment, but who knows? I may wake up tomorrow and feel very differently. I'm just trying to be practical, understanding that this debt is wholly mine and I hate it and I am determined to pay it off instead of taking another route, which I refuse to do. I want to retain a decent credit rating.Back to working with the public (pardon me, but ugh). It doesn't feel particularly good, but working full-time does limit my p/t options somewhat, so this feels a bit like an opportunity to take advantage of.I realise I'm the only one who can make the decision. The voice of Gail Vaz-Oxlade keeps rattling around my head, 'If you have debt, you need to do whatever you have to, to get rid of it.' I'm paraphrasing a bit, but that's the gist. I've tried to shift a few things online, but people only seem uber-keen if it's free, or maybe I'm just using the wrong sites. At any rate, I need to do SOMETHING and right now, this seems to be an option. There's no guarantee I'll even get a job, but I can at least try. A computer-generated 'staff wanted' sign smacks a bit of desperation, so I think I have at least a shot. They're obviously not inundated with resumes...Otherwise, work has picked up a little bit this week with the director back in the office. Not by much, but a little, so that's something. Still no word about a review, though.I got a free vacuum cleaner yesterday from a colleague who'd bought a new one and was going to donate her old one - a Dyson! It's a bit of a bigger and heavier upright than the one we originally had (and gave to Roomie E's colleagues when we moved in here). The previous tenant of our new flat left us his old one, but it's not great so I'm thrilled with the 'new' one. It had a fairly large hole in the hose, but I've put some packing tape around it and it should be fine. A Dyson - fantastic!I was supposed to be at the cafe for a shift this morning but begged off yesterday because I've had such exceptionally poor sleep this week. I'm not sure why, but I keep waking up during the night, having slightly disturbing/disruptive dreams, etc. I felt utterly wretched yesterday and was actually a bit concerned about the drive home. It was fine, not too busy, but I very nearly took myself to bed at 6:45 (not kidding!!). I pushed myself to stay up until 9:00, and while I woke up once last night, I managed to fall asleep again and didn't wake up again until 7:00. I feel much better today, but just couldn't face a morning of coffee & tea making, no matter how much I enjoy it.It was our downstairs neighbour's 95th birthday yesterday. I bought a card and a couple of cupcakes for her from both of us. Her son and his husband were here for a couple of days, and she showed me the decorations they'd put up for her when I went to see her this morning. She'd had 20 cards, which is a pretty substantial number considering her age, and they'd gone to a party last night where she'd seen some friends she's known for about 70 years! Amazing.The book is making very slow progress. I've stalled again, although I can feel the ideas and thoughts bubbling away inside. Frustrated is the best way to describe how I'm feeling about it. I KNOW it's there, I can quite literally feel it, but I can't seem to get it out how I want it. I'm quite probably overthinking it all...Anyway, I hope you all have a lovely weekend. The weather here is finally doing 'summer', at least for the next ten days or so, so that's something."},
{"title": "Mid-July update", "date": "Sunday 14 July 2019", "text": "every-tuesday.comWell, we're getting there, piece by piece of stuff around the place. There are still things in the garage and the living room but as it belongs to Roomie E, I'm not touching it. I'm more or less happy with things the way they are at the moment and am just going to live with things the way they are for a bit before doing anything more drastic than moving things around a room.I got rid of two pairs of shoes on Friday, which removed a bag from my bedroom floor. They weren't in awful condition and as I hadn't worn them for probably two years, I just shoved them in a bag and did it before I thought any more about it. There's a shoe & textile recycling bin near the office and I put them in there. Part of my reluctance of getting rid of things is that much can't be recycled and I hate throwing things in the garbage, although I know that's the only place some of it can go.I'm also reluctant to get rid of everything pretty and fun because I want some things for my own place eventually, but current space is at a premium and I'm feeling a bit squeezed. Regardless, I like the flat and am finding my way into a new routine although I still feel a bit 'off', and I can't quite figure out why. I feel generally restless and have no idea why.Roomie E has been away visiting her family in Italy for a week and comes back on Tuesday so I've had the place to myself which has been really nice. It's slightly small for two people sharing, and is more conducive to a single person or a couple. I can't afford it on my salary (even without debt payments), which is disappointing but is on par with Southern rental prices, unfortunately.I'm struggling a little bit with my writing as well. After a couple of months of writer's block, I started again and pushed ahead reasonably well before stumbling to a halt again. I've got ideas but adding them in where I need/want them to go means almost a total rewrite from the beginning and I'm not sure that's what I need to do. I WANT to move forward, regardless of what winds up on the paper, so I think that's what I should focus on. I did buy some cue cards and am trying to figure out the best way to work up an 'old school' timeline. It hasn't got very far either. Ha ha! I'm frustrated because I feel the need to write, I just can't quite DO it or get it organised to do it. I'm probably overthinking it all.In the meantime, I whizzed through the last three of four books in The Dales Detective Agency cosy series by Julia Chapman: Date with Malice, Date with Mystery and Date with Poison. This is set in the beautiful Yorkshire Dales, somewhere I'm keen to visit, and the fourth book is neatly tying up threads begun in the first, Date with Death. I wish I could write like Ms Chapman! Fantastic characters, beautiful descriptions of the dales, great mysteries and I'm hoping the next in the series will tie up all the ends, although that will mean the series is at an end and I'm not sure I'm ready for that. No 4 came out 27 June and I finished it on Friday, so it means at least a year's wait. *Sigh*Work was very quiet last week. The director was on holiday, as was the office manager, and there wasn't much to do. By Friday we were feeling quite bored, so I think we're kind of looking forward to tomorrow when the director is back. We had fish and chips for lunch on Friday which was a nice treat, and quite delicious.Â I'm still waiting for my review.Anyhoo, I've been contemplating starting running again, and today purchased twelve months of online yoga for Â£12 via Groupon to give that a try.Otherwise, I've been pretty quiet around here, just concentrating on the new flat and trying to get a routine of sorts in place for my days off. It'll come, it's only been three weeks."},
{"title": "Phew! New digs, finally.", "date": "Sunday 30 June 2019", "text": "stolenandmissingpetsalliance.co.ukPhew! It's done. Another new flat, unpacking, settling in - all that's still happening, but more or less we're under control and really pleased overall.Â It was a long, tough move, despite having the bonus of a garage at either end. I am VERY glad I had the week off for this.We met our new landlords Wednesday afternoon at the estate agency and collected the garage key so we could start moving things. We did four runs in the car that evening, and the garage door broke the first time we tried to shut it - the cable that assists with lifting snapped (it was just time, it was completely rusted and frayed. It wasn't anything we did). We advised the agency and the landlord came by to have a look. They are a really nice, reasonable couple so I didn't expect any grief and didn't get any. He was perfectly accepting that it was just one of those things. It's since been repaired.Thursday we had the cleaner in and did several more runs that afternoon, clearing out most of the boxes and 'little stuff' (of which there was/is a phenomenal amount). Out of one garage, into the other.Â We hired a van on Friday for the big stuff and return it only 5 hours later (!), so that was a huge accomplishment. We were thrilled to hear that we'd have the key early and could get started a day early (our official move-in day was 22 June). Roomie E had a couple of her colleagues come by for an hour and they helped immensely, bringing the beds upstairs, helping with boxes, etc. I've never ached so much in my life. It was one thing to move it back and forth from car to garage, but the new garage is a bit of a hike to the flat and then there's a flight of stairs...I was sore for DAYS!We met all our new (immediate) neighbours, however. Derek, who lives downstairs and one flat over; Margaret, a fully-independent, amazing 95-year old who has turned the communal gardens into something absolutely glorious over the 30-years she's been here; and Charlie, who was a star and made us a cup of tea.We are more or less settled, but literally, have only one storage closet in the place (we had four in the last flat). So there's stuff everywhere, despite getting rid of stuff. I've set up another box for donations and I have no doubt we'll fill it up.My plants don't seem to be adjusting as well as we are and I can't quite figure out what the problem is. Where they currently are, in front of the window, isn't ideal for winter because the radiator is there and they'll dry out. But that's a few months away yet, andÂ  I can't really fuss with them too much because we still have stuff all over the place. I'll just have to wait until we're more organised. They're okay where they are for the time being, but it's obviously not ideal. Anyway.So, here's where we are now. It's still a work in progress, so please ignore the boxes, blank walls, etc.Rear gardenLiving room. Those windows!Opposite sideEntry foyer and stairsKitchenFront garden - the kitchen overlooks this.My room, stuffed to the gills with...stuff. Feeling a bit claustrophobic, but it's the same stuff I had in the last one, just 1/3 the space to put it all in (I've spared you a glimpse under the bed, however)!I'm actually pleased with the smaller space of my room. I don't believe there's a better way that I can set it up I just need to declutter, so this is all a really good exercise in 'what brings me joy' (if you haven't read/watched Marie Kondo, I recommend it - she's quite amazing).We currently have no Internet but our 'star' neighbour Charlie has given us his wi-fi password and we're piggybacking until ours is set up, which is currently set up for Tuesday.I was back at work last Tuesday and it was a loooooong week. Fortunately, the boss is away from next Wednesday for 10 days so we'll have a bit of peace & quiet.My hospital visit of the 14th went well enough. There were four people besides me in the room - two nurses, the doctor (obviously) and another consultant. Wow. Awkward, but carry on...I wound up having a local anaesthetic ('there') and a bit of a reaction to it, but the doctor managed to get what he needed, proving that I actually hadn't needed to have a general the three previous times...ahem. Anyway, the doctor was a huge GoT fan so there was a lot of discussion about that. You know, what are you going to do when you're literally 'in that position'? Hoping, however, that this is the last time.Anyway, outside of that excitement, I have been going to bed at 9 (earlier than Margaret - not kidding!) and sleeping THROUGH THE NIGHT since we've been here. That means about 8 solid hours a night, which is quite amazing. I also wasn't at work for most of that so I think that speaks volumes. Anyway, I'm not complaining at all, I'm thrilled. Obviously a good move. :)Happy Canada Day weekend everyone! I'll be looking for some red & white flowers for the office tomorrow as my acknowledgement."},
{"title": "June - and moving!", "date": "Thursday 13 June 2019", "text": "getalternative.comWord of the month: Feel (the feelings)I'm on holidays starting today until 25 June. It's a miserable, wet, windy and cold June day (welcome, summer!) so after a couple of quick errands this morning, I decided to just take time to catch up on some emails and try to get a bit more organised for the move next week.I have a hospital appointment tomorrow, so that will be most of my day gone, a shift at the cafe on Saturday morning, and then a few days to get the last of the bits & pieces organised for the move next Saturday. We're pretty organised, really, and I suppose it's just a matter of hoping the weather is clear(er) so that things don't get too wet and soggy on the day.We never got our job reviews last month. One of our surveyors went sick, so a few jobs had to be rearranged (unforeseen, so okay...sort of). We didn't get an acknowledgement or apology until a couple of days later, so I wasn't particularly impressed. It was rescheduled and then cancelled. Again. And again, without acknowledgement or apology. So, I'm still waiting if no one else is. All things I'm taking note of for when I legitimately start looking for a new job.To that end, I've been feeling particularly tetchy and frustrated at work for the past couple of months. So I made a 'proactivity' list in my handy dandy journal, things that I need to do to stay forward focused: looking at evening/online courses, completing a National Career Service 'Skills Health Test' (check!), updating my CV, clearing clutter, writing my book, etc. Things like that. Taking little steps forward is better than feeling like you're stuck and going nowhere. Or worse, backwards!But the biggest thing happening right now is, obviously, the move. We've got someone coming to collect the sofas early next week, the cleaner next Thursday, carpets are being done next Friday - when we also pick up our moving van - and then Saturday we need to ensure everything is out and the keys at the estate agents by 4:00.Â We've already started moving boxes and things into our garage so the place is looking a bit bare. We're collecting the key for the garage at the new flat next Thursday and will start moving things over there then (we are SO lucky to have this as an option!). Friday will be packing up the van and moving what's left over there, apart from beds, etc., and we should be finished well before 4:00 on Saturday. There should only be one trip with the van and as it has to be back for noon on Saturday, we should be absolutely fine if we start first thing. Our neighbours across the hall volunteered their services and Nissan Pathfinder for assistance if required, which is really kind!We've learned that moving on a Saturday in England is completely inconvenient - no one seems to work on weekends (carpet guys, cleaner, Internet techs, van rentals...). Noted for the next one!Mrs May has stepped down as PM but remains in charge until a new leader is selected, which is in process. All the hopefuls are on about Brexit, but I am expecting much egg on faces in the run-up to the new leave date - Hallowe'en! I think he (because the female hopefuls haven't made it through the initial round of conservative party leadership votes) is kidding himself that he can do better. There's plenty of strutting and preening happening, and lots of overconfident waffling and tooting of horns, but the EU has already said they won't be making any concessions, changes or other agreements on what has already been agreed. So it's that or nothing. Good luck!Anyway. I've also been coming up with some ideas for my book, which is great but means having to more or less rewrite everything I've already got down which is a bit frustrating. I'm opting at this point to just keep notes and peck away at Chapters 1 and 2 so that I can get the initial characters and potential suspects sketched out. The point is to get it all down on paper, knowing that it's going to be really rubbish/rough, and then go back and review, amend, rewrite, etc. Patience and persistence, right?I keep getting tempted by 'preapproved' loan offers from my bank. I was playing with some numbers today, but need to just stop doing that and focus on reducing my debt the old-fashioned way for the next few months. I'm not entirely ruling out another loan, but I'm going to see how much I can hammer it down before making any further decisions about it. Plus crunch some numbers and see if it'll just make things worse.Wish me luck for the move and I'll update from the 'other side' - with photos!"},
{"title": "May post!", "date": "Monday 27 May 2019", "text": "shutterbean.comWord of the month: NourishWell, it might as well be June, really, at this point. Phew! Today is the first full weekend day off I've had to post all month. It's our late May spring bank holiday and, boy!, do I feel like I need a full day to do not a lot.The first weekend of May I was housesitting.The following weekend I went to Wales with my cousin to visit our auntie and uncle, then cleaned for my friend at the AirBnB (I took the Friday & Monday off - and am glad I did!).The next weekend I worked at the cafe on Saturday and cleaned the AirBnB.Saturday, I met a couple of Canadian friends out near Gatwick Airport to spend a few hours catching up and wandering around the beautiful gardens of Nymans Gardens, a National Trust property. I hadn't seen them in 10 (!!) years, and am thrilled we were able to make a meeting happen. It was a 6.5 hr (return) train journey for me, but well worth it. They're here to bird watch, visit gardens and have a holiday, albeit it just for a week (this time). I met them when we all lived in Whitehorse. They've just recently moved to Nova Scotia from BC. It was a very long day (for all of us), but very, very worth it.Yesterday I did my final clean at the AirBnB. The house is (actually, genuinely) sold now, and this is the last time I'll spend any time there. Quite sad, really, and our friend is genuinely depressed about leaving it. It's the best thing that could happen, though, as she's struggling to maintain it so this is the best outcome. She's going to spend a year in Norfolk, then make a decision where she wants to be. That times perfectly with our new lease (although that reverts to an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) - month to month - lease after 12 months) and my continued desire to live alone. Anyway, that's over a year away at this point, so there's no point speculating on what will happen in a year, although a year is both a very long and very short time away.Today I am puttering. I've swept the garage so it's ready to take packed boxes from the flat, dropped Roomie E at work, and don't really intend to do much more, other than sitting down to do some writing. I haven't done any of note since the end of March (!), so I'm doing a bit of rewriting of bits that currently are too convenient/no longer make sense/etc. At least I've been getting some ideas popping up recently, and I think that's because the move is, for the most part, all sorted.Phew.Carpet cleaners booked. Cleaner booked. Furniture bought from the current tenant at the new place (he offered when we were looking around! Ha ha!). We need a van yet, but Roomie E is going to take care of that over the next couple of days. We're not getting movers this time - we're going to do it ourselves. Cheaper but harder work. Anyway, wish us luck!I've taken holidays from 13-24 June which covers the entire moving arc because I don't want to get too stressed about it. Also, because Roomie E gets only until 6pm on moving day (!!) to get as much done as she can, I think a lot of unpacking and set up will be up to me. So that's fine.Tomorrow is my long, long overdue review at work (they were waiting on the Brexit results...and finally got tired of it), and I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to it. I suppose I am, as I'm not really expecting anything dramatic or unexpected to come up. It's just nice to sit down and hear what they have to say, really. I think I'd know by now if I was doing a crummy job!Brexit continues to wreak havoc - Thursday's EU elections decimated the Conservative and Labour Parties (no surprise). The Conservatives returned the worst results since, I think, 1894!! Nigel Farage - one of people behind the original Brexit movement - and his new Brexit Party, formed a scant 6 weeks ago, have raced to the top of the heap. He promises to deliver Brexit (as a No Deal option only, apparently), but I think he's dreaming. I would love nothing more than to see the smug, self-satisfied grin wiped off his face.I'm not sure how this new EU parliament is going to go forward. France has gone slightly right-wing with Le Pen, although only by a percentage point or two and Macron remains President; Merkel slipped in again, followed by the Greens (hooray); and the Greens and Lib Dems made great strides here in the UK as well which is good news. It's almost a 50/50 pro/leave Brexit mix, however, in Brussels now. The next several years will be very interesting and possibly very unpleasant.Mrs May resigned on Friday. 7 June is her last day as PM. I wish good luck to the incoming PM, whoever s/he might be. I'd also like to remind them of all the other issues that have been ignored/forgotten over the past 29 months and ask that they please focus their attention to those as well."},

{"title": "April mid-month update!", "date": "Saturday 20 April 2019", "text": "whatsonrenfrewshire.co.ukHAPPY EASTER EVERYONE!It's been a busy two weeks around here, mostly revolving around the issue of moving house. I had made it quite clear that I wanted to move alone this time because it was time, and I wanted to be walking distance from work.That only lasted a week when I saw my very first (and only) studio flat. It wasn't awful but it was, um, compact (compared to what we have; to be fair, I would adapt), although had a decent bathroom and separate, if very tiny, kitchen. It was clean, tidy and had double glazed windows and a new, updated electric heater in the living space. It was, in a word, fine. EXCEPT (!!!) it didn't come with a washing machine or fridge freezer. Quoi? I would have to supply my own (this is apparently how it's done when renting, but every place I've looked at since has both, so not convinced).Â So, on top of my deposit of Â£780 (expected) and the letting agency fees (Â£418!!!), I'd have to fork out for appliances. Even second hand, I'd have to arrange delivery so would be looking at around Â£150 for both (at the high end). Which makes Â£1,348 before I've even moved in...I had Â£1255 total. I was angry and frustrated by this, so thought perhaps renting a room might be the way to go, with all bills included. I also mentioned to Roomie E that I wasn't able to go on my own which apparently threw off plans being made with others, which have since settled. I spent a few days feeling frustrated and annoyed and really off until I finally realised what the problem was - I don't want to live with ANYONE, but I can't afford not to at this point. Moving into a room in someone's house would simply mean learning new routines, new characters, new habits, etc. If I have to continue living with someone, it might as well be someone I like and whose routines I already know. Our schedules conflict somewhat, but that's just the way it is.We are, however, trying to find somewhere in the same area and have already seen one flat in the next village over (right opposite the beach!). I don't love it, but I wouldn't be unhappy with it either if it turned out to be the best option. We have two others lined up today, though, slightly cheaper, both with garages (!) and would mean I don't have to adjust my commute to any great extent. I like one better than the other, although I can't quite explain why without having seen either...hmm!Adding to the stress was the receipt of our latest electricity bill...Â£840!!! (Estimated) It's a good thing I was sitting down when Roomie E told me. I was, as the English say, gobsmacked. We managed to get a meter reading, however, and the bill fell by over Â£130, but that was still another Â£700 we had to fork out! My share took almost a quarter of the money I've managed to save for deposits, etc., leaving me quite depressed.So it's been a bit of a rollercoaster this month in respect of finances. I've not been eating well either, which doesn't help, but I'm stuck in that cycle of not eating/exercising well so feeling tired & down, and then just feeling like toast for dinner, you know? Ugh. Unsettling. Upsets to my routine play utter havoc with my eating habits.The same day I had seen the studio flat and realised my hopes of 'single living' had been dashed, my sister asked for a Â£575 loan. She was waiting for a payment from the council that hadn't come through as she'd hoped. So this added to my anger, but I couldn't NOT give her the money, but it is definitely the last time, particularly as she already still owes me money. I got just over half of it back the following week, but still...I've been feeling a bit better the past week, but won't feel entirely back to normal until we've found a place and have moved in if I'm honest. I packed three boxes yesterday of bits and pieces in my room, and have a box of things ready to go to the charity shop (more to come, I hope), so it's a start. Packing up the 'things' that aren't necessary to living at this point will help and if we find a place close enough, making multiple trips in the car won't be too much of a trial, which will hopefully save a bit of cash on movers.I'm cleaning for my friend three times this week, so that will go towards petrol (which has jumped almost 10p per litre in two weeks - agh!) and some groceries until payday. But the weather this weekend is glorious - up to 23C today, so that will help a little bit. We've got the flat viewings starting at 11:00 and then I have an appointment with a psychic this afternoon. I've been on the waitlist since December for this, so am really looking forward to it.I also asked about staff reviews at work as we've been waiting since January for them. They are going ahead, the MDs were just waiting for Brexit results, but as that's now delayed - again - until end of October, they're going to arrange to get them done. Finally!On Tuesday I had a telephone appointment with an adviser from the National Career Services (job centre). I wanted a bit of a review of my CV and she gave me some really good advice, also saying it's more or less already how it should look but can always use some tweaks. She sent me some links to job sites, so I'm going to spend some time over the next several months tweaking the CV and looking out for other job opportunities. I'm not yet ready to move on, but this feels like the best first step to shake off the apathy that can set in.I've only read one full book in the past couple of weeks! I read and read and read for NetGalley and - I can't believe I'm saying this - I think I burned myself out! I'm struggling to find the enthusiasm to read for fun now, and still have a few to read for review. However, I know it's only a glitch and I'll soon be back at it. The last one I read was 'Murder at the Grand Raj Palace' by Vaseem Khan. This is one of my absolute favourite series, set in Mumbai and with an elephant sidekick. If you like No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, you'll love this. There's some definite character development so I suggest you start at the beginning with 'The Unexpected Inheritance of Inspector Chopra'.April rolls on - I've only JUST written up (part of) my journal for the month. May is going to be really busy. I've got a long weekend of house sitting; a visit to Wales; moving; Dogstival...phew! Plus packing and sorting in my evenings. But I'm looking forward to it.Have a lovely long weekend!"},
{"title": "April just around the corner - changes abound!", "date": "Sunday 31 March 2019", "text": "theriffrepeater.comWord of the Month: Finance(s)! Â£$And here we are - more or less - in a new month. Again! Is it just because we're getting older that time seems to whiz by faster than it did when we were younger? I don't know. But another month has sped by regardless.Brexit was a crash and burn on Friday. A German friend of mine described it perfectly: Clusterf**k. Leave, stay, deal, no-deal - we've paid an exorbitant price for it over the past 2.5 years AND a 'healthy' raise for the Parlimentarians just a few months ago. Poor loves. All that 'hard' work and nothing to show for it. If I worked that 'hard' for a result like that, I'd be fired. Perhaps that's at the back of their minds?? This whole fiasco has taken over entirely, leaving hundreds of other issues forgotten, languishing, overlooked, underfunded, etc. to the detriment of every single one of us. Anyhoo, we now have until April 12 to come up with a new scheme/plot/desperate attempt (or not). Any further time requested after that threatens the current 'plan' as EU elections are imminent (potential changes to the current committee/task force).WELL DONE, ALL.Â Anyway, in better news, it's SPRING! My birthday is on Tuesday and the weather bodes quite well - warm-ish but showery. Typical, but nonetheless, I'm quite looking forward to it.Â I have absolutely no plans, but I might pop into a shop at lunchtime and treat myself to something new. My wardrobe is feeling dull, old, flat, etc. Some really pretty things around at the moment and I'm torn between handing over my CC and hauling some new duds home (that I honestly do need) and being overly cautious because I do have other things to attend to.The biggest reason for this is that as well as the non-event of Brexit happening on Friday, we also got ourÂ notice on the flat. Our move date is (before) 31 May. ItÂ wasn't entirely unexpected, what with a one-year lease. The landlord has decided to sell. Prior to that, however, the damp proofing works need to be done to take care of the damp/mould issue we've been experiencing. Our landlady wants to do it once we've left, which is really the most sensible solution for all involved as the works are apparently quite disruptive for about 14 days. Roomie E and I will be going our separate ways, as this is my opportunity to move closer to work, and her staying in the current area makes more sense for her job.Â This means I need to register with a new estate agency which also means additional fees. I don't believe ourÂ current agency lets properties in Ringwood, at least I've never seen anything advertised by them. I'll be missing the new legislation banning letting fees, however, as that comes into effect 1 June and I'll have arranged everything and moved prior to that. The only thing I can do to mitigate that cost somewhat is to findÂ an agency with 'more reasonable' fees. I can't avoid it, but I will have my deposit coming back to me and that will offset the costs (movers, cleaners, fees, etc. Geez...) that I will likely have to put on my CC.Â I'm looking at a studio flat, nothing glamourous, but all I'm able to afford. I'm hoping costs will even out a little bit, as the idea is to not drive as often and save money on petrol in that respect (currently about Â£60 for almost a month). Plus, walking to work - about 20 mins from town centre - every day is bound to be better for the waistline, too! There's a big Lidl five minutes walk from the estate, too, so I'll be able to budget my food a bit more tightly as well. These flats come up semi-regularly - there was a bit of a flurry in the last two weeks - so I'm not worried, although I am kind of hoping a little one-bed I saw on the High Street last year comes up again. Who knows? I'm going to start looking and that's all I can do.I'm going to start collecting boxes for my tchotkes and bits and stuff and have asked if I'm able to start storing some things at the office (yes). I'm going to declutter, as usual, and a move is a perfect opportunity. I already have a box designated for donations, it's just a matter of dropping the items off at a charity shop (repeatedly!).My mobile phone died, as I mentioned in my last post, so I tried again to get a PAC number from my provider. Of course, they'll try anything to keep you, so I was quite proud of myself for making them work a little bit for that privilege. I kept firm to my budget (less than Â£20 a month), and initially got my same data package - 4GB, unlimited texts/minutes - for Â£9 a month instead of my current Â£16, but worthless if the phone doesn't work. So I got a new phone & current data package for a fixed monthly price of Â£19 (24-month contract). Ideally, I'd get SIM-only, but I can't even do that if my phone doesn't work, so I'm keeping that in mind for the end of the current contract. I've actually not had any issues with my provider, so am happy enough to stay with them, and am pleased they spent so much time trying to keep my business.While it seems I'm spending more on my monthly package, I'm actually not. I consistently went over my Â£16 monthly 'limit', at least doubling it most months, so I've capped the overage on the new phone at Â£0 for that. It should keep things consistent. The phone is last year's model (who cares) and is massive compared to the old one. I've finally got it set up and am getting the hang of it. I'm not tethered to my phone and almost literally use it only for texting or WhatsApp'ing. My data package is massive for that, but that's what I was offered, so whatever. I had 17 voice mails waiting for me - ha ha! It means that I need to collect phone numbers and stuff again, but that won't be too difficult.April's word, as you'll see, is 'finances'. I need to focus on these this month, whether it's redirecting some funds elsewhere, combining accounts, looking to cash out my veryveryvery tiny investment to put towards debt (literally Â£100), where I can make more, moving costs. All that good/bad/ugly stuff. My sister owes me about Â£200 but I can't expect that anytime soon so while that's going on my list, I'm not officially 'counting' it at the moment.I made my first payment on my 0% CC yesterday too. I'm so used to thinking 'but interest still needs to be added', I almost didn't. Then I was like, 'BUT THERE ISN'T ANY!! YAHOO!!' so one month down (a portion of my deposit refund WILL be going towards paying down CCs).I had a dentist appointment yesterday and my teeth are all clean and shiny now. I can see why the hygienists prefer the ultrasonic picks - they're fast! I'm not overly keen on them, but my first experience with one wasn't great as it seemed to hurt my teeth, but dental technology has advanced greatly since then, so there were no issues at all except for a very sensitive wisdom tooth, which she had to do by hand. So, all good, with a reminder to 'floss every day'. I paid cash and because they had no change - usually take cards - I have a Â£2 credit for my next appointment in October. Ha ha!While I was in my appointment, I had my car washed by the crew in the parking lot. The fellow did a fab job (Â£5) and Pascale looks loooooovely. She was looking very grimy.My book still has legs but the forward momentum has stalled at Chapter 7. I'm feeling a bit stuck now. I've resorted to vignettes of different scenarios with different characters interacting to see if I can get more of a feel of motivation/character/personality, etc. Some surprises, but it's also fun. I think I need to figure out the murderer, motive, some clues to add, red herrings, etc. because it's a bit flat at the moment. Anyhow, it's early days yet, so having something is better than absolutely nothing!Happy spring, everyone!"},
{"title": "March rolls to an end!", "date": "Sunday 24 March 2019", "text": "It's happened awfully quickly, as it does every year. Already we're a quarter of the way through the new year. The Government is in shambles while we hurtle towards BrexitÂ  (which has now been granted an extension from 29 March toÂ 12 April) and the Conservative Party eats itself. They're howling for Mrs May's resignation and plotting a coup now because of the \"wretched\" job she's done to this point, conveniently forgetting that they're also the ones who put us here in the first place and that literally, no one has come up with anything better.Anyhoo.It's a glorious spring day today and the weather bodes well for the next few days, so I'll be out for my lunchtime walks again starting tomorrow. The temperatures are supposed to be in the low teens with lots of sunshine. Fab! I take myself out for a 40-min walk which seems to be the perfect mid-day break. Today, the windows in the flat are wide open and the heat has finally gone off. No way do we want another bill like the last one!Our fridge/freezer hasn't been working properly for a couple of weeks and we had the tech in last Wednesday. Apparently, some ice or something got inside the freezer portion and has messed up the inner workings (or something). So today we're going to be cooking up what's left in the fridge because we have to shut the whole thing off for two days and leave it standing open. The tech will be returning at some point with the replacement part but in the meantime, we're going to be without a fridge. I can take some items to work and keep them in the fridge there, but not everything, so there's going to be a significant amount of eating today, I think. We've had to dispose of a lot of stuff from the freezer as well, unfortunately, as it wasn't salvageable.My new CC balance transfer happened last week - hooray! There was a Â£25 service fee, and my first statement will be with me on 17 April so I'll know then what my minimum payments are. Knowing the balance has 0% interest is amazingly calming, as the MC was the one card I wanted to tackle this year, so I consider that a semi-win for the time being.Have been pecking away at my book too and have reached Page 39. It's neither particularly murderous nor mysterious (although the murder has happened), and I don't have any idea where it's going. It seems to take me all over the place, but I'm mostly glad it's still got legs and forward momentum. I'm considering that as a 'win'. To help me with my characters a bit, I've been writing little vignettes with them interacting with other characters so I can figure out how they'd re/act to different situations. It seems to help solidify their motivations and personalities a bit, which will help the overall feel of the whole book.I've slowed down in my reading, I seem to have lost momentum with it. I'm reading a couple of non-fiction books at the moment and haven't managed to engage fully with either of them, although they're quite good. I think I'm concentrating on my own book and my own process that I'm just not really focussing on the others. I still have almost 20 to read and review, however, so I'll need to get back to that sooner rather than later, as I have so many books I want to read this year.Our council tax is going down as of 1 April (!!) by Â£40. I am NOT complaining. It puts Â£18 a month back in my pocket every month and I'm perfectly fine with that.My mobile phone seems to be finished. I have no network connection and haven't been able to text or phone since the beginning of the month (obviously it's not a concern as I've only been fussing about this since last Thursday). I took the SIM card out and did a factory reset, losing all my data, but that didn't help, so am taking the phone with me on Monday and will take it to a phone shop in Ringwood to see if they can help. I called my carrier to ask for the PAC number but it was entirely unhelpful because I'm apparently still in-contract and need to give them 30-days notice that I want to leave. I try not to get frustrated with the call centre people, but India's a very long way away and it would be nice to have someone a bit closer to discuss this stuff with. So, for the moment, I have a phone (5+ yrs old) that I can't use and am paying for a service I can't access. It's 'only' Â£16 a month, but I'm exceptionally frustrated. My colleague is going to bring me her old phone on Monday to see if that works.Â Next Saturday I've got my teeth cleaning, and am also going to have the car washed while I'm the dentist. There's a mobile car park car wash crew and it's the perfect opportunity to have her spruced up for spring.I've got April's word all ready to go and will be doing my card reading next Sunday, so I'm interested to see what pops up.Happy spring everyone!"},
{"title": "Sometimes it's about shifting perspective a little bit...", "date": "Saturday 16 March 2019", "text": "creditcards.comI was online at my bank the other week and noticed that there was a little note beside my account information to let me know that I had been 'pre-approved' for a CC. I was sceptical, but clicked the link and was brought to a page that offered two options: both had 0% balance transfer options and both had reasonable interest rates (comparatively). It was the 0% balance transfer option that piqued my interest really.Now, initially, I backed out of the page because it felt a bit dangerous. I don't need another credit card, and there was no guarantee that I'd be approved anyway (despite their 'pre-approved' claim), a refusal could damage my credit rating, etc.This particular offer came alongside another offer of a 'pre-approved' CC via a bank I used to bank at in Canada. That had a huge ($10,000) limit. But I can't apply for a Canadian credit card without any affiliation to Canada anymore, so that didn't fly and I got rid of that offer (but thank you very much anyway!). There was something else, too, but that wouldn't have worked out either.I've been with my current UK bank since I arrived over 5 years ago and have wanted to 'buy' more products with them for a couple of years. Perhaps I'm naive in thinking that loyalty does pay off in some respects, but I have no reason to change for the time being and the offer of a 'pre-approved' CC was tempting.As I said, the first time I saw it, I backed away from it. Today, though, I was online for another reason and noticed that the notification had disappeared, so I followed the main link. The same two CCs were on offer, so I went ahead and applied (holding my breath a little...).I am REALLY glad that I did - I was approved and I've transferred the balance of myÂ 35.9% interest MC to my new CC where I have 29 months at 0% to pay it off!! The amount due each month doesn't change much, so in that respect, I'm not saving but it means I won't be incurring the interest so the balance WILL ACTUALLY GO DOWN. Noticeably. Phew. I can't tell you how relieved I am about this.I feel like a very little weight has lifted! I already have April's word, and this ties in perfectly. It also ties in a little bit with my word for March - focus."},
{"title": "Heading into spring", "date": "Saturday 9 March 2019", "text": "every-tuesday.comWord of the Month: FOCUSThe word of the month came quite easily to me this month, so I'm paying a bit more attention to what's going on around me ('focus', right?!). ðªðIt's edging slowly into spring here. The temperatures were in the high teens last week, but have settled back to a more seasonal level - cooler days, cool evenings, and rain on and off (it's England).Â CarI love driving my new car! Two months in and I'm finally comfortable with (most) bits of it and don't turn everything on when I'm just trying to find the turn signal. Shortly after I bought it, I went to turn and had the wipers going, the lights on dual beams, both indicators going... None of that nonsense now! Most importantly, I feel safe in it - so solid.Â Last Friday, one of the bulbs in the headlights blew and I wasn't overly concerned because it's light enough (more or less) to not need them now, although I always drive with my lights on as a habit I picked up in the Yukon. I have a three-month warranty on the car (expires 2 April) and wondered whether that was covered (it seems very little actually is). There are options, though, including watching a video on how to do it yourself. It was in Croatian, but I followed it easily enough. But before I went into full-on DIY mode, I stopped at the garage where I bought the car to clarify if it was something that was covered or not. It's not; HOWEVER, they did it for me anyway. For FREE (!).Goodwill is sorely lacking these days, and I'm so happy that they did this for me. My experience with them has been 5* and I would happily buy another car from them. They don't have to do little things like this - particularly as they're just a small, family-run business - but it's literally little things like this that can make such difference in the experience you have.WorkPretty much the same.Â The weather has kept me inside at lunch for most of the past week and I'm missing my walks. I've found a route that takes me about 40 mins (-/+ 2 miles) and that'sÂ justÂ enough for me to feel like I've accomplished something and still gives me time to eat my lunch when I get back.But, work...yeah. The trouble is that I don't want to necessarily do anything until the Brexit-mess has been sorted out (T-minus 20 days). Leaping impulsively into something that may or may not be more stable at this point isn't really worth it.Â I have to say, I've been less stressed out this year (so far) although more tetchy at the beginning. A lot of revolves around martyr syndrome, helplessness, fear/dislike of change, etc. And not on my part. Does it make me a martyr to stay somewhere because I'm more worried about disrupting the current situation than moving onto something that is a better/happier fit where I have a chance to advance, use my brain and like? Hm. Possibly.Anyway. Focus.HealthI'm doing 'no' sugar for Lent, along with a colleague who's given up chocolate and biscuits (but is allowing herself the odd piece of cake). I did that no-sugar programme before and have heaps of recipes from it, so I've started with that this week - but already have spent double my weekly grocery budget on it! So, based on that (and that I now have Â£60 for the rest of the month), I have to modify it severely. I want to keep the quantity of veg that the programme promotes, but need a way to make it stretch much, much farther (doubling recipes and having them for four meals rather than just two would be easiest).Trying to walk, if not every day, at least regularly and for a minimum half an hour.I'm doing 'no' sugar in that I'm going to focus on good food, but keep my tea as is: milk and 1/2 tsp of sugar (with a goal to reduce that over the next few weeks). I'm happier with this scenario.I had an ultrasound on my kidneys a couple of weeks ago and the sonographer found nothing of note. Said it all looked normal (yay), so unsure now if my doctor will be following up. I haven't heard anything, so may call to follow-up next week.Â I have a follow-up appointment next Tuesday at the General hospital with the doctor who did my last procedure last year. He wants to see if the prescription he gave me has done what it's supposed to, so I'm 'girding my loins' so to speak, as he mentioned taking a sample in clinic. Not sure it's going to happen, but...okay... ð£Anyhoo, the appointment is mid-afternoon so I've taken the day as a holiday instead of fussing with driving to work, leaving work, taking the train, blah blah blah. But now I've got a morning shift at the cafe, so have to make sure I'm out of there by noon or I won't make my train.My dental cleaning is at the end of the month, and I've got the funds for that all ready to go (hurrah!) due to a little extra income the past couple of months.Â MiscellanyLots of reading continues - I'm now down to 20 books remaining to review! Hurrah! I'm almost ready to be finished, and I can't believe I just said that...Just really makes a difference when you're reading because you want to and reading because you have to.The conversation started about my Mum with my brother and sister has dropped off. Both my sister and I said more or less the same thing, and all of a sudden we have radio silence. We're not chasing, so nothing can/will move ahead until we hear back.We've had a damp specialist by the flat to have a look at the mould/damp issues, but are still in the dark about it only because the report will obviously go to the owner. We've also broached the 'what's going on in June' query, as that's when our lease is up. If I was the owner, I would see the lease to the end then take care of these damp/mould issues. That makes sense to me and would help make the decision for us, although I'm already keeping my eyes on flats in Ringwood as, ideally, I want to walk to work. Hopefully, we'll know more by the end of the month. I can only (barely) afford one move, so it really has to count.I spent some time clearing out my dry goods a couple of weeks ago. I know they last a bit longer than other stuff, but I'm talking about stuff that was up to almost five years old that I've just been dragging around with me. Nope. Time to go. Cleaning out feels good!I found Â£2 in the parking lot when I arrived at work on Thursday! It was sitting on the ground by the rear tire. Thanks! :DI took a couple of holiday days last month as my boss was away those days and I'd be quieter than usual. It just made sense. It was okay - I didn't get up to much, just puttered really, but I felt strangely restless and unsettled the whole time. It was very odd.I've been focussing a bit more on my writing too, and have managed to produce some reasonable words on pages the past couple of months! I sneak it at work (naughty!) and try to concentrate more on weekends. I'm determined to have a veryveryveryveryvery rough but complete book by the end of the year. My writing group are supportive, helpful and make great suggestions and they're keeping me going. I'm so grateful to them! I also think that the fact I'm not getting distracted by FB is part of this.But is it a murder mystery or a romance? Or both?Hope you're all having a great weekend!"},
{"title": "January wind-up - hello, February!", "date": "Sunday 3 February 2019", "text": "bulldogvillage.comWord(s) of the Month: Trust (in the) CommunicationI spent most of last week sniffling and coughing at work, and took advantage of potentially adverse weather on Friday (and the fact that I've been sleeping so poorly the past couple of weeks) and finally took a sick day. We're pretty slow in the office at the moment, so I'm sure I wasn't particularly missed. There'll be plenty waiting for me when I get back tomorrow.The adverse weather (heavy snow) affected most parts of the UK, including routes to and from London. I could have made it to the office, but quite frankly couldn't be bothered after waking up yet again at 4 a.m. I was feeling really rough, and I'm glad I took the extra day to just rest. There's apparently something going around, so I suppose it was just a matter of time. It wasn't too bad, considering, but has drained me of energy and it's been nice to sit and rest for a couple of days. I woke up this morning with a much clearer head, after a good sleep, so am finally feeling more or less back to normal.I went to the dentist last Saturday and was pleased (and very relieved!) to have a clear checkup. I mentioned that I've been clenching my jaw and she didn't seem overly concerned as there was no pain or swelling anywhere, so there wasn't any damage to the muscles or joints. She did give me some paperwork about some exercises that might help a little bit, but it appears that clenching my jaw is how I deal with stress. Knowing that, I just have to be aware of it and unclench when I realise I'm doing it. I do, however, need a good clean, so that's booked for the end of March.mvpfamilydental.comI also returned that book I didn't think I could! After all that, I'd just picked the 'wrong' choice on the Amazon return options. I went old-school and printed off what I needed and off it went. The credit, less Â£3.99 for postage, was applied in the next couple of days, so I'm pleased. I've since removed payment details from my account so that there's no temptation. I do, however, visit my Wish List page daily, because sometimes there are free books that show up on it! Yes, please!I'm still reading up a storm, and I cleared at least six books from my NetGalley list last week. To be fair, one was only a novella and took just about an hour to complete, but I'm feeling aÂ bit better. I'm still two months behind, but I'm getting there steadily. Most have been very enjoyable, fortunately, with only a couple that I was slightly disappointed in.Regardless, I'm looking forward to getting to the bottom of that TBR pile.I've also been Netflixing a fair bit the last few days. I've worked through most of a 90sÂ English show called 'Jonathan Creek' which is a murder mystery series. It's quite good - it stars a comedian called Alan Davies as Jonathan Creek, a magician's assistant (more or less) who lives in a windmill and solves murders. There have been some great guest stars. I've moved on to 'Hinterland' now, a Welsh police procedural filmed in and around Aberystwyth, on the central Welsh coast. I do love the Welsh accent, it always sounds musical to me. The show is really good, too. I saw the first several episodes a couple of years ago but started from the beginning again anyway. I didn't remember enough about them to skip them. So I'm going to carry on with that.I had a bloodwork appointment at my new surgery (medical clinic) on Thursday morning. Here I was thinking a vial or two, but the nurse kept adding vials to the dish until she had six! Yikes. The doctor must have wanted tests for everything...fortunately, it was quite straightforward (I've got good veins), and I was in and out in about 10 minutes. I was startled, therefore, to get a call the next day to let me know that my doctor wanted a urine test and is going to book me an appointment for an ultrasound of my kidneys and abdomen. Nothing I've not done before, but it seems this issue is rearing its head again. I wonder if it could be part of the reason I'm so bloated? Anyway, happy to do whatever I need to - I've done all this before and if my current doctor wants to have a closer look at it all, that's fine with me. Perhaps I might get some answers this time? I'll have to wait and see.As part of my 'Discover' January, I took myself to the Citizens Advice group at the library. Part of my stress is around how much debt I have (all, once again, self-inflicted) and was starting to panic a bit. I basically wanted to talk with someone about what options are out there for assisting with this sort of thing (without feeling the need to resort to something as drastic as bankruptcy). I spoke with a lovely lady, who walked me through some options and possible solutions and worked up a financial statement for me. I did a bit of reading up on the solution we discussed (a debt management plan, or DMP) and it seems to be the right solution - when I'm ready. One of the things that I'm trying to avoid is affecting my credit rating (which is VERY slowly creeping up). I got myself into this debt and it's my responsibility to get myself out of it. I'm not going to renege on my responsibilities to the creditors, but I am struggling a little bit at the moment.Anyway, there is a slight risk that landlords may refuse to rent to you if you have a DMP on your credit record, although it's obviously not as impactful or serious as a bankruptcy or a debt relief order. With a move of some kind likely within the next few months, I'm not willing to take the chance that I could be turned down for a flat. As long as I keep on the way I am currently, paying my priority bills (rent, utilities, etc.) first and paying my minimums on my non-priority (CCs, etc.), then I'll be okay. Once moving is out of the way, then I can make a final decision on the DMP.Part of the reason I wanted to gather some information was that I'm tired of not being able to do anything simply because I can't afford it. If I didn't have my debt, I'd have Â£375 a month to put towards travel, savings, horse riding lessons, yoga...whatever I wanted. Instead, I miss things like my brother's wedding because I can't afford it, even if part of the cost was covered. I'm angry with myself for being here at this stage of my life.I discovered lots in January.However, February has just started off on the right foot - my computer anti-virus is due for renewal soon and a little reminder popped up about half an hour ago. A few weeks ago, I had decided to amend my subscription renewal so that instead of automatic renewal, I would get a reminder instead. I'm not sure what prompted me to do it, but I'm glad I did! My auto renewal would have cost me Â£219!! That's for multiple devices, mind you, but holy Sh!t. I clicked on the website and changed my subscription to a 1-year, single device (desktop) subscription and paid Â£25 (it was 50% off for some reason - yes, please!). So I'm now renewed until next Feb. Phew! A good catch, I'd say.So let's see what insight February's words bring."},
{"title": "Update: week four, 2019", "date": "Sunday 20 January 2019", "text": "theinspiredroom.comI mentioned in my last post that I had taken myself off social media for three months. My social media presence is only FB because I quite frankly can't be bothered with anything else. I've found it easier than I thought to remove myself, partly because I'd already cut down over the previous couple of months, so am pleased that I don't have any withdrawal 'symptoms' from it. I also figured out how to remove the news headlines from my Google homepage on my iPad, so I don't even see those. I only hear sound bites via the radio, so am blissfully ignorant of (most) of what's going on in the world right now. And I'm okay with that for the time being.The idea behind this was for some self-care - which is not only a physical thing but also mental, emotional and spiritual.Back in October, I (kind of) started a bullet journal, attempting to keep myself in some kind of ordered chaos. I've (kind of) kept it up, but left myself a bit more flexibility in it as we entered the new year. I keep track of the books I read and review (those ones -->) and am making a list of things to do this year, as well as trying to keep track of my debt, my habits, my reading, etc. My words for 2019 are 'joyful adventure' - I think to remind myself to just let go a little bit and sayÂ 'yes' to necessary/scary changes. Following on from my self-imposed social media ban, I decided that each month would have a word associated with it, as a way of paying attention to what I need (whether it be good food, a walk, to stop being so hard on myself, watching my thoughts, decluttering my room, etc.).Â January's word is 'Discover'.I watched Marie Kondo's 'Tidying Up' show on Netflix. A gentle, mindful way of decluttering your home. The 'KonMari' method works seemingly contrary to most decluttering rules, by keeping only things that bring you joy. This mindful approach is the way to a clean house apparently, so I have a few notes to review.I decided that I need to focus at work, doing the best that I can and not being such a complainer. My colleague reflects a lot of my own stuff at me (passive-aggression mostly, also victim/martyr issues), and I've vowed to pay close attention to that this year. A couple of weeks ago I offered to change my lunch hour with her because she's always 'absolutely starving' when her lunch rolls around at 1:00 (she starts work at 7:30!). But no, 'it's fine.' So I'm not goingÂ to offer again and take that on board. It's not my problem.I want to be more present and make sure that I'm a little more measured and thoughtful in what I say, rather than spitting out the first thing that pops into my head, in an effort to try to be funny or whatever.I watched a show called 'Addicted to Food' last week, about recovering food addicts. Both ends of the spectrum were shown, the bulimics and anorexics and the obese. The woman who runs the treatment centre is lovely (and a recovering alcoholic/binge eater herself) and pointed out that although what they treat at the centre is food addiction, the fundamental issues for any addiction are the same (trauma, abuse, neglect, etc.). One client wasÂ determined to leave about 10 days before the end of the programme, and one thing that stuck out to me from the conversation the director had with her was that the client's first instinct is always to 'cut and run, and what would it take for you to commit? What would it feel like to commit?' I do this. When I get bored, frustrated, etc., my first instinct is to 'cut and run'. My decision is to commit to my job - despite being bored, frustrated, whatever - and just be there for it, instead of day-dreaming of 'better'. Whatever I imagine that to be. After all, in the current climate, I could be in a much worse position.I have also decided to do this with my book. Just commit to it and get it done. How would that feel?!So, January has been pretty good, so far!What else? My car is fab. I'm still getting used to it but took my cousin to the little village of Burley last weekend. I wanted to get a crystal of sorts for the rearview mirror but didn't find anything. I bought some chakra-themed candles instead (abundance, joy, motivation and compassion) which smell lovely and will help clear the air around here.We got our quarterly electric bill which was a huge shock - Â£706!! I was expecting it to be around Â£350, but not a bill that rivals a month's heating in the Yukon in mid-winter. We don't have gas, so everything is electric. The heating is via night storage heaters, old, notoriously expensive and fairly inefficient. Realistically, we can't cut ourselves off, so we've been trying to figure out the best way to deal with it. This means turning off the rads during the day (they 'charge up' overnight, on the much cheaper tariff, and release the heat during the day so I'm not sure how this is going to help...but I've agreed to try it). I had to use my travel fund to pay my share of the bill. It means I have to start from zero again, but I'm glad I had it.My biggest (arguably only) hobby is reading. I read ALL. THE. TIME. I love it. I review pre-release books (over there -->) and currently have a backlog of about 45 books to read and review. Phew. I'm struggling to keep up. It doesn't help when you come across a book that just doesn't do it for you, although you do have the option of not finishing it. As a result, I'm beginning to resent it, as I have loads of others to read yet feel obliged to read all of these first. I got myself into this dilemma so if I can get through a couple of books a week, I'll clear up my backlog relatively quickly and will take a break from reviewing after that. When it stops being fun, stop doing it.I had bought a book released earlier this month and which I decided to return to Amazon. The return options have changed a bit which is frustrating, and instead of printing out a return label for the item, you're now issued a scanning option which you need to take to a post office (depot) for them to scan and print. Can I be bothered? No. And the book does fit perfectly into my January 'discovery' theme, so I'm keeping it after all.I've been walking every day at lunch, too. I manage about 1.5 miles in 30 mins (according to my app) which is quite good, but I am noticing that my breathing is starting to labour again and have a call with my doctor on Tuesday to hopefully get things arranged for a new blood test and some iron supplements. My anaemia is rearing its head again!Â Outside of that, the temperatures are on the cool side here (snow in the north!) but haven't been too bad. The walks have been pleasant and refreshing (I don't go out in the rain), and I'm feeling good doing them. Half an hour seems to be a nice balance in the middle of the day, as that still allows me lots of time to eat afterwards.Hope you're all having a lovely weekend!"},
{"title": "Update time! A few random bits & pieces...", "date": "Saturday 12 January 2019", "text": "7yearstodiagnosis.comI'm back again, feeling like I need to update a little. I imposed a three-month social media ban on myself from Jan 1, but don't really consider this social media (as such) so want to continue my as-and-when postings.Â The holidays were okay. Not as relaxing as I would have liked (partly my own fault for taking on a little bit of work, partly not), but it was a nice long break at least.CarDid I say that I love my new car? If not, I do. I really, really do! I'm still getting used to it, but what a difference it's making to my driving confidence. It's wider and more solid than the Clio - to the point I had to get out of the passenger side when I'd got it squeezed into the garage last week - ha ha ha! I've since figured out the secret to giving myself an extra inch, so I haven't repeated that, but it is tight. Hadn't occurred to me it would be a problem, but there we are. She fits - snugly - and I can now get in & out with relative ease.The engine is fabulous - so much bigger than the Clio's! I'm less nervous about pulling into traffic, but at the same time, I can't get over-confident about it. I'm being quite precious about her at the moment - parking in the widest parking spaces I can find so she doesn't get dinged, and once even in a row all by herself at the far end of the lot. My friend laughed but didn't complain about the 'long walk' to the restaurant. Still haven't settled on a name, though...  MoneyI mentioned I purchased her by cashing out an RSP. The after-tax funds totalled just over $8,000. I left $2,000 in my Canadian bank account, which is going towards paying down my LOC. My LOC was down to around $7,000, but sometime in December, I happened to notice that they had increased my limit around Christmas (I'm not clear why). So, after a bit of a think, I used some of that to clear my last Canadian CC. Not actually getting myself further ahead, but condensing everything into one (slightly lower) payment. That, of course, brought me back up over $10,000. WhileÂ I'm okay for about six or seven months at the moment, I'm checking regularly to make sure nothing drastically changes. I set aside Â£50 a month to go towards this. My goal is to eventually only have this debt (and then, obviously, none).I've put away my MC and am no longer using it. The interest rate is stupid and there's no reason for me to use it. Right now, it's eating up Â£50 a month that could go towards other things. I'm determined to get this one paid off this year, somehow. I'm going toÂ let it sit and have the payments accumulate for about six months (bringing the balance down to about Â£1000). Depending on how things look in May - the month before our flat lease is up - my plan (at the moment, at least) is to borrow again from the LOC and clear the remaining balance. The Â£50 can then be redistributed accordingly. This is currently the solution that feels best to me, but things can and do change.So, the remainder of the RSP was converted (at an utterly DIRE exchange rate) and I received just over Â£3600. Â£2300 went to the car (which, as I think I said, was the top of my budget), Â£360 to my travel account, and I put Â£800 into my flat account. I'm happy with the distribution. I now have a deposit + first month's rent on a (very cheap!) flat as/when I need to move. Roomie E and I will obviously each get deposits back for this place when we leave it, but that can take up to six weeks and I genuinely don't have enough resources to finance a move otherwise. I'm really pleased - and so much less stressed! - with this in place.The Â£360 towards travel is ostensibly for a trip to Bruges in May with a friend. We've made a little bit of noise about it, but haven't moved forward much beyond provisionally reserving some hotels. We don't even really have confirmed dates yet. But we're both keen and it would be a nice break, so I'm keeping that in place. IF something should happen before May and I need to take funds from somewhere, then it's available to me.Part of me is anxious that the travel money goes towards a CC payment instead. But along with paying off the debt, I also need to have something to look forward to and Bruges is it!I've bought and returned some Amazon items (books), and once a final credit is applied to my card will remove the details from the site. The last item I bought was a book that I thought might be useful, but I'm not a Millenial so made the 'executive decision' to just return it. I have MORE than enough books to read already.HealthIs okay. I've actually lost almost a stone since last summer (14 lbs) and am now hovering around 11st. I'm not exactly sure how this happened, but although I'm feeling pretty good overall, I still need to work on a couple of things.I'm on a new prescription for my stupid menopause issues. But there we are. The results from the last procedure were the same as from the procedure(s) before, so the doctor suggested this particular pill might resolve the issue at last. I'm not sure, but we'll see. Anyway, it's this or a coil and...eeyew! I've said I don't want anything in me on a permanent basis, but it may come down to no longer not being an option. I appreciate they're just doing due diligence, but surely I get some say as to when it's all over? Maybe not.I've signed up for a food delivery service to see if that will help me with my cooking & eating. My first delivery is tomorrow and it's mostly vegetarian/vegan. I'm going to try to eat less meat and see how that makes me feel. Certainly, more veggies in my diet are never going to be a bad thing, so at the moment I've got one delivery (three meals) a week coming for three weeks. I can suspend at any time and it's currently Â£30 per week. I'm going to see how I'm feeling at the end of the month and if I want to continue or perhaps amend the deliveries to twice monthly, etc. It's all pre-portioned and planned out for you and everything is either returnable to the company, recyclable or reusable; they buy produce and meat from small farmers around the UK; and, they also donate one meal for schools for every box you order. So their food & business ethics are definitely something I can get behind. I'm just not sure if it's good value for money for just one person.I will report back.I've made a dentist appointment for the end of the month. I'm long overdue for a checkup and this particular clinic is at the local grocery superstore (!), just five minutes down the road (three in the new car). I know my bite has changed - I clench my jaw so I'm sure that's the reason why. I discovered this in December, so it's only been fairly recently. I also have a sneaking suspicion I may need some fillings replaced (bye bye travel funds??). The problem is that I'm now a nervous patient, not helped by not having anyone to get referrals from. I'm taking a stab in the dark and trusting that I'm picking a good practice! I've also started taking a walk during my lunch hour. Even a half hour helps. I'm keeping in mind the phrase, 'start as you mean to finish' and apart from our half-hour lunch breaks on Friday, I'm doing well so far. Once the evenings get lighter later, I'll be taking myself down to the beach and the water after dinner. I'm aiming for an hour total a day, to start.HomeOverall, the flat is lovely. On the cold side, but lovely (but it is winter in England, after all). I'm still keen to be closer to work, but I feel committed to seeing out at least our year-long lease, which I think is fair. Things always have a way of changing, though, as Roomie E has the opportunity of a fabulous job at a 2-Michelin star hotel and would have to move counties if she got it. She's off to Italy tomorrow for a few days (to rest and have some health concerns investigated), but I think will be visiting the hotel the following week for a trial shift. No guarantees but I think if she's offered the position, she needs to take it. She's beyond miserable where she currently is and I'm sure that's part of the reason she's unwell at the moment.There is also some (fairly serious) mould in her room. I'm not sure how far back this issue goes, but it pre-dates us and is supposed to have been resolved. The issue is also in the kitchen. Our property manager will, I'm certain, be contacting us early next week once she has spoken with the owner, after discussing it with the building managers. We can't really do/say anything until we know what exactly is going on and how it's going to be resolved.Â There was some fairly minor mould in several places which was, apparently, the result of not enough ventilation in the flat, but I'm not entirely sold on that explanation based on where it was along the top of baseboards. Regardless, I removed it this morning and it hopefully won't come back.I suggested that perhaps the mould is part of the cause of Roomie E's health concerns, but I'm not sure it's got that established or bad yet. Regardless, it definitely could become an issue if not taken care of.I feel quite bad for the owner. This not only causes a problem for us as her current tenants but also potential problems in respect of the sale or further rental if not resolved. At any rate, as I say, nothing we can do until we know what has been discussed.WorkWe started back slowly this year, which is great. Got a few outstanding little bits & pieces cleared up at the office last week as none of the surveyors was at work until this week. They more or less hit the ground running, but the work hasn't trickled in fully yet. The boss is back on Monday and I will be asking at some point if our annual reviews are going to happen at the end of the month. I'm still bored, but have decided that I need to focus on work at work and make sure that I'm spending my free time doing more stuff that I enjoy, regardless of what it is: reading, writing, driving my new car (have I said how much I love it?), etc. Outside of Brexit (tick, tock), I can't really see anything affecting my job so that's a bit of a comfort. And also a big motivator regarding getting out of debt faster.  Miscellany My sister, brother and I have started a discussion about our mother and her long-term health and care. We're all non-residents of Canada now, he in South Africa, and my sister and I here, so the distance makes things more difficult. My sister and I are wondering why my brother didn't start this conversation two years ago when he visited her and noticed that she's not as strong as she was... Anyhoo. The convo is now started and we're tossing around potential ideas and thoughts for discussion before broaching the subject with Mum. What is the best solution for someone who wants one of her daughters (specifically my sister) to return to Canada to care for her, neither of whom wants to? This is the least happy and healthy solution for all concerned. Plan 'A' - in my mind - is that Mum puts herself on a wait list for semi-independent living at a residence where a number of her friends already are. Staying in the same town, with her friends, familiar places to go, etc., would be the best. And the wait list is unlikely to move quickly. In the meantime, we think of a Plan 'B' (a perm move to SA for brother and SIL to care for her? An enormous, expensive and difficult undertaking at the best of health. For an 86-year old...? But they have both said they'd be happy to care for her permanently. But she has to ask. Which won't happen in a million years). Care in the UK is expensive, varies in quality and with the utterly dire (current) exchange rate, any money made from the sale of the house, etc., would be quickly eaten up and then what? Neither my sister nor I have the means to care for her. There is a lot to talk about, not least that if someone does return to Canada, even temporarily, we'd be unable to work legally (as non-residents) and would have no way to earn any kind of income to support the needs and care of self and Mum. She has small pensions which go some small way of paying for the basics, but anything over and above that is going to need more substantial income. Anyway, the discussion has started and all we can do at the moment is to continue and try to figure out a reasonable solution that we can at least start a conversation with (although I suppose the next discussion is who's going to start THAT conversation...). US & UK politics continue to be complete shitshows. Brexit vote in Parliament on Tuesday. Will we leave with or without an agreement in place? WHO KNOWS? Certainly no one in Parliament. Everyone keeps saying that the PMs plan is awful, but no one seems to be able to suggest anything better, soooo...? Shut up, boys. You BAILED. B.A.I.L.E.D. Your opinions are no longer relevant in this farce. I'm no conservative, but I'm feeling resentful on Mrs May's behalf because of all the shit she's getting for taking this on when no-one could be bothered. Anyhoo. Roll on 29/03/2019. Let's just get it over with. And on that note, have a good weekend everyone! xx"},
{"title": "Soooooo, I bought a new car today...", "date": "Saturday 29 December 2018", "text": "To clarify: a new TO ME car. This is the colour, make, model, etc., etc., although not the car itself. It's a Peugeot 308 1.6 Sport 5 door. Poor petite Renee (my Renault Clio) has finally reached the end of her motoring life and it was time. I put over Â£700 into her for various reasons since October and I simply can't afford to do that anymore. That's a deposit on a new(er) car. So, sadly, I started perusing Autotraders and have basically been viewing and reviewing the (same) cars for a couple of weeks. I kept coming back to this one, although it was at the tip-top of my budget (Â£2500). Now, I hear you putting on your thinking caps and wondering, how, exactly, did I do this? Well, it's a little bit of borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, but not really. I cashed out an RSP I had sitting in my Canadian bank. The exchange rate is pretty dire right now, but it was of more use to me here than there, so I bit the bullet and brought it over. What I wanted and what I needed were two different things, of course, but this particular car ticked the mostÂ boxes: Newer? Check (10 years - it's an '07). Decent mileage? Check (60k on the clock). Well-maintained? Check. Last service at 59,991 miles. MPG? Reasonable for the engine size. Some comparatively modern bits & pieces on the dash? Check (MP3 player!). Pretty? Right?! That colour... And so solid, drives like a dream once you get yourself positioned properly - there's a bit of fussing about to get the seat up, straight, forward... I was a bit worried that it might be so sporty as to have bucket seats, but that's not the case and I was really pleased to find that it was so easily adjustable. The engine sounds lovely, and having a bit more room for me felt better too. Currently, the top of my head just grazes the roof of Renee, and I have some proper headroom in the new one. However - insurance has gone up (almost double!), not least because there's apparently a claim on it which will stick around for five years (three more to go). This I found a bit surprising, as I had notified the insurance about an accident two years ago, but had no idea there had been an actual claim around it, as it certainly wasn't me who claimed anything. The fellow I spoke with was very helpful, but couldn't actually clarify anything around that (basically it shows as a claim, although might not be...?). Anyhoo. There it sits and there it raises my premiums for the foreseeableÂ future, as does the much larger engine. So, it is what it is. Road tax also goes up, but only by Â£40 a year, so not substantially (that's based on your vehicle's CO2 emissions). Overall, I feel better for having spent my budget for a decent, solid, reliable vehicle. I put a deposit of Â£299 on it, and the garage will have it washed, fully valeted and the brake discs replaced before I pick it up on Thursday. The fellow gritted his teeth and gave me a Â£200 part exchange on Renee (I do realise that's a fantastic amount, considering her age and state of repair. He even said they'll lose money on that, so I am hugely appreciative of even that amount). The Renault was struggling along (to be fair, I'm not the best car owner out there), but I had to replace the immobiliser (twice), the antenna, the seals around the sunroof were beginning to leak quite substantially (hence the need to replace the immobiliser - the whole system is all packed in the same place), lost my interior lights weeks ago, and despite a Â£400 MOT bill, the rear reg lights have gone again. That's all since October. It was time. Although I'm quite sad to lose the Renault, I have to admit. She's been a very good little car and I believe that with the right owner, she would have lasted another 21 years.Â  I'm hoping that with the new car, I'll feel more comfortable and confident on the road, too, and get myself out more. I don't feel confident enough in the Renault to go exceptionally long distances too often anymore. It feels nice to start off the new year with a fresh, new vehicle, and one that makes me feel like I'm spoiling myself a little bit. I'm not good at treating myself very well, so while a decent car at a lower price was tempting, I felt that having another old one would just leave me in the same position I'm currently in, throwing money at it just to keep it going a little bit longer. So, my sums are okay. I'm happy with my purchase price of Â£2299 (including 9 months left of its annual MOT!). There's a three-month warranty on the car, which I believe is standard for second-hand cars here, and the guys I bought from have been in business since 1979 and are local to where I work. It feels a bit impulsive and I was feeling a bit sick earlier on, but I know it's the best thing I could do. I genuinely don't know how much longer I'd have Renee, and the last thing I want is to break down somewhere en route to or from work, and feel completely stuck. Now I have to think of a name."},

{"title": "Finally, rain!", "date": "Sunday 29 July 2018", "text": "livinginluzern.swissWe have had WEEKS of hot weather - not just pleasant, warm days that hover around the low 20s. No, up in the high 20s & up into the 30s (Friday reached 37C in some areas!). I think we're at five weeks now. That's a long time.I'm not a heat fan, not with consistent temperatures like that. I'd love a few weeks with temperatures hovering around 21/22C and some evening rains to make the gardens and creatures who rely on the water happy, but I hibernate or seek shade if it gets hotter than that. Living as close to the ocean as we do, however, the temperatures have been much more pleasant, particularly in the evening. I open the windows and patio door and the breeze flows through and freshens the flat beautifully. I love that.Grass is brown and dry as tinder all over. Trees are losing their leaves (it looks like autumn around here!), plants and animals are struggling in the relentless heat. Farmers are concerned about crops. On the flip side, bees and butterflies are prolific - they love the heat and numbers are good. But rats are becoming a problem - I didn't know they could reproduce monthly - and even I've seen about half a dozen, which is unusual.Yesterday, after a middle of the night thunderstorm (which I slept through) and a little rain, it was terrifically windy ALL day. Always the sign of a storm coming in. Clouds blew overhead on and off all day and it was noticeably cooler. I awoke this morning to the same wind and rain on my windows! It's going to be a wet, miserable, windy day all day today.Â Fantastic! And so, so, SO desperately needed, even temporarily. We're forecast to get back to a stretch of sunshine tomorrow but with temperatures not quite as high, so that's a relief.What else has been going on?I've been feeling less confused about things since my last posting (a good thing) and am just letting things lie for the moment.Â Roomie E got home from a visit to Italy on Friday and weÂ bought a table that evening. We had one temporarily from our old landlady but she took it back. She backed out of the house sale in June - after all that chaos over the past few months - and has opened a B&B of sorts. Uncertain that the legalities of it have been formalisedÂ (or even considered), but that was annoying to hear. Anyway. Not my problem.The table arrived yesterday morning and I spent a couple of hours putting it together. It's even more cheaply made than I thought it would be. I have no idea what kind of wood it is, but it serves its purpose and that's the main thing. So much nicer to sit at a table to eat! I sat at it most of the day yesterday doing one thing and another.There was a rather terrifying police incident in the building foyer last Sunday (very early morning). I can't/won't go into detail about it, but suffice it to say that when I was doing laundry yesterday and the drum started to bang against the machine, I jumped about three feet. It's brought a lot of old PTSD issues to the fore. I can say that I hope the fellow involved is okay. He was experiencing extraordinary mental distress and had had some kind of breakdown (not helped by a large amount of alcohol). The police were great and I sent them a note to say 'thank you' as it was a rather difficult arrest for them. The person involved was also staying in the building - his parents live upstairs. I dropped them a note as well (they slid one through all the building residents' doors to explain what happened).The week following was mercifully back to normal but I was completely drained on Monday. I hadn't managed to go back to sleep on Sunday and was up until 10:00 that night. Ugh.Anyway. I've also managed to save Â£100 on my car insurance this year by removing an item from the policy, so I'm pleased about that. I did have to add Â£10 to my monthly fuel expense, however. It's costing me more than I thought, but have learned early, fortunately, and can adjust the budget accordingly.I am, however, still spending too much otherwise. I've bought a couple of impulsive purchases on Amazon (one of which is definitely going back) and found some great deals at the thrift shops and a mid-season sale sweater. My trouble is getting rid of things now - I need a much more effective rollover process.I've also been stuffing my face with carbs which hasn't helped my weight issues and I'm 'fitting well' into my Size 14 everything. I didn't realise carbs converted into so much sugar, so they're definitely on the '(much) less of' list. To that end, I thought I'd give Huel a shot. It's a vegan meal replacement (funded by Sir Andy Murray - yes, that one) and it cost me Â£45 for 28 meals. That's one meal a day for almost a whole month and even considering the cost of that initial payment (it's cheaper if you get a subscription), it still fits perfectly into my monthly grocery budget (works out to Â£10 per week and Â£1.61 per meal). I'm going to see how I feel at the end of the month before I decide whether or not I want to continue. It arrives on Tuesday.Yesterday I was feeling at a bit of a loose end so sat down to work on my bullet journal. This is a new(ish) fad that combines a diary/agenda/to-do list/etc. in one journal. You can make it as fancy or as simple as you like. Some of the pictures on Pinterest are gorgeous, but I don't have the time or inclination to create works of art. I want it to be fun, easy, and simple so that I don't begrudge the time I spend on it, or lose interest in it. I've already torn out and restarted a few pages and have barely made a dent. Good thing I have a list of what I want to lay out (sort of!).Anyway, August is just around the corner and another month to start fresh with. I will continue to plot and plan and adapt my budget as I go.Hope you're all having a great weekend and summer!"},
{"title": "More ch-ch-ch-changes...?", "date": "Thursday 5 July 2018", "text": "asdablog.comWell.It's already July. ALREADY. JULY. Over halfway through yet another year and the potential for changes continues. I now have even MORE thoughts swirling about my head, thanks to a visit to Nottingham over the weekend to visit friends.I went north (technically at least - Nottingham is more or less the geographical centre of England, but is situated in the area known as the East Midlands) to go on a ghost hunt in Sherwood Forest and visit my friends. I've known N since I was 16 when we started writing as penfriends. Fast forward 35 years and we're still in touch (he's one of about 4 I still correspond with 25+ years on), but this is only the second time we've actually met.He & his wife, J, were wonderful and we had a brilliant time. The ghost hunt was interesting, if long (6 hours!), and we were thoroughly exhausted by the time we got home at 2:30. I have nothing to compare it to - other than what I've seen on TV and that's massively edited - so it was both what I was expecting and not what I was expecting. Ha ha! I certainly didn't see any ghosts; however, we did see a glass move (like a OuijaÂ board type thing) and I definitely heard a couple of strange things. I also noted changed faces when we were standing around the Major Oak at the end of the night. This, however, could be due to tiredness and a mostly-full moon, but as this particular phenomenon didn't affect everyone in the circle, I can't be sure.I'm a 99% believer in this kind of thing, so I really did enjoy myself. J wasn't keen at all, but I think is actually quite sensitive to this sort of thing, as she came over feeling quite sick during our final 'experiment' (the glass).I do have some photos to upload this weekend although I didn't take all that many. N did capture some orbs around the Major Oak, but I haven't seen mine properly to notice if anything may haveÂ shown up.So what does all this have to do with more changes? It's no secret that I'm bored at work. I'm torn between 'settling' for this job that I'm good at, that has been very good to me, is permanent, etc., etc., and filling my private life with more interesting things, or going off in a completely different direction entirely (again).Â School - but what school? What will I study? For how long? Where? How will I pay for it? When will I go? Part-time or full-time?Moving - this has put a wrench in the works. I have a year to see where things go. If we're offered the opportunity to extend our lease, will I want to? Walking to work beckons, and I would prefer my own place. But the north...I love the north and the initial, tiny seed was planted when Jane and I hiked Hadrian's Wall several years ago. It has taken root after my visit to the Midlands. Cost of living is so much lower than in the south. But where? What would I do, the same type of work? Something different?Savings - my birthday gift from Roomie E and the landlady, T, was a savings pot. You break it open when it's full (can apparently have Â£1000 in it if you put just Â£1/Â£2 in it over a year!), which is a shame as it's so pretty! Anyway, I decided last week what I wanted to do with it - take a falconry course. Random, right? There are schools dotted around the country and you can take various certification courses. They're about a week long and from what I can see, the programmes start about Â£400 and go up from there, depending on how far you take it. So, I am looking into this. As a potential career change? Hobby? Part-time work? Conversation piece? Who knows??Â I have so much research to do about everything. The draw to the North is strong, not least because I could actually afford to BUY a place (depending on where I end up, of course, prices vary wildly).It costs nothing to look, however, and I like having things like this do to. Feeling - and being! - more proactive about my life always seems to get me to the right place in the end. Even if it starts out as 'just for fun'..."},
{"title": "Two weeks in - how are things going?", "date": "Sunday 17 June 2018", "text": "friendyourselfproject.comThere's always an adjustment period with moving - with change in general, really - isn't there? New surroundings, new people, new routines, new issues. It can really mess with you.I am normally quite quiet and keep to myself a lot. I don't swear (much), am quite easy-going and tend to adjust relatively well to whatever is going on around me. Having said that, however, I prefer peace and quiet to chaos. Since the landlady moved back to the house in Feb (March?) and announced she was selling, it's been steady chaos, not least because there have been dogs to contend with as well. I have nothing against dogs, I love them in fact, but they're very needy creatures. I think that's why I prefer cats - they're far more independent and are quite content to spend much of their time alone. Much like me.Anyway, the first full week we were here I felt annoyed by EVERYTHING and had a really short temper. Everything felt like BS and I was just ranting against it. The neighbour who thought my car was abandoned? F*(& you, MrÂ 'I'm too lazy and self-important to park it in my garage like I'm supposed to' 2009 VW Golf. What a ridiculous thing to say. Taking time off work to wait for a plumber who didn't show, when Roomie E was here (sleeping). That annoyed me no end and I stated unequivocally that I couldn't take the time off work again for the rescheduled appointment, which was Thursday at 8:15.Â Work was really getting to me. I'm frustrated by the 'information vortex' where questions, suggestions, thoughts, general info, etc. seem to enter but answers never come back out. I have offered (several times, quite keenly) to do some overtime at home/office. Instead, we've had our part-time typist in to do some catching up, which I thought was what we were trying to avoid. Don't get me wrong, she's lovely and I enjoy it when she's there, but I seem to remember a conversation about not using her as often because I HAD OFFERED OVERTIME. O_oSo, I felt really wound up and angry but strangely focused at the same time. I realise part of my frustration is that I'm currently not learning anything, even for fun, so I need to look at an evening class, an online class, or a weekend workshop of some kind. Floristry? Genealogy? Writing? Painting? Yoga? Aromatherapy? Paranormal? So many options to look into. I gave myself a card reading and it was excellent - pointed to school as my 'way out' and started and ended with 'Let Go' cards! Telling.This week has been so much better. I've calmed down considerably and am loving the peace and quiet of this place. I've sat in the living room a couple of evenings and just revelled in the silence. Apart from birdsong, there is literally no noise. It's utter heaven. I think last week was part of the adjustment to that - from utter chaos to zero. I'm realising how badly it affects me.So, having come 'down' I've decided to make some changes, starting with a diet overhaul. I bought this before I moved. This is their website:Â https://www.bosh.tv/.It's a new vegan cookbook. I'd seen some videos on FB and they looked delicious (!). It's a beautiful book and has plenty of recipes for everyone. I'm planning an 80/20 overhaul, with meat becoming much less of a regular addition. I'm not off it entirely but I am becoming more aware of the process and finding it harder to justify eating as much. I have a cookbook/programme that my sister recommended to me and read half of it. It rang true in many ways, with respect to balancing hormones, etc. that I'm dealing with in menopause, but still didn't sit quite right. This does, so I'm going to sit down today to make a meal plan. I'm going to concentrate on dinners and lunches for now, and ideally start next week(end). I've got some bits and pieces to go through this week. But as I say, I think 80/20 will work best for me, as these are the kinds of recipes to which I can add a bit of chicken, sausage, or salmon. There are, of course, some things I simply won't eat (I'm looking at you tomatoes, olives and mushrooms...yeesh!), but there's enough stuff here that I can manage more than well enough.I'm off to Nottingham at the end of the month for a visit with my friends and a ghost hunt in Sherwood Forest. I bought train tickets because the bus, whilst cheap, would take about 5 hours! Yikes. I got a pretty good deal on train tickets, though, although the connection in London is tight-ish. I'm trying to avoid the underground (simply because I don't like it) and the walk from Waterloo to St Pancras is about 45 minutes, but it would be only one line to get there if I decided to take the underground after all and I can manage that. I hate changing. The walk is more or less a straight line, so hopefully I won't get lost. I don't know London well enough to take shortcuts.Our Internet & phone were set up on Thursday so we're all set there as well. A bit frustrating not to have it, but we managed - I read about 6 books (!) and am all caught up on my NetGalley reading and reviewing. I don't HAVE to read a book until August now. I'm quite relieved, as I was struggling a bit there.Anyhow, that's my update. I'm happy to have come through my anger with some clarityÂ  on the other side.Hope you're all feeling good this weekend!"},

Outside of that, it's so quiet and peaceful. We really lucked out with this place!It's been a bit of an exhausting week as we get settled and figure out new routines, etc. The drive to work hasn't been too much different - about an extra 10 minutes all in. The only 'bother' (if it can even be termed that) is that I now have to cross a fairly busy commuter road and just need to stay patient there. There is an alternate route, but unclear how long that would take me, as it's along Highcliffe high street which is about 3\" wide and I think could get a bit jammed depending on the day. Anyway, no major issues so far and here's to that continuing.I am putting it in writing, however, that next time I move, I'm moving alone.Outside of that, I've been reading up a storm and have cleared three more books from my TBR pile this week (I KNOW! Keener...). Fortunately, I've enjoyed them all and this morning spent some time updating my NetGalley reviews so am currently up to date with those (more or less).My writing group met yesterday morning and we had a fantastic meeting. Considering we were literal strangers when we sat down 18 months ago for a writing workshop, we are a cohesive, supportive, EFFING amazing group of ladies who genuinely enjoy each other's company. I believe I can genuinely say we're now friends. Now that the anthology has reached its apex, we've been feeling at a bit of a loose end so decided that new goals were needed. Each of us has a long(er) term goal that fits with who she is and what she wants to do. Mine is publishing a novel (a cosy mystery) set in the New Forest, which is a beautiful and very unique part of the country. My first goal is to write an outline and a couple of character sketches for the next meeting in July. I need the accountability of showing everyone a result: a half or full chapter each month after that. The group will be my eyes in respect of continuity, etc. Plus there are two ex-teachers in the group so grammar issues will be picked up as well. I can bounce ideas off everyone and fine-tune questions and suspects, etc.I'm happy to be in a place that feels good and where I'm sleeping well. I haven't slept consistently through the night for almost three weeks, but I hope last night's 8-hour solid snooze will be the first of many more!Hope you're all having a great weekend!"},
{"title": "1st moving day: keys", "date": "Friday 1 June 2018", "text": "infoworld.comAt noon today, we collect our keys to our new flat and sign our lives (for the next 12-months, at least) away. Roomie E will, I believe, be spending time this afternoon running back and forth to get some bits & pieces into the space, but I've taken a shift at the cafe. I'll be doing my running about tomorrow.I wasn't QUITE as productive in the packing department as I'd have hoped last weekend, but I'm not too bothered. I can take stuff over, empty bags & boxes and then reuse them. I'm leaving all the big stuff for the movers on Sunday morning.It's been a bit of a funny week. Only three working days, but they were quite busy, which helps the days go quickly, but there was still lots of typing to be done when I left yesterday. But one thing I like about the job is that you can walk away from it at the end of the day and just not worry about what's there (or maybe that's just me...?).I've had some really fab thrift shop finds for the flat this week, too. I've picked up a few more things for the kitchen - why does the kitchen ALWAYS need so much stuff? I found a utensil holder for Â£2, and some new tea towels for Â£5. I was beyond thrilled to find an entire set of GLASS Pyrex storage containers (with lids!) for Â£25 which means I can finally wean myself off the plastic containers I've got. It's ridiculously hard (and expensive) to buy glass storage, so this pleases me greatly.A work colleague brought me some sofa cushions she didn't want anymore. They're navy blue with sea creatures on them (they're nicer than they sound) and will look great. I'm pleased with free acquisitions and am helping her out by taking them off her hands.I also bought an actual cordless phone! I'd seen one in the electronics shop but when I finally stopped in to get it, I found that the sale on that particular one was over. So I settled for a slightly cheaper model (Â£19), one without nuisance call blocking. After a bit of a think, I decided to splurge and get theÂ one I originally wanted - who wants to be bothered by telemarketers all the time? So I was prepared to pay an extra Â£20 for the upgraded model. When I went in yesterday, however, he only had the display model left, so sold it to me for the sale price of Â£24.99, which means it only cost me an extra Â£5! HURRAH!Roomie E and I both want to make long-distance calls and much prefer a landline for that, so we've set up a contract with a provider for Internet and Anytime International Calls. With a small monthly fee, we get 300 'free' long-distance minutes. Quite a good deal. We have our mobile phones for UK callingÂ I also found a necklace hanger that I liked for Â£2.50 at one of the thrift shops, but by the time I got home, I'd lost the hanger bit for it! Very disappointed, as now my necklace hanger is just a weird statue. I did keep myÂ eyes peeled when I retraced my steps to the office yesterday morning, but no luck. It's gone, sadly.I did, however, make a rather startling discovery when I went to look for the hanger in the back seat of the car: chicken sausages that had been under the passenger seat since FEBRUARY. Gross. Oddly enough, they didn't smell, which is why they weren't picked up on a lot earlier.Yesterday morning I woke up to find all four hubcaps missing from my car. *sigh* Probably bored kids on spring break, but whatever. I spent half an hour at work sorting that out. Fortunately, it doesn't affect the performance of the car, it's just aesthetically displeasing (hee hee), and will cost me less than Â£20 to rectify. ThereÂ are funds in my car fund I can use for that.I've been enjoying my reading as well and have made my way through two more books in the past week. I need to review them this weekend, as I won't have (personal) Internet until after 14 June, which was the earliest we could get an appointment to get it set up. I'll try to manage...I made myself promise me that I'd wait until we'd moved in properly before finding anything else to take home. Once we have it all set up, it'll be much easier to see what we need/want.Hope you all have a great weekend! I'll make sure to take some photos of the new place once we're a bit organised."},
{"title": "On the verge of summer!", "date": "Saturday 26 May 2018", "text": "lovethispic.comI have to say, though, that I'm one of 'those' people - I don't particularly like summer. I don't dislike it, of course, but I don't do well in the heat. I activelyÂ seek out the shade and tend to spend my daysÂ as only a slightly darker shade than 'pasty white'. I'm quite happy to let those who live for days on the beach make their way down to the coast on these long, hot weekends and jam themselves into the available space with millions of their closest friends and neighbours.Not for me. No thank you! No way.Roomie E and I move next weekend so this bank holiday weekend (which is overcast & raining on and off), I'll be starting to pack, organise, tidy, recycle, toss, launder, rest, relax and read. We pick up our keys on 1 June and sign the contract, then have a couple of days where we can move a few smaller things in our cars. We can set up some bits & pieces but have booked a 'man and a van' for the morning on Sunday 3 June for three hours. I'm not convinced it'll take three hours, but that was their minimum (and the price was right, too: Â£50 all in per hour), so it's fine. Depending on the size of the van, it may take two trips anyway - the fellow didn't ask what we had.But it's sorted out and that's the main thing.I'm also dog sitting this weekend for two dogs and making Â£30 for it, so I'm fine with that. That can go towards my share of the movers.I've also been looking for Internet/phone providers and looking at the deals that are available. There are a couple, but not a wide variety. Because our lease is only 12 months at this point, getting into anything longer could potentially be more expensive because of the (likely) necessity of cancelling the contract if the lease can't be extended. I've found two that work well (but for different reasons): one is a 12-month contract, one is 18 months. Both include international (landline) calls, but only one includes UK calls. I'll have to discuss it briefly with Roomie E when I see her tomorrow morning.Anyway, regardless of what we decide, we're going to have to wait about two weeks for it beÂ set up, so the longer we wait to make a decision, the longer we'll be without internet at the new place.My Mum was here for two weeks and left on Thursday morning. It's always difficult to spend time with her. I've realised that a large part of the difficulties I have with the way I communicate (or don't) stems from her. My sister had similar revelations (communication, interactions with other people, 'owning' space, etc.) and is happy now to spend some time on her own to process this. She's good at this and processing it all in a healthy way, whereas I tend to stuff it down on top of everything else and just add to the pile. This is part of the reason why I feel so 'dead' inside - I don't allow myself to 'feel' anything. My Mum is exactly the same. And this also means that I literally have no feelings one way or another for my Mum. I'm not sure what the catalyst for full release of all this junk will be, but it'll be massive, whatever it is.She's going to SA for my brother's wedding with one of our Canadian cousins but isn't entirely sure whether or not she'll go through with it. She feels obligated (obligation/guilt is big), but if she's not healthy enough to go, or isn't feeling like she can manage a huge trip like that, then she should feel fine to cancel too. Two international trips in one year is a lot for an 86-year old. I'm considering telling my brother that Mum's doctor advised her against coming here to see us because of her heart. A 36-hour trip to SA could quite literally kill her. I don't want him to feel guilty for paying for her ticket, but I think it's right that he should be aware. Ultimately, though, it's her decision.Anyway, the weather was good while she was here - sunny, but not too hot most days. My sister stayed at the flat with her, while I would go over during the day and then come home at night to sleep. I got lots of reading done (about 4 books, I think), particularly as I didn't sleep through the night the entire time. I'd get to bed at my usual time, have the light off shortly thereafter, and be wide awake before 4:00 a.m. I'm finally starting to sleep through the night again, so that's something.Once I've moved, I'm going to do an entire overhaul of my diet. Both my sister and I found ourselves stuffing our faces the entire time Mum was here and I've finally tipped the scales at 12 stone - the heaviest I've ever been in my life. I feel tired all the time, can't wear most of my clothes and am now overweight for the first time in my life according to the BMI scale. Not by much, but still. I realise part of it is menopause/hormones, but a larger part of it is my current biscuit obsession and massive sweet tooth.I've bought the vegan cookbook Bosh! with the intent that I can maybe have a couple of days a week of meat-free meals. I'm also going to concentrate on managing my hormones better with what I eat, and have a book designed specifically for that as well. I'm hoping the combination of the two will make a noticeable difference. I've been doing okay with my walking at lunch, but have let it slide the past few days so need to pick it up again. It makes me feel better and moving a little bit is better than not moving at all!The new flat is close to a bike/walking path/beach which is great, so I'm going to explore that once we've moved in. I was having some trouble with one of my knees and a wrist last time I tried to ride my bike for any great length of time, so I'm going to see how it goes. I may end up having to sell my bike if it continues and/or gets worse. But that's not for right now.I am, though, working on a list of things I own that I could potentially sell. This is all related to clutter and whether or not I'm using an item, etc. I cleared a few books off my iPad/Kindle app this morning. Just because they were free doesn't mean that I'm going to read them. So I'm going to continue that. I'm also looking at 'big ticket' items like my dSLR and bits, my bike and a printer/toner that I have and am not using. I have to come to terms with whether I like the idea of having a camera more than I like having the camera, as I don't use it at all. I take pictures with my iPod or something compact like that. I haven't used my camera for several years and it's just taking up space at this point. There's someone out there who would get a lot of use and joy from it. The same with my bike - I've only ridden it about half a dozen times and I think I like the idea of it more than I like having it. Plus, as I said above, I'm not even sure I can ride it for great distances anymore.The printer/toner I got for free from work when we moved (!), but I'm sure someone would be happy to take it off my hands for a reasonable price.This is what I'm going to spend the next few months organising in my head and physical space. I'll be moving on again in a year, so I think it's all part of the process of letting stuff go.openyourhearts.com"},
{"title": "Phew!", "date": "Sunday 22 April 2018", "text": "pintrest.comI've been a bit stressed the past several weeks while the new flat search has been on. We saw several places that weren't good, one that was fabulous (really!), and one that was 'okay' but not quite right.Fortunately, because we have time, we weren't TOO panicked, but you know how it is - you just kind of want it over and done with, so you just don't have to think about it anymore. Other things are still going on in life, after all!After losing the really fabulous (yet unaffordable) flat, I'm very relieved that we have actually found somewhere! This place popped up several weeks ago and Roomie E was on it like a fly on poop. I also sent an email about it, but got a call from the agent to say that it had been rented already! The agent said it had gone to an older couple (I think in their 70s) and as the building residency leaned more to that age group, it probably wasn't what we wanted anyway.He obviously has no idea about our lives...hahahaha!Â At any rate, we were disappointed, so I lined up three more potential viewings and a half-day holiday to see them. But on Monday afternoon I got a call from the agent to say the flat was back on the market if we were still interested! So I arranged to see it Tuesday evening and took myÂ sister with me as a second pair of eyes.The photos are pretty accurate, although it's actually a bit roomier than it looks. The rooms are all good sized, there's a small dining area off the kitchen and we have a small outdoor space off the living room. It's literally just a patio but we can put a bench out there, some plants, a bird feeder, etc. and it'll give us some peace and quiet. The landscaped gardens aren't used for anything except to make it look pretty (shame), but that's not too much of a problem as we're now only a 15 min walk from the beach. It's in a lovely residential area, has two bathrooms, an enormous amount of storage and comes with a garage!Fantastic.The reason the original interested party backed out is that it's only a 12-month lease and they want long term. Roomie E and I are fine with a year (unclear if there's potential for an extension as I believe the owner is looking to sell it eventually) so more or less from the moment I move in, I'll be saving for the next move, but there we are.The only concerns I have are: council tax is quite high (just the county we're in) and heating is electric storage heating. This is an older style system which can be more expensive, but we don't need it at the moment, so we'll manage ourselves accordingly through the summer. There's no gas supply, so that's one bill saved at least, although I know very well how expensive electricity bills can be! And council tax is only paid over 10 months, so we'll have a couple of 'free' months towards the end of the tenancy which will help.Roomie E is taking the larger bedroom, but I get the larger bathroom in lieu (with tub). A democratic agreement I'd say! :DOur move-in day is while my Mum is still here, but it won't take very long for us to get ourselves set up, as we don't have much stuff. My sister will be around to help too, so all we need is a man with a van and really, we're all set for a few hours. We'll probably be able to leave a few bits & pieces at the house if we need to, as well, and pick them up later.We still need all the referencing and applications to be approved, but I can't foresee any issues with that part of it.Â One good thing is that by this time next year, there will be NO agency fees to pay on top of rental deposits! Roomie E and I, between us, are paying Â£675. On TOP of the 6 weeks' deposit for the flat. I understand the deposit, that's expected, but the fees are horrendous. I'd actually be okay with, and understand an admin fee of Â£100-Â£200, but almost Â£700?? Ridiculous. And that's to EACH agency you register with (costs vary). But the Government has stepped in to finally say 'enough' and will let renters off starting next April, although I'm sure the agencies will find some way of taking a cut. But it's a start.Otherwise, I had a lovely birthday in Edinburgh at the beginning of the month, although the weather was atrocious - rain, snow, more snow, some snow...and me without a sweater! Honestly. It did limit my excursions, I have to admit, but I saw plenty and the day I left was absolutely beautiful - clear and cold. I hadn't realised when I booked my dates that it was Easter break for the kids so there were a billion people around and lineups everywhere! I avoided them where I saw them but did enjoy a walk around the beautiful castle, which affords views for MILES from the top.The flat I had was fantastic, comfortable, in a perfect location for everything and I spent a decent amount of time there, too, as I would take myself back for lunch or to warm up with a cup of tea before heading out again.Edinburgh is a small city. You can walk around the whole thing (the old city at least) in less than two hours but it's absolutely beautiful. It's a city I would love to explore more of - in much better weather - so is going on my 'to do' list again.I did a great ghost walk, too, an underground one. There are plenty of options about, walking through graveyards and underground during the day and later into the night, but as I was a bit pushed for time, I decided an early afternoon one would be best. It was great, and next time I might even take on two of them, as I would have liked to have had one around Greyfriars Graveyard, which is the largest - and most haunted - graveyard in the city.Next holiday is May when my mum is here, then a long weekend in Nottingham to visit my friends there (and go on a ghost hunt in Sherwood Forest!), and then hopefully a few days in September when I have some friends visiting.Hope everyone has a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Lucky you!", "date": "Saturday 31 March 2018", "text": "ndmagazine.comTwo posts in two days from me! This is just how fast stuff is changing around here. I'm having trouble keeping up. But at least it's all somewhat clearer, so my frustration level is coming down which is good for everyone. :DI had a great sleep last night so am feeling much better today, which helps immensely. The landlady said this morning that the house closing isn't until July (!) which, even for England, is a long time. This is good for everyone; it means no panicking (on my part, at least), more time to save and more time to look, as the market is continuously changing.To that end, I made some adjustments to my budget to the end of the year, realising that things will change again, probably more than a couple of times.Â Pay off myÂ MC as it's got the lowest balance and the highest interest rate. I'm aiming to do this in the next 6 months, but hopefully sooner (snowflaking is theÂ most likely option).I won't have a 'chicken' budget after July so can put that Â£10 elsewhere.Continue with retirement savings generally, and emergency funds to Â£1,000. As I'm going, that will be December next year but I'd like to try and fund it fully before that, so that'll take a bit of thought and playing with numbers and accounts. Again, though, I'm leaving this alone for the time being as it's working fine and overthinking things will get me flustered and muddled.I'm going to start looking at car insurance too. I know I can get a better price than what I'm currently paying, but my current insurance is valid to the end of July so I'm okay for the time being. I'll be dropping comprehensive coverage and going strictly Third Party (my car is worth about Â£50, comprehensive simply isn't worth it). I should be able to get a really reasonable price if I do that. Plus, as I'm now over 50, I'm hoping to snag a bit of a deal that way too.Everything is a big question mark after July but have left it all as it is for the time being. I'll have to add utilities and council taxes, possibly more rent and petrol.Savings will stay the same until I need to change them: I've set up car, travel, flat deposit, emergency and retirement savings accounts. As long as I'm saving something, I'm happy. They currently all get about Â£25 a month.But that brings up the question, should I use some of that to clear my MC, instead of paying it off monthly? The problem is that I may likely need some of that as a deposit for a flat, so don't want to change things too much at the minute.I also still have Canadian debt, being chipped away currently at $240 a month. I don't have to worry about it until next year, but I need to start saving to continue with that starting in June or July to send a chunk.There is one final no-sugar programme starting tomorrow and I registered for it. They're winding up the whole business after this, and I've done a big backslide since the last one (as usual). Another auspicious date, I'm considering this another birthday present to myself. There was a 40% coupon for it, so I took it. I'll likely be a week behind as I'm away this week, but I can at least cook where I'm staying and will try to focus on veggie-heavy meals if I can.Hope you're all getting some spring weather where you are."},
{"title": "Feeling tetchy", "date": "Friday 30 March 2018", "text": "All this moving stuff has me unsettled. I've lost out on the little one-bed flat in Ringwood that I saw (and loved!), but know that there are others out there for me - just not yet. I've more or less come to terms with that, as it would have been just too tight for comfort, although I am still a bit disappointed. Someone else got a real gem!So, instead, we looked at this place for the three of us that's just down the road (quite literally). It's dated but otherwise in good shape, although quite compact. Although originally coming onboard with us, I don't think P was particularly keen on it and he's since decided to take a step back (again) and instead look at buying a flat which, honestly, makes far more sense for him.Â So I'll call the agent today to let her know it's a no-go, unfortunately.But the waiting and flip-flopping is frustrating. I just want it done, although I *know* there's really no panic.So we're back to Square One now, looking at 2-bed places. Roomie E has found several nice ones, but I have a very limited budget. I think she's leaning towards another house, which is a greatÂ idea, but that costs more overall, and I can't afford to pay more than Â£550 (incl everything). She can pay more, but I don't want it to feel too unfair and in the case of a house, it would be.I have found this little gem, though, that I'd like to go and see if it's still available. It's about 5 minutes drive from E's work but adds about 10 mins to mine which in the grand scheme of things, isn't such a bad commute (giving me 25 mins of travel instead of 15). Plus it's all on roads that I already drive!Well. Disappointing. The landlord won't accept 'sharers', so we have to keep looking. :( I wonder if this is going to be a bit of a roadblock...hm.I've been sleeping badly since the time change last weekend and have been waking up before 5:00, regardless of when I get to sleep, leaving me tired and tetchy. Wednesday was 'one of those days', a collection of tiny little mishaps that just got the better of me: I broke an egg in the morning, stalled in an intersection, spent the morning at work feeling fat and bloated (but better after a walk at lunch!), got home to find a dog had peed on my cross trainer, my mother called and mentioned that my brother's fiancee had called her and offered to pay for our tickets to SA (from London) and would I think about going as she doesn't want to go alone (yet I'm sure she told my auntie that she wasn't able to go...?), so on top of having to think about theÂ move, I'm being guilted into having to consider being an escort/chaperone to my Mum for a trip I can't afford and which is, sorry to say, the last thing I want to do (sorry I'm sounding like a shitty daughter). I went to bed early after having a figurative tantrum and venting to my sister, who, fortunately, understood.The SA venture will be a topic during The Visit in May.Â Prior to that, however, is my trip to Edinburgh, beginning on Monday. The 'Beast From the East' has been downgraded to 'only' rain, which is good, but how much? Anyway, I'll make the best of it and am going to spend some time this weekend figuring out what best to do. Monday consists of arriving and settling into the flat, meeting a friend for dinner and walking up Arthur's Seat. Outside of that, a visit to the castle, the haunted Blackfriar's Kirkyard (just up the road!) and a ghost walk are on the agenda so everything else will have to fit in around those. I've had loads of suggestions from my sister, so it's a matter of prioritising it all into three days - and if it's raining, what will keep me inside for the most part.Our book launch next week is no longer happening! Very sadly, the gallery where it was to be held is closing permanently on Sunday. This is disappointing not only for us but the town and the artist community it was trying to support. A real shame!Outside of that, I don't have much on the agenda on this very wet Easter weekend apart from a couple of shifts at the hotel and organising myself for Edinburgh, which won't take very long.Happy Easter everyone!arabiangym.com"},
{"title": "On the move again...but not JUST yet!", "date": "Sunday 25 March 2018", "text": "Well, a move will happen, we're just not sure when. The house is for sale and there have been three viewings this weekend. T had been on holiday for a week or so and made the decision while she was gone that she wants to see it through this time. Roomie E hadn't been wholly on-board because T doesn't make up her mind quickly and since she arrived here from Spain (saying she's put the house on the market), she's not been focussed on it 100%, and just hasn't been able to make up her mind what she wants to do. That's left us a bit uncertain but now that the decision has been made FOR SURE, we can make plans to get ourselves organised for a move. I've been looking for awhile now (I'm always looking) and last week viewed a very compact, cosy one-bedroom flat about 30 seconds walk from work! I absolutely loved it and would have signed the paperwork there and then if she'd had any. However, sense prevailed and I've since crunched numbers and decided that although I CAN actually afford it, it would be too tight to be comfortable and would empty my savings accounts for the deposit and fees, leaving me very vulnerable if anything happened. A further chat with Roomie E has confirmed that she's now on board with a move and is happy to continue sharing with me. There's also the possibility of 'dragging' Roomie P with us as well, as apparently he was a bit hurt that we hadn't included him in our discussions about moving. We didn't include him because we were under the impression that he was going to go north, to be near his parents, but that's apparently not the case. But he didn't say anything to us, so how are we supposed to know?! Honestly... I'm going to see a three-bedroom flat tomorrow near work, but I'm not sure it'll be suitable as Roomie E has said her preference is closer to her work because she sometimes is back and forth several times during the day and Ringwood is a bit too far for that. I can appreciate that, although I'd like to be closer to my work too. Regardless, someone will have to drive a distance. There are precisely two options in Bransgore for rent. One is a 4-bed house that's too pricey and the other is a 3-bed bungalow just outside the village proper, in a small hamlet less than a 5-minute drive - and walkable, as there's a path leading directly to the village. The house is a bit dated (like, 1960s!) but is in good shape and is in the area we want it (this will all be dumped on Roomie P when he gets home tomorrow - he doesn't know we've planned all this yet) and is more or less the same price as we're currently paying. We'll need to set up our utilities, etc. but that's straightforward enough. So I made arrangements for Roomie E to go and view it on Tuesday. She liked what she saw online - plus the fact it has two bathrooms! - and is keen to see it properly and get a true feel for it. I kind of hope she likes it enough that we can just make a decision and have it done. If Roomie P decides he doesn't want to come with us, then it'll just be the two of us and we can adjust our searching accordingly.One of the couples who viewed today was very keen and made no secret about the fact they want the house. T couldn't get rid of them, as they wanted to tell her everything they were going to do with/to it. Haha! I'd be very surprised if they didn't make an offer. I spent the time washing my car - hardly a professional job, but it looks SOOOO much better. The fat wood pigeons have been using it as a toilet and it was quite embarrassing if I'm honest. It's been well over a year since I've had it washed. I'm sure with both more motivation and elbow grease, I'd have managed a much more thorough job, but I'm pleased regardless, as I got the worst of the dirt, grime, oil, moss, and bird poop off of it. Edinburgh the week after next - at least, that's the plan! The Met Office is predicting yet more snow over Easter, so I'm going to have to watch my flights quite carefully, as I fly out of Southampton on Easter Monday. If it's anything like it's been the last two times, there's a good chance of cancellation/delays, particularly as it's supposed to hit the East and North again. There's a chance that I'll have to cancel or at least postpone, but it's all wait and see at this point. A bit frustrating, but what can you do? Otherwise, I'm still picking away at my decluttering (took a few items to the thrift store yesterday but brought home 4 - two books, and two pairs of summery trousers), and getting my room sorted out. I'm still keen to do it because even though we aren't moving right away, we will eventually and I know my room won't be as big so keeping things to a minimum is still important."},
{"title": "Work from home, part-time option!", "date": "Saturday 10 March 2018", "text": "work.chron.comThe potential for overtime at work has come up again - this time potentially doing it from home on weekends, rather than heading to the office. Nothing has happened around it (yet) and I would need a foot pedal, a headset and a dictation software license (easily downloadable, but costs about Â£120 for the one we use at work). If work covers the cost of the license, I can borrow the extra foot pedal and headset that we have and I'm all set.However, I've spent about an hour today poking around online and have discovered the world of home transcription work! I won't say it's lucrative, butÂ it would certainly be a simple way for me to earn some extra money. I can download a type of dictation software and license for less than Â£20 (until 15 March, Â£50 after that) and could still borrow the foot pedal and headphones from work if it came down to it. It's not that I'm exceptionally excited to do more of what I do for work on my weekends, but I CAN do it, I'm an excellent typist and several of the companies I'm looking at offer as/when type of options - do what you want, when you want - which is perfect! There can be a huge variety of different reports, so that's the part that I'm uncertain about as I only have experience doing survey reports (and I may have to blag my typing speed a bit, too, as apparently, you need 70+wpm and I do about 60-65).I'm assuming that purchasing a license for the type of software we use at the office would set me back the same as it would for the office to buy me one but as the price isn't on the website, I really don't know.I've got a potential move to save for, debt to pay down and have just received an invite to my brother's wedding in South Africa in October (ouch!). I can't do it all at once, but having a steady, second income stream would be ideal.Â My first choice would be to spend time doing this for work because I know the system already and it's time and a half, but if I get myself set up with a decent little system of my own, it opens up a lot more options.Some thought and chasing up the opportunity at work will be the first order of the day!Hmmm...."},
{"title": "Snow!", "date": "Thursday 1 March 2018", "text": "metoffice.co.ukIt's finally happened. We have snow in the south of the UK, an area that generally doesn't see more than a frosting. I'm at home today because I simply didn't feel safe on the roads - and Hampshire Police have issued travel advisories: don't travel unless it's absolutely necessary. Hampshire Police trump myÂ urge/guilt to be at work, even for a short time.This is what we woke up to this morning. I took this about 7:45 or so.The back yardÂ this morning.The back yard about two hours ago. The snow started falling steadily just before noon.The chicken run. You can see the chickens near the end of the wall on the right - they've been there for two hours! I have a feeling I'm going to have to physically remove them back to their house (at the back of the run) at some point, as the snow is a fair bit deeper now and they are reluctant to be in it at all.Of course, it's causing havoc on the roads all over the country, but we're not the only ones. Italy, the south of France, parts of Spain - places that normally don't see such a thing as snow, are getting it. The North is under a 'red alert', meaning the cold and the conditions can be deadly. Flights are cancelled, roads are a mess, train service is delayed/cancelled/disrupted, and tomorrow is supposed to be much the same.Where we are we're actually luckier than most, the Isle of Wight protects us to a degree from the worst of it, but it's still quite a mess out there. I'm not sure whether I get paid for today or not (the director went in and my colleague went in this morning as well, although it was ridiculous to do so, coming all the way from Southampton!) but I'm not particularly bothered either way. I've enjoyed my day off and have managed to get a few bits and pieces done that need doing on a weekday."},
{"title": "February update", "date": "Saturday 24 February 2018", "text": "savingmoneyinmytennesseemountainhome.blogspot.comHere we are again, at the end of another month - more or less. Honestly, where does the time go? I feel sometimes like I'm imagining how fast it goes, but I don't think I am.So what's been happening?I had a proper job review at the beginning of the month and got a big ol' gold star, whichÂ I'm pleased aboutÂ andÂ a very, very modest raise (but my first since starting in 2015). I'mÂ pleased, but using it as a benchmark for next year's review. We have TWO newÂ surveyors startingÂ in the nextÂ few weeks and my workload will increase, soÂ I'm going to be paying attention to what/how muchÂ I'm doing andÂ try to negotiate a bit next year.My writing group is having a 'book' launch for our (very small) anthology, which we published just before Christmas. Although not until April, it's going to be held at the gallery where it all started, on a Sunday afternoon. They were very keen to promote this, as it's exactly the sort of thing they're working to encourage - arts in the community - so we're having an afternoon launch - reception? tea? soiree? - with a couple of short readings and some of the gallery patrons in attendance. It'll only be about an hour, but it's quite exciting nonetheless!My very stressed and sick Roomie E is back home in Italy for a two-week holiday, hopefully getting force-fed by her Italian mama and coming back healthy, rested and relaxed. The landlady (T) is here from Spain during this time and pretty much the first thing she told me was that she's put the house on the market! :O There's no panic, as house selling in the UK isn't quick. She needs a minimum price for it and if she can't get it, then she'll take it off the market again. I told her not to tell Roomie E until she gets back because otherwise, it's the only thing she'll think about (I wouldn't put it past her to come back early) and the last thing she needs, while she's on holiday, is another stressor!Â To that end, T is going to be here when Roomie E gets back - they're good friends anyway, and Roomie E was quite disappointed that she might miss T - and take her to lunch and have a proper chat to both catch up and explain things properly to her. I have to admit I was a bit shocked by this - I love this set up and am very comfortable here - and had just decided that morning that I need to be patient, give myself a year to be able to save up deposits, etc. and just focus on getting debt paid down, savings up and figure out where I'd like to go from here. Ah well. Sometimes decisions are made for you, right? I've decided that Plan A (B?) will be to chat with Roomie E and see if she'd like to continue sharing with me somewhere. I like this 'end' of the county, it's close to work for both of us, and it will help keep her calm. It's not entirely altruistic, though, as I can't afford to live on my own (yet). If I do the legwork of searching, making appointments, etc. within a price range/area, I think that will help too. She'll trust me to pick something nice. But, as I say, it's all a big 'maybe' at this point because nothing has happened yet, and T wouldn't make a decision without taking us into consideration or talking to us anyway.Payday is Wednesday and I'm carefully adding all my spends onto my budget spreadsheet. It's adding up in all the wrong places at the moment! I've been uber-spendy this month and payday can't come soon enough, sadly. I have another bill to start paying as of March 1 too, so have added that to my expenses. It's only until July but still hurts.I've read one money book this month. It was written by a woman in Bristol who gave herself the challenge of living on Â£1 a day for a year (2006). The reason behind the challenge was to save up for a wedding present for her brother, a Lifetime Membership to the National Trust. It was an easy, quick read and quite enjoyable for the most part. Obviously, prices have changed quite considerably since then, so I don't think Â£1 a day would be doable today (end of day prices for loaves of bread at 10p??), but does give you things to think about. It changed the way she looked at things: food, waste, the environment, getting around (she walked, biked or hitch-hiked), etc. I'm considering something similar in March but focusing only on food and trying to keep the cost at Â£30 per week, which is about Â£25 less than I've been spending on my no-sugar programme. That's my sister's budget and she eats very well, so obviously it can be done, but it will take a bit of creativity, some batch cooking, and a little sacrifice.I've started a second book behind which the idea is to manifest $1,000 in 21 days. Each day gives you a process, affirmation, or writing exercise to release 'stuff' that's holding you back from attracting abundance (more or less the law of attraction). I've been on Day 2 for over a week now! It's all about forgiveness and releasing the negative associations/feelings that you've been hanging onto FOREVER. They don't even have to be money related because everything is connected to worth/value (of self). I have a long list and am trying to figure out why I can't just do the process ... definitely something I need to do this weekend and keep moving on in the process.Ooooh! Snow forecast for this part of the UK next week, which is unusual, although not entirely uncommon. How much, though, is the question. Unlikely to be what the north gets, but if there's a warning from the Met Office then it could be enough to affect, well, everything.I have a hospital appointment at 10:00 on Monday morning. This is the follow-up with the consultant post-procedure of two weeks ago, so I hope all is well. I also have to drop my car at the garage near work that morning for 8:00 for new front tires. So I bought a bus ticket, which works out well to get me to Southampton in plenty of time for my appointment. And it's only slightly more than taking the train. Plus, I didn't really want to change my car appointment. The tires need doing (and I have funds for it!).I went to the pretty town of Swanage to visit my sister for a weekend while she was housesitting. The bungalow was very pretty (the owner is an artist, and Canadian, so the perception of space is different) and comfortable. It was a miserable day on Saturday when I arrived, but we did a quick visit to town - buying what was absolutely fabulous Guinness cake at a cake shop - and went for a walk on Sunday when the weather was better for it, although it wasn't particularly warm. I bought a Himalayan salt bowl, something I've wanted for some time. This isn't mine, but like the one I bought:I think that's about it. I had a great clearout last weekend and plan to do much the same this weekend. At the moment, we're all prepping for a house viewing this morning, so I'm going to take myself for a walk then pick up some things in the village. There's painting going on, vacuuming, cleaning, tidying, dogs out, cat's out, flower baskets up...phew. Not all by me, mostly by the landlady and her boyfriend, but my room is tidy and vacuumed and looks very nice, if I do say so myself.Have a great weekend everyone!"},

{"title": "February reading plans", "date": "Monday 22 January 2018", "text": "bellalifebooks.comÂ I'm making reading plans for February. I read a LOT. It's really my only hobby and one that I've loved since I was a kid.Â This month has been a bit of a catch-up month of my NetGalley reviews (I'mÂ very behindï»¿), but part of my thought process this year is that because I've been feelingÂ 'blah' since before Christmas,Â I'mÂ letting January pass by as it will: I'm feeling better now thatÂ I'm eating better (and much less sugar), I start my volunteering at the coffee shop at theÂ end of this week, I've been recovering from the flu or whatever,Â my sister was visiting, etc. It's been - despite being sick - really nice to just rest, really.Â My favourite genre is cosy mysteries. There are, like any genre, some terrific ones out there and I definitely have my favourite authorsÂ - andÂ have recently added a couple more! There areÂ also some real stinkers, which is always disappointing butÂ all part ofÂ being a readerÂ (and obviously it's a personal opinion as well). I've been lucky in that most of the books I've read through NetGalleyÂ have been terrific, in my unprofessional opinion,Â but there have beenÂ several I've definitely really struggled to finish. I'm about a third of the way through one that I started way back in November. I'm strugglingÂ with it, butÂ would like to finish it. Now that my head is clearer, I think it will make a difference in how I engage with it.Â So as JanuaryÂ rolls to an end,Â I considered what to do in February. I have lots of non-fiction books on my trusty iPad/Kindle app, about half a dozen or so dealing specifically with money. AfterÂ a bit of a think,Â I decided that February isÂ money month ('February Funds' or something). I want to do some reading, thinking, considering, clearing and focussing on my money: how I get it, how much I get, how to get an honest understanding of investing it, saving it, and how to get a true grip on this debt that is perpetually dogging me.Â The real issue ISN'T money, I know that much, but it's certainly a symptom of (a lack of) something else, and I'm keen to find out what comes up.Â There will beÂ writing involved, as well as lots of reading, pondering and considering, so I'm going to have a look at my books on hand and see which one feels best to start with. If anyone's interested, I'll likely be keeping track and maybe posting a bit about it. It feels right to be doing this while I'm doing the no-sugar programme, while I'm already doing some digging and 'cleaning out'."},
{"title": "Update - week one, No Sugar & other bits", "date": "Sunday 14 January 2018", "text": "busy-at-home.comSeeing as I've attempted this programme several times before, I should be an old hat at this. It's going better this time, partly, I think, because I've been sick and feeling pretty rubbish anyway, but also because I understand the process much better. I've made it more or less unscathed through Week One. A few off-plan meals, but only one that would have had any kind of sugar (fructose) in it. So, overall, I'm very pleased. The meals have been delicious as always (apart from a rather disappointing cauliflower curry last night) and I'm already feeling better. I haven't had great cravings for snacks and sugary things, so that's a positive. This time, however, I'd like to carry on the sugar-free focus once the programme is over. I think if I can make it 80% very healthy and allow myself the occasional treat, then I will be exceptionally pleased with that.It was my first week back at work, too, and it went well enough. It was relatively busy for January and I've already booked some holidays, too! I'm off to Edinburgh in April for a few days, and have booked a long weekend in Nottingham in June with friends for a ghost hunt in Sherwood Forest!!hauntedeventsuk.comThat's actually the company we're going with, too. It's the last ghost hunt at the old visitor's centre (which means, I assume, they've built a new one) and runs from 8pm - 2am! My friend sent me a link of the company running one of the hunts, so I have to search it out and watch it. Apparently, his wife is already freaked out after watching it! Hmm...I'm FINALLY over the cold/flu/thing that's been plaguing me for three weeks. Today my head is entirely clear, and I've been sleeping like a log for most of the week which has helped immensely, as has all the good food I've been eating. So glad to finally be rid of it - what a gigantic pain it was! I've never been sick for so long, but there's definitely some nasty things going around and I'm just glad it wasn't worse.My sister was here for several days, too, which was nice. I haven't seen her since October and weÂ spent our time playing silly video games for the most part. She made a lovely vegetarian soup (no sugar!) which was a delicious Friday evening meal. Saturday morning I had a surge of energy and cleared out a bunch of stuff from my wardrobe and bookshelves. We headed to Ringwood to pick up a few things and dropped off my old TV, plus two bags of clothes and other bits at a charity shop. I wanted to donate the (large bag of) books at the library but they're apparently not accepting them! So they're currently in the trunk of the car until I can get to another location (a bigger branch perhaps) where I can leave them. I've never had an issue donating books before! It seems a bit odd but never mind.It felt really good to get rid of that stuff. My sister is good at decluttering - it was on my 'to do' list, but sometimes it helps to have someone else prod you to just get it done. I'm confident there is plenty more to do, but it was a great start.Â I moved my room around a couple of weeks ago and am much, much happier with it. I've got more space in it now and a little 'lounge', separated by my bookcase which has my plants on it. It's a cosier spot and I can relax much easier in it.At the moment I've got some cooking/baking happening for this week's meals: a beef ragu and a lovely veggie loaf. I went to the butcher in Ringwood and got some 'proper' beef for stewing, and picked up a beautiful sourdough loaf at the bakery next door. It was a bit late in the day for their usually large selection of bread, so I ended up with a large white loaf instead of the small, brown seeded sourdough I love, but I'm not fussed. Half of it went straight in the freezer for later in the programme. I'm learning! :DI start my volunteering gig at the village coffee shop on the 27th and am looking forward to that. I had also wanted to look into volunteering at the food bank but it's only open three days a week - Monday, Wednesday and Friday - so, unfortunately, is off my options now. I know there are some animal charities around, too, so I'll shift my focus to one of those instead I think, once I've settled into a bit of a routine at the coffee shop. There is also a big parish quiz on the evening of the 27th - this is one I've attended twice before - near my cousin's house, so I'll be going up there for that which is always fun.I am anticipating a review at work in the next week or two and looking forward to hearing how I've been doing. My job isn't changing much (except I'm taking on more typing - damn my excellent typing!) but we're hiring more surveyors so there will be more work. I have already said I'm happy to do some overtime if needed - I'd rather do that than polish glasses! - and they are looking at sending some typing out to a different timezone (I imagine Australia way) to have it typed and ready the next morning if it's needed. That sounds like a fun way to get it done! Our part-time typist isn't always available so having the option of out-sourcing it sounds like a good one.Otherwise, that's about it. I'm happy to be feeling clear-headed and more energetic. Being sick really does bring you down - I hate it.Hope you've all managed to avoid it for the most part!"},
{"title": "Week One - no sugar programme", "date": "Saturday 6 January 2018", "text": "whistlergrocery.comI've decided to start the year off on the right foot and do (yet another) no-sugar programme. I've been feeling the need for change and know I've been doing very poorly with my diet up to and through the holidays. Being sick doesn't help and my usually hearty appetite has been reduced considerably. After this cold/flu/pain-in-the-butt-whatever-it-is finally decides to pack it in and vacate my body, I would like to be eating good, wholesome food rather than the carb & sugar-heavy options I tend to lean towards.Feeling much more human this morning (hurrah!) after a good night's sleep, I sat myself down at the computer and ordered some groceries.Â I had my shopping list open on one side of the screen and the grocery site on the other. Because I need my groceries earlier in the day, this added Â£6.50 to my final bill which is annoying. Some shops don't charge once you're over their minimum spend (generally Â£40), so I'll need to look around next week. Still, I suppose it's the cost of convenience (i.e. me being too lazy to go the grocery store). I do need to monitor this, however, as it's not helping my budget.I spent almost Â£60 before tacking any meat onto it. I am reluctant to add grocery store meat to my shops these days because there is a family butcher in the village and they sell gorgeous cuts. They're more expensive but it's worth it, as the meat is much better quality.Anyway, I went to the village to pick up some meat and a couple of other bits & pieces and came away with Â£20.26 worth of meat and veggies (all from the butcher)! This meant I could adjust my initial order and IÂ managed to shave just over Â£10 off it, so I'm pleased.Â Part of the cost, too, is 'initial purchases' of things like baking soda, spices, flour, etc. which won't get used up immediately and will be carried over for the whole programme. So some shops will work out much cheaper. Plus now I've got chicken (8 breasts!) to last me three weeks or more.Tomorrow, once the groceries have arrived, I'll have to reorganise my cupboards and shelf in the fridge to get everything sorted out - I have stuff that can be fed to the chickens - and then have some batch cooking to do for the week. I don't really like spending my time cooking but do appreciate that it's a huge time saver during the week.One thing I'm considering this time around is buying produce on a daily basis, rather than weekly, as it means fresher items. I'm wondering if it would be easier to monitor costs and waste more easily. I'm literally two-minutes walk from two very big grocery stores near work, so taking myself out at lunch for a bit of a mooch wouldn't be a hardship. I'm a fussy(ish) eater and soft veggies really don't motivate me to eat them (which is where so much of the waste comes in because I'll just buy fresher ones to use instead).Â So this, combined with some light walking, should see some comfortable overall health results this time around."},
{"title": "What a way to start the year!", "date": "Friday 5 January 2018", "text": "stilletosontheglassceiling.comI went home sick on 21 December (half-day) fighting a fever, sniffles, stuffy head - all that fun stuff - and got much worse over the next couple of days. I seemed to turn a corner and felt more or less human again by 25 December, so I decided to go to work (the hotel). Probably a mistake. I'm not a night owl as a rule anyway, so working every night, then having an evening out with friends, a 50th birthday disco for my cousin, and then working until 2a.m. New Year's Eve probably wasn't the best decision for me. I felt entirely unrested and wound up sick again! :(I've been off work since Wednesday afternoon now, but DO feel slightly better - I had breakfast this morning! It's just a persistent low-grade fever, a bit of aching (mostly from the coughing), and stuffy head. I'm hoping lots of rest, hot drinks and sleep will manage to wipe the last vestiges from me. I have a friend who's been fighting what sounds like the same thing for over three weeks now, and I know there's something nasty out there. I'm seeing it onÂ FB and hearing others' experiences. I hate being sick. I am relatively healthy, generally, though, so I'm hopeful I'll be over the worst of it very soon.Just SO frustrating!Roomie E made me a beautiful bone broth yesterday evening which perked me right up. It was just what I needed! So kind of her to take care of (pander to) me like that.On Wednesday morning, we had a 'mandatory' work meeting which also included photos for the website. All I said to the photographer was, 'If you can make me look alive, I'll be happy.' I am NOT looking forward to seeing the result online....Â :P The meeting was just an overview of what we'd done the past year, what the plans were this year, the re-org of the admin staff, and just everyone meeting everyone else (some of the surveyors work from home, so we only see them very rarely). Some good plans, although it will mean more work for me - admin has been re-organised to play on strengthsMy No-Sugar Programme officially starts on Sunday. The first emails and menu plans arrived yesterday, so today I have to organise a grocery delivery to get myself started. I'm quite excited, as I was feeling really sluggish and tired over the holiday (not only because I was sick). I'm debating about a Waitrose delivery (the high-end grocery store) but only because I have a Â£25 gift card to use there...Outside of this, I'm not sure I want to make goals or resolutions this year, but just try to do better in everything: more consciousness about spending / savingÂ / eatingÂ / healthÂ / exerciseÂ / readingÂ / writingÂ / etc.I'm excited to spend another year with you all! xx"},

{"title": "Challenge consideration for 2018", "date": "Tuesday 26 December 2017", "text": "uk.businessinsider.comMy Achilles heel is books. I love them, whether I actually read them or not. I buy them, I look at them on my shelves, I ponder them, and although it's hard, I can actually get rid of them (get rid of = donate) so I don't have quite the same issue as the lady in the photo. It's my only genuine hobby and is something I've done since I was a kid.The past few days I added a \"few\" more books (20?) to my Kindle - not all of them free. As I have them organised into categories, I decided to add up how many I actually have: 412. Yikes! That's not including the ones on my shelves and if I include those I probably have almost 450. Based on the number of books I've read this year (61), that's just over 7 years worth of reading.I set myself a goal to read 100 books this year (I managed 104 last year), but have struggled with it. I haven't been able to engage as fully in my reading this year for some reason. Regardless, I'm going to adjust accordingly for 2018 and be a bit more modest in that goal - after all, there are other goals I have in mind too - and perhaps take a bit more time to enjoy the books, rather than simply rushing through them to meet a random goal.I belong to Netgalley, which issues free ARC copies of new books to readers around the world in exchange for reviews, so I read books from that. I have my library app which I can use for up to five books at a time, anytime I like. I scour Amazon for free books (now that I know they're there). I have to come to terms with the fact that, sadly, I will never be able to read all the books out there. Ever. I have to keep my focus smaller. I am a sad bunny because of that, but what can you do? ;)Basically, what I'm saying is that I don't NEED to pay for any books yet I still do. Thus my consideration of a 'Bought Book Ban' for 2018. This will both allow me to save money and give more focuses consideration to what I already have. Some I'm going to thoroughly enjoy, some I'm not, as is always the case. But I have a number of non-fiction ones focused on money that I want to really concentrate on and take the time to work on properly. I'm aware of the irony in that...Anyway. Obviously setting out for a year's ban is a bit of a stretch so I'll start with January and go from there. Addiction recovery of any kind only works a day at a time (this relates more to spending money/buying stuff than the actual books).Suggestions and thoughts most welcome as always."},

I have tea, blankets, food galore and entertainment (TV, iPad, books) so have plenty to do. Obviously I need the rest. Will I work at the hotel over the holidays? Only if I feel like it.I left work early yesterday and didn't go in today, so my holidays have started a little early. My plans for tidying and decluttering, however, will remain intact, but I have so little energy at the moment, there's no point starting at the moment.I wish kindness and compassion for 2018. We've been in short supply this year and we could all use a shot in the arm, so here's hoping hearts rule heads in the new year.NLA xx"},
{"title": "What the heck!", "date": "Sunday 10 December 2017", "text": "international.gc.caI've just applied for a job at the High Commission of Canada in London. It costs nothing to try although I won't hear anything until the new year at this point.Literally, this is my 'job of a lifetime' opportunity. Nearly 5,000 people have viewed the job, but no idea how many of those applied. I'm not surprised the competition will be strong - it's a fantastic opportunity.My chance of success is zero if I don't try, so after a bit of a frustrating afternoon when every time I tried to apply I got a warning, I took a little break, got a couple of suggestions and managed to get everything sent off. The job closes at midnight tonight.So...fingers crossed!Outside of that, I'm working on my Christmas cards. If you'd like one, drop me a line - I'd love to send you one!Work at the hotel continues. It still takes me three days to recover, but I will take advantage of it until at least the new year. Christmas will be busy and exhausting but at least I have the daytime to recover and recuperate a bit, and there will be another commis sommelier (my TITLE!) to help. So it won't be tooÂ bad.I'm also waiting for a review at my day job. I don't think it will be complicated or too long, but I know there are things going on and I'm keen to hear what they are. I sincerely hope that I'll come away with a higher wage as well, as modest is good to a point, but tends to start chafing a bit when costs increase. And if you're hiring more surveyors, surely there's a couple extra grand in there for the admin staff too?I've inquired about doing some volunteer work at the little coffee shop in the village. It's run by the church (so I hope it's not too, er, 'churchy') and is about 15 seconds walk from the house. I have time on Saturdays (they're open 10-1) and I'd like to get to know a few people and feel a bit more involved in the village community. There's also a dog charity I'd like to inquire at, as well as the local food bank. Those will probably be new year queries, however. A little bit at a time.I'm thinking of things I want to do over the holidays: tidy, perhaps rearrange my room (how, I'm not sure yet), declutter, donate, walk, read, etc. Outside of work, I need to do something(s) for myself. I'll also be fussing with my budget, I imagine, trying to see where I can add or change or increase or decrease things. Definitely a work in progress, on the scale of Gaudi's cathedral in Barcelona...I bought myself another TV. Yes, I said 'another'. The one I inherited from my housemate was fine until it wasn't, so I managed to find a digital TV (remember those?) in a thrift shop for Â£45 a few weeks ago. It was a bit big for the space but worked perfectly and I was more or less happy with it until I walked into the same thrift shop last week and saw a smart TV for Â£39! It's anÂ earlier version, a bit more compact, although I believe is the same size. It's a nicer picture and I'll be able to get Netflix on it, whereas I can't on the digital TV. I'm going to see if I can Â£20 or so for it. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it - it's just not HDMI, etc.-friendly. Someone will love it and there are so many buy/sell sites out there these days, it shouldn't be a problem finding someone who's looking for a second TV.Christmas will be upon us in no time! Is it just me or has this year simply flown by?"},
{"title": "End of November!", "date": "Saturday 25 November 2017", "text": "mortgagemanfro.comI can't believe the end of November is already here! Honestly, where has this year gone? I wanted to do another small update before I forget what's going on around here.Last Monday I slept in until 9:45!! I haven't done that in decades, but apparently, the second job takes that much out of me (not being 25 anymore...). I obviously needed it and felt absolutely fine the rest of the day, so it was lucky I had it off.I worked again last night and am going in again tonight for a few hours too. I'm not sure I want to do too many of the Friday night shifts, but do want to take advantage of the opportunity ofÂ the extra work whilst I have it. Certainly, Christmas will be busy, and I have a lot of time to put in some hours while I'm off from my job.I splurged on a new, proper pair of shoes for work. I bought a second pair of Skechers GoWalk, in black. They're not the cheapest shoes out there but they are probably the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. If I'm on my feet that much I need something light, comfortable and relatively long-lasting, and these shoes are all of that. I felt much better in those last night than I did in my boots! Phew! I decided to buy a good quality pair rather than get something cheap and cheerful at a grocery store or thrift shop. It seemed like the practical thing to do.I'm off to help with the teas at a pantomime this afternoon before another shift at work tonight. My cousin is part of an amateur dramatics group and today is the first performances, a matinee at about 2:00 and an evening show at 7:30. I'm on the matinee shift again on 3 December.I've managed to rack up another several hundred pounds on my credit cards, but part of that is the shoes (Â£45) and Â£61.31 is a big bunch of flowers for a friend's 50th birthday today (she's one of my oldest friends and one who lost her mum last year). I didn't get the card off in time but with the magic of the Internet, I can certainly send some flowers on the day. Funnily enough, another long-time friend is also 50 today, and I'm going to send her something a bit later on, as I didn't get a phone number in time to send flowers. I'm thinking a jigsaw puzzle because I seem to remember she likes those.As part of my budgeting plans, I've set up several more sub-accounts within my bank account - car, travel & school - so that I have my goals in front of me and can direct funds towards them. I've put Â£100 into each of them (from my loan money) as the 'seed' and the hotel paycheques will go towards these.Â Thinking about goals for next year and what I'd like to focus on. Health, for sure, and money.Â Certainly, my colleague is feeling the pinch of the office move, too, in that she's spending nearly Â£100 per month now on petrol. My rent is Â£100 more a month than when I was living with my cousin and I'm also spending a bit more on petrol, so it's all adding up. Part of the money focus will be to work on my thoughts around it and work on having a better, more positive relationship with it. I have a couple of books about money manifestation as well, which I'm going to work on. Can't hurt, right? :D"},
{"title": "Mid-November update", "date": "Sunday 19 November 2017", "text": "carersfirst.comWhat have I been doing? That's a good question.I'm almostÂ 50% throughÂ my Pathology course. I'm picking away at it and doing well so far. It's more or less designed for massage therapists, so the 'therapist's notes' portions aren't necessarily relevant to me as I won't be doing that programme. I'm going to concentrate on 'just' understanding the actual pathologies, rather than the therapy required to both save myself some time and some reading.Roomie P was at his parents' for a week and it felt like a month! I was by myself for most of the time, as Roomie E works long hours. It was nice but also a bit odd, as even when neither of them is here, I don't feel 'alone' in the house yet I felt that way last week. How funny!The chickens are happy and healthy and I've been collecting a good number of eggs from them. People tell me they're delicious, so I suppose I should really try a couple! I actually managed to pet one the other day - soft! - although they weren't really thrilled about it. They're still getting used to me, I think.Work is steady, not overly busy but not dead either, although it is coming up to that time of year. We're busier this year than we were last year at this time, so that's something at least, and hopefully, the momentum will see us through to the holidays.Thursday night I went to a ladies' group meeting with the group I'd been part of for the past year. It was so nice to see everyone! I stayed overnight with one of the ladies and from there I took myself to my hospital appointment on Friday (found my way to the hospital on my own - woot!). That was a pretty miserable experience and not what I had anticipated. I was expecting just a chat to see how I'm doing after my procedure in May, but it turned out the doctor wanted another sample (something to do with the womb lining changing - so this is a pre-pre-pre-cancer check, from the way I understand it). Fair enough. Except that it's an exceptionally painful procedure to endure for me these days (not that it's ever fun or discomfort-free, but let's just say there were tears involved this time).Â This just means I'm put on a waitlist for another out-patient procedure, literally so they can get a sample that would normally take about 5 minutes. I'll be under general anaesthetic again... :( ButÂ as it's much less invasive and quicker than the other procedure, the recovery time will be far quicker so that's something.I've found myself a part-time job! Roomie E works at a 5* hotel about 10-minutes from home and spoke with her boss about some potential work for me (even if it's just over Christmas). I am now the washer and polisher of glasses for the sommelier department. Literally. That's all I do for about 3 hours a night. It's perfect, although hot and noisy as I'm located at the back of the kitchen. But I'm not dealing with the (5*) public and it apparently does help the sommeliers if the glasses are prepared and back area is tidied, as this is normally something they would do. I just go in at peak times (7-10, 8-11 sort of thing). And only on Fri/Sat nights as this is not something I'd leave or compromise my day job for. I'm on a zero-hours contract, which means no commitment from either side which is actually perfect. I can pick up/turn down shifts as I like or as I'm needed. This will help with at least a couple of loan payments and hopefully also get me a new set of front tires for the car.I had hoped to do Nanowrimo again this year, but that hasn't happened.Â I'm still fiddling with my budget and have made a couple of purchases I'm considering returning. My 'need/want' switch seems to be stuck, so I think I'm going with my post-spend nudges and send the items back.I have a long weekend this weekend, so am looking forward to tomorrow as well as it means I have a whole day to recover from the weekend. Yesterday I was fighting a headache ALL day - I finally took some ibuprofen later in the afternoon and that got rid of it, but last night I remembered to take water with me and went through about 1.5L whilst I was working, so that helped immensely. I'm not nearly as dehydrated this morning.I do, however, need a better pair of shoes. I'm wearing boots and they're just not appropriate - far too hot - so I need to scour the grocery store lines and the second-hand shops for something cheap and cheerful.Otherwise, I've been quiet and just enjoying my space."},
{"title": "Thinking ahead", "date": "Monday 30 October 2017", "text": "jean-outhout.blogspot.comI'm thinking ahead to the end of the year and some goal setting, but the two words above came to me a couple of days ago as my 'theme', if you will, for the new year.I (by nature? by nurture?) don't tend to give a lot of thought to my purchases, instead going on my impulses. That instant gratification, the Thrill of the Buy, the ongoing 'want vs need' war.The purpose of this theme is to get me consciouslyÂ thinking about what I spend, what I do/don't do, eat, etc.; to focus and make me differentiate between excuses and reasons, and to fill my time more purposefully, whatever I feel that may be.I spend a lot (A LOT!) of time on electronics - my iPad, my computer, the TV. I don't spend nearly enough time reading (although a huge number of my books are on my iPad now so that's a bit of a catch 22), walking, cooking, baking. I don't spend ANY time meditating, doing yoga, or simply resting.So when this popped into my head the other day, I jumped at it. It's not meant to be an exercise of spending hours deliberating about the reasons/justifications to do/not do something, just to literally give me a few seconds to consider, reasonably, about my choice or option and why/why not.Why wait to go for a walk? Why wait to take myself away from Candy Crush? Why wait to read that page for school? Why wait to have tea/cake/bacon? Why wait to purchase a new set of boots? Why wait to have an apple?The little changes will hopefully work into larger ones, and also help me to live more in the moment, rather than terminally waiting for the 'when I...' of the future which never seems to happen. I struggle with this.Funnily enough, I came across this video this morning, posted by a friend on FB and it, almost literally, is exactly what I'm trying to do, only said with much more clarity and meaning than I could ever do.It's 22 minutes long, but it doesn't really feel like it. It sort of tapers off at the end with a plug for 'learn more at', but the bulk of the message is there and I really appreciated it.Just be more conscious and work to define needs/wants more clearly. Train the brain! :Dthedosomethingproject.com"},
{"title": "Cleared...set...registered", "date": "Friday 27 October 2017", "text": "debtcamel.co.ukThere are arguments about which is better to do when tackling debt: I believe Gail Vaz Oxlade was a proponent of ridding yourself of the smaller, more easily removed debts first, as I think she felt you could mark the little achievements as big milestones, and then roll that payment onto a second one (snowballing) to bring that down faster. Others prefer tackling the higher interest ones first, which also makes sense because of the interest tacked on each month.I'm not sure where I sit - somewhere in the middle, although I only have one choice that makes the most sense for me. My loan is the lowest unsecured interest rate I have, so it makes sense to pay off the credit cards, both of which are twice that. My LOC & Canadian CC both have interest rates under 9%.So I paid off the CCs.Â Cleared - both CCs are now at a zero balance. Woo! Phew...Â Set - my Canadian debt repayments this morning: 15 months' worth! I'm putting $200 per month on my LOC (for a total of $3,000), and $75 per month on my credit card (for a total of $1,125). That takes me to the end of January 2019, but will revisit at the end of next year, just to make sure things are on track. I can check on things anytime and adjust as necessary, but love that I can more or less leave it alone. The exchange rate was relatively good (Â£1 = $1.69) so I decided to go ahead and send the funds and get everything set up (today it has already fallen slightly, so my timing was good).Registered - two of three online portions of the programme I'd like to do next year - Â£100. One takes 8 hours, the other about 30. The final one is 64 hours, so I'll be looking at that in January or February. It felt a bit overwhelming at the moment! Once that third and final portion is done, I'll have to see how I'm doing before registering for the full programme. It might be that I have to postpone for another year, but at least I can get started. I've just received confirmation that my material is ready for download so, HURRAH! I can even get started on this stuff this weekend.Yesterday I put a full tank of petrol into the car and bought a few toiletry bits that I've been putting off. I also removed my credit card details from my Amazon & FB accounts.Today I need to buy chicken food for the girls and some envelopes so I can set myself up for cash only from this point on.Â I got a bigger paycheque today than I was anticipating, which is great. I have to get two new tires for the car (I had considered four, but think I will maintain it on an 'as and when' basis, so I can build up my emergency fund again). I can now cover those - which should be less than Â£100 according to the guy at the garage - and my homoeopath appointment on Tuesday.I was flipping through a local magazine yesterday as well and came across an ad for a cleaning company - who are hiring! I'm sitting and thinking about this, but the pay is weekly and it's around the New Forest so I hope I could get something fairly local. I'm not willing to go too far just to clean someone's house and wind up using my paycheques just to cover petrol. I'm going to send her an email to inquire and see what she says. My hours are limited because I can only do weekends/holidays, but it costs nothing to ask at least. It's hard work, cleaning, but it doesn't have to be forever.I also sent an email to the local organiser of the Ringwood ladies' group that I was hoping to join to say that I didn't think it was a good fit for me, but would take her suggestion about contacting a different group. She agrees as she thinks they're a bit closer and certainly have a more 'youthful outlook' - ha ha! So I'll be sending an enquiry email about that over the next few days too.I saw my brother & SIL on Tuesday evening. They had just arrived from Vancouver that afternoon and driven directly to my cousin's so were pretty exhausted. We went out for dinner, though, and managed to have a decent visit and catch up. They are finally engaged, too - it only took my brother 13 years! They then went to Wales for an overnight visit (!) before heading back to London yesterday for a few days to see friends there. They fly back to South Africa on Monday.My sister arrives on Monday for two nights, too. I haven't seen her since May, so we'll be able to have a good catch up whilst she's here. I'm looking forward to that. She'll be arriving mid-afternoon Monday, so once I've picked her up at the station we'll have a couple of hours so I can show her around a bit. The clocks go back on the 29th (just here, don't panic!), so it'll be dark by 5:00 or so.I decided last week that I needed some proper wet weather gear, so I did a bit of a spending flurry and ordered a new waterproof jacket, a pair of Bogs, and a proper, pretty umbrella (it's a sunflower!). This means I need to go through my closet again and sort out my coats, jackets, etc. I have two that need re-waterproofing before I give them away, so the stuff to do that with has been added to my Amazon wishlist. The Bogs fit a bit snugly, despite being my usual size, so have reordered a half-size larger. I'll be sending back the original pair next week. The boots and jacket are teal so I'll stand out amongst the Brits, who tend to black, brown, navy blue, and grey. I do love my colours.Anyway, tonight there's a week's worth of ghosty shows starting on TV - you can bet I'll be watching! I love that stuff. And Tuesday is the final of the Great British Bake Off!Have a great weekend, all!"},
{"title": "(Almost) Clearing debt with...more debt?", "date": "Tuesday 24 October 2017", "text": "exeterstf.org.ukÂ I am both terrified and pleased by this. This whole 'borrowing from Peter to pay Paul' existence of mine is a creation of my own doing; I appreciate and accept that. The bank said 'no', so I went elsewhere to try and, today,Â an hour after applying for a loan, the money was in my bank account.So. In full disclosure, I got Â£7,000 at a rate of 15.9% for five years (repayment total over that timeÂ is Â£9,828). I now have ONE reasonable monthly payment of Â£164.28, can pay extra as and when I can and pay it off early, both with no penalty. This saves me approximately Â£150 a month, giving me a little breathing room. Obviously, the sooner I pay it off, the less I end up paying.Â Repayments startÂ on 24 November, so I have a month's grace. I'm pleased because even though the amount isn't QUITE enough to clear my entire debt load, the interest rate is half of what I currently have on myÂ credit cards, so guess what's getting cleared first? One has already been done. I'm still expecting things to go through on the other one so am waiting for the numbers to change before I clear it.Â I've put Â£1,000 directly into my savings account, as I also want an emergency fund. This is aÂ flexible number, but is a good place to start. This can also be used toÂ towards the loan, which seems a little contradictory, but I'm going to see how I go in the next 12 months.Â The other half of the loan is going back to Canada to continue paying down my debts there. With the current exchange, that will give me approximately a year's worth of payments. I'm sure there's a way to set recurring payments, so I'm going to look into that over the next few days and set that up. This gives me a year's grace, so to speak. Once that's over, then I'll have a second monthly payment to contend with, but by then the minimum payments will have fallen considerably and I can adjust accordingly.IÂ intend to get this paid off long before the five-year mark, however. It means some serious belt-tightening and watching every penny, but this is the 'terrified' part of the whole thing. I absolutely do not want to fall behind, miss payments, or in any other way mess this up. And I don't want to still have it in five years. Or four years. Or even three. It feelsÂ a bitÂ 'loan shark-y' although has good general reviews and a good score from the financial overseer of such things.Anyway, I am feeling a bit lighter now and with the right focus and plan, this feels much more easily resolved somehow.ï»¿"},
{"title": "A bit of overtime!", "date": "Saturday 21 October 2017", "text": "Just today really. But how's that for an earworm? Oh, boy! That takes me back a bit.Anyway, I 'volunteered' to do a few hours overtime (and am taking 15-mins to type this) as we were short staffed this week and our typing got a bit ahead of us. Although we're more or less up to date with it, it's easier to come in and hammer out a few reports so that it's not so overwhelming. The phones aren't ringing, there's no one asking me to do other things, and so it's actually far more productive.Plus, it's a pretty miserable day today - Storm Brian is en route and there are heavy winds and periods of torrential rain. Apart from wondering how the cat is, I'm happy to be inside for the most part.I won't see the extra pay until next month's pay cheque at this point, but any little bit extra is welcome.I'd best get back to it, as I don't want to be here all day and have a couple more reports I'd like to get done before I leave (and it's almost 2:00 already).Have a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Long weekend winding down", "date": "Monday 16 October 2017", "text": "someecards.comYup. That's about the size of it! Haha!I'm into my last few hours of my long weekend and I have to say it's been lovely to have this time to chill out and relax. We're expecting the edge of Hurrican Ophelia to hit us later today - Western Ireland is already under alert and has sustained some damage and one death - but I don't believe it's going to be too back this far inland. Wind and some rain, but I can't imagine we're going to get it as badly as the west coast is expecting. The sky was a spooky orange earlier on, but so far that's about it. That's moved on and it's a bit brighter now, but wind warnings and alerts have been set in place for the western edges of the UK, due diligence by the Government and meteorologists. It's 30 years ago that the 'Storm of the Century' did such awful damage, so it's a bit weird to be having another such a storm almost 30 years to the day of the last one!Anyway, I'm tucked up with Wandering George, the cat, in my room. I went to mow the lawn earlier but must be doing something wrong because the mower wouldn't work for me. It's been a while since I've mowed a lawn, I admit, but it's not rocket science, particularly with electric mowers: plug it in, go! I was ridiculously frustrated, but a) there are no outside sockets on the house; b) the cord, had there been a socket to plug it into, wasn't long enough to have allowed me to cut the whole thing. I thought about plugging it into a socket in my room, but that wouldn't work because I would only reach about a third of the lawn. Then I checked the shed at the back of the garden. Nope. I finally checked the wendy house and found an outdoor extension cord that was perfect (on a spool like a garden hose). So I plugged that in, then plugged the mower into that. Nothing.After moving the cord to two different sockets with no change I gave up. I was pretty pissed off by this point (who likes feeling like an idiot over such a simple, straightforward thing?), so I asked my roommate if he knew anything about it. He's never mowed the lawn and apparently, there used to be a petrol mower, so he was no help. I'll try asking my other roommate, but I don't think she knows either, so I'll likely end up asking the landlady. It's going to have to wait until the weekend now, I'm afraid!But outside of that, I have been marginally productive. Today I took my paperwork to the medical clinic today to register, and have written up a CV to take to a couple of places this week in anticipation of possible Christmas hours. I haven't worked retail for a few yearsÂ but thought I'd give it a shot (I know, retail@Christmas, WTF am I thinking?). The Cook email I mentioned a couple of posts ago came to nothing, so I think the lady may have been hacked somehow. Not to worry. If I don't get any joy, I won't worry about it for the time being. I just want to try.Over the past several days I've read a book, gone shopping, gone for a walk, vacuumed my room, downloaded a bunch more free books, adjusted some numbers in my budget and my bank account, made some very small, loose plans with my sister for when she comes, and just felt really rested and relaxed. I'm ready to go back tomorrow, though. That's just long enough for me to recharge. Besides, I've got four more days off at the end of the month when my brother, SIL, and sister are here.I'm currently sitting here with a mud mask on, tea and a lovely piece of chocolate cake in front of me. I discovered on Saturday that the village has a bakery, so bought some bread, a piece of chocolate fudge cake and two baps for Â£3.47 (right???) this morning.Â I'll likely just settle in to eat cake and read some more this afternoon. I also want to do some writing out of stuff and checking into course start dates for next year. I'd like to start sometime in the middle of the year, but it depends what might work best in respect of time, availability, etc. I'm going to also look into a student loan so have to check the prerequisites for that.Anyway, it's been lovely few days. And an option noted for future reference!"},
{"title": "Taking a few days off :)", "date": "Friday 13 October 2017", "text": "koosakids.co.ukI have a long weekend this weekend. I had some vacation time outstanding, so have taken a few long weekends here and there until the end of the year. I'm off through Monday, then have time off again from 25-30 October (when my brother & SIL visit), a long weekend in November, and then my last three days over the Christmas week.As much as I like the week/two-week holidays, I have to say that I've enjoyed these occasionalÂ long weekends immensely. Just an extra day here or there to relax really does make almost as much difference as an entire week sometimes!It's been a good week overall. I started out by attending a Monday evening meeting with the Ringwood branch of the women's group I belong to. The speaker was a homoeopath and after a bit of a wandering start, theÂ talk was quite fascinating. His office is across the street from my office, conveniently enough, so I have made a mental note to make an initial appointment. I believe he'll be able to help in a way Western medicine hasn't.Despite that, I'm not convincedÂ that the Ringwood group is a good fit for me. They're very nice, but all (seemed) quite posh and I didn't feel nearly as comfortable with them as I did with my other group. I might try another group that's also fairly close, but I may just look for something else entirely. Or both. I'm not sure yet.I also had my car MOT'd and serviced yesterday, which went better than I thought. She didn't pass the initial MOT because there were a couple of 'fail' points that needed repair: rear registration lights needed new bulbs (easy fix), and there was some welding needed on the rear driver's side. The same place, actually, that she was welded LAST year, but on the inside of the wheel well rather than the outside, making it trickier. There was some brake fluid needed (NOT a clutch, as I'd feared!), I need two new tires before the end of the year, and that was about it. That should cost me less than Â£100Â and I think it's better to get all new tires at the same time so I will consider that.Yesterday's total: Â£464.95 and I can now taxÂ her without any worries. He said the car was otherwise in good shape, which I am pleased to hear.Â PLUS, I was able to pay for all that in cash, although it took all my savings to do it. Thanks to my cousin's generosity over the summer, I had managed to squirrel away enough for my deposit and first month's rent here, plus have a bit left over. Now that's gone, but I am more than pleased I didn't have to put it on a credit card. I was concerned it would be more than that, so that's part of the reason I'm okay with parting with it. It confirms to me that I need to carry on with my little bit of saving I do each month.I didn't get the loan with the bank and that's absolutely fine. I went in saying that I wasn't sure they could do anything for me and they can't - not right now, at least.Yesterday I also spent a good portion of my day (slow work day) downloading FREE books to my iPad - I'm learning! :) I think I have 44 newÂ ones. I know they're out there, I know the library offers an enormous selection as well, but it appears that I believe to get anything 'fun' you need to spend money. And that is absolutely untrue, as we all know.Today my plans are simple: putter, think, read, tidy. I've already done a laundry and have a second, smaller one on. I've been to the shops and bought a few things I need for the next several days (food wise). I'm going back shortly to drop some stuff at the thrift shop, as I had a bag designated for a charity pick up on Tuesday and it wasn't picked up, so that's fine. It just goes somewhere else, that's all.I need to be at home later, though, as my roommate has a computer being delivered and it needs a signatory.I'd like to go for a walk as well, as I've not yet explored Bransgore and don't know my way around at all. I'm going to register at one of the doctor's surgeries as well, as I'm no longer in the catchment area for my current surgery.Â I'm also going to sit and think about what I NEED. Important things like taking care of my health, saving, decluttering, going to see the homoeopath, resting and relaxing, to not-as-urgent stuff like getting my car washed (it needs doing so desperately, but it's so dirty I'm embarrassed to take it to get it cleaned! Hahaha!), reading all my books, registering for one of the online portions of the course I want to take next year; and all the way down to those unessential-yet-little tasks that fill your days: putting away the dishes, tidying the kitchen, watching Pointless this evening, drinking copious amounts of tea, planning when I can mow the lawn, and finding somewhere I can buy a dustpan.It really is lovely to have the house to myself for most of the day, putter and fuss and tidy and plot."},
{"title": "A rather random, rambling post...", "date": "Sunday 8 October 2017", "text": "theperformancecurve.comSo, T'Pol, over at Frugal@Istanbul wrote this post a couple of days ago about how do you define a NEED?She makes some excellent points, and I know this is something I really struggle with and have struggled with my whole life. This insidious feeling of 'lack', that you're not good enough without this, that, or the other (most expensive flavour-of-the-month) thing. I understand that all this stuff is simply a facade for being lonely, bored, afraid, unworthy, poor, etc. But the question is, do I GET it? Like, truly, really, honestly, down-to-my-cellular-core GET IT?Obviously not, because shortly after I read that I went over to Amazon and bought some more books for my Kindle. That makes 143 (plus the ones I've read and not counting the ones I've read and since deleted) for me to read, PLUS all the actual books on actual shelves I've still got to read (so. many. books.).*sigh*So I'm making October my 'discovery' month: discovering what I currently have, what I currently (genuinely) need, what I can get rid of, what I can cut down on (books & food wastage), what falls into the 'want' category, and working out small step plans to do better.Needs I currently, genuinely, have are as follows:1. MOT & Service for the car. Absolute necessities. I can't legally drive without having the MOT, and I always get a service at the same time because it makes sense as she's an old car. I've booked this for next Thursday. I'm hoping that I'll be able to keep her on the road for another year, but realise I may need to start looking before that. If anything is wrong at the MOT, it needs to be fixed before she can go back on the road. My tax isn't due until the end of the month, so this gives me lots of time to repair anything that's needed. I checked the oil level this morning and it seems fine, but my clutch is squeaking in second gear and she looks a bit low on the driver's side, so I'm afraid of what they're going to say. But there's no point worrying about it until they say it.2. Groceries for the month. I'm almost already through my grocery budget and it's only the 8th. I need to be exceptionally careful about this.3. That's really about it.Rent is paid. All the bills are included in the one payment (water, electricity, internet, council tax, cable, etc.). I do need some more chicken feed, but they'll be okay for a couple of days on some pumpkin seeds and green beans - they also love bananas!Â So shelter needs are taken care of nicely and quite comfortably. I've paid what bills I have (mobile phone, credit cards, etc.), bought enough pots of instant oatmeal while they were on sale to last me three weeks (MOMA coconut and chia - delicious!!), and try to buy simple things for lunch (although why I can't just make extra for dinner and take leftovers for lunch, I don't know).My debt: I've been making a list of things that I can potentially sell: my bike, my DSLR, books, items of clothing, etc. I don't have much. But I AM sick of this debt, so selling items could potentially get me a little bit closer to eradicating it (realising that I won't get a lot of money for the items and assuming that I don't keep adding to it). They're all still just potentials at this point, but they are articles that would be worth a little something. Sometimes you can't have nice things until you can afford to have the nice things. Right?All of this is part and parcel of the big changes I've had in the past few weeks. I've moved house, we've moved the office, I'm adjusting to new routines with new people,sorting out a new room. Nothing so dramatic that I can't handle it, but the move was needed, and now I need to sit down and plan out a few things to make sure I don't keep the same habits from keeping me stuck in the same place.I had a two-hour yoga workshop yesterday morning which was fantastic and really needed. I'm stiff and sore from being in the car every day. I feel so much better this morning! I went for lunch with my friend and her family afterwards and it felt really nice to be included in the gathering.I spent the afternoon puttering in my room, doing laundry, catching up with Strictly Come Dancing (can't believe I've not been watching this year!) and chatting with my sister online. I also got an email from someone at a company called Cook. I had enquired about part time work in mid-September, as they were opening a new store in Ringwood and I thought it might make an ideal second job. This is a company that makes frozen meals here in the UK. There are stores all over the UK, but there is a central kitchen where the meals are cooked (no additives or preservatives!), flash frozen to -35C, and then sent tot the stores. It's truly delicious stuff (some is nicer than others) and very popular. The email said she had a copy of my CV, but no contact number. I'm a bit suspcious about that, because a copy of my CV would have my contact number on it, although the email looks legit enough. However, as I had enquired about p/t work on their main website, she wouldn't have had my email address otherwise (I hope!). This email came entitled 'Interview for Ringwood'Â from an area manager last night at just before 6pm, so I called and left a message. If it's legit, I'll get a call back. If not, then she may have been hacked. I did send it to my sister to have a look at it, although it doesn't look wholly professional, and she said to follow it up.Â I'll know soon enough.A second job would be ideal. And as it's nearing Christmas, this is a good time to start looking. I know I'd be happiest at a bookstore, so am going to work on my resume to take to the bookstore in Ringwood too.I have a bank appointment on Tuesday. I want to talk to someone about a consolidation loan to clear me of my CC debt, and perhaps give me enough to buy a decent used car. I've seen one that I like for less than Â£3k. I genuinely don't know if they'll give me one or be able to help me in any way, but it costs me nothing to ask. I'm picking away at my Canadian debt and am feeling resigned but hopeful about that, but I'd like to have one single, simple payment here rather than scattering my money in about 15 different places.Otherwise, work is going pretty well. We're distracted by the MD being in the same space as us and are trying to come up with ways to get him to move into the office down the hall (using passive-aggressive means, of course, not outright asking).After a chat with my Italian roommate and hearing her struggles to learn her trade in the UK (she's a sommelier), I've decided I need to get back to learning. I'm going to register in November for an online portion of an aromatherapy programme that I'd like to do sometime next year. I need to take advantage, in the best way, of my language skills, my free time, and my desire to keep learning.So that's my ramble for today. I hope you all have a lovely weekend - Happy Thanksgiving to all you Canadians, and a Happy Columbus Day for you Americans tomorrow!"},
{"title": "I'm in!", "date": "Monday 25 September 2017", "text": "www.dianegottsmann.comWell, I'm all moved in at last. I spent Saturday moving the bits & pieces I needed down to the living room, packing up the last of my items in my wardrobe, and taking apart my desk. I felt very productive but a bit strange dismantling all the pieces that have been my life for four years. The room was almost empty when I finished, just the bed, wardrobe and side table still remaining.All a bit sad and forlorn. Not even the cat! I had booked a man with a van for Sunday morning and he showed up at 10:00 to get everything awkward to my new place (bed, bike, large plants, dresser, etc.) and who managed to get lost on the way there - he put the wrong post code in and wound up about 3 miles from where he should have been! Whoops. Anyway, he finally made it and unloaded everything into the new space, and my cousin and I set to unpacking and setting up. This is currently what it looks like:The bedroom side, which I'm quite happy with (for now).The sitting area, which is still quite disorganised. I'm working on this today (ostensibly at least) and hope to have it looking a bit less like a small bomb went off in it. I need to get rid of stuff, so am pleased that there is a thrift shop in the village that I can take things to.This is my outside space (on a cool, misty day):Private patio with picnic table. I'm responsible for maintenance of this portion of garden.French doors from my room (little roses are from my cousin, boots are chicken poopy). Hoping spring will see some pots and plants of various colours and variety to brighten it up.The girls! I've named them Claudette (white) and Brunhilde (brown) for no discernable reason other than they seem like chicken-y names. Eggs every day (more than even I can eat, really) so can take them and give them away to my cousin, etc.I have a few pictures to hang, bits and pieces to go through and keep/toss/donate, but so far it's all fitting in - although that's not necessarily a GOOD thing. ;)The first thing I did, before I started unpacking, was to remove theÂ Glade plug in thing from the wall. The owner had it there because of her dogs, but I hate them so got rid of it quickly. The ones in the hallway and kitchen were removed today, too, as I was chatting with my roommate this morning and she said she didn't like them either, so out they came. They're in the junk drawer in the kitchen if anyone is so inclined to replace them.The radiators come on quite early and stay on all night (!) and I can't seem to turn mine off. Not for lack of trying, as I've certainly already spent a good amount of time playing with the valve and although it shows as '0', it's still pumping the heat out. I've got my windows and french door open to keep it cool enough in here to sleep. A terrible waste of energy.Otherwise, I've met George the cat who seems very friendly, have sorted out the chickens (8 eggs today, which means they've not been collected for several days), and had a quick lesson in all things appliance - washing machine, oven, shower, etc. A cleaning rota has been left by the owner and I said I would do the bathroom today. It makes sense while I have a whole day ahead of me.I've been changing addresses as I remember: driver's licence, bank, credit cards, library...I don't have much so it shouldn't be so hard to keep track of everything.I'd best get on with my tidying and sorting so that I'm not looking at all this stuff six months from now. It's a slow process, I realise, but getting a head start on it isn't a bad thing.Once I have things sorted more to my liking, and much tidier, I'll post another photo. In the meantime, I'll spend some time settling in a little. :D"},
{"title": "I'm moving!! :D", "date": "Sunday 27 August 2017", "text": "www.karenzapaperie.co.ukWell, I did it. I found a new place to live yesterday and I am REALLY pleased with it.Despite my enthusiam in my last post about the studio flat and possibly being fully independent again, I came home from seeing the room in Bransgore, a pretty Forest village, more or less already moved in! Haha!Â The flat in Fordgingbridge was cute and much roomier than I imagined, with loads of storage space (could have even used one of the spaces - pantry sized - as a mini-library!), although the bedroom was on the small side for a double and kitchen was T-I-I-I-N-Y! But heaps of character (beams, uneven walls and floors, etc.), big bathroom and a bright, roomy living area. It would, however, be a nightmare to move anything into - the stairs are on the steep side and winding in a narrow stairwell, so getting something like a sofa in there would be almost impossible if it weren't flat-packed. But the reason it hasn't rented (and probably won't for the foreseeable future) is that the electricity is on a coin-operated meter, so you feed in pound coins to run it. I think. I've never actually used one and don't quite understand the concept of it, but can't imagine it's particularly cheap and efficient. The landlady, however, won't change it, despite requests from the estate agents.Â Plus there's no parking included and I'd either have to park further up the street in the residential area or buy an annual permit (Â£100) and park in the public lot around the corner.So I was a bit disappointed although, as I say, I didn't dislike it. Fordingbridge is a nice little town, and the drive to Ringwood is only about 15 mins or so (just over 5 miles).Next I went to Bransgore to see the room. It's a small village tucked into a corner of the Forest, 6.5 miles (16 mins drive) south of Ringwood and not somewhere I've been before.You can see Ringwood just at the top of the map.Part of my dilemma with having to move was the fact that, apart from not having the funds to do it, I wanted to be fully independent. Why should I look at rooms again?Well, this place was lovely! Really and truly. The room was at the back of the house, opening onto a sun-filled patio (with picnic table) that was all mine! There are two chickens, a fish pond, a little guest house/potential studio at the back, parking, a BBQ & garden area at the side/front, all the shops are literally a block away, it's bright and cosy and the owner and one of the other tenants were there to chat with me. The owner is so easy going and is moving to Spain. The tenant I met (there are currently two) was an Italian lady, a sommelier (!) and quite lovely. The other tenant, a solicitor, was away, but has apparently been there about 6 years and has zero inclination to move away - his office is actually located above the grocery store on the corner (about 100 yards from the house). The house would more or less be mine on weekends, as the sommelier works and the solicitor is away at his parents' or somewhere.It's sooooo peaceful!Rent includes everything, including council tax, and as I was more or less redecorating the place less than an hour later, it shouldn't come as a surprise that I took it. We all liked each other very much and it seems I'll be the one using the kitchen the most as the other two just aren't around or don't cook much.I paid my deposit last night and pick up the keys next Sunday, when I'll be in Ringwood helping a bit to set up the new office for a couple of hours. I'll drop some un-necessary bits and pieces there (my books, most likely, and some knick knacks) at the same time and can see how it might all start to fit together.The Forest is about 5 minutes up the street, it's 10 minutes drive to the beach, I can cycle more or less anywhere, and the drive to work will be very quiet. I'm hoping to be fully moved in before the end of September, but as I'll have my keys I can come and go as I please and will be officially settled by 1 October.So, I'll be driving more than I'd like, but not on any major roads and the distance means I'll be home before 6:00, which is almost half an hour sooner than I am now! Biking - depending on the roads - would take me about half an hour, so once I'm more familiar with the roads and the area I can start doing that when it's lighter in the evenings. The narrow English roads are frightening enough during full daylight as a cyclist, I don't want to risk them at night quite frankly.Anyway, I'm feeling really good about it all. Staying with my cousin was never meant to be a permanent things and I've over-stayed my welcome. So this is going to be good for both of us.Will post pictures once I've got everything to my liking. :D"},
{"title": "Busy Saturday to come!", "date": "Thursday 24 August 2017", "text": "The house hunt continues BUT I am very excited because I have a very busy Saturday with viewings at THREE potential places.I'm having one last kick at the can with the flat in Fordingbridge, if for no other reason than I'm very curious to see why it isn't renting. Is it haunted? Is there a tremendous stink? Can you get any furniture up the stairs? Is it a sauna in the summertime? Is it ridiculously noisy, seeing as it overlooks the High Street? Are the neighbours creepy? Am I going to feel claustrophobic because of low ceilings (it's on the second floor)?All legitimate questions that I shall seek answers to. IÂ like Fordingbridge, but the flat really isn't affordable for me, so this is most likely a wasted trip for the agent. But there is also the slim potential for renegotiating the rent, so I'm leaving that window open as well (although I've never done it before). Surely any reasonableÂ amount of rent for the landlord is better than losing Â£550 a month by itÂ sitting empty?I'm then zipping down to a village called Bransgore, which is tucked into a corner of the Forest just south of Ringwood, to see a room. It's at the back of a bungalow, shared with two other people, and the room has its own private patio out the back! It's a decent size and Bransgore is a quick ~12 min drive to Ringwood, almost 4 miles. It's walking distance to all amenities and I could, depending on the roads, ride my bike to work in good weather.Rent is Â£550 per month, including all bills. I'm assuming this also includes council tax, but that's a question I'll have to ask.I was then going to see a room only a 5-min walk from Ringwood High Street, but I've just today cancelled that visit. I would beÂ claustrophobic and I don't want a repeat of my time in Chertsey, where I more or less jumped at the cheapest room and wound up being entirely miserable the whole time I was there. Rent, inclusive of bills, Â£400. I'd be able to save/pay down more, but I would not be happy.And then...AND THEN!!!!!!Â This little studio flat in Ringwood popped up. 20 mins walk from Ringwood High Street, across the fields from a place called Liberty's OwlÂ Raptor and Reptile Centre, somewhere I was considering volunteering because...owls & raptors! I've got an appointment booked for 2:30. I'd be happy if the current occupant left all her stuff, as it's beautifully laid out, but sadly I'm not confident that'll happen. But it's entirely self-contained and it's just me, so how much space do I really need?I'm beyond excited about this because I also have the funds to pay the criminal outrageous estate agency fees, deposit & set up fees for utilities. I'll be down to a zero budget every month with no room for luxuries, but it would be so fantastic to be independent again. I've got umpteen books and as long as I have internet, I'm more or less happy. Ringwood has a library and (hopefully) a few options for part-time work if I needed.I like both the Bransgore room and the Ringwood studio for different reasons. But I have to see them to be able to make a proper decision. I haven't seen the rest of the Bransgore house yet, so can't make any comments. The studio may be exceptionally claustrophobic feeling in its own way.Â You really can'tÂ make a decision based on Internet photos.So, fingers crossed for me, please! I'll let you know how I get on and what I ultimately decide."},
{"title": "Still looking for a new place", "date": "Saturday 19 August 2017", "text": "I'm certainly feeling better since my last post - which is good for everyone really! - although I am going to make a concerted effort to shift some of this weight. I might also just get rid of the scales, too, as they tell me I'm now at my heaviest ever: 78kg (12stÂ or 168lbs). Up until I arrived here, I've consistently weighed 66kg and that's what I'm used to. Not to say that it's not where my natural weight is, but where I am now is uncomfortable, unhealthy, incredibly frustrating and entirely something I can control, so I need to control it.To that end, I've done a massive (!) food order and will be jumping on the 'no sugar' bandwagon again this week. I did a great service to myself the first time I did this, so why I had such difficulty following through a couple more times I've no idea. Regardless, I realised yesterday that I quit smoking cold turkey 21 years ago, so it's like that the best way for me to quit sugar too. The only concession I'll be making is a small glass of orange juice in the morning for my iron supplement.roseannzaft.comI plan to follow it to the letter otherwise, portion size and everything to see if I can shift some of this bloat, weight, brain fogginess, etc. being aware, however, that some of it isÂ menopause-related and I can't change everything. I can moderate the symptoms, however, and being able to wear something other than only yoga pants would be most welcome.In other news, the house/home hunt continues.That's about the size of it, isn't it? Or what it feels like at least. I have decided to take one last opportunity to look at the flat in Fordingbridge, although I admit I can't really afford it. Currently, bare-bones living in the flat will leave me Â£23 in the hole each month, and that's at a minimum! I'll consider a (very) cheeky offer on the rent after seeing it and having a chat with the agent, but obviously, that's yet to be determined.I've made a spreadsheet with expected/assumed costs on it and keep fiddling with the numbers. I've now got several options on it, including rooms that are up to 8 miles from Ringwood (meaning higher fuel costs).The room I had hoped for has fallen through, sadly, but I am at the top of her list should anything change in the next six months or so. I had a lovely chat with the homeowner on Thursday evening and she's disappointed as well, but as it's her (severely handicapped) daughter moving back in from group home living, she feels she needs to concentrate all her energy on making sure her daughter is happy and in a good place.Absolutely fine obviously! I'm not in danger of being kicked out although I know my cousin would like me gone sooner rather than later,Â but IÂ need to be proactive in my search so she knows I'm serious and not just wanting the rental discount. The longer I'm here, however, the better. I'd like to have as much set aside for moving as I possibly can and then, once moved, I can use some of those saved funds to use as a springboard for saving towards a proper deposit/utility set up fees and also for debt repayment.I sent queries about three possible rooms yesterday, one of which I've already had a response about. The landlord is just waiting for a deposit on it, which is a bit disappointing as it's quite lovely! I've not had a response about either of the others yet, although I know the messages have been received. It's hard not to get disheartened but as it's only been a day I don't suppose I can start giving up just yet! :PI've also got some details about a part-time, home-based job for the women's group I belong to. It's a national group and they're looking for a Website and Publicity Coordinator, so you need to be quite au fait with, well, web stuff like Facebook, Twitter, etc. as well as being inclined to work to attract new members (i.e. marketing), etc. I'm more or less qualified so I thought I would give it a shot. Nothing ventured, nothing gained after all. I have until 8 September to apply so will mess about this weekend with my CV and polish it up a little.Otherwise, the move to Ringwood is scheduled for 1 September and very little has been done at the office. I'm hoping the Office Manager, back from holidays on Monday, will get a schedule of some sort done so that we can tackle all this stuff head on. It's tricky while we still more or less need everything to keep the office going until that day. I have to get quite a bit of stuff filed away, packed into non-existent boxes, and we have SO. MUCH. JUNK. to get rid of. Boxes of computer bits & pieces everywhere - keyboards, mice, cords, towers...surely someone will collect and recycle/reuse that sort of thing? Someone always does.Anyway, some good food, some internet home searches, perhaps starting my morning walks again, continuing with my room declutter and planning for a boot sale, getting the office organised and applying for that part-time job are all on my agenda and will hopefully make the next couple of weeks fly by.I'll try to get some photos of the move (if anyone's interested), current and new digs. I'll be heading to the new offices on 3 September to do a bit of setting up, so I'll try to sneak a few photos in."},

It's so frustrating.Â Literally the only pants I can fit into at the moment are my yoga pants, and even they're starting to become slightly uncomfortable. And I'm fatigued. So tired I can't even think about thinking! I'm in that cycle of feeling so fatigued I just want to sleep and feeling like I've got permanent PMS, so I'm eating mostly sugar and salty (you know the drill, chocolate then chips, chocolate then chips, etc.) and then feeling worse than ever. I KNOW - genuinely, honestly, intellectually and realistically KNOW - that it's not helping. Not even a little bit. In fact, it'sÂ making things worse.I'm contemplating another No Sugar programme, but IÂ have enoughÂ recipes for about 3 cookbooks worthÂ (plus three ACTUAL cookbooks) that I'm already not using, so will probably forego that and simply try to find the motivation to do it on my own.I'm feeling frustrated that real estate feels entirely out of my reach, in every respect - my cousins and I were commiserating the other day. Even they, with a good income and dual incomes respectivelyÂ both said that if they were trying to getÂ onto the ladder now, they're pretty sure it wouldn't be possible. That makes me feel a BIT better.Â Certainly, though, my sister and I are feeling frustrated, feeling it feltÂ easier in Canada, although I'm notÂ sure that's necessarily the case anymore (depending on where you live). Whitehorse was more or less out of my reachÂ at the time I left - I wasÂ lucky I had a fantastic landlady who valued quality tenants overÂ rental income.Â My sister is getting fed up with moving around constantly but is in the position of needing a steady job to get accommodation and needing accommodation to get a steady job. I'm slightly ahead with the steady job, but it doesn't get me much further ahead as there's honestly not much out there. I've printed off paperwork to apply for council housing, but there are years' long waitlists for that although if I don't put my name on a list, I'll never be eligible. Southampton, for example, has a 7-year waitlist for one-bedroom accommodation.I suppose I just feel I should be further ahead than I am at 50 and lodging with a cousin. You know?Searching out people I've gone to school with doesn't help either. All the ones I've found are Successful and have Real Jobs and Careers (thanks to my mother to comparing us constantly to 'better, smarter, more polite, nicer' kids while we were growing up).I'm bored and kind of fed upÂ with my job but am feeling loyal to employers who are, overall, very good people. My quandary: I want to move on, but I simply don't know what I want to do.Plus I went out for dinner last night and ate way too much. W-A-Y too much. So I'm feeling fat(ter) now.Blah.ButÂ these moments always motivate me - to an extent - to try to do things differently, make some changes, etc. Sometimes it even works. I know I need to change, it's just picking the thing to do first.This'll pass. It always does. I'm really yearning, though, to have my own space again - wholly, totally, entirely my own. But what I have to gather right at the moment is patience. Another year and I think I'll be closer to that. I keep looking, and looking is fun, which keeps me going. Thanks for the ear!"},
{"title": "A few days off", "date": "Tuesday 1 August 2017", "text": "htiblog.comI've had a few days off, nothing in particular planned, but just because I have some holiday time to use up and sometimes it's just nice to not be at work for a few days. I'm back to work tomorrow for a short week (that will likely feel twice as long!) and then don't have anything else scheduled until my trip to Edinburgh in September with Jane.I've sorted stuff out to put towards a car boot sale that my cousin and I are going to do at some point next month - clothes, a few books, random items like a bike basket, some throws, etc. I won't make a lot of money, obviously, but the point is to clear some bits out and a car boot sale is as good a place as anywhere. Whatever doesn't sell will go to charity (unless it's complete rubbish). There's a local one that runs every Sunday and has a Â£5 fee for vendors which is reasonable.I had an appointment to view the flat in Fordingbridge last Thursday as well but have rescheduled again to Saturday, Aug 5. I just couldn't be bothered to go in all honesty. I'll go and see it but after crunching some numbers I can't afford it anyway, unfortunately - not if I want to eat! A shame, but going to see it won't hurt and will give me a good idea of space for the future. There's definitely a reason it's not renting as flats don't generally stay so long on the market (it was first posted a year ago, but I don't know if tenants have been in since then). Certainly a top floor flat is going to be slightly more difficult to rent out, but I would have thought that lowering the rent even a little would be an option at this point - surely something is better than nothing? I don't know. I appreciate there's a 'break even' point before you actually start to lose money and perhaps the landlord is currently at that price point now, but I do wonder. Regardless, I still can't afford it which saddens me a bit.I did, however, decide to take the room in Ringwood. It just makes sense, particularly as I won't have to drive anywhere on a regular basis and can keep the car parked. It won't be until October 1 though, as I have some commitments inÂ September to see through before shifting. It will also give me more time to divest myself of excess clutter and give me an extra month to save. It also means a month of commuting, but I'm okay with that as it's only about 20 minutes, more or less direct from where I am and against the traffic! I've sent the homeowner a note and am hoping to hear back from her soon. I'm pleased because I'll be able to actually save a bit. Ringwood is also a larger town and there are more opportunities for part-time jobs (I hope!) if I wanted one.Â I've worked out aÂ loose budgetÂ for (assumed) costs once I've moved but obviously that will change once I've lived with it for a while. I'm still hoping for a bit of a pay rise but I don't think I'll hear any more about that until all the ink has dried on the paperwork for the new offices so am not anticipating that for the budget at the moment. We do finally have a new space, right on the high street in Ringwood town centre, and the MD is anticipating we'll be in by the first week in September (!!!) but I'm not sure how that's actually going to work. We'll get movers for the physical aspect of it, but it more or less means we need to start clearing the huge amount of clutter yesterday. Ah well. I did say I was happy to put some weekends in but just need to know in advance.Oh! And I got my first pair(s) of glasses too. I was determined to make it to 50 before I got glasses, and am now the proud owner of two pairs of reading glasses. It's going to take me some time to figure out when I need these and when I don't, but I'm sure it won't take long. The reading glasses in the drug stores are much cheaper but I need a prescription because my eyes have minor astigmatism. I'd say 'just' readers at this point is pretty good. I've been very lucky not to need any corrective eyewear to this point, particularly as all my family has worn them forever.Otherwise, my time off has been quiet, not doing much of anything. I've washed just about everything that needs it, sorted out the stuff (above), grocery shopped, had a lavender tea with my cousin on Sunday, and have been catching up with 'Endeavour', which is terrific.I've been doing a bit of catching up with everyone's blogs, too, which has been a nice treat.Â I hope you're all having a great summer!"},
{"title": "Hiking for a cause (with pictures!)", "date": "Sunday 23 July 2017", "text": "macmillan.org.ukMy dad was 50 years old when he died of pancreal cancer, back in 1981. I reached 50 this year and it feels a bit surreal to be where he was, but in such different circumstances: no kids, no marriage, not a homeowner, no career (I have jobs, not careers), yet I'm now actually older than he was - he died only a month after his 50th birthday.Macmillan is a national cancer charity, supporting patients and their families through their cancer journies, supplying nurses, support, advice, help, etc. Most of their funding comes through fundraising and charitable giving and they are a tremendously worthwhile group to support (I already give Â£5 a month).To that end, every year they organiseÂ and promote fundraisers like coffee mornings, where people bring cakes and coffee and donate towards the cause, to golf games, quizzes, walks, hikes, bikes, etc. The hikes are generally pretty tough and are aptly dubbed 'Mighty Hikes' for good reason.I decided at the beginning of the year that I would do one of these hikes so registered for one on the Jurassic Coast (south west coast) - all 22 miles of it - on July 8. The kit came with a guide to training, information about fundraising, etc. so I was all set. First, though, I asked my boss at work if they would be willing to match me with anything I raised and he said yes! I know they support Macmillan anyway, but it was still a good feeling to have him say 'yes' to that.I did no training, however, not even a little, figuring I would get as far as I would get (I actually got further than I thought I would) and that it would be a well-fought struggle to get there anyway. No one prepares for cancer, after all...Anyway, the walk started in the seaside town of Weymouth, in Dorset and travelled along part of the South West Coast Path, finishing 23.5 miles away near Corfe Castle. I had registered for an 8:00 start, based solely on the fact that that's the time Jane and I generally start out our hiking days. To be fair, however, we've never hiked that far in a day - our longest was about 19km, this worked out to over 37!There were 1300 of us hikers that day, staggered in groups of approximately 200 every half hour from 7:00 (for the slowest) to 10:00 (for the super fit), all to be completed by 9:00 at the latest that night. Each group had a welcome speech and a few minutes of Zumba to warm up and off we went. I started out with a young lady I met at the start, but very quickly found myself on my own again. Only for about a half an hour or so, however, as I met a lovely woman, also on her own, and we were well matched for pace, so we hiked the rest of the way together. I honestly believe I would not have made it as far as I did without her encouragement and support.Â IT WAS TOUGH.And this is my journey in photos:Weymouth beach, with the Esplanade in the background.I walked to the registration tent on Friday night when I arrived (a half hour from my B&B) and found this mosaic en route.The pebbled half of the beach with the Jurassic coastline in the distance.Weymouth, looking back towards the harbour.Sunset from my B&B window - note pub opposite! I had a wretched night - not because of the B&B, but beause of the noise around it. So. Much. Noise. I must have got about 3 or 4 hours sleep. Ugh.Saturday morning - streets are quiet.I love these old fashioned benches.Beach huts!Ice cream! My favourite...too bad it's shut!The start - the 7:30 group getting their motivation on!A look back at the coastline, about half an hour in.The Osmington White Horse - representing King William III.Sunrise. It was deceptively humid already. Temperature supposed to be about 21 & overcast.Â Yeah, okay...5 miles done and our first rest stop - drinks, medics, fruit, snacks, information and toilets. It was extremely well done and had everything you could want. We had a good rest of about 20 minutes or so. We were feeling quite good at this point as it was a reasonably paced walk, with a few moderate climbs. Lulled us into a false sense of security, really...After our break, the clouds starting dissipating and the temperature climbed little by little. Shade disappeared and by the time we got to Lulworth Cove, five miles later and our lunch stop, it was considerably hotter than when we had started, and beginning to get much hillier.I'm unclear exactly if this is abandoned or not. It looks like it might be, but also has solar panels on the roof and curtains in the windows, so I'm really not sure. At any rate, it was kind of remote and the photo below is more or less the view.Ohhh, those downhills were tough! And as steep as the uphills.The Durdle Door! 'Durdle' is apparently derived from the Old English word, 'thirl', meaning bore or drill. And the Durdle Door is apparently privately owed, as part of the holdings of the Weld family, who own 12,000 acres in Dorset as part of the Lulworth Estate.Lulworth Cove and village. You can see our destination, the big white tent in the field in the foreground.It was hot, hot, hot by the time we made it for lunch. It was fantastic - a delicious variety of salads, cold meats, muffins and cookies, drinks, etc. We stayed slightly longer than we had anticipated but as I was really hungry and not feeling so great when we arrived, the rest was good and I was ready to go after a good break.Pretty Lulworth Cove village.Lulworth Cove.Deceptively shallow climb.Boats everywhere - we were all rather wishing for a quick dip at this point. The temperature had risen steadily to about 24C and with no shade, that direct sun took a lot out of people.Gorgeous!The woman I hiked with, pausing at the bottom where we actually got a more realistic view of the hill. It was a monster and took us about 40 minutes to climb.But the view was amazing!Down the other side of that monster, hoping the next one isn't QUITE so awful (it was).My battery ran out here, but we are just starting up the next hill here.Ultimately, we made itÂ 15 miles and got a shuttle to the next rest stop at mile 17.5, where we withdrew. I literally could not have walked another step - my poor feet! And that heat was wretched. People were still continuing - the really fit ones - to the finish, but we headed back to town and our beds.I'm still collecting my donations but believe, with work's match, that I've raised just over Â£500! I think that's pretty awesome, actually, considering I don't really know that many people.My cousin picked me up the next day, which was awesome of her, and we stopped for a late lunch at a pub called The World's End, just outside of Ringwood. It was another stinking hot day and as I'd got myself quite burned, I just wanted to be away from the sun, wherever that happened to be. It was cooler inside and we had a lovely meal before the final leg home.That morning, before I met her, I'd spent some time wandering the town. It was the annual Seafood Festival (makes me wish I like seafood, apart from prawns), so it was packed.It was a great weekend and although my poor toes are in pretty bad shape, I'm really glad I did it and very proud of myself for getting as far as I did. I would definitely do another one, but perhaps one that's not quite so long - maybe 10-15 miles instead - as it's a great cause.Â *******************************************************************************I've been on the lookout for a flat, as I've mentioned, and have tried to view a little flat in a village called Fordingbridge (15 mins north of Ringwood) twice now. The first time was my fault the viewing fell through, I admit. I thought I had plugged my phone in to charge, but I had forgotten to turn the switch on and so it didn't charge overnight as I'd planned. It meant I missed both the email and voice mail asking me to confirm that I would be meeting the agent as arranged; if not, she wasn't going to make the journey from Salisbury.Fair enough. I called and apologised when I got home and rearranged my viewing for yesterday. I hadn't heard from the agency and when I called to say that I was there, I found out that THEY hadn't added the rearranged appointment to their books! ARGH. So, I've rearranged once more (and for the last time) to see the flat on Thursday morning. I have a few days off this week, so I hope it actually happens this time!Â After that, we went down to Ringwood to view a room that I'd arranged to see. Unfortunately, the room itself I couldn't see as someone is currently in it (I have seen it in a photo online, however), but we were shown around the house by an utterly lovely woman and I'm actually inclined to take just it, as it's a 15-minute walk from Ringwood High Street, there's an allocated parking spot, two (tiny) dogs, a garden (albeit a paved one) and the house is immaculate. The costs of having my own flat, however, are a bit out of my reach at the moment so this would be a more feasible, realistic move for me.I need to find out when we're expecting to move, crunch a few numbers and try to make a decision. I told the homeowner I would get back to her next week, but I'm the right age and gender for her preferences, as well as having a 'normal' working routine, so I'm pretty sure the room is mine and I just have to say so.I'll let you know how I get on!"},
{"title": "June update - with photos!", "date": "Sunday 2 July 2017", "text": "The Knights Trail, LincolnIt's been a good month (not spending-wise, however) as it's been busy at work, and I was away last week for a long weekend.I joined a women's group last year and there's an annual conference to bring lots of us together from all over the country for a day or three. The conferences move around the country, allowing day attendance for whichever local groups are in the area. There are also regional conferences throughout the year which everyone is welcome to attend.There were about 300 of us at this national conference, held in the very pretty city of Lincoln (Lincolnshire). There were wraparound events planned and three of us from my group attended. I drove up with one other lady, Alison, on Friday and we arrived at about 1:00, after a 5-hour journey. To be fair, we would have been slightly earlier but were talking so much at one point that we missed our exit and carried on almost to Birmingham (too far west). Whoops! A bit of a cross-country trek back got us back on track, fortunately.I had booked an AirBnB which was in the perfect location - a 5-minute walk from the castle and about 15 mins from the University of Lincoln, where the conference was being held. Perfect! We weren't actually in the BnB itself but in a separate house, only 2-minutes away from it, which was really comfortable. There were three bedrooms (one with en-suite, downstairs) and it was set up with everything that we needed. There were three other people staying there, two fellows in the downstairs room and one other, who was let in at 3 a.m. by one of the fellows downstairs and then left his dirty breakfast bowl in the sink. Rude! It was still there when we left on Sunday morning, as no one wanted to clean up after him...Once we'd got ourselves settled, we headed out for a castle tour. After that, we had a cheese tasting session (delicious!) and a lovely meal at a pub called the Wig and Mitre on Steep Hill (because it is!).Castle Square, looking at the cathedralThe castle is free to enter - it's the buildings & wall walk that you pay extra for.Setting up for the Cliff Richard concert on Saturday night! A Â£22million refurbishment of the castle, finished in 2015, has ensured that this beautiful building can remain standing. The Lincoln limestone is so soft it was crumbling and more or less a ruin. The red building in the centre is the prison - there is a Victorian and an Edwardian section, in the middle of which is a brand new, state of the art vault containing one of only four original 1215 copies of the Magna Carta!Â The Lincoln courthouse - this is the Lincoln City court. You can be held in contempt if you interrupt the proceedings in any way while court is in session, so you have to be very quiety when outside it. The court jurisdiction begins at the paving stones.Crumbling limestone walls.Another knight! There were 37 in total to find.Steep Hill, which leads into the more modern high street much lower down.Steep Hill.The more modern high street.Located in Castle Square, at the top of Steep Hill and opposite the castle.The cheese tasting was delicious, although I baulked at the blue cheese, I admit. Some fabulous cheeses, but so filling that we only had starters for dinner, although they were quite delicious themselves - salmon balls with a chili dressing - and a pudding. I had a lemon mousse-type dessert (can't remember what it was called now) which was nice, but not lemon-y enough in my opinion and a bit heavier than I would have liked.Anyway, the conference the next day was good - the speakers were excellent. Sophie Wells MBE is a Paralympian dressage rider, who has won gold and silver at London and Rio. She's a tiny little thing but very determined and really made me consider my own excuses for not getting thing done. It really is mostly a mental attitude.The next speaker was Mary Powell, who managed the funding and oversaw the refurbishment of the castle. She explained how the money was raised and that it was, so far, outstripping their expectations in respect of how many visitors it would attract. The project has been a huge success and Lincoln is very proud of its beautiful 'new' castle.I actually snuck out after lunch and returned to the castle because I wanted to see the Magna Carta. It was on display with the Charter of the Forest and the Domesday Book (1086) which is on loan to Lincoln until September 3. After that, it will disappear back into the National Archives and won't see the light of day, so to speak, for another 5 years. I wanted to take the opportunity to see it while it and I were in the same place.Â The Domesday Book is more or less a Land Registry and is still referred to! The most recent use was in 1964 and while the pages are still original, it has been rebound to ensure it stays together. Fascinating!I then walked the walls and took a quick tour through the prison, although it didn't really hold my interest that much. Despite dekeing out of the conference, I did want to get back for the last speaker of the day.The entrance to the Magna Carta vault.Crests of the Barons who signed the Magna Carta.Part of the document's translation.The vault. As close as I dared to take a photo.The prison.Creepy! They put mannequins in to show how the prison chapel works, with doors separating the prisoners from each other.From the walls of the castle, looking east.Into the bailey.I climbed that tower on the mott (the grass hill) to get a beautiful view of the city below.Prison yard.Climbing the tower on the mott. They wanted to replace these stairs but figured out quickly that they were the only thing holding the tower up! So they reinforced and added passing areas instead.A lift for the handicapped to allow them to walk at least part of the walls. Those stairs are also the only way up to the walls. The metal is new(ish) but is designed to rust quickly in order to blend in a bit more with the environment.Lincoln Cathedral.Our last speaker was author Sophie Hannah. I'm not sure how many had actually ever heard of her - I certainly hadn't prior to this - but not only is she quite a prolific author in her own right (of mysteries), she is also the author of the new Agatha Christie Hercule Poirot novels, chosen by the Christie family & estate to continue the legacy. Very funny and a very interesting story of how she became their chosen author.For dinner that evening, we had a fantastic Thai meal and then wandered around at the top of town so I could get photos of the Knights - I was determined to find all 37 - before our ghost walk that evening. Accompanied by the concert of Sir Cliff Richard and led by the woman who is the official town crier of Lincoln, we had a very interesting hour and a half, wandering around the streets and hearing stories of ghostly happenings.Sunday we finished off our Knights Trail - hurrah! We found them all - and then had an hour-long boat trip on the river. It was ... well, I could have happily not done it and not missed doing it. Let's just say that. It was relaxing, I'll give it that, but that's about it.We headed home after that (no missed junctions this time) and arrived home in time for dinner. A fully, busy weekend in a truly lovely city. I'm glad I went and I'm glad I took time away from the conference to see the Domesday Book - I certainly don't regret that.Lincoln is on my 'to visit again' list. It's small and pretty (if you stay away from the modern high street) and full of university students. And it's north - technically, the Midlands - which I like as well. The people are a bit more open in the north and it feels more welcoming sometimes than the south. Just an observation from this foreigner...Hope you've all had a lovely weekend - and Happy Canada Day (yesterday) and Happy Independence Day (Tuesday)!"},
{"title": "Learning my options", "date": "Sunday 4 June 2017", "text": "It's not like I've never moved before or had to set a place up from scratch. I know what the basic expenses and expenditures are: set up fees for utilities, bathroom & kitchen items, furniture, etc. I know it's stressful and frustrating at times. Â That's just for an apartment - never mind the legal fees, movers costs, etc. that are involved with an actual house.Â I also know that, despite that stuff, it's an excellent opportunity to declutter and move with a nominally smaller amount of stuff. But I've never in my life had to pay estate agent fees on top of that to find a place. I'm not sure real estate agents even deal with rentals in Canada, do they? Certainly, I've never used one to find an apartment before. I thought they stuck with houses and condos and things, not rentals. I've been lucky and things have always worked out for me and IÂ have no reason to think it won't be the same now, but I'm learning that it just might be a bit more difficult. I've been chatting to a couple of estate agents about the process and am learning that each estate agent has different fees. These range between Â£200-Â£600 ON TOP OF RENTAL DEPOSITS which are 6 weeks' worth of rent + first month.Â There are referencing fees (which are charged PER PERSON); there are Tenancy Agreement preparation costs; there are Pet Addendum fees (if applicable); there are check-out fees at the end of the tenancy; there are Tenancy Extension fees. All are non-refundable. Some may be refundable, but only if the landlord changes his/her mind over you as a tenant, not if you change your mind about being a tenant for that property. I'm afraid to ask whether these fees are charged per flat (at the same agency) or if, once referenced, etc., you are on the books with them and can look to your heart's content. Certainly, you pay more fees if you sign on with more than one agency. So the minimum I need to rent a place is almost Â£2,500 before I've even moved in. And if for whatever reason, I don't get accepted, I lose my fees. I can't afford that. It's criminal. It really is. I've also learned from one of the agents that the referencing tool they use requires someone interested in a place with a monthly rent of Â£850 to earn Â£26k per year. Someone referencing for a monthly rent of Â£700 is required to earn Â£21k. That is Â£5-Â£10k more than I currently make (and there isn't a great chance that I'll ever make either one of those numbers anytime soon). Which leads me to believe my available rental level is somewhere around Â£300-Â£400 per month. I'll be lucky to find a room for that. I do appreciate, however, that they want to ensure they get the rent. I understand - to a point - why there's a minimum. I don't understand the variously priced fees for the agents. Why not a flat fee for all of that? How do people rent places? I work full-time and make a very modest wage. Even without my debt payments, I won't qualify (based on the above numbers) for even a studio flat. I'm likely going to start with moving from my room with my cousin to another room in someone else's house. I was hoping to avoid that, but I can't afford to be particularly fussy sadly. Despite all this, I KNOW the perfect place is out there for me. It may just not be ready yet. I've never failed to find a home - even when I had four cats - so I'm not worried, just kind of disgusted and slightly frustrated. Knowledge is power, however, so it's not a total waste of time learning how the process works. I know what I want, so I just have to be patient. I'm in a very fortunate position, with a job, a comfortable place to live and a cousin who, while itching to get to work on her house and have me out of it, won't leave me homeless and is being kind and generous enough to let me pay a minimal amount so that I can save most of my wage to put towards a place. In other news, I've paid off a bill from the Canada Revenue Agency which was from 2014. I cashed out one of my RSPs but was unaware that it was subject to 25% tax, as I'm a non-resident (although I thought I wasn't deemed a non-resident until after I'd cashed it out. Anyway...). I got the bill last month and finally got around to calling Ottawa about it a week or so ago. The only place I could pull the funds from was my LOC, so I've done that today. I'm both glad and sad about this. I was one payment away from clearing a full $1000 off my LOC and now I've fallen back down again, but I no longer owe the Canadian Government and I think that's a wiser move. Plus, the interest rate is lower on my LOC. I was told some complicated way of paying it off through the CRA website, but it didn't give me an option to pay from a Canadian bank account (assuming, I suppose, that you don't have one). I specifically asked if I could pay it through my bank account and was told 'no'. I was surprised but took her word for it - she should know, right? Well, apparently she doesn't. I wanted to clear it up today and after looking at a couple of options, I went to my bank and checked what bills were available to set up and there it was: CRA NON RES ARR (CRA non-resident arrears). So. Done. Once I've moved, I really need to find a part-time job."},
{"title": "Moving news!", "date": "Tuesday 16 May 2017", "text": "edge.caÂ Well. This is exciting! Our staff meeting revealed that we are moving (which isn't a surprise to me - ha ha) and it will be to the western edge of the Forest, to a town called Ringwood.Â Ringwood is a market town, much nicer and it edges into the Forest on its eastern side. It has all the amenities and conveniences you could want - except direct bus or train transport. You can see it here, and where it sits in relation to Southampton.Â Â This is much nicer for me, as I had more or less decided that Totton (which is not indicated on the map, but is almost exactly halfway between Southampton and Ashurst, at the very eastern edge of the Forest and bumping up againstÂ Southampton Water). I don't much like Totton other than for its convenience, so this actually gives me a much wider net to cast as far as looking for available properties.Â I've found a super one that I'd like to go and view - all inclusive, including being furnished, which is extremely rare. It's slightly more expensive than I'd like to pay, but during my review the words 'pay rise' were bandied about, but that will be hammered out at a further meeting in the summer, once we know for sure what our new premises will be and what they will incorporate.Â This is the little flat - here. It's probably a 20 min drive from Ringwood (you can see Burley on the map, just a little south of Ringwood). But the further I dig, the more I find, so this is looking much better than my options for Totton. I've since found a tidy little one-bed, detached flat - a converted garage from the looks of things - for Â£500 a month! It's further north, towards Fordingbridge, but what a find!Â So I'm feeling much more positive about things.Â My colleague, though, is not as happy as I am as it means a much further commute for her, although there will be parking at the office and we were told that travelÂ couldÂ be compensated - there's no point discussing it at the moment when we aren't sure exactly where we'll be and when we'll be there, although it's looking like the autumn at this point.Â But it'll also mean a lot of hard work, packing up and moving stuff, so I'm sure there's going to be discussion about that as well.Â Lunch is over! Back to work I go :D"},
{"title": "Taking time to rest", "date": "Tuesday 9 May 2017", "text": "threepullpa.comThis is what I'm planning to do this week. I've been sleeping very well since my procedure on Saturday and am thinking I would like to take the rest of this week off to rest and recuperate while I can.Regardless of it not being major surgery, my body has still been through some serious trauma and needs time to heal. I'm enjoying being at home and being quiet and calm. There's been no pain, but I'm aware of the area if that makes sense. A little 'nudge' here and there to remind me of it. And I have a gigantic bruise where the anaesthetic IV went into my hand. Doesn't hurt, but it's pretty impressive!I've not been eating much at all, but have been getting lots of fluids (water and tea), so I'm fasting I suppose. It's not necessarily a conscious thing, but it feels like the right thing to do.I admit I don't really want to go back to work just yet, either. I'm enjoying this quiet and calm and want to go back when I feel both mentally and physically ready, rather than just when I feel I 'should'. Feeling guilty means I care about what I do, but I know that if something were to happen, it could potentially mean even MORE time away and why open that kettle of fish?My supervisor isn't in today but I will call her tomorrow to discuss. I'll enjoy my peace and quiet today and worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. :)"},
{"title": "Update: week ending 6 May", "date": "Sunday 7 May 2017", "text": "shunvmall.comIt's going to be a quiet few days for me. I'm off work tomorrow and Tuesday, just taking some time to recover from a routine out-patient procedure I had done yesterday. It was under general anaesthetic so I'm feeling a bit delicate today as the anaesthesia works its way out of my system (approx 24 hours).All went well. I arrived at 12:15 and was called in almost immediately. Paperwork in quadruplicate as each staff member had to come in and chat, check and sign paperwork and I was asked the same questions about 4 times. No getting around it, but it is time-consuming! At any rate, I didn't wait long to be prepped and taken to the OR.I was having a lovely dream and then woke up to a nurse called Rachel greeting me at about 3:30. A few minutes in the recovery room, where the doctor came in and said some stuff to me (which he admitted I likely wouldn't remember) and off I went to the ward for a few hours. They loaded me up with water as I needed to pee 200ml before they would let me go. That seemed to take ages and ages, but finally, they got enough to release me and let me go with loads of pills - all of which I'm supposed to take 3-4 times a day, but I'm a bit confused with them, so will read the directions and see what I'm supposed to do with them. They're all for pain management, but so far have only taken an Ibuprofen last night. I imagine I'll need them a bit more as the anaesthetic wears off during the day.The staff were great and the nurses really lovely. I will need a follow-up at some point, I think, and also need to make an appointment with my regular doctor anyway, so can drop the discharge information there when I do that.Â So I'm not venturing far, today at least, and fortunately have plenty of unread books at hand, as well as a few emails and letters to write. I feel I need to take advantage of a couple of days off and get caught up there.I've started looking at flats and there are several that I really like but as I said previously, there doesn't seem much pointÂ looking for something I can't yet afford to do. If I'm feeling up to it on Tuesday, I may take myself into town and register at a couple of places to get started.I had a brief chat with my boss on Thursday, however, and he said not to make any sudden move plans for the moment. The reason being that the MDs are thinking of moving the office closer to home (on the western edge of the Forest) so my plans on where to move might change. This wouldn't happen right away, obviously, but it does open up options for me, although Totton is where my ladies group is and I don't want to be TOO far from that. At any rate, we're having an office meeting in a couple of weeks so that the MDs can have a chat to us about it. I've been sworn to secrecy at this point, so will have to act surprised.I did get a 6-month train pass, too, which makes more sense than an annual one at this point, seeing as neither I nor the office knows where we'll be come the new year. So that's handy, although a bit more expensive than an annual pass. Oh well, not complaining! I'm very lucky to be able to say 'I need a new train pass' and get one. Ha ha!Otherwise, it's been a quiet week! I've set aside some cash for moving (Â£32 - woot!) and have about Â£25 more at the moment from various bits & pieces. Can take that to the bank this week and feel better about doing something. I've found a job ad for a tea shop in Lyndhurst that might be right up my alley, so am going to apply for that (weekend shop front staff). No guarantees, but it doesn't hurt to try. I don't have any experience in food service, but this is quite a nice shop and serves 99% tea, so might just be perfect.Anyway, this was just a quick update. Hope you're all having a good weekend!"},
{"title": "Planning a move!", "date": "Sunday 30 April 2017", "text": "theleantimes.comI'm moving!Â Not right away but it is an absolute now, probably in the new year. My cousin sat down with me yesterday and weÂ had a further chat about things, as she'd been thinking about this again. Mostly she wants to get on with 'house stuff' sooner rather than later and, to be fair, I've taken advantage - and not in the best way - of being here and having so few responsibilities.The biggest obstacle for me is deposits & affordable rents once I'm on my own. I've called in the debt that my sister owes me (Â£200) which will go straight towards that, and have to shave, shave, shave my already relatively slim budget, and put all those funds towards a deposit. My cousin has said I can have two months rent free at the end of the year, which will give me Â£900 and is a huge relief. I've been thinking about a Saturday job but they seem hard to come by, although I will keep my eyes peeled and have just this morning had another thought about the current rent with my cousin which I'll discuss with her at some point.She's also willing to sell me her old sofa and all the bedroom furniture for about Â£100 so that I'm not starting with nothing. I'm happy to accept! As well, it means I'll be scoping out the thrift shops looking for fun, colourful and funky bits and pieces to put in my new place. I've found one in Lyndhurst which has a gazillion cutlery items, so can mix and match to my heart's content. It's a start.Things I need to consider and budget for:1. Rent - what's the maximum I can comfortably pay each month?2. Council tax - like property taxes, this pays for rubbish removal, street lighting, road maintenance, etc. There's no getting around it, but each property pays a different amount so I have to account monthly for this.3. Water.4. Heat/electricity/gas.5. Broadband/internet, TV license fee.6. Food, car & transportation.7. Managing agent's fees (if using one), deposit and first 4-6 weeks rent.8. FUN! I need to entertain myself and have enough fun money to go out for tea and cake or lunch or take a weekend away somewhere once in awhile. I can't be 'house poor'.I've decided that I need to find a place in Totton which, honestly, is a bit of a dump, but has both direct bus and train connections to Southampton, three big grocery stores, a library, my doctor and dentist, and my social group. It's still close to the Forest and my cousin, too, so while it's not pretty by anyone's standards, it's convenient and the prices aren't more or less than anywhere else. It's only 5 mins on the train to Southampton, too, and there are more trains in the evening as it's basically a bedroom community for Southampton. There's also a direct bike route into town.There are just fewer places to rent, that's all. But no matter! I'm confident I'll find the perfect place.So what would I like in my own place? A flat or maisonette; one-bedroom; off-street parking ideally and a place for my bike; walking distance to train/bus; bright and not too modern. I love a bit of characterÂ but appreciate that all the 'newly refurbished' places are clean and modern and what most people want and expect.So the hunt is on! There are several places online at the moment that I'd consider looking at but there isn'tÂ much point until I have some money put aside in case I find 'The One'. I'm going to put the word out to my friends, colleagues, etc., as that can work too. They know far more people than I do and who knows what'll turn up?"},
{"title": "York 2.0 - Walls continued and into the Minster", "date": "Saturday 15 April 2017", "text": "Along the south-west portion of the walls now. The homes inside the walls are quite lovely, although not as cheap as I'd have thought. I suppose that goes with living in such a unique place. Prices were surprisingly high.So pretty!The Perky Peacock cafe. We had decided on a visit to it later in the trip, but never actually made it, unfortunately. Next trip! :DThe River Ouse. It has a lovely river walk alongside. Again, something I would've liked to have done, but you do have to pick and choose what you want to do. I think we did plenty!Lendal Tower at Lendal Bridge. This is apparently a holiday let property! How much fun would that be?Up Museum Street towards the beautiful Minster.This was a half-hourly tourist train direct to the Minster. From where I'm not sure.Daffodils brightening the city up.A beautiful building that took 200 years to build!Heading back to the hotel, two blocks from the gate at the end of the street.The Georgian House Mews. A three-star guest house that isn't trying particularly hard for the fourth star. It was absolutely fine for our purposes (location and cost), but we had a few little issues. Despite dirty glasses, no toilet paper, it not being the cleanest of rooms and a rather lengthy wait at our first breakfast (the staff weren't paying attention - a German guest approached them first, then me), I would stay again as it was comfortable enough and the price was definitely right!Around the Minster.Some of the hundreds of grotesques decorating the building. There is ongoing work to repair and refurbish the brickwork - you can see some new bricks here, the fresh yellow ones.Stunning.The Minster organ.Everything is so beautifully and elaborately crafted.The ceiling in the Chapter House.Some of the hundreds of little grotesques all around the Chapter House walls.The beautiful floor.I climbed to the top - this is only halfway!Finally made it all the way up! Phew - it was quite a trek. Well worth it, however! Look at the views.A few of the 275 steps.The kings from the beginning of the building of the Minister through its completion! Two walls' worth!Â The windows are truly amazing. Some were being cleaned and refurbished, but the colours really are glorious.The Kings Book of Heroes - listing all those who fought and died in WWI. A beautiful tribute.I'm finally feeling better after being sick for nearly two weeks! So frustrating, added to by email problems at work last week. I was pretty grumpy for awhile, so good for everyone that I'm feeling better. Ha ha!My cousin is visiting her mum this weekend so I have the house to myself. I didn't do much of anything yesterday: booked a tune-up for my bike and went out to get a few staples, but otherwise puttered around and didn't get much of anything done.Â I haven't been on my bike in M-O-N-T-H-S and am feeling quite guilty about it. I'm intending to ride it to work over the summer as my train pass is expiring in May and it would save me some money, but I'll see how it works out. It would take me almost an hour to get there, but I'd feel really good about it! I'd still like another train pass, though, so will discuss with the MDs for another one. They were very open to it last year.Today I was feeling well and energetic enough to take myself for a walk this morning. I did just over 3 miles and felt great doing it. I've not felt like it since I got sick, so I'm glad to be feeling better enough to start again. I've missed it! I got the best of the day today as it was sunny and bright and by the time I got home an hour later the sun had gone in and it was considerably cooler. I'm planning on a similar walk tomorrow and Monday.I've got some baking on my to do list as well which I'm going to tackle tomorrow: a loaf, some breakfast muffins and a lime coconut cake. YUM!(More photos tomorrow or Monday!)"},
{"title": "This week's goings on ... more things (and more photos!)", "date": "Sunday 9 April 2017", "text": "It was my birthday last weekend - I finally arrived at the big '5-0' and I have to say it honestly feels a bit of an odd number to get my head around. 50. I'm the same age my dad was when he died and that in itself is slightly surreal. I'm the third cousin to make the magical mark in the past 6 months, and there's one more to go this year, in December. So here we are. What did I think I'd be doing at 50? I honestly have no idea. I suppose I just assumed I'd have a house, maybe be married (but no kids, I knew that much at least), still be living in Toronto, have some kind of job, maybe a pet... ...aaaand that's about as far as I got. Things really do change! Instead, I've got a room in a (semi-)foreign country, no solid direction, a decent job doing something I can do well but don't love, and continue, really, to drift a bit aimlessly. The hyper-focus that got me here 3.5 years ago disappeared once I'd arrived and I'm left more or less in the same position I was before I left - a bit frustrated, feeling like I'm just spinning my wheels and not moving forward in anything except age. I'm not complaining - I'm feeling more reflective now I've hit the half-century mark. I think it's impossible not to look back at where you've come from, where you are and the choices you made on the way; why you made them and where you've ended up because of them. The difference is that now I've got the wisdom (supposedly!) to be more conscious and aware of how I got here and what I need to do to make sure I don't just keep making the same choices that don't really move me forward. Anyway, I have a few fun things planned this year, the first being a trip to York for a long weekend with my cousin! She took our cousin Sarah, who turned 50 in September, to Bath for a birthday present, and York was my choice. Neither of us had been before and I've heard nothing but good things about it. It's a very old city, being established initially by the Romans somewhere around 71AD (Eboracum), then being added to by the Vikings in the 9thC(Jorvik), Normans, and into the early medieval period. It's an absolutely fascinating city - original walls still encircle the old city, with the new parts springing up around it. It's kept parts of its original medieval centre as well, the shopping area known as 'The Shambles'. Tiny cobblestone streets with overhanging buildings, low doorways - it's a pretty amazing place. It's also the setting for 'Diagon Alley' in the Harry Potter films for all you HP aficionados.Â  We drove part way on Thursday night and stayed with my auntie in Hertfordshire and took the train from there the next day. It took a couple of hours and we arrived at noon - the first thing we did after checking in was find a place to eat. We found a nice cafe only a block from the guest house and they were kind enough to make me a breakfast sandwich at that time of day: sausage, bacon and egg! Delicious and that much protein helped me make it to 'cake' o'clock (which, in all honesty, is anytime after breakfast).Our coffee shop wall.Our coffee shop.The gate where we climbed to the walls (stairs on rh side).Walking along the walls, above the city.Daffodils everywhere! It was a gorgeous spring weekend.The Minster.Monkgate. There was a Richard III exhibition here (which we didn't visit) in which you try to decide for yourself whether or not he was complicit in sending the Princes Edward and Richard to the Tower in London and ultimately to their deaths.See the black cat? It's a statue and they're all over York's buildings. I think there are about 23 of them scattered around various parts of the old town. There's a cat trail to follow and a handy map to guide you.Walmgate. This has been converted into a very cosy (read: small) cafe. There are a few seats inside, but the majority are out on the battlements.Â I believe this is Bitchdaughter Tower. Someone wasn't very happy when it was named!Clifford's Tower where, in 1190, 300 Jews and Jewesses committed suicide rather than die at the hands of soldiers.The River Ouse.The white rose of York.That will have to do for today, photo-wise at least. I seem to be technoligically challenged today and nothing else will upload for me and I can't figure out why not. I have a cold and a very annoying cough so I'll have to wait until tomorrow or something to try again.Enjoy your weekend!"},
{"title": "Things that happened this week - very photo heavy!", "date": "Saturday 25 March 2017", "text": "Last weekend I headed up to the Capital to see my sister and a mutual friend and her daughter, who were visiting for a few days from Canada (spring break). Our friends were visiting London and Paris; her husband and older daughter were on tour in Asia - Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia.Â My sister's last housesit was for a someone in Devon who happens to own a number of properties, a few of which are in London. She was offered use of a two-bed flat for a week - perfectly timed with our friend's visit! The flat was 15 minutes walk south of Elephant and Castle tube station, on the south bank of the Thames, in an area called Walworth. It's very multi-cultural - African, Caribbean, Turkish, etc., with bakeries, restaurants, pop-up markets, etc. all over the place. Really fantastic. Direct bus service to Waterloo station and into London as well, so nicely placed, yet much cheaper than many parts of the city.I started out early on Saturday morning and arrived at about 10:00 (after spending half an hour standing outside the wrong flats!). Our friends arrived about 2:00 and we went out exploring a bitÂ but saved the first full day for Sunday. We took a bus to Waterloo station at about 10:00 and then didn't stop walking until 3:00! After which we kept going...London is a huge city, but perfectly designed for walking because there is simply so much to see.We started at the iconic London Eye, a few minutes walk from Waterloo station.The Hungerford (train) & Golden Jubilee Bridges (pedestrian) with a view of a hotel called the Horseguards across the Thames.The Eye and that other iconic landmark, Westminster and Big Ben.Plane Trees.Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament. Scene of chaos only three days later. It's always heaving with people, so the fact that so many more weren't hurt or killed isÂ a miracle.This is the area where, on Wednesday, a very sick man drove purposely into the crowds, killing three people and severely wounding so many more. But this day was just 'normal' busy. You get a bit of an idea what it's usually like - traffic standing still on the bridge, pedestrians everywhere.St James Park dressed for spring.Cherry blossoms galore!Duck Island cottage - built for the bird keeper (there's a long history of it on Wikipedia) now owned and managed by the London Historic Parks and Gardens Trust.The Mall is closed to traffic on Sundays and this day there was some filming going on - perhaps a new episode or two of Prime Suspect 1973?Certainly plenty of filmÂ accommodations and necessities. Intriguing!The Mall, surprisingly quiet...until you get to the Palace and understand why.Here's everyone! What exactly is going on?The hordes.The changing of the guards!! That explains it. It was shortly after 11:00 and this is a daily routine. I'm pretty sure it didn't start out being a tourist attraction, but it's definitely become one. It was actually on my 'to see' list, so I can check that off now.The handsome Horse Guards.The iconic Grenadier Guards.It's a bit odd having such a quiet street in London, but quite nice, as you can wander at will.The Wellington Arch - and police on horseback!The Royal Crest on the gates at Wellington Arch.Brompton Road and ... is that HARROD'S? Yes! We made it.In we go (we were looking for the food)!Baby cakes - Â£10 each.Rainbow unicorn cake - rainbow inside too!!Â There are about 7,000,000 rooms in Harrod's, I'm sure, but we limited ourselves to a quick nose around the food court (dare I call it a court? Haven?) in the basement - it was amazing. Take yourself downstairs if you ever happen to be in the area - or simply make a point of visiting on purpose - as it's overwhelmingly fantastic.Chocolate and red velvet cakes - Â£70 each. I, of course, got a piece of red velvet cake to take home with me and bought my cousin a piece of carrot cake. I have to say that it genuinely was the best red velvet cake I've ever had. At Â£6 a slice, it had better have been! Yes, a ridiculous price for a piece of cake, but seriously - it's Harrod's.Â Divine selection of delectable cupcakes!A statue we came across by Hyde Park.Marble Arch. Where we FINALLY stopped to eat something (thanks, Pret a Manger!) and sit down for a half hour. Once refreshed, we carried on.Mayfair.Dressed up for Beauty & the Beast.Piccadilly was also shut. We couldn't quite figure out why, but I think it had something to do with a belated St Patrick's Day parade - there was an Irish festival of some kind happening in Trafalgar Square and there were SO. MANY. PEOPLE.This was one of the Arcades leading off Piccadilly. I remember it as the Broughton Arcade, but I'm not sure that's right. Tiny, exclusive shops.We finished up at M&M World in Leicester Square. It was packed. Of course, I bought some M&Ms - Â£8 worth! Oops.I returned home to the Forest after that - quite relieved to get back to the peace and quiet of it in all honesty. London is fun on occasion because there's so much to see and do, but it's exhausting - just so many people and so much happening all the time. Still, it was great to see our friend and meet her daughter - they had Harry Potter World on their agenda, a family visit and food, and then were off to Paris for a week yesterday, so hopefully they enjoy that just as much.Wednesday was the attack on Parliament and four deaths and so much hurt. A sad, sobering day. Bits & pieces of information are coming together about the attacker (British-born), but Londoners are pretty solid folk - like I've been reading, there were so many bombs and IRA attacks in the 70's and 80's they're not inexperienced in this. They're prepared and they practice. A lot. The Emergency Services were absolutely brilliant. It's definitely left a bit of a pall, however, and there's a large, growing memorial for those who died, but London is tough. She'll recover and is already carrying on. What else can you do?Today is a glorious spring day - supposed to be about 15C! I've already been out to the bank, picked up a few bits and stopped at the library (6 books came home with me). My cousin has gone to Romsey to look around and get her nails done later today, but I decided not to join her. I can't really be bothered, although I enjoy Romsey for the most part. It's just nice to have some time to get caught up on things and have some time on my own. I was going to get up early and go for a walk but didn't. Instead, I'll do that tomorrow and see how far I can go. I've been walking in the mornings - taking a later train allows me to get up, go for a walk, have breakfast and still get to work for 9:00. I'm less stressed, am getting more sleep, and enjoying my walking. I did 3 days walking this week (11km on Sunday in London, 3km each during the week) and I'd like to do 4 this week. I'm happy to miss a day as long as I go the next. I'm aiming for consistency and 30-40 mins a day.It's my birthday next weekend and my cousin and I are headed to York for a couple of days, which I'm really excited about! I haven't yet been but have heard great things, so I've already got several things in mind of what I want to do: York Minister for sure, the walls, The Shambles (I've been told to go early in the morning to avoid crowds here - so I think I'll get myself up on Sunday a.m. before we head back and poke around a bit), possibly a ghost walk. We only have two nights and really one full day, so I have to be really picky about what to see.Have a great weekend everyone!"},
{"title": "Looking ahead, waaaaaay ahead!", "date": "Monday 13 March 2017", "text": "So way back in the day, a couple of years ago now at least, I signed up forÂ several photography workshops which I thoroughly enjoyed. One was a 'taster session' of several hours, where we pottered around the Forest and more or less played around with our cameras, figuring stuff out and enjoying a beautiful spring day and New Forest ponies who joined us as willing subjects.I then had another three-hour session with the same photographer and a smaller group in a different part of the Forest, a morning of trompingÂ across heath andÂ hills to capture theÂ autumn heather colours. I was distracted then by both ponies and the macro setting on my camera, trying to get close ups of heather and spider webs and all sorts.I've missed it, actually. I do love it when I'm out there, but it's just getting out there. I have no idea what stops me from doing it, I just don't. I'm on the emailing list of the photographer and over the past couple of years he's sent out monthly updates of whereÂ  he's been, his favourite photographs, etc. Lovely stuff! Last year he starting arranging two-day workshops in Cornwall. They were a bit pricey, so I didn'tÂ pursue them, and then when he added an extra day, they got a bit pricier, so I still didn't.Until now.I got an email yesterday about a workshop offering in March 2018 -Â an entire year away! The cost is Â£399 (includes B&B and instruction over three days, so actuallyÂ good price considering there will only be threeÂ people joining him). IÂ hesitated aÂ little bit, but then sent an email toÂ him know that I would be very keen to attend. We're going to West Cornwall - link is hereÂ -Â where my dad grew upÂ and near to where my grandparents spent many decades. I think I couldÂ make a longer trip out of it and poke around some of the places I remember as a kid. I know my grandparents' house is no longer there (thanks, Google), but the area is still wild and pretty and the landscape much unchanged. They were very close to a portion of (what is now) the Southwest Coast Path, which we used to travel to the beach - Praa (pray)Â Sands - near their house.My grandpa was the reverend at Breague Parish for over 30 years and both he and my grandma are buried in the churchyard there, although not together, sadly.Anyway, the more I think about it, the more I'm looking forward to it and the more I think I will make an actual holiday out of it - if I'm going to get in the wee beast and drive for four or five hours, then I want to spend a goodly amount of time in the area. Cornwall is just so very, very pretty."},
{"title": "Checking in, more or less mid-way through March - already!", "date": "Sunday 12 March 2017", "text": "What have I done so far? Lent's been a bit of a write-off, I have to say. All my best intentions to have a good clear out have resulted in exactly two drawers of toiletries being taken out of my dresser and put into a bathroom cupboard, where they really belong. It's something, I suppose. :)I've cleared out a few books, although still have too many if I'm honest. I'll work on that. Perhaps I should read the ones I have first before recycling them?Â I'm going to be in London next weekend for a couple of nights. My sister, who's gone back to housesitting, has been given the use of a two-bedroom flat on the south bank, about a half hour walk from Waterloo station. She'll be staying about five days.We have a friend and one of her daughters coming from Canada for a visit for a few days, so we're all going to be bunking at this flat. It's close to everythingÂ and gives us a nice, central base. London is most definitely a walking city, and there's plenty to see in the immediate vicinity, as well as slightly further afield. I have some free train passes to use up before May as well, so am quite looking forward to it.I've been doing yoga regularly once a week, which is great. I'm enjoying it and I think it's actually doing me a lot of good - I feel less achy and I'm certainly more flexible than I thought I would be. I had a two-hour class last Saturday which was brilliant, but it was the same day as my writing group so I had to miss ANOTHER one of those! I honestly didn't do it on purpose, although once having spoken with a couple of the ladies, I do remember having to reschedule because someone wasn't able to make it. Nuts.Had a decent appointment with my doctor although she did look a bit startled when I mentioned I had a whole list to go through! Ha ha! I started with my most concerning issue at the moment which is the fact that I'm having trouble with my breathing, the same as last year. It's not quite as bad as last year - yet - but I've had to change my route to work from the train station to avoid the worst of the hills because it simply takes me too long to recover if I walk up one. ANY exertion leaves me gasping.She sent me for a blood test and it turns out that I'm quite anaemic - again! I don't know what the numbers mean, but I think it's related to haemoglobin in the blood and mine is down at 84. I think it needs to be somewhere up near 130. Anyway, the results were back the next day (!!) and I have a prescription for ferrous fumarate, 210mg 3 x a day for a month. We'll go from there. It's almost as much as last year (I started with 400 mg a day), but at least I know it's actually a thing, and I'm not just thinking it's me.I've made a double appointment for the 29th, to see if I can get another couple of items checked off my list. The bloating (which I've had for two full years now) and possibly my thyroid will be my next issues to tackle.I'm hoping that with the iron supplements, my compulsion for raw coconut chips disappears as well. I've eaten my way through 4kg since late January - I no longer fit into my work trousers so am having to wear yoga pants! Coconut is good, I love it, but that's excessive any way you look at it.Off to see the movie 'Girl on a Train' tomorrow night, which I'm looking forward to. I've got the book but haven't yet read it and have only a vague idea of what to expect.And only two weeks until my birthday! 50...gosh. I'm a bit overwhelmed but have some good things planned this year, so am looking forward to it. Off to York for a weekend with my cousin at the end of the month for my birthday and very much looking forward to that.Nottingham (to be confirmed) at the beginning of May, a Wales self-catering weekend with my sister and all my cousins at the end of May, Lincoln in June, and Scotland and the Lake District in September. I've provisionally booked a place in Westport, Ireland, at Christmas although unsure if that'll happen, as I don't know what my cousin is going to be doing. Regardless, if she's not going to be around, I'll book a couple of days at a little hideaway closer to home, that's all.That's about it, really. Wanting to manifest Â£250 to register for my online anatomy course, so if anyone knows a really good manifesting statement to help with that, I'd appreciate it! :D"},

The problem is deciding what to give up - so much to choose from!I'm considering sugar, procrastination, complaining, wheat, tea, etc.I've pretty much decided on clutter generally (mentally, physically & emotionally). Lose the external clutter and internal clutter will follow, so I think that gives me a nice three-pronged approach. Sugar will be the external devil to banish, along with bits & pieces that I've been hanging onto in my room - clothes I no longer like nor wear, books I've not yet read, stuff I've not recycled or thrown away, etc. Emotionally I'd like to fight lack of motivation, fear, this 'lack' mindset that I'm stuck in that keeps me in a semi-permanent state of debt, low-paying jobs, etc.Add in walking and yoga as and when I can and I think it's a good start. A day late (as it'll be tomorrow now), but at leastÂ I have a place to start.Anyone else?"},
{"title": "Still struggling along...", "date": "Monday 20 February 2017", "text": "I've written upÂ a list of health complaints to take with me to my doctor's appointment a week Friday. I'm allowed one thing to present with, so I've written ONE list. I'm happy to attribute a portion of this list's complaints to menopause, but not all of it.Â I don't particularly want to make 16 different appointments to take care of the list, but if I have to I will. Surely one or two things can be checked off with, say, a blood test? The NHS is a frustrating place to navigate. A very broken system with employees who are doing the best they can with it. I'm sympathetic, but still frustrated.Â I am pondering what I need to remove from my diet to moderate how I'm feeling: dairy, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, carbs, etc. I'll be sitting down this week and making up lists of food I need to focus on.Â I also discovered this morning that all that coconut I've been inhaling the past several weeks (about 3kgs of it now) is both terribly fattening and sweet - even though it's raw, unsweetened coconut. This is why my work pants, which fit me Friday, don't fit me this morning! I did walk to work - housesitting this week in town - which took me 45 minutes, so that's something. I plan to do it all week, weather dependent. It's direct and quite pleasant so I'll take advantage of the mild weather and do a morning walk. It's half-term so the roads are much quieter, too, which is nice.Â As one of my complaints is shortness of breath (attributed last year to anemia), I won't be walking back in the evenings as it's all up hill (although a very long, gentle hill) and I would struggle. One thing at a time. I felt great this morning for doing it, so that's a start.Â I've sat at this place before (they have three cats) and wondered about their little garden annex, which they now use as an AirBnB flat. I was asked to put some milk in the fridge for the new guest who arrives on Tuesday, so took the opportunity to snoop. It's very tiny - just two rooms and a bathroom -Â but quite bright and has everythingÂ necessary (including a small outside garden space off the bedroom) for a comfortable stay. They used to rent it out and I may ask later in the year if they're considering doing that again, as I would be very interested. I believe the last time they rented it, it was Â£680 'all in', which is highly unusual. As I'm not in a position at the moment to really do anything about it, I'll leave it, as I say, until a bit later in the year. It costs nothing to ask, after all.Â It would be really nice to have my own place again, evenÂ a tiny flat. I don't dislike living with my cousin, but I've said from the beginning that ultimately I want my own space again. It seems to be taking me an awfully long time, though! Ah well.ï»¿"},
{"title": "Mid-February already!", "date": "Sunday 12 February 2017", "text": "The chocolate tart and chocolate chip mint ice cream I enjoyed at the Leenane Hotel. Worth a return visit in itself!Finally feeling a bit more 'with it' and arrived home a couple of hours ago after an overnight dog sitting job for my colleague. Jac is a lovely fella, easy to care for and he essentially spent the day sleeping yesterday. I watched trashy Saturday daytime TV and we went out for a walk about 4:30 for about half an hour.We had a much longer walk this morning, which was nice, and now I'm back in the Forest. My cousin is visiting her mum this weekend so I have the place to myself until tomorrow. Not doing much of anything - trashy Sunday daytime Netflix mostly, and cuddling with the cat, who was all alone for 24 hours. He survived unscathed and is happy to have one of his laps back.I have another housesit starting Friday night for a week - 3 cats in a six-bedroom house. I don't mind as it's only a week, on a direct bus route to work and they pay me. The cats are more or less friendly and it's quite straightforward. I will put the cash towards a bus pass, some groceries andÂ if any left over, travel funds. I'm attempting to save my Â£5 notes this year, as well as my Â£1 & Â£2 coins, although I don't actually use cash that often. Regardless, it's a bit of a challenge and will be interesting to see how well I can do. I'll keep the notes, but re-deposit the coins.Scotland accommodation is all sorted - caught a mistake in one of the bookings but because it's so far ahead, there was no trouble sorting it out, fortunately. Phew! We booked our final B&B about a mile outside Fort William in a pretty spot overlooking the loch. It's slightly cheaper than the original booking, too, which is nice. Our first class train tickets are booked for the Jacobite and our cream tea and cheese plate ordered! It's going to be fantastic.I've had to cancel one of my planned getaways this year already which I'm a bit annoyed about: I had wanted to go to the Bristol Balloon Festival and reserved a B&B near the grounds. I had asked a cousin who lives in Bristol if she wanted to join me but didn't hear anything (which is fineÂ because I am capable of doing things on my own - haha!). A week or so later, however, I found out that she, along with her kids, is going to the Isle of Wight that week with the cousin I live with (and one of her nephews), so it means I have to cat sit. It would have been nice if she had just TOLD me this. I don't mind cat sitting at all, and it now means I have two extra days' holidays, but I'm just a bit ticked off with the lack of communication, that's all (says I, the Queen of Non-Communication).I'm starting my third week off FB. I was despairing and sad about the political stuff that kept appearing, so have taken myself off for awhile. I'm not sure how long at the moment, but I'm not missing it and my mental health is more important to me. I'd rather a break than a breakdown. Anyhoo, there hasn't been too much of note happening (apart from a sudden addiction to coconut flakes - I've gone through over a kilo of them in about 3 weeks!), but I'm really just happier to be feeling more with it (mentally) and slightly more energetic. The temperatures are going up a little (although we had light snow flurries yesterday morning) and the days are lengthening, so I'm sure that has something to do with it. A little extra light is always welcome."},
{"title": "Rain", "date": "Tuesday 31 January 2017", "text": "Alllllllllll week...and into next, I believe.ï»¿Â It's a bit warmer at least, although so much rain is going to be not only depressing but is going to create all kinds of road and flooding issues.Â \"Into every life a little rain must fall\". Sure, but there must be limits?Â Anyway.Â I've temporarily deactivated my FB account because I am in despair at what is happening in the US at the moment. I need to take a break and because I get most of my news (\"news\"?) through FB, it was the most direct way to cut off the majority of that. Here, there were thousands who protested the PM's Royal invitation to the President. There are over 1.5 million who have signed a petition asking her to revoke the invitation. I'd like to see her set a precedent, honestly,Â and damn the 'special relationship'. This has put the Palace in a rather unusual position and I'm waiting to see what they decide. Protocol, professionalism and position come into play here, but I for one would really like to see the Palace overturn the invitation.Â The Daily Mail (at theÂ bottom of the \"quality journalism and readership\" ladder)Â screamed aÂ headline this morningÂ that '99% of Daily Mail readers agree with Trump's migrant stance.' This isÂ misleading because Trump's stance is against IMMIGRANTS, not migrants. As for the 99% of Daily Mail readership, well...Â The almost-daily executive orders (which were apparently wholly illegal and unconstitutional during Obama's tenure?) are making my head hurt. Â So I've stepped away from it. I don't know for how long. I'm choosing to stick my head in the sand (his firing of the US Attorney General this morning actually made me gasp in horror).Â And then some kid shoots 6 Muslim men in Quebec. At least the PM is calling it what it is, a terrorist attack. That's cold comfort, but I give him a lot of credit for saying it."},
{"title": "End of January - phew!", "date": "Sunday 29 January 2017", "text": "How I'mÂ feeling in January...Not that I want to make it seem like I'm rushing or anything, but I'm really looking forward to January being over. Mentally, it's been a bastard, bringing me down for several weeks at the beginning of the month. It's only been the last week or so that I've finally started to feel better and brighter. To that end, I've essentially written it off as any kind of productive month and am just using it to organise, plan and think about what I want to do for the rest of the year. It's still doing something (more or less) just not as energetically.I had almost 10 days off over Christmas and was planning on having a few days alone to recharge and plan after a short visit with my sister. That plan was scrapped after she had to leave the place she was staying - no physical danger, fortunately, it just had become very unwelcome and uncomfortable for her. So she ended up here, initially for a couple of weeks, but only left yesterday. My cousin is annoyed because she was promised a weekly monetary contribution which hasn't happened - she's given my sister an extra week to pay it. My sister asked if I could loan her the money (Â£300) but I don't have it. So it's up to her to figure out how to make it happen.It was a long time to spend with my sister and I'm feeling more relaxed now that she's gone (she can be quite spiritually intense). She's applied for a job in Devon and in the meantime has moved to a housesit near Salisbury for a couple of weeks.I had a nice enough break, we did lots of walking and relaxing, probably got through a book or two, and all too soon work rolled around again. It's still fairly quiet and IÂ hope it picks up again soon. It's nobody's fault, but it is a bit frustrating and despite best efforts, I am becoming bored again, which is not good.However (!!), because I am now a mature and productive adult (haha), I've decided to forego rash and impulsive decisions about leaving jobs I'm not happy with and finding something else because I'm tired of doing that. No, it's not the most challenging job I've ever done and my boredom plays host to all sorts of alternate options, but I am lucky to have a) a permanent job, b) a steady paycheque, c) colleagues that I like, d) good bosses and, e) the opportunity of a slightly flexible schedule (in that I can take a day off here and there and make it up, rather than being held to taking it as vacation or sick or whatever). I can set my budget (within Â£20 or so) each month to pay my bills, pay down some debt, etc. And in this economic environment, that alone can be enough.I don't REALLY want to get a second job, despite the fact that I'm struggling with my wage, but if I can get my debt down to a much more manageable level (have no one to blame but me for that), then I would have more to do more FUN things, rather than feeling this lack of... all the time. Having said that, I haven't ruled it out, I just would prefer not to (and it would depend on the job). But needs must, I know...a goal of mine this year is, however, to ask for a raise.In December, I bought a fun goals planner here. I've not quite completed it, but am doing my best with it. I'd like to have it fully done by the end of January. One of the items in it is a list of '100 Things' that I want to do this year. They can be literally anything, simple to complex (a weekly bubble bath, climbing Mt Everest, sitting with a cup of tea or glass of wine for half an hour each night, starting a business, reading more/less, watching the Northern Lights - you get the idea). I have just over 80 at the moment, several of which I can already confidently cross off the list! The ones I've crossed off are:Go to York (going with my cousin for my birthday in April).Go to Edinburgh (going with Jane in September!).Contact a genealogist about their work.Visit friends in Nottingham (May - yet to confirm, but at least we've discussed it!)Self-catering weekend with my sister and my cousins - just us girls! (booked for end of May)Not a lot, but I still think that, despite having the energy of a slug, it's a good start! :) One of the other items on my list is to read more non-fiction, so I started this year off with a book about feng shui, which I've just finished today. It was really fun, so I made copious notes and I've got all kinds of plans for my room. :D It's a little project I can do over the next several months, including collecting little bits & pieces to enhance it.I'm trying to decide what my next non-fiction book will be.As I said at the beginning, January is a write-off, so a lot of the other stuff is going to start in February, now that my energy is coming back. And if I don't get them all done (is Goal #100 \"meeting Gary Lineker\" really going to happen?), I'll just move them to next year. The book is all about taking responsibility for change and fun and your circumstances. There's a Facebook group that's supportive and fun and interesting and there to help you reach your goals - you can use it as much or as little as you like. I'm spending a bit too much time online at the moment, so one thing I plan to do is remove the FB app button from my iPad to make it less accessible. It's become overwhelming, politically speaking, so I need to step away from it.I'm planning a trip to Scotland with Jane in the autumn before she goes on her hike. I'm going to drive up and meet her and we're going to spend a week or so exploring the country from Edinburgh to Glasgow to Fort William (with hopefully a visit to Loch Ness, a Jacobite train trip, and a few little side trips if we can fit them in). My return from Glasgow will hopefully include an overnight in the Lake District, as I go right past it and it seems a shame to miss out if I don't have to. It's supposed to be beautiful.Last Monday I was in a car accident en route to the train station with my sister. There was heavy fog and the roads were quite icy. I thought I was going slowly enough but as I hit a corner (a tricky one even in good weather), I was obviously STILL going too fast. There was already a car on its side in the ditch and a police officer on the scene and as I tried to avoid a van that was coming the other way, the brakes locked and I hit him on the rear driver side. My poor wee car had a smashed headlight (which needed replacing anyway) and now has a permanent dent. The other fellow drove off without much concern or exchange of information after asking if all okay, so that left me hanging as the officer couldn't do anything without details. I drove home and my sister had to take a cab to the train station instead. I ended up taking the day off to drop the car for repairs (the rock stars at the garage repaired it theÂ same day) and calling the insurance to report it. What a pain! I paid for it out of pocket (Â£85) because both the fellow I spoke to at the insurance company and the guys at the garage said if they'd had to take the front panel off to repair it, the car would have been written off instead. That startled me but I suppose makes sense, as that would have cost far more than the car is actually worth. As the guy at the garage said, the car is worth more to me on the road as she is. A dent is unsightly but she's still roadworthy and driveable, so doing any more work isn't worth it.Annoying and frustrating, but no one was hurt, so overall it could have been much worse.I'veÂ decided that I'm going back to school this year. I need to have a focus and that seems like a good one. I double checked to see if there was a similarÂ program closer to home, but there isn't, so it's an hour's drive for me once a month to attend class. I'm okay with that. I want something that'll make me some (extra) money as I head towards, and into, retirement in the next 15 years and that'll allow me to feel good about what I do. I've decided on acupressure, and the following year will add aromatherapy. That feels more like what I need, so I'm going to follow that feeling. I can register for the online portion of the course anytime, which would lessen the workload in the fall. This is something I plan to do at the end of February. Then I have to make sure I take the time to do the reading and reviewing to get it completed.I'll also be meal planning and try to get into the habit of making meals that will last more than one day. Freezer friendly, easy, tasty and cost saving - I need to make more of an effort with my food. My cousin is really good at that sort of thing, so I know will be able to help with stuff like that. I'm lazy - I admit it - and would rather spend my weekends just not doing much of anything than cooking 101 things, but do acknowledge that it's a real time saver during the week and the less thought for me around what to eat, the better!Anyway, that's really about it. Just a few thoughts to catch up. To those on the east coast, I hope the ice storm eases and that some sense of normalcy returns soon. Take care of yourselves!"},

{"title": "27 November 2016, update", "date": "Sunday 27 November 2016", "text": "It's been a bit quiet in the Forest lately which is just how I like it. :) I'm going to do everyone's favourite kind of update - bulletÂ point - because I have a bunch of stuff to do today (see picture above) and have basically just been faffing about since I got up at 7:00 to wait for a grocery delivery.As it's just arrived, my to-do list has got that much smaller but I still want to accomplish some stuff today.Work is going okay. It's still a bit slow but as there isn't much we can do about that, there's no point getting worked up about it. It just really makes me want to go back to school again to focus on something I can do part-time and/or eventually roll into a full-time job that will take me into retirement.I did three walks on the Forest through the New Forest Walking Festival in October. This is an annual event, apparently, which takes place for two weeks and showcases the Forest in all its functions. There were nearly 100 on offer with a variety of distances, times, difficulties and 'themes'. Most are free, others have nominal fees (Â£5 or so), and they were really enjoyable and informative. Â It's a really remarkable place and I'm SO lucky to live here. I'll definitely be signing up for more walks next year.I attended a writing workshop in mid-October, held at a gallery. It was an all day workshop and was interesting in that the instructor gave us a lot of ideas to work with to prompt and poke our creativity, but I didn't necessarily come away with anything new. However, the 6 other women I did the workshop with were absolutely lovely and we've since met again to discuss what we want to do. So I now have a monthly writing group to attend starting in January! We'll be working with the workshop instructor over a period of 6 months to a goal of publishing a small anthology.The gallery has a wide variety of workshops which I'm going to explore next year (block printing, silver making, felt work, drawing, painting, etc.).Â I'm enjoying the women's group I've joined. They're a really lovely bunch and I'm glad I decided to join up. It's not active, but they're an intelligent, welcoming, interesting bunch and it's quite relaxed,Â so is enjoyable a couple of nights each month.I've been housesitting for a few weeks during October and November, taking care of cats and a dog in two different parts of Southampton. One was a Very Posh area, one not. Both paid me (!) and I had direct transit routes to work which was great. One was for a colleague who went to Slovenia for a few days and who has recently got a dog. He's lovely but dogs are hard work! Although the twice daily walks did us both good. She gave me a dept store gift card and I'm going to buy a food processor with it.I got a letter from Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs to let me know that I've been overpaid by Â£1,200 in my Working Tax Credits (essentially extra money for making less than base wage). So I have to pay that back, obviously, and I've made arrangements for a monthly direct debit to pay it back, which will take me through most of next year. It was a bit of an unpleasant surprise but my own fault, as I didn't phone them to let them know my circumstances had changed. So, an expensive lesson. Yeesh!I spoke with my Mum last night who said she'd like a large jar of Marmite for Christmas. She can get it in Canada but it's quite expensive, so that's definitely doable and will be bought and sent. She said she's going to send us some money, as she usually does, so will have to consider the best way to designate that when it arrives, particularly as it's split between me and my sister and my sister currently owes me a couple of hundred pounds. I may take at least part of what she owes me from it.I'm currently doing Nanowrimo again this year, although I can't imagine I'll finish it on time. I'm at about 8500 words and need 50k by next Wednesday. I was looking for the story I started a couple of years ago as I wanted to carry on with it, but I can't find it so started again and am picking away at it a bit at a time.My sister and I have a Christmas market trip to Salisbury planned for next weekend and the following weekend we're going to be in Bristol for a family birthday, which I'm really looking forward to.Will be writing up Christmas cards tonight and mailing them from work tomorrow (a bit of a discount if I use the franking machine). This is an approved method of mailing and was encouraged last year - I keep track of the postage used and pay it back as and when I can.I'm back on the no-sugar (except for honey in my tea on the weekends) programme and although I actually started a couple of weeks late because of the house sitting, I'm doing well and the recipes are really good. This takes me through into January, so will be a real test of willpower over the holidays!I've organised my budget for next year already and it's almost time for goals and 'projects' to be sorted out. This will be done over the next few weeks and,Â hopefully, I'll be on top of it before the new year this year.I'm off to do some bulk cooking for the next few days now. Have a great weekend everyone!"},
{"title": "October plans", "date": "Saturday 1 October 2016", "text": "voicecommunications.co.ukWhere has the year gone? October already - how did that happen?It was payday on the 29th, so I spread the love around, as you do. I have a bit more to work with this month because of the payments on my credit cards (which have now been removed from my wallet). I'm ALMOST paid off on my M/C, but the amount has gone up a bit and now sits at about Â£490. Why?I got a fantastic deal on a refurbished iPad 4 on Groupon and bought it: Â£229. It cost me less than I budgeted for. This was the best way to do it as it includes a charger and USB cord, whereas if I were to buy it from the place I'd originally considered, I'd have to buy those additionally. So, pleased.The other Â£30-ish is for flowers for a friend in Canada whose mother died on Wednesday. I wanted to acknowledge what her mum meant to me and let her know I was thinking of her. I picked out a sunflower bouquet and asked for some white lillies to be added. Her mum was a joy and I felt it would be a bright spot in an otherwise sad time.Â The flowers arrived literally several hours later (thanks, Internet!) and were well received, so I'm happy. Zero issues with this cost.I budgeted down a little for my debt repayments on this end and that's given me a bit more in the bank this month. This is a good thing as I have a two week housesit starting on the 12th and I'll need both my own grocery money (my cousin and I are splitting grocery purchases again) and bus fare! This is a bit frustrating, but easier than driving every day although I'll be taking my car with me and have free parking at work if I want it.I've got loads of things planned for this month too, which I'm actually excited about! I'm not sure why October ended up being ridiculously busy, but I'm not complaining.I've decided to join the women's group I went to the other week. I thoroughly enjoyed the ladies' company and it's very laid back. If you can't make a meeting, it's okay. There's generally tea and biscuits as we wind up, so I've decided that I'd like to contribute some kind of baking. I love to bake but my places to share it have dried up since my cousin now works from home and my own colleagues don't really eat baked goods anymore...So with that said, I have a couple of nights with them that sound fun.Â I've got a two-hour (!!) yoga workshop next Saturday morning (Â£15) which should be interesting, as the last time I did any yoga was 4 years ago while I was at college.It's also the New Forest Walking FestivalÂ from the 15 - 30 October with loads of walks to choose from, most free, some with nominal fees. My cousin and I have registered for two easy walks of a couple of hours each and I registered for two further ones that are about 4 hours apiece. These latter ones are also informational in that I'll be learning about how the Forest works so I'm looking at them as research as well as exercise. Quite excited about those! Hoping for decent weather...I've registered for a writing workshop one Sunday too. Perhaps I'll come away with something I can use as a start for Nanowrimo in November.Phew! But in a good way.Today I went to the library again. I returned 5 books (several of which I didn't get to and didn't want to renew - again - at the moment) and somehow wound up with 8 more! I have no idea how that happens...This weekend is quiet, but as the weather is on/off rain, it's nice to have a day to putter and get a few things done around the house."},

My general lack of any kind of life direction sort of bothered me, so I often covered it up with short-term pleasures. I spent money and did things at least in part so that I wouldnât have to consider my lack of life direction.I think that feeling is common for a lot of people. If you donât have any sense ofÂ what you want to do with your lifeÂ to guide you, it becomes really easy to justÂ driftÂ through life, living paycheck to paycheck and simply trying to get the most momentary enjoyment that you can from what life hands you.\"I found this blog just now. It seems to have a number of contributors with posts about various personal finance topics but it's the latest post, \"What Should I Do With My Life? The Fundamental Question of Personal Finance - and a Surprising Answer\" that jumped out. In particular, those two paragraphs above stood out - okay, maybe it was like a universal smack upside the head, but really! Why has it taken me so long to realise this? (emphasis mine). I'm a drifter. Somewhere I did know this, I've been told, but I suppose you get to a point in your life where you just start 'Adulting' and get on with it. My upbringing didn't encourage girls to be anything other than wives (ideally of People: doctors, lawyers, etc.) and mothers. I knew I didn't want thatÂ but at the same time, anything I DID want was neatly deflected as unimportant, silly, unnecessary, etc. So where did that leave me? Anyway, here I am. I don't believe in coincidences - everything comes to you as and when you need it. There have been a number of 'aha' moments in the past couple of months and I've begun to pay real attention, conscious attention, to them and am finding ideas, experiences, and opportunities are starting to show up. I don't love my job, but at the moment it's steady and allows me to live comfortably and enjoy a few things.

The exchange rate is pretty miserable, but the interest rate on the LOC is about 5x lower than the credit cards! It makes more sense to do this, despite the fact that I haven't lowered my total debt load, as I can adjust my outgoing debt payments down a little bit.I'll be paying a bit more than minimum on the remaining CC and concentrating harder to bring the LOC down more quickly.I add this as it was another of those little 'aha' moments, even though it's technically more of a lateral move than a forward one."},
{"title": "Ireland: Dublin, Day 1 (photo heavy)", "date": "Saturday 24 September 2016", "text": "copyright irishexcursion2015Well, I know you know that Jane and I were just a 'little' excited about our trip to Ireland, so here's my first post now that we're back.I've just finished organising my photos so thought it best to just get the first post done or it would be ages until I got around to it.We started our trip in the capital, Dublin, a very old, eclectic, vibrant and international city. Jane had arrived the day before me so had had a chance to walk around and explore a lot.We were staying in south Dublin, in the area called Ballsbridge which is home to many foreign embassies, beautiful, large Georgian homes and wide streets. It's quite lovely (and not cheap). Our B&B was called Ariel House and was one of the said Georgian homes. It was gorgeous, albeit the decorates were a smidge tired and in need of a little TLC. The staff was superb, however, and the breakfasts delicious.On the map above, if you find 'Irishtown' on theÂ right-hand side near the bottom, our B&B was half a block from (just to the left of) Landsdowne DART Station, which works out to a 15-20 min walk from the city proper.There was a lounge to relax in if you wished and in the evenings they put out cake and hot drinks for the guests.Breakfast was a small bowl of muesli & yogurt and a poached egg with smoked salmon. There was homemade brown bread - which we found everywhere we went in Ireland - which was hearty and very delicious. It wasn't soda breadÂ but was rich and flavourful.Then we headed out, walking 20 mins or so into the city.Our beautiful room. The ceiling was about 12' high!Jane, excited to be going adventuring in Dublin, outside the B&B.The front facade of the hotel. Our room is on the top floor, far left.The doorways around Dublin were beautiful, all slightly different colours or designs.Some beautiful tilework decorations.The Grand Union canal.The statue called 'Eire' in Merrion Square (a small, pretty park on our way to the city).Jane 'trying before buying'. Chair sculpture in Merrion Square.The Oscar Wilde memorial in Merrion Square. He lived in a house across the street for a few years.We bought a bus tour ticket outside the gates of the park as they were having a 'one day sale' and they were a pretty good deal for 10Euros each. We didn't go on right awayÂ but purchased them as they were good for 24 hours.We first went to Trinity College for a tour.A cow sculpture on an empty house.Trinity College, Dublin.Our tour was given by a student guide and took about half an hour. It was really interesting and our guide was very good. It's a beautiful campus, right in the heart of the city and covering 47 acres. It was founded in 1592 (by Queen Elizabeth 1) and today there are approximately 17,000 students studying a range of disciplines: medicine, science, geography, politics, law, etc. and has both undergrad and postgraduate studies.According to Wikipedia:Â Trinity CollegeÂ (Irish:Â ColÃ¡iste na TrÃ­onÃ³ide) is the sole constituentÂ collegeÂ of theÂ University of Dublin, a researchÂ universityÂ in Ireland. The college was founded in 1592 as the \"mother\" of a new university,[Note 1]modelled after theÂ collegiate universitiesÂ ofÂ OxfordÂ and ofÂ Cambridge, but, unlike these, only one college was ever established; as such, the designations \"Trinity College\" and \"University of Dublin\" are usually synonymous for practical purposes. It is one of the sevenÂ ancient universitiesÂ of Britain and Ireland,[7]Â as well as Ireland's oldest university.Originally it was established outside the city walls ofÂ DublinÂ in the buildings of the dissolved AugustinianÂ Priory of All Hallows. Trinity College was set up in part to consolidate the rule of theÂ TudorÂ monarchyÂ in Ireland, and it was seen as the university of theÂ Protestant AscendancyÂ for much of its history. AlthoughÂ CatholicsÂ andÂ DissentersÂ had been permitted to enter as early as the end of the XVIII century (1793),[8]Â certain restrictions on their membership of the college remained until 1873 (professorships, fellowships and scholarships were reserved for Protestants).[9]Â From 1871 to 1970, the Catholic Church in Ireland forbade its adherents from attending Trinity College without permission. Women were first admitted to the college as full members in January 1904.[10]Trinity College is now surrounded by Dublin and is located onÂ College Green, opposite the formerÂ Irish Houses of Parliament. The college proper occupies 190,000Â m2Â (47 acres), with many of its buildings ranged around largeÂ quadranglesÂ (known as 'squares') and two playing fields. Academically, it is divided into threeÂ facultiesÂ comprising 25 schools, offeringÂ degreeÂ and diploma courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. As of 2016, it was ranked by theÂ Times Higher EducationÂ (THE)Â World University RankingsÂ as the 160th best university in the world, by theÂ QS World University RankingsÂ as the 98th best, by theAcademic Ranking of World UniversitiesÂ as within the 151â200 range, and by all three as the best university in Ireland.[11][12][13]Â TheÂ Library of Trinity CollegeÂ is aÂ legal depositÂ library for Ireland and the United Kingdom, containing over 4.5 million printed volumes and significant quantities of manuscripts (including theÂ Book of Kells), maps and music.We kept our tickets for the Book of Kells for the next day, rather than wait in the lengthy lineup that day.This is called 'Sphere within a Sphere' and stands outside the newer, smaller Berkeley library.After the College tour, we hopped on a Green Bus Tour to go out to Dublin Castle. This was a building from the roof of the tour bus. Sorry, I don't have details on this...The Record Tower of Dublin Castle. The sole surviving medieval tower c. 1228.We bought our tickets then went to have lunch as we had some time to fill and were getting peckish.Temple Bar and The Olympia Theatre entrance roof.Â We stopped for lunch at the Queen of Tarts, a delightful cafe just across the street from the castle. We settled into this lovely space.Lunch! Delicious. I had a fantastic quiche. So delicious was the food and so lovely was the cafe that we almost missed our tour of Dublin Castle!!The tour had already started but a tour receptionist took us over to join the group. We only missed a few minutes of the introduction - phew!The castle chapel.The state apartments.The (with)drawing room.The throne room.The dining room.St Patrick's Hall, used for presidential inaugurations and dates from the 1740s. It was used recently to welcome Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland in 2011. She is the first English monarch to visit Ireland since 1911.The beautiful ceiling decorations in the Hall.Our first selfie of the trip!The castle gardens.Christ Church Cathedral. We missed the tours but there was a food and craft fair on the grounds and we consoled ourselves with divine mini cheesecakes. Mine was passionfruit.Â Off Grafton Street, the main pedestrian shopping arcade.There are about a million pubs in every city and town in Ireland. Not kidding.It was heaving, although in this photo it doesn't actually look as busy as it was (or at least felt!).Tilework on a business down one of the alleys off Grafton Street. There were about a dozen flowers, all different colours.A couple of the decorative light stands outside the Renaissance Hotel. Each was a different woman.Another doorway en route back to the B&B.We stopped at a pub called Crowe's Pub for dinner, a place Jane had discovered the day before. Dinner was delicious: a three-beet salad with halloumi, quinoa, rocket and pine nuts. Drinks were a little less so - I had two attempts at a rum & coke and wound up with little bugs in both! Ick...The landlord finally figured out that they were fruit flies that had got into the bottle of rum through the spout. Once he'd opened a fresh bottle, all was well and good with the world and I even got a second drink on the house for the trouble, which was really nice of him.Tomorrow: the Book of Kells and a ghost tour!"},

I like the simplicity of this one (hence, I suppose, its appropo title \"Simple\"), so will see what else I can play with. I'd like to change the cover photo but can't remember how to do it...I also decided to separate my debt into its specific items, rather than lump it all into one. It's big. But I think it's important that I see it like this, so it will make me more accountable and focused on hammering it down. Since I've been back from holiday, I've acquired the books below from various thrift stores - quite a haul! The top book in the second photo was quite a score actually as mass market paperbacks of that size aren't common and I've never seen one of theseÂ cosy mysteries on any bookshelves here (barring MC Beaton ones). The ones at the local branch of the library were donated by me. There are a few authors printed in that size, but not many, so I was thrilled to find it - so much easier to carry around with you!These were buy 2, get one free - total Â£7.69.These were Â£1.20 each - total Â£6.00. The Edward Marston one happens to be #4 in a series that I'm reading, so was a great find!Outside of that, not much happened this week. It's a lovely, relaxing weekend and a warm sunny day today, so laundry is drying in the sun and my cousin is repotting some plants. We bought tickets yesterday to a psychic show that will be at a local theatre on Thursday night. I've been to psychics privately a few times, but never to a show by one so am looking forward to the experience. It was only Â£10 and I hope will be interesting. I do believe in that sort of thing, but am also a bit of a sceptic when it's on public display. There's also a small part of me that really hopes my dad will come through.Regardless, I think it will be enjoyable and it's a night out and not far from home.I've got a few brochures to look at as well, as there are some fantastic art workshops and classes that I'd like to attend. They aren't overly expensive and it would be so much fun to learn something new, get out of the house on a weekend, and make something. We also picked up a brochure for an arts & crafts place that has a Sunday writing workshop that I'm going to call about. I want to sign up for that.The need to create is strong, so I'm really pleased to have found this information!"},

{"title": "Anniversary!", "date": "Sunday 21 August 2016", "text": "My anniversary at work (if you will) was August 3 - one whole year already! That went fast.Â It's been a year of learning curves, feeling frustrated and stressed at times, bored at others, but overall I believe I've done very well. For the most part, I understand what I'm doing and have been given more to do, have found my work rhythm and know what I can complete in a day and how quickly I can do it.Â And yesterday I was told I have an extra holiday day now! Yay!I can either use it this year or roll it over and add it to next year's (giving me a total of 22 days). Tempting to use it this year, but once I've come back from Ireland there isn't really anything pressing I want to do so, at this point, I will roll it over and perhaps take a long weekend somewhere. I have places I want to go (European destinations) and people to see there, so having an extra day to use as and when would be terrific.But (you knew there'd be one, didn't you?) doing a pros and cons list, let's see how it really looks.Pros:1. Lovely colleagues!2. Steady, regular income.3. They bought me an annual train pass!!4. We're (finally!) getting new chairs.5. Interesting sector of work (construction related, and I love construction and anything 'house-y' and real estate related) and one that's absolutely ruined me for a future home purchase (but not in a bad way - just makes me more aware of what to look out for).6. I'm comfortable and confident in what I'm doing/saying/telling clients.7. An easy, straightforward, non-stressful commute.8. I'm good at it and, for the most part, like it.9. Dog Tuesday - one of my colleagues brings her dog into the office. It's my favourite weekday. :)Cons:1. I'm Bored (see the 'for the most part' qualifier in #9 above).Yup, the ultimate motivation killer - boredom.Â I'm aware that all jobs become routine after a time - what would we do without it? - but there's no room for growth, which is a bit limiting in the long runÂ because the company is so small. Everyone has their job.It's why I enjoyed the week the MD was away - it was quiet and I was away from my desk and working on a - not insubstantial - project. It appealed to myÂ mild OCD and need for order - which only manifests at work - and it felt great to accomplish such a much-needed, albeit dirty, job. I need more projects like this or one that I can pick away at weekly, monthly, etc. and that has a proper result at the end of it.Do I want to leave? Yes and no. No, because I think I need the stability for a bit and I DO like it. I'm tired of job hoppingÂ if I'm honest.Yes, because...bored and no growth potential.And that's the reason I was contemplating going back to school, which I've since decided isn't a good idea this year. I'm going to leave this on the back burner at the moment and assess how things look next year. I definitely need to be further ahead in debt reduction before I take on something like that again.I'm hoping that I can have a discussion with the Directors at my annual review and work out some kind of a project with them. A continuation of what I started would be great, but there has to be something - marketing? Some kind of writing? Learning some of the HR aspects? I don't know.Anyway, I'm hoping for a positive review regardless and hopefully a little pay rise.But I also think I just need a more fulfilling life OUTSIDE of work. There are so many things I like, but that I just don't do: bike riding, photography, writing, walking...Instead, I spend most of my free time either watching TV (okay to a point) or reading. The former is just a bad habit and addictive. The latter I don't want to change at all, just do something a little more outside it.I need to do some serious soul searching and this is part of the reason I'm looking forward to Ireland so much. I'm hoping for a good mental cleansing. :)"},
{"title": "In less than a week...", "date": "Saturday 20 August 2016", "text": "...I'm going to be here!!!!!!!!!!!!!! With Jane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OMG!!!!!!!!!!!This time next week we'll be in Dublin, in the Republic of Ireland. I'm feeling almost entirely prepared: I have new shirts (too many), new socks (never enough), new boots, sunscreen, toiletries, a Guide Book to Ireland, tickets, maps, various and sundry bits & pieces and am making up my trail mix this weekend.I've bought all kinds of bits for my trail mix: M&M's, cranberries, coconut, currants, pumpkin seeds, and I've got three kinds of nuts: almond, cashew, and walnut. I think I've got more than enough to see me through the hike, if not beyond.The weather isn't supposed to be so great, but hopefully we'll get a few decent days and who knows? The system may move off before we get there or at worst, while we're there, and we'll be able to bask in the green glory of the countryside. Regardless, there's literally nothing we can do about the weather (except moan and I promise to keep that to a bare minimum, Jane - or at least keep the muttering to myself) so will make the best of it that we can.In the meantime, there's still a week of 'real life' to get through.Work is slow. It's trickling in at this point and we're struggling a bit to find things to do during the day, although at least the MD is working pretty steadily which means I still have things to do. However, I can't see it picking up before ChristmasÂ when it usually reaches a standstill anyway.I've just come home from the library where I had YET MORE heavily crime-themed books awaiting my attention - 9, to be exact.A few more hardcovers than I would have liked, but there we are. They're due back after I get back from Ireland and I renewed the others I still have as well. I managed to get through 5 books this month (so far) and have to decide which one(s) I'm taking to Ireland with me.I'd like to get through the top two of the pile this weekend. My cousin is away to see her family this weekend, so I'll be expecting to see her on Tuesday when I get home. She rushed off yesterday evening (it's a two-hour drive) and an hour after she'd gone, I found her purse left behind on the kitchen counter! So she is sans wallet, glasses, and phone, but at least she's with people who can take care of her until she gets back. She didn't even realise until she arrived at her mum's house and was unloading the car. Ha ha!I sent an inquiry to a local women's group (which is part of a National Association) last week after seeing a poster at the library for it. It's similar to the WI, but I don't think is so focused on week-day activities and seems to be more of a chatting and social association. There's an annual fee of Â£20, which is very reasonable, and there are only 9 members at the moment. A nice size, actually, as any more than that and I'd likely not bother.They have bi-weekly meetings that seem to focus on discussions of various sorts - next week is a meeting at a pub to discuss current events (which I'm embarrassingly lacking in knowledge of), two weeks' on is the AGM and planning the next few meetings, and the one following that is a talk by one of the members about her trip to Cyprus. I'm struggling to meet people here. I have three women I consider friends - two live in London and the third has disappeared from radar for the most part as she met a fellow in January and is now planning her wedding, so I haven't seen her since the end of last year. I'm feeling a bit stuck and lonelyÂ if I'm honest, so this group is, hopefully, something I can enjoy.I'm hoping this group is a start, but that it isn't too, well, boring (says the woman whose only hobby is reading). I said right off the bat that I work full-time, so am limited in what I'm able to do (evenings & weekends) and the WI was frustrating because they planned 98.999% of their outings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'd like to have some...more youthful...members as well so that perhaps there will be some more energetic activities available.It feels a bit structured but it can't hurt to go and see how I feel about it.Anyway, it's a rubbish(y) weekend weatherwise, I've just finished sorting my trail mix and it's time to take book to sofa and get started on the new pile. I have a couple of books I can likely get through if I set my mind to it.Have a great weekend, all!***********************************************************************************Amended to add:Also, that student loan debacle that happened way back in January 2013 (already, apparently)? The one that made headline news because of the lost flash drive and potential privacy breach of 583,000 Canadians?Â I was affected and once the initial phone calls, etc. had been made and all the right noises voiced, I promptly forgot about it.Â I got a letter last week making me aware that I'm included in a class action lawsuit - 4 legal companies have banded together for this opportunity - against the Federal Government.I considered not bothering, but it's actually easier to just be a part of it rather than faffing around with paperwork to get out of it. They're still working through the collection and review of paperwork - which should take them through February next year - but, according to (one of) the legal bits, \"Borrowers may be entitled to compensation for the breach of their privacy, damages for identity theft and/or damages to their credit reputation, damages for the costs incurred to prevent identity theft, damages for the time spent changing your personal information such as your Social Insurance Number, damages for emotional distress/inconvenience, and/or compensation for out of pocket expenses. Punitive damages will also be claimed because the Government failed to disclose the breach of privacy for 2 months.\"I actually did none of the above, so unclear what my compensation would (or MAY, no guarantees) potentially be. Nothing? These sorts of suits are notoriously lengthy and I think the only people to honestly profit will be the lawyers, although the Feds have capped their fees at 1/3 of whatever the compensation happens to be.I could make $20,000. I could make $20. There could be nothing. I've got the necessary pageÂ bookmarked, but am not really holding my breath for a massive windfall of any sort.Still, it'll be interesting to see how it turns out in the future."},
{"title": "What's been going on this week?", "date": "Saturday 6 August 2016", "text": "This is the desk and lamp I bought at IKEA last weekend! Very pleased. It's a bit big, but is exactly what I want, as my computer - unlike the practically sized laptops - is a monster of a desktop so needs quite a deep space to sit in. My cousin has given me her old desk chair, so I'm all set. :) Â£55 for the desk, Â£15 for the lamp, Â£3 (?) for the bulb and I bought a cushion as well.I bought a new notebook for Ireland (green, my favourite colour and appropriate for Ireland): Â£1.75An unbelievable find at a charity shop for 'new' hiking pants (the zipping kind!) Â£3.50! A perfect fit, too, which just proves they were meant for me. Olly is kindly adding essential cat hair for me.I dropped a dozen or so items at one of the charity shops in town today and spent some time poking around all of them. I found this for .50p!I decided to go through my Goodreads lists and see what I could order from the library (why this has never occurred to me before, I have no idea). I'm currently at about 21 items on hold (at .50p a reservation) and 14 of them came in pretty much all at the same time! Yikes. And here I am going on holiday in less than three weeks. I've decided to start at the top and work my way down and just see how far I can get before I go - probably three, maybe four. Whatever I don't get to I'll just renew and get to when I get back (or not). This stack cost me Â£7.50Southampton currently has zebra statues around town - you're probably familiar with these installations, even if your town or city hasn't had them. A few years ago there were hippos around, painted and auctioned off at the end of their display period to raise money for one cause or another. The zebras are being auctioned for conservation (of zebras!), which I think is a great idea. There's a map and quite a few are located near work, so I could actually get some exercise at lunch and go find a few to photograph.These are the ones my sister and I found on Thursday when she came to see me for lunch. Because it was so quiet at work my supervisor allowed me an hour and a half for lunch (!), so we definitely made the most of it.'Zeffe''Fantastic Mr Fox' - in honour of Roald Dahl.'Who's You?''Zippy''Allegra''Zeeberry'I walked to work past this one the next day and someone(s) had pushed it over! There was police tape around the area and a lady - I'm assuming somehow connected to the zebra - standing over it. This is apparently the second time it's been knocked over. Such a shame that people just can't leave things alone.'Frederic'I'm going for a walk with my sister tomorrow somewhere in the Forest. We'll likely have tea and cake afterwards (or before) as we usually do. Next weekend we're going to Portsmouth for the day to use one of my passes. Possibly a trip up the Spinnaker tower too, but not certain about that yet. We'll see how the day goes.I was uber-productive at work this week, despite not having much 'real' work to do. I tidied and cleaned out the stationary cupboard and the storage cupboard in the meeting room (soooooo much junk!) and even attacked all the offices on the second floor. 99% of stuff is off the floor and I think the MD will be quite pleased with his office. There's still a way to go, but it's a definite start. I was full on all day Wednesday and Thursday, filling filing boxes, sorting, tidying, etc. I was exhausted but it feels so good to have done it. No one else was willing so it was better than sitting down all week and doing nothing.Before he left on holiday, I asked the MD if I could have a new office chair (and one for my colleague as well) and he said to pick out a couple to look at and I could have what I wanted (win! Does no one ask for things in this office?). I've got a couple that I quite like - office chairs are expensive! - so I'm hoping that either one will be approved. I'd say I've earned my chair this week...ha ha!Anyway, 20 days until Ireland and I'm starting to get organised in my head. I'm pretty much set but do need several more pairs of hiking socks and at least two more t-shirts just to be on the safe side."},
{"title": "Catching up on a little reading...", "date": "Tuesday 2 August 2016", "text": "My cousin accidentallyÂ severed the TV cable cord while she was tidying up her garden about a month or so ago, so we've been using YouTube and various iPlayer type things to watch 'TV' on my computer instead. It's actuallyÂ better, because you can pick and choose something you know you'll enjoy rather than just watching something for the sake of it which, I admit, we do far, far too often.Â So it's been 4 full seasons of 'Jeeves & Wooster',Â six episodes of a new show calledÂ 'New Blood' (police drama, brilliant), some ghost shows ('Most Haunted' & 'Ghost Adventures') and catching up with one of my favourite shows, 'Mock the Week.' The host, Dara O'Briain is one of the funniest men on TV.Â I've also been 'collecting' books - utilising what I can find the in library or picking up interesting sounding ones from used book stores - and am going through them at quite a pace. The library for the most part is a free service, as it is at home, apart from CDs or DVDs, but I've been perusing my Goodreads site today and searching the Hampshire library system online and have put 16 books on hold (work is s-l-o-w). Reservations cost .50p each, so I've currently racked up Â£8. Still, considering how much I usually spend on books, it's still a bargain.Â There are already 4 waiting for me at myÂ home branch! Ha ha! Â I've zoomed through 6 library books and four of my own new (used) ones in the past 2.5 weeks. Granted, they've not been particularly challenging, but I've enjoyed them and I read them mostly during my commute, so I get about an extra hour a day to read. They were cosy mysteries,Â and I've now moved on to Bill Bryson's 'Made in America.' I like to read a couple of non-fiction books after I've gorged on fiction, just to keep myself balanced. I don't read non-fiction as quickly, and am quite particular about it.Â So, the summer is all set with lots of reading to be done.Â I also got a nice surprise last week when I received 6 free train passes in the mail from the train company I travel with to work. Because I have an annual pass for the train, I get a few benefits, like upgrading for a small(er) fee, discounts on rail travel, etc. Apparently, IÂ also get free trips anywhere on the system this summer so, WIN!Â I can take someone(s) with me as well so as long as I have myÂ rail card with meÂ and keep the free ticket on hand, I can take my sister or cousin on a day trip somewhere. Salisbury springs to mind at the moment...Â Ireland in 24 days! Transportation is now booked, as is a ghost walk in Dublin. Â Serious consideration is being given to returning to school in the fall for an acupressure diploma. There's a college near Brighton (about an hour away) that I'm looking at, as there doesn't seem to be anything closer. It's not too expensive, the course is one weekend per month for 11 months, and it is something I've tried and very much enjoyed in the past. As I say, I'm just considering it at this point, but I'm feeling a bit frustrated that I'm not continuing to move forward, at least in the respect of learning something. Â Anyway, work is very quiet at the moment soÂ I'm doing filing (long, LONG overdue filing), the weather isn't fantastic so I haven't really been out on my bike, I bought a desk, I've joined my cousin on her Weight Watchers plan (just the food part), and life, for the most part is good. I've had a bit of an epiphany about depression and how longÂ it's been affecting me, so I've made an appointment withÂ my doctor to get a referral for some counselling to do some digging. To start the process, I've taken myself off FB for the time being, as I can literally lose myself for hours in it with nothing of note to show when I finally get off it.Â Otherwise, I'm counting down the days to Ireland (over there --->) and will be focussing on that for the next couple of weeks to make sure I don't forget anything, pick up anything last minute I might need, etc. and will be doing a lot of reading! :)"},
{"title": "Updates from the New Forest", "date": "Sunday 10 July 2016", "text": "Ed, the magnificent European Eagle Owl.It's early morning in the Forest, with yet another overcast and damp day ahead apparently. It's been one of the warmest Junes on record, but mostly overcast and wet - thanks, Jet Stream! - so it's hard to get excited about 'summer'.Â I've hardly been out on my bike but did finally get out yesterday for a decent ride. I went to Lyndhurst to meet my sister in the morning. It's about 5 miles and took me half an hour (each way, obviously). The weather was on the cool side when we met up but had warmed up considerably by the time we parted. It was a lovely ride - the local authority has paved the track beside the road and it's a flat, smooth ride right into town. I'm definitely not in the best shape but the beauty of having so many gears is that you can always find one that works for you. :) It felt really good to be out on the bike.I picked up a pair of shorts in anticipation of some decent weather in Ireland in September when I go hiking with Jane again, something I'm very much looking forward to. We've got almost all the details organised now, just need to book some transport from place to place, and are counting down the days.Â Our trip starts in Dublin, then we spend two days on Inis Mor, the largest of the Aran Islands on the West Coast. Technically we have two days hiking while we're there but we may opt for bikes, depending on the cost, for at least one of those days. 8 days later we arrive in the town of Westport, on the mainland, before heading back to Galway for three nights. After that it's Cork for 2 nights and a visit to Blarney Castle to kiss the Blarney Stone (!). Back to Dublin and we go our separate ways again. I have total confidence that this trip will be as great as last year's - despite not really knowing each other before last year, we got on extremely well so this year promises to be even better.I've wanted to visit Ireland for DECADES, so this is literally a dream come true for me. Being able to share the experience with a friend just adds to the joy. SO excited!!In other news, I've changed my car insurance this year to a different insurer. I just about fell over when I got my renewal form: Â£381!! That's half of what I paid for the car, really not worth it. Fortunately there are about a million other options here so I plugged in some numbers, got some suggestions, et voila! I've got a new policy that's saved me Â£120. My current insurer couldn't match it, so they said 'thank you very much for your custom' and let me go without a fuss, which I appreciated. I would've stayed had they been able to match it, but it wasn't to be. At least not this year. But I'm pleased nonetheless. Every little bit helps.I'm less disappointed about Brexit now that I've had time to think and learn more about it. It sounds stupid to say that post-vote, but I haven't lived with the EU for 40 years, so despite a little reading pre-vote there was only so much I could absorb and understand. The English have been living with this for decades so have a better idea (or at least stronger opinions) about it. Now that all the 'Leave' campaigners have bailed, however, it will be interesting to see how things pan out - but a woman Prime Minister is pretty much a given. I know nothing about the women running, so it appears I'll have to do some more reading, but it wouldn't surprise me if, despite being the firm favourite (and part of Team Remain), Theresa May doesn't get the job. If it goes to a general election, it's quite likely the People will continue their decimation of the privileged and bring in someone entirely unexpected.As I said before, interesting times!I took myself to the doctor last week and had a chat. It wasn't with my regular doctor (who doesn't work this day or this day and is the emergency doctor that day...) and I actually felt like I was listened to. I went because I'm slightly concerned by the fact that I'm almost permanently bloated in my legs (started about two years ago). He wrote up a bloodwork request and included kidney numbers (harking back to my issues in Whitehorse), which I was pleased about. Oedema can be caused by heart or kidney issues.He took the pulse in my legs and feet and my blood pressure and said he wasn't at all concerned that it was my heart (phew!), as the pulse was strong and the blood pressure right where it should be.It also includes iron numbers, as I've been taking my iron supplements since February or March. I've definitely noticed an improvement in my breathing and energy levels but sometimes think I could use more, so I suppose I'll have to wait until the results come back before asking about that. I'm positive that some of it is menopause related, but not all of it, so I'm glad there is this bit of follow-up.Work has been quiet this week, partially because two of our surveyors have been on holiday, and also because of the air of general uncertainty that's hovering around the economy at the moment. People are still buying houses, but even in the past two weeks things have noticeably quieted down. I think this initial uncertainty is going to be around until the new year. In the meantime, I've managed to get some long, long overdue filing started (stuff from 2010!). I have spoken with the MD about putting in some extra hours to get this organised, but I may save that until the fall, when the weather is really rubbish and I don't want to spend my weekends trying to get out on my bike. I had suggested that I take some extra time off for extra hours worked (1:1), but may take half cash, half time. That would get me a little more each paycheque without losing most of it to tax, which I can then put towards debt, and 'save up' for a bit of extra time off here and there.Anyway, apart from library visits, a day trip to Poole with my sister, watching some terrific British dramas, lots of reading and talking Ireland with Jane, not much else has been going on.Hope you're all enjoying your summer!"},
{"title": "Well.", "date": "Saturday 25 June 2016", "text": "Oh boy - Brexit.I can't say I'm not disappointed, but I'm feeling more philosophical about it today. It is what it is and now we just have to see how things unfold over the next few months and years.I don't believe it was a good result - fear won this - xenophobia and wedge politics - not facts and figures because, let's face it, there weren't many. Both sides resorted to scaremongering and supposition and theories and fingerpointing and a lot of guessing (and awishin' and ahopin').So what happens now? WHO KNOWS!Lots of speculation, rumours, the Prime Minister's resultant resignation, the EU top brass asserting the remaining 27 member countries will continue as they are but warning that there will be no precedents set with respect to trade deals, renegotiations, etc. And why should they? The divorice negotiations are going to be tricky.Anyhow, here were are on the other side of a historic event with only a sketchy idea of which way we're going - forward.What happens to Wales, which voted to go but which has one of the poorest economies in the UK and get millions in subsidies from the EU, which are going to stop? Scotland is livid and is probably already printing the ballots for their next 'leave' referendum. Northern Ireland and the Republic - what happens there with an EU border between them, after such huge strides to peace? Gibraltor, hanging off the bottom of Spain, voted almost unanimously to stay (96%). What do they do? Will Spain ask for it back? What does this mean for the remaining Commonwealth? Will we weather a bigger recession than 2008?So many questions and so much uncertainty, but here we are.I got told off this morning (by a family member) on FB because I made a postÂ about how I have the option of going back to Canada ('why don't you leave now, then?'). The thing is, I've ALWAYS had that option - nothing has changed in that respect - and I'm staying here because I'm happy here. That's fine. The 'complaining remainers' all over his FB feed would be 'complaining leavers' if it had gone the other way (based on his response, I'm guessing he's in the latter camp).Can England go it alone? WHO KNOWS! 52% believe it can, 49% aren't as confident.Interesting times, indeed."},
{"title": "A new bike - finally!!", "date": "Sunday 22 May 2016", "text": "Some of you may remember that shortly after I arrived in the UK almost three years ago, I bought myself a bike so I could a) get some exercise and, b) get around a little on my own, without relying too much on my cousin.It worked beautifully for a while, until only 6 months later when it was stolen from the train station. I'd taken to riding it to the station and leaving it locked up (in a 'leave it at your own risk' bike rack) and one day I arrived back to see only the front wheel remaining. I was pretty pissed. I reported it to the police, but the officer I spoke with said that the chances of getting it back were slim to none. While I appreciated the honest, it didn't really make me feel a lot better at the time.Â Then my little car appeared and the bike slipped off my radar for a while.I haven't really prioristed it either, until now (or really had the means). However, a few months ago I got a credit card and have been good about consistent monthly payments. They seem to have appreciated this, so they raised my limit about two weeks ago (a pleasant surprise). I bought new hiking boots last weekend for my trip to Ireland in September and today I went out to \"look\" at bikes.Who am I kidding? I wanted to come home with one and I sort of did.I knew what I wanted (see the photo at the top): an Ariel Specialised hybrid with disc brakes (they're a little more solid than the clamping ones) in size large (17\"). After a brief look on my own and seeing a row of bikes that looked right, I got some help and was led right to it! The only difference between the bike I bought and the one that was stolen is the colour. My one's white with turquoise writing on it, the old one was what they called 'blackberry' (more eggplant colour, a lovely rich, dark purple). So while I'm sad about the lack of colour, I'm very excited that I have a new bike.Yes, it did go on my credit card. The interest rate on that sucker is somewhere around 35% (newbie credit builder), but I've set up a recurring monthly direct payment to ensure that I neither miss a payment nor carry the balance for too long. I realise that I would be better off to plan and pay for these things in full, however, but I'm also still throwing cash at my debt in Canada. Slowly but steadily that's coming down, too, and I'm quite pleased with my efforts all round, if I'm honest.I got some new accessories (new pannier rack, lock, mud guards and bike rack for the car; still have my helmet and panniers from last year, fortunately) although it won't be ready until Wednesday, which means I'll need to arrange to leave work over an hour early to get there on time, but I don't believe that will be a problem.Tomorrow I'm going to scope out the bike rack at the station. It's been a while since I've even looked at it. If I'm not comfortable with the way it's set up, I won't ride there and will leave the riding for evenings and weekends instead.I missed riding last summer, so am really thrilled that I can do it this year. I bought the bike rack for the car so I can go a little further afield with it, although there's plenty around here to start."},
{"title": "Meeting a friend at last!", "date": "Monday 16 May 2016", "text": "I spent yesterday in the nation's busy, bustling, noisy, exciting, overwhelming capital. I don't head up to London often - it literally exhausts me - but do enjoy the opportunity when it arises.I've been up TWICE in two weeks this month!The first time was the bank holiday weekend at the beginning of May to meet with a woman who was one of my instructors at school - not technically a 'friend', but most certainly an acquaintance - and who I've kept in touch with since graduating. We spentÂ most of the dayÂ in Regents Park, walking around and catching up. I hadn't been to Regents Park going on 30 years, I'm sure, although I don't remember anything in it so it was new to me! We saw the Princess Diana memorial fountain, opened 2004, by HM Queen Elizabeth.image courtesy: Gustafson-porter.comï»¿It's very low profile, but the water flows around it over a variety of textures and it's very pretty and relaxing.We wandered over to the Royal Albert Hall and saw the magnificent Albert Memorial, sitting down for a tea in full view of both (the below is what we saw, only missing the sunshine).image courtesy: royalparks.orgÂ Â It was great to see her - she, her husband and parents were off on a 37-day cruise to Singapore! - and catch up. Walking was the perfect way to catch up. Afterwards we sat down for a proper tea for an hour before I headed back to the coast.Â Yesterday ï»¿I returned to the city to meet another friend. Ines and I have been friends for over 25 years but this was the first time we ever met in person! I met her through a penfriend organisation out of Ireland, back in the day when snailmail was the only way to do things (early to mid-90's). I can't remember if she was one of my first (I joined consistently for about 5 years), but she is amongÂ only a handfulÂ I'm still in touch with. I have a friend in NottinghamÂ I've been writing to sinceÂ we wereÂ 17, but have yet to get up there to meet him. Soon, I hope.Â Ines was in London with her family (husband and two sons) and I went up to meet her. We met at the London Eye (along with about 5 million other people) and spent the rest of the day on open-top double decker tour buses taking in the sights, chit chatting, etc. We had a stop for lunch in between -Â finding an empty bakery to sit down in for an hour to get some peace and quiet - before ending the day walking across the Millenium Bridge and along the South Bank to get to Waterloo.Â It was so wonderful to finally meet her! She's not the first penfriend I've met - I've been lucky enough to meet several others - but certainly is one that I've had the longest. It was quite an easy transition from 'pen' to just 'friend' and I'm so glad the chance arose to meet her."},
{"title": "Fort McMurray", "date": "Saturday 7 May 2016", "text": "I've been overwhelmed with the news about Fort McMurray this week: photos, videos, and stories of sadness, grief, total loss and utter devastation.But the fact remains that outside of a tragic traffic accident, 88,000+ people made it safely out of a terrifying situation. That's not a little thing.Â The Emergency Services at every level are proving themselves beyond question. They're working 24/7 while their own families leave, their homes possibly gone. All levels of government are working together to do the best they can in a terrifying, incomprehensible situation. One that isn't actually getting any better from the sounds of things.I can't really afford it, but I donated to the Red Cross for the relief effort. I decided to put my money where my mouth is. There are thousands right now who have nothing and I'm very fortunate to have all my comforts - whatever I deem those to be. With the Feds matching $ for $ that means I doubled my donation to $400. Maybe someone can get some groceries with that, or a new pair of shoes and some clothes for the kids. A dog or cat or horse can get a new blanket or bed. Or a hotel bill can be paid. Or a new book can be bought.Frustration is high. Anger is high. Fear is rampant. Rumours abound and communication is garbled. Keyboard warriors abound - politicising, finger pointing, blaming, assuming, undermining, etc. Think what you want about the government at every level, love them or hate them, but what matters most is that everyone is safe. The hardest part will be post-fire, when the damage is assessed and the rebuilding starts.Let's just all be Canadians together right now and support those who so desperately need it right now. Alberta really needs us."},
{"title": "Income Tax...results!!", "date": "Tuesday 29 March 2016", "text": "I just spent about half an hour on the horn with the folks at the Canada Revenue Agency (thanks for continuing to pay your taxes everyone - they help pay for my collect calls to our Nation's capital...ahem...) trying to clarify a couple of things.I needed a new security code to sign in to my online account as I have no idea where the last one they sent me has gone to. On the way: check! One department.The next department (which I was kindly transferred to) was the General Inquiries line to ask about my LLP. After a little misunderstanding on her end and a little miscommunication on my part, I'm thrilled that I can now reduce my overall debt owing by about $8,000. It seems that my LLP has been taken care at that end and is cleared up.I'm not entirely clear on how, exactly, other than it was added into my income for 2013 and I was assured I don't owe anything on it anymore. My understanding was that if it wasn't paid off right away, then I had to roll over the remaining into my income until it was paid off. I didn't realise it was a 'one time' thing, so I have been consistently adding to my RRSP to pay it back annually, as originally organised.Anyhoo, I'm still going to continue to add to my RRSP, but concentrate on the other two outstanding debts first (LOC & CC). It makes much more sense to take care of that if the LLP debt doesn't need to be taken into consideration at this point. The payments will be very slow, but steady, until after I've had my holiday at the end of the year and can focus more on the debt repayment. Once that's down substantially, I'll have money to start a retirement fund and emergency fund here, as well as hopefully saving for more (nearby) travelling.I'm really happy right now!!!"},
{"title": "Spring and into Week 8 - the final leg! :D", "date": "Sunday 27 March 2016", "text": "Happy Easter everyone! Hope you rest, relax and enjoy some family time, good food and lots of choclate this long weekend.Nothing says spring quite like a bouquet of daffodils. They were everywhere at Jane Austen's house in Chawton, Hampshire, which we visited three weeks ago. It was a perfect day - we even sat outside for lunch at a cafe afterwards!The front of the house. The door isn't actually the main entrance into the house. That's around the side, and the original entrance is thought to have been where the window to the left of the door now is.The open door takes you into the kitchen. The door next to it is the entrance to the museum.The well, outside the bakehouse.The little bakehouse.The garden. The slabs would not have originally been there and it would likely have been more of a kitchen garden. Plenty of plants and flowers there now, but they have replaced the vegetables - and possibly fruit trees - that would have grown in Jane's time.This will look glorious in the summer covered in roses.The study, where Jane was thought to have written. The costumes scattered throughout are reprductions from various movie adapatations of her books.The table at which Jane is believed to have written her last three novels: Emma, Mansfield Park and Persuasion. She is also thought to have revised Sense & Sensibility, Pride & Predjudice and Northanger Abbey here.This chair was in Mrs Austen's bedroom.A recreation of Jane's bedroom. It is not her bed, but is a reproduction of the kind she would (likely) have used at the time.Single glazed leaded pane windows. The house would have been VERY cold in the winter.The view of the house from the rear of the garden,Hundreds of daffodils were in bloom around this very pretty, very old English village. I can't imagine it's changed altogether that much since Jane lived here.Chawton House. This houses The Centre for Early Women's Writing 1600-1830. It was closed when we were there, but is generally open to public from the end of March to September.Â An original shepherd's hut, restored from the early 20thC. It sits just outside Chawton House farm (off to the left, down that road immediately behind it).St Nicholas Church. Jane's mother and sister are buried here. Jane herself is buried in Winchester Cathedral.A pastoral setting. Too bad the sun was in the wrong place!Happy Easter!Â One of several chickens ranging free at the farm. I thought she had lovely colouring.I'm heading into the 8th and final week of my no sugar programme and I have to admit I've been a bit slack the past couple of weeks. I haven't really been using the recipes, but have been trying to at least make sure my meals are sugar free and, for the most part, have succeeded. Having fruit back on the menu has made me very happy - I have strawberries in my morning oats every day, but haven't branched out much from there. Just not feeling the urge and I'm not sure that's necessarily a bad thing.I am, however, feeling a bit lazy as we near the end. The joy of cooking continues to elude me, but I've got two weeks holiday at the moment, so I hope that having more time during the day to prepare food will help alleviate some of that. My biggest frustration is getting home late and then having to put something together for a meal.My sister says my skin looks much better (big win!) and when I was down in Devon last weekend, we did a bit of shopping and I noticed that too, as well as the fact I seem to be down a size in clothing (big win!), so despite my frustration with the fact that nothing seems to have changed, things actually have. I'd still like to amend the programme a bit and see if I can shave off some costs. I'll work on it on my own for now and if I feel I want a reset, I'll do another round in the fall or something.My cousin has started with Weight Watchers and the fridge & freezer are now jam packed. Some items overlap (veggies, etc.) but we're now basically out of storage containers so are going to have to pick up some more of those. Just means very careful shopping each week and using up what's in the freezer first. Not a bad practice by any means, but one that I'm not very good at... :PI went to my naturopath two weeks ago and had a good visit. When I went for my first visit before Christmas and had a food intolerance test, nothing unusual came up. This time soy, corn, tuna, cod & plaice popped up as sensitivities, so I found that quite interesting that that has changed in a short period of time. She also suggsted I take a potassium supplement for my bloating (oedema) and see if that helps.My cousin and I are meeting our first cousin once removed (my Mum's first cousin) tomorrow. He's English, although lives in France, and is the product of a bit of a scandalous familial relationship back in the day. He's only recently figured out that his dad is his mother's uncle by marriage, so not directly related at least. He's pretty confident about this, but there's no proof, obviously, but he's asked questions, talked to people, done a little detecting, and this is the answer he's come up with. He's a nice guy, if a bit intense, so as he's in the UK for a week or so, we're having lunch with him and his friend tomorrow, then have plans for a tea or early supper on Saturday, when my Mum is here, so that she can meet him.My Mum arrives on Thursday and my sister and I are heading down to the bungalow on Wednesday to get a look at it, get some groceries in, etc. We have plans for a tea on 7 April, when the family is coming. My sister and I are going to do some baking (cakes & scones), buy some quiches and canapes, and get a platter or two of sandwiches. We don't want too much mess or fuss and this way people can just help themselves and the only thing we have to worry about is refreshing drinks. We're hoping there will be enough space in the garden for 16 or so people and will have to consider a Plan B if not.Â Outside of that, there are no plans in place. My Mum is 84 and doesn't want to go on excursions, so I image at this point it'll be a day to day decision making progress. This does limit us somewhat, but Lymington is a very pretty town and we can at least take walks along the seafront. Hopefully the weather will hold, as there's not much worse than the seaside in the rain...Hope you all have a great, relaxing long weekendÂ¬"},
{"title": "Review of Week 4 - one week to go until strawberries!", "date": "Saturday 5 March 2016", "text": "Heading into Week 5...I admit it.Â I've lost a bit of my motivation and my concentration for this. Don't get me wrong, I'm really proud of myself for doing as well as I have and pretty much following the programme to the letter), I just feel I should have noticed more obvious changes. You know?Â Last week I noticed a bit more room in my trousers (win!) and while the focus/purpose of the programme is NOT weight-loss, it is going to be a natural side effect of not eating sugar for so long. It can't not be, really.I think I've said I've not had any detox symptoms and that hasn't changed. However, I've also not had any hunger pangs and have drastically cut down on my snacking between meals. I'm finding the portions a smidge on the large side, but find I take longer to eat them, so perhaps that's the pay off. I feel full properly, rather than feeling I need to fill the space after I've already eaten.Â Still, no weight loss, back to feeling bloated and therefore a bit sluggish and part of me just wants it to be over (I think this could be considered a withdrawal symptom, actually - my brain is 'sugar sad'). I'm a bit fed up with the cooking, spending great amounts of money on food, eating late(ish), and the huge amount of prep and dishes that get done every week.Â I've not had any harsh or specific cravings, though. At least not the kind where I push old people out of the way to get a chocolate bar or anything like that, so I suppose that's positive (at least for the oldies). It's a bit hard to explain, but it's almost like the cravings have simply gone dormant. They're there, I can 'feel' them, but they're being very quiet and that's part of the reason I'm very consciously NOT putting sugar in my tea (drinking it without, but really not enjoying it) or cheating in other ways. I'm worried that once I start, I simply won't be able to stop again. One lady on the FB forums had a little bit of fudge she'd made for her grandson's birthday and threw it up! :( Not good, but good in the sense that she won't likely try sugar again in a hurry, that's for sure!Â There are three weeks left - Week 5 (this week) is our last NO sugar week - and next Sunday we can start adding tiny amounts back in, but only in the form of berries and Rice Malt Syrup. I am REALLY keen to put strawberries back onto my morning oats, I have to say!Otherwise, I'm sure the iron supplements I've been taking have been helping, too. I'm no longer gasping for breath for ages at the top of the 'hill' on my way to work. I still breathe a bit heavily, but nowhere near what I was just a month ago. I've gone from 400mg per day down to 200mg (still a lot!), but am definitely feeling more with it. I've not done any exercise, but am planning to start running again once the hour changes at the end of the month (can get up nice and early) and will try that trampolining thing I wanted to start back in Feb. Hopefully, combined with the new eating regime, I will see some weight loss then.Â I told the MD at work yesterday that I had a proposition for him, so we had a chat. The company has only been in the current offices a few years, but no one's ever really gone through it to organise and sort the paperwork, which is something that's desperately needed. The MD certainly doesn't have time to do it, although his office is one of the worst offenders. I told him I wanted to start sorting/organising the stuff as plenty of it can probably be sent to archive at this point, or thrown away or at the very least put into boxes and hidden away again. I'm going to go in a couple of Sundays a month for a few hours at a time to get it done because there won't be any time during the week, there's simply too much going on. I'm taking time off in lieu (or perhaps half time, half cash) so it's worked out well. Parking is free on Sundays and if I go in early enough, then I can spend a few hours focussed on work and then be home with plenty of time left in the day to relax. I'm going to start after my mum leaves in April. It's crummy work and not particularly something I'm looking forward to, but it needs to be done and I'm happy to have extra time off in lieu.I've booked my falconry experience for May 3 and bought one for my sister as well, so that'll be fun. So excited - raptors are such brilliant creatures (and heavier than you think), so I'm really looking forward to it.Then I've got cupcake decorating to look forward to as well, likely once my Mum has gone as we'll be busy while she's here.Â I've been buying books like crazy (they're my Achilles heel) despite my promise to myself to use the library more. I have over 200 'want to reads' on my Goodreads list, but if I have cosy mysteries at hand, everything else gets pushed aside, although I love non-fiction as well.My February finished pile. All bought since end of December and will be donated to the library.My 'to read' pile. All bought since end of December - all the books at the bottom are books about writing (instead of actually writing, I tend to read a lot about it instead...). The top of my dresser also has about 2 dozen books I have yet to read as well, but these are the newest. \"Death in Devon\" and \"The Unexpected Inheritance of Inspector Chopra\" were bought on a visit downtown on my lunch break on Wednesday. The lady at the bookstore was very excited that I was buying them - she had her eye on the first one (he wrote the Bookmobile mystery series, which was terrific) and had read the latter and LOVED it. So, good choices, apparently. :)My smaller 'to read' pile. The Andy McNab titles are borrowed from a work colleague and I'm currently reading the top one. I find I can't really read more than one book at a time these days, although I used to be able to do it. I'm ensuring I now have a book with me at all times, as with the waiting and commuting I do every day I can easily get an extra hour of reading in.I've got the house to myself this weekend as my cousin is visiting her mum for Mother's Day (it's tomorrow here). I had semi-grand plans, but basically have just unpacked my grocery delivery and done a laundry so far. :P Tomorrow I need to be more productive: tidying my room, doing some food prep for the week, etc.Have a great weekend everyone!"},
{"title": "End of Week 3 - heading into the halfway mark!", "date": "Saturday 27 February 2016", "text": "Here we are already - halfway through the programme and halfway through our 4 week block of - literally - no sugar.Â Not so motivated with this week's recipes, but will do most of them. I've made another veggie loaf, which I love, so will be sticking to that for breakfast with mashed avocado and feta. Being able to pick & choose a bit more at this stage is great, as we have more options. As long as it doesn't have any sugar in it, you can eat it.I've curbed my mid-afternoon cravings this week with cheese (mature cheddar) and a treat from Starbucks mid-week: they now have coconut milk, so I had a steamed, cinnamon & nutmeg topped, medium cup. I'm not confident that the sugar content of it fell into the accepted range (0-4g/100g), but it wasn't dairy and it was darn tasty! And, as I said last week, my sugar intake has dropped massively, almost 100%, so I'm content enough to be 'naughty' on the rare occasion.In two weeks time we will be reintroducing sweetners into our diets in the form of berries and rice malt syrup (in very limited amounts). The intent is that our tastebuds will have calibrated to the point that even minimal amounts of the sweet stuff (whatever it is) will feel like more than enough and we'll be able to limit our intake. Right now, all I can think of is strawberries...not chocolate, not cake (I know...), not bananas or kiwis or apples or cookies or pie. Strawberries. Can't wait to put them back into my breakfast oats!I'm feeling much better this week too. What have I noticed this week?1) Much more 'regular' (it was 'gut week' this week, so a lot of the food was for bringing back good gut culture...and stuff), although I used a natural product to help that along a bit initially2) Because of the above, lighter, 'cleaner', less bloated (the end of last week was wretched), even though I'm only down about 3lbs overall3) Sticking to programme (98.5%) and not feeling the urge to have sweet stuff (win!)4) Have some definite keeper recipes: detox broccoli soup, the veggie loaf mentioned above, a biryani, halloumi everything, and kedgeree amongst others5) Enjoying some new foods, flavours and tastes6) Staying positive and focused7) Heightened sense of smell. I was on the station platform after work the other day and I smelled chocolate brownies. You know that sweet, sugary smell they have when they're baking? It smelled wonderful and awful at the same time, but three weeks ago I may well have gone in to buy a cookie or whatever it was that was baking. But there was Â no salivating, there was no urge, there were no tingling tastebuds - there was nothing! Not even 'OMG that smells so good!'Apart from a slight metallic taste in my mouth on occasion, there haven't really been any negatives apart from my boss saying he thought the programme sounded awful (but I haven't regaled him with details - yet!). One of my work colleagues has even borrowed the cookbooks because she's that curious about it!Cravings still hit mid-afternoon, but a piece of cheese generally takes care of them.I'm going to collate all the recipes and menu plans into a binder so I can keep them to refer to. It's not that I can't make menu plans, it's that I don't want to. Having someone make a list of exactly what I need and how much of it is terrific. I'm finding there are a few things I'm not using (the salad bits) so will not bother with those from now on as I've just thrown another package away today.Â I'm food shopping to the tune of about Â£60 per week - just for me! To be fair, I have done a couple of 'over shops' the past couple of weeks so that in case I'm unorganised or notÂ motivated to make a meal from the plan, I can at least have sugar-free options on hand or make more than the recipe calls for. Anyway, it's a lot of money, so if I'm going to be continuing this I'll have to find ways to shave the costs, although I've upped my grocery budget again to accommodate, starting next week.In other news, my Working Tax Credit continues, which I'm thrilled about (I get a bit of money from the gov't every month as I make under a certain amount). I had some paperwork at the beginning of the month querying the legitimacy of my claim, so I had to send a letter explaining my living situation (I can't claim if I co-habit with someone in a more official capacity than I currently do), send along some bank statements and my mobile phone bills, and wait. I hadn't heard a peep, but when I checked my bank account yesterday, there it was - a very nice surprise! I'm not sure if I have to re-apply after April 5 (tax deadline), but I imagine a quick phone call will answer any questions I may have. I should still qualify, as I had a long break last year and don't think I earned the minimum qualifying amount (just shy of Â£16k).This continuing amount will ensure that I a) get to Ireland and, b) decrease my debt at home. Ideally I'd like that below $10k by the end of the year, but I'll be throwing half of any monthly snowflakes at it. I'm already thinking about what I may be able to do if it gets low enough by the end of the year.I've already bought my March treat - more books - and added funds to both my travel and my debt accounts (thanks, tax credit!), but payday is Monday and I'll add aÂ bit more. I've got everything down to pretty much the last penny this month, so I hope to stick to it. It helps that I'm not going to the coffee shop at the moment, but the car still needs the doors fixed, so I'll arrange that for the end of March, before my mum arrives.Anyway, it's dinner time here and I'm going to make some pasta with a little pesto and some green veg (I've got broccoli & asparagus hanging around).Have a great weekend!!"},
{"title": "Treats!...and their cost...", "date": "Tuesday 23 February 2016", "text": "No, not like that, although it does look quite delish.I just checked my bank account and had a bit of a shock as I'm down to Â£2.20 from almost Â£100 at the weekend. Where's it gone?!Â£61.77 for groceries (free delivery!). I got almost Â£100 of food for that price: I had a Â£20 off coupon for a first-time purchase discount, plus I saved Â£15.21 by getting specials or deals on some of the items. I'm okay with that!Winchester on Saturday. Â£8.40 for return train fare, Â£7.20 for lunch. The rest of my spends were in cash (which I've made note of).Today? I bought two Groupon experiences: the first one is a cupcake decorating class! I'll have to arrange for a weekend for that, probably some time after my mum goes home in April. Very fun at Â£14 for 2 hours.The second one is a half-day falconry experience! I love raptors and this gives you an opportunity to actually work with them for a few hours: hawks, owls, etc. Fab! I got a Â£10 coupon from Groupon so I bought this for Â£16 instead of Â£26. I have to use this up by April 11, so will have to take some time during my holidays in Mar/April to do this becauseÂ it's only availableÂ Mon-Fri.But the lack of funds (apart from someÂ Â£32 I have at home)Â meansÂ I'll have a very tiny shop on the weekend and won't be able to go to Chichester to meet up with a few of the ladies doing this programme with me. I'm annoyed by this, but it's entirely my own fault. I do have some money in savings, but I don't really want to start shuffling it about for non-essentials, particularly, as I say, because I wasn't paying attention. I get paid next Monday, but that'sÂ too late for the meet-up, sadly.It's because I'm bored at work today. Have also searched for bread making courses and cooking classes among other things.But at least I haven't had (much) sugar! Had some nut butter on rice cakes for a snack. 5.6g/100 of sugar, but as that's this WEEK, and as I've saidÂ before, I'm not particularly concerned. :)"},
{"title": "No sugar - Week Two over!", "date": "Sunday 21 February 2016", "text": "Yup. That's me right now. Two weeks in and I'm feeling EXACTLY the same as I was before I started the programme.Â That's right - despte the wagonloads of veggies entering into my diet, I feel like I've taken 4 steps backwards this week. I know I'm not the only one - the forums and FB pages are aflutter with some participants not enjoying their weekly menues and deciding to go 'off programme' a bit. And some people are trying to find sugar-free replacements for sweet stuff despite the admonition of NO sweeteners (fruit infused, stevia, chemical sweeteners, etc) for the next three weeks.Last week I felt 'cleaner' and 'lighter' and like I was making progress. I'm not particularly jazzed about this week's menu although I will make some of it for sure. Part of the problem is that I made an online grocery order yesterday and thought it was coming this morning. It turns out that it was scheduled for TOMORROW morning, so I got up early for nothing and have had to scramble a bit for meals for the first couple of days this week, as I'm missing the majority of the food.Ah well. I have sausages defrosting and plenty ofÂ veggies that'll work for tonight and still be perfectly acceptable for programme fare for the moment (thanks to my meaty overshop last weekend!).But what's really got me the most frustrated is that I'm wondering if I'm gluten sensitive. Lots of rice and veggie bread this week and I've not been at all regular (ahem) and Wed-Fri I was feeling more bloated than usual. My calves felt like they were going to pop! During Week 1 I was actually feeling GOOD and this week I have stopped, despite not going off programme once (except for dinner last night - on programme except no veggies), and it means I'm 98.5% following the programme. A bit of sugar in a couple of the ingredients isn't concerning to me as it's so little and so infrequent over the week it's hardly worth a mention.Â That in itself is a huge success, I have to admit. And two weeks is generally about my limit for any changes, so I think this is part of the process as we head into Week 3 tomorrow -that's it's a permanent change, not just short-term or temporary. I'm not enjoying the cooking and prepping, although I am glad to have the food ready for during the week when I need it so it's a real challenge to get motivated most days.My other cousin (my cousin's sister) and her two boys were here for a couple of days last week and it was really good to see them. They're lovely kids - funny, smart, fun, and I particularly like that they like what they like and are fully supported in it. My mother was terrifically unsupportive & critical of most things that we wanted to do, thought about doing, were doing, enjoyed doing, tried to enjoy doing, etc. so I'm always impressed when parents just let their kids be and support them in whatever they enjoy. The boys are creative and artistic and love drama, acting, media, etc. and went to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang while they were here. They love musicals.The food in the house, though, was atrocious. I felt torn - half of me was enraged at the shit they were eating, the other half just wanted to attack and down a box of Cocoa Pops. I resisted doing anything about either, you'll be pleased to know, but if nothing else, this programme is showing me how much the food industry manipulates us into eating what it churns out in factories and into believing that added vitamins are healthy in sugar-laden cereals and low-fat crap. If nothing else, it is absolutely encouraging me to choose my food better.Week 3 has some repeats from week 2, breakfast-wise, but has some broccoli detox soup in it that looks quite good, but feeling unmotivated mostly because a) I get home after 6pm most days and it takes me ages to organise my meals and, b) I'm not sure what my cousin's going to be eating again this week. She starts working from home this week, so unsure what that will do for her food wise. Again, I only shopped for me and am already almost over my monthly food budget. Good thing I get paid on the 29th! I'm going to have to boost the food budget for March again at this rate.Â This week's successes:1) No caving into cravings! I've had cheese mid-afternoon when the cravings strike and that has worked beautifully2) Having enough to eat every day - and sometimes feeling full through dinner from lunch!3) Encouraging & encouragement in the forums & FB pages4) Still drinking tea without sugar but down to only about 2 cups a day because of it!5) Sticking with the programme - I'm saying 98.5% because of the small amounts of sugar in a couple of the ingredients I've used.Needs work:1) drinking water (needs to increase a lot)!2) playing with food that may contain gluten and seeing if I can repalce them with non-gluten items to see if that helps me feel better3) Bloating remedyOnwards to Week 3!"},
{"title": "Week One - No Sugar Programme", "date": "Sunday 14 February 2016", "text": "This pretty much sums it up! :)I had some nervousness last week (okay, fear!) heading into this marathon as to whether or not I could actually do it. What the heck was I thinking, giving up my favourite food? For one, I don't cook (don't enjoy the fussiness of it), I'm fairly fussy about what I eat (green = veggie, right?!) and then there's all that cleaning up of dishes, pots, pans, etc. Which is worse than the actual cooking part.And then there are all those withdrawal symptoms that are supposed to knock you for six as you come off the sweet stuff: headaches, exhaustion, cravings, etc. Who wants that?But...BUT...!This week was cutting down/out sugar, so we can go a bit more gently into this week. We were still allowed some fruit, a sweetner in coffee or tea, that sort of thing. I did okay with this and probably have had (including today) just over a dozen tsps of sugar all week! Considering I can double or triple that amount on a regular day with just one cookie, that's incredible progress in a very short period of time.While I can't admit to loving the prepping & cooking part of it, I can absolutely appreciate how all the hard work on Sunday makes a difference to how the rest of the week pans out. It's all measured out and set up to make the week as easy as possible. So there's some fussing that happens on Sunday (chopping, measuring, baking, blending, pureeing, etc.), but it means consistent, tasty, well-balanced, veggie-heavy food for every meal of the day. It means I'm less hungry as I fill up three times a day instead of grazing and choosing quick, sugary snacks to get me through that 3 pm slump. Lots of protein, fats, and veggies to ensure you're filled right up and don't need to eat between meals.If you do feel hungry, however, there's a list of approved snacks (nuts, nut butter & celery sticks, carrots & hummous, that sort of thing). I've only snacked twice this week! :)Drink lots of water to keep everything moving and stay hydrated (working on this).The meals are easy to prepare and delicious (for the most part - I had a pizza crust disaster the other night, but lesson learned! Coconut flour is 'vampiric' so you need lots of liquid and it's a bit sweet for pizza dough. Next attempt I'll be using what I know). I'm personally finding the portions a bit big, so am adjusting as necessary, but chatter on the Forums shows I'm in a minority and most people are finding them too small!The week started off badly with a hot flash Sunday night, keeping me up past midnight (fun!) and my period arriving AGAIN on Monday. I felt utterly wretched Monday and Tuesday: bloated, headachy, frustrated, achy, tired, and wiped out. I took some Paracetemol on Monday and felt mildly better on Tuesday, but by Wednesday things were going a bit better fortunately.It's early days yet, so the differences I'm feeling are small, but they're definitely there and I hope it's just the start.1) Â I'm noticeaby less bloated and my legs less tingly.2) Â I'm eating less over the course of the day and taking more time eating my meals (being more conscious).3) Â I feel 'lighter' (cleaner) although I think I've only lost about a pound, if anything. My clothes are not fitting much differently, but I feel different.4) Â Feeling much less achy around my neck & shoulder area.5) Â Regular and frequent...elmination! ;)6) Â Sleeping soundly and waking up feeling more alert.Possible withdrawal symptoms (some may seem a bit contrary to the above):1) Â Some sneezing & sniffling.2) Â Mild headaches on Mon & Tues.3) Â Less tolerance for some things (Friday I came home from work feeling ridiculously frustrated).4) Â Feeling a bit slow & sluggish.5) Â Mild cravings mid-afternoon, but not nearly as bad as I was anticipating.I'm still taking my iron supplement and I'm not sure how much of this can be attributed to that. I feel as though I could easily have more without issue, but of course that's not up to me. One more week of 400mg daily and then I can go down to 200mg daily. It will be interesting to see how I feel once that starts. I'm still struggling to catch my breath on occasion, but it's less than it was, so it appears that it is working, if slowly.Week 2 starts tomorrow and it's a lovely looking (sugar & sweetner-free!) menu plan this week: halloumi, lamb (which I don't eat so have replaced with pork), prawns, and ham and pea soup amongst others. The plan that I'm on is very meat-heavy, which is fine, but even I'm finding it a bit much (processed meats which are processed with sugar and loads of sodium = bloating). Regardless, it lays out what's for dinner and lunch and breakfast every day and it's SO nice to have it all planned out for me and not have to worry about food on a daily basis. I did a big shop yesterday and got loads of nice things and then got annoyed because my cousin ate my new halloumi (I have another pkg) for her lunch. I had specifically asked before I went out if she wanted to join me this week because I need to know how much stuff to get. I need to account for one person or two. Her sister and nephews are coming down on Wednesday for several days, too. She said she might go shopping for that today (but hasn't) or Monday or Tuesday...so does this mean I'm making enough for two for one night? Two nights? Three nights? I've certainly not got enough for 5 people (or 10, because...teenage boys). Anyway, it pissed me off because I bought this stuff specifically for my programme and she's chosen not to join me (but kind of, although not really...sort of...a bit...but not for every meal...sometimes) but is eating it anyway.I've let it go (honest!), but will be asking for replacements if it happens again. I'm happy to share if I have enough stuff, but at least ask first. /ventBut there's a stack of dishes calling my name and I've been procrastinating about doing them.Wish me luck for Week 2!!PS: my food warmer? Best. Thing. Ever. I've used it every day and it's brilliant. You need to get one."},
{"title": "Day 1 - prepping for the week :O", "date": "Sunday 7 February 2016", "text": "I guess that's the seasonal baby I bought yesterday. ;)I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed as I'm not drawn to cooking (although I sure can EAT - just ask Jane). But the recipes for this programme are straightforward and simple, which is great and I suppose the prepping and organisation is 50% of it. That way 30-minute meals actually do take 30 mins instead of the (seemingly) hours-long process they can turn into.Â I'm counting today as the official Day One. We got our week's info and details on Thursday, but really the only thing we had to do prior to today was shop, so I haven't done anything differently.Today we're doing a little prep work for the week: quinoa, a mince and a squash & sweet potato puree. I've done the quinoa and am just trying to motivate myself to move onto the next ones - the mince and baking (before pureeing) the veggies.One of the ladies in the UK Crew has set up an FB group for us and it's neat to see so many people (I think there are two men) from all over the world joining the main forums: Canada, USA, UK, Australia & New Zealand, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and Austria are represented, among others. Everyone seems excited, trepedatious and motivated for their own reasons (most of them health-related) to do this. There are also nutritionists, personal trainers and yoga instructors, doctors, naturopaths, dietiticians, etc. on board to help us, as well as the experienced IQS-ers and the Ambassadors, who are there to advise, guide and support.I'm not really sure how I'm feeling (apart from a little overwhelmed by all things kitchen, as I said above). I suppose a bit uncertain what to expect with regard to withdrawal symptoms (headaches, irritability, fatigue...) and how bad they can be. It depends on your addiction, so I'm anticipating I'm going to be a \"bit\" wretched to live with over the next coulple of weeks.I'm also unsure what to do about tea. I can still have it, just not with sugar. If there's anything I'm addicted to more than sugar, it's tea. It's my Everything. We are still allowed to have it, just not with sugar obviously, which is the problem. I do, however, have a delicious herbal tea that will probably work as a replacement because, quite frankly, if I can't have sugar in my tea, I might as well give it up because I can't drink it without (right now, at least). So. Now I'm adding caffeine withdrawal to the programme.Might as well kick it all at once, right?I'm getting another parcel today (got two books yesterday). I am on target with my 'monthly treat' budgeted amount, so this particular purchase came out of my 'misc' budget - which was exceptionally high this month, as I put half the deposit on the holiday bungalow for my mum. Regardless, I have Â£17.07 left in this amount and that's it for me this month. So what did I buy?A spiralizer!I know. I'm weak. But look! \"Courgetti\"!! So weak...It arrives today!! :)I'd best get prepping or I'm going to regret it for the rest of the week!"},
{"title": "It's here! 'Bye sugar! :(", "date": "Saturday 6 February 2016", "text": "photo cred: iquitsugar.comOur first email arrived on Thursday. It includes a comprehensive (and very specific) shopping list, a fabulous looking meal plan, exercise tips, and a long list of snacks that can be eaten between meals if you're feeling really hungy. The cook-up and portioning happens on Sunday and there are notes to help you work out how your daily meals are organised and set up.During the first week we're still allowed a little sweetness, which is why fruit is on the list.I was really thrilled to realise that I had a large number of items already in the cupboards and pantry, so I had only fresh things to buy - veggies, meat, dairy, etc.I wandered around the (relatively empty) grocery store and was very pleased to note that the prices were lower than usual on a lot of things and that the produce department in particular had been re-organized. It looked great, although it still frustrates me beyond reason that SO much stuff is packaged in plastic containers and it's hard to root through things for single items. Depending on what you want, you either end up with a huge amount for relative pennies or, like strawberries for example, you get about 8 for a stupid price.Anyhoo, I (mostly) stuck to the list and wound up spending Â£60.58, which was still more than I was anticipating, but I think that comes down to the meat, really, although I feel I got a pretty good price on what I bought. As well, pantry items won't be bought every time: containers of spices and mustard, for example.Meat: Â£17.27364g beef mince Â£2.91370g pork loin Â£2.45128g bacon Â£1.15 (2 pieces)322g haddock Â£3.85.985kg pork loin joint Â£3.946 Sausages (pkg) Â£2.97Produce: Â£19.791/2 white cabbage Â£.473 x sweet potatoes (1.265kg @ Â£1.25/kg) Â£1.58pkg wild rocket Â£.823 x white onions (0.350kg @ Â£0.75/kg) Â£0.262 x broccoli Â£0.76 (Â£0.38p each)large avocado Â£1.352 x butternut squash (medium?)

I have some for next week now, as apparently I only need one this week!3 lemons Â£0.63 - need only 2 for recipes, but also need some for my water during the day so bought extra.Items with sugar (or fructose): korma paste, strawberries & curry paste. But as this is week one, we're allowed a little sweetness. It's NEXT week that we cut it out for four solid weeks. Tricky stuff that sugar.I hope I don't end up like this (at least, not for too long):The 'Sugar Free Farm' celebs (week 2 of 3) seem to be doing a bit better, although one fellow threw a tantrum because he \"didn't sign up just to eat vegetables.\" WHERE'S THE MEAT!? He denied it was a withdrawal symptom, but his kitchen co-celeb realised that it was. She forgave him his outburst, but was ready to throat punch him the next day after he and another fellow ate half a loaf of sugar-free bread she'd bought for everyone. She was really angry and he was barely apologetic.I'm confident I'll spend less next week (part of next week's shop was bought today - the pork joint), as a good portion of 'other' is stuff that will carry over.Â Overall, very pleased with what I got. The grocery store had lowered prices on loads of things - plenty in the produce section, fortunately - which was great to see.I adjusted my grocery budget UP Â£60 a month to accommodate this programme, so I hope it'll be enough. I won't be buying tea this month, so that'll save me Â£40, which I can either roll over into groceries or savings. Not buying things at the shop on the way to work (for lunches or whatever) will also help. I've spent my food budget for this week.I then bought gas (sorry, petrol). It's Â£0.999 per litre at the grocery store, which is the lowest in the area. I imagine it'll go back up as we creep towards summer, but hopefully not too much. So a full tank of petrol (35.94L) cost me Â£35.90 today, saving me Â£4.10 on my petrol budget! Fab! That should last me just over 2 months, assuming I'm just driving back and forth to the station and don't decide to take a trip to Scotland somewhere in there (unlikely).The change went directly into my coin bank. My snowflake jar sits at at nice Â£63.85 and I have over Â£140 in my bank account. That might not seem like much, but I'm usually down atthe very bottom, so I'm actually really pleased and hope I can continue. Plus, keeping a reasonable amount in the account should also help with my credit building. The bank doesn't like to see you at your limit every single month.Otherwise, the Irish trip continues to bloom. Jane and I have booked our accommodation in Galway and Cork and are working out transportation and food budgets. She has also booked her flight, but I'm still searching for mine. The hike itself (plus 2-3 nights in Dublin before hand) I will look into at the end of February. All costs in the Republic are in Euros, which makes it a bit cheaper for both of us. I can't believe I'm FINALLY going to Ireland!!!! Beyond excited!!I've been taking my iron supplements as directed for a week now and I am feeling better. I'm sleeping extremely well (!) and feel a bit more switched on this week, which is great. I know I have a ways to go yet, but I canÂ notice a difference, so it is working, and I'm pleased."},
{"title": "Roll on, February!", "date": "Saturday 30 January 2016", "text": "Is it just me or do we seem to have lost a ridiculous number of People this month: Lemmy, David Bowie, Joe Cocker, Alan Rickman, Glen Frey, Dan Haggerty, Abe Vigoda, and Rene Angelil amongst them. Many, many others - a quick search showed me almost 150 since the end of December 2015! Not to mention so many others that don't make these sorts of lists, the average, the ordinary, the everyday.January has been that kind of month, apparently.This week I was feeling more 'off' than usual, making some silly mistakes at work, and feeling utterly exhausted even after nights of solid sleep. I'm glad my iron tablets arrived yesterday! I hope they do the trick and I'll be feeling better in a few days. It's not that I feel horrendous (I wouldn't have gone to the doctor if I hadn't wanted to do an exercise programme), but I know that once my iron levels are back to where they should be, I will feel fantastic compared to how I feel right now. I mostly just feel drained and very fatigued.However, my period seems to have FINALLY stopped - pretty much 4 months to the day it started - so that will help immensely. I start my no sugar programme on Thursday, and that will help even more. I'd like to say I'm going to start the exercise programme in February, but I'm not sure that's wise until my breathing regulates - right now, walking up small hills and into a strong wind leaves me gasping, so extended, vigourous exercise seems foolish.My work colleague is doing VERY well with the diet progamme she started at the beginning of the month and is down 4lbs since the beginning of the month! She's pleased, but is a bit frustrated that it's not more and that she was up 1/2lb two weeks ago. I told her to just keep this in mind:My new programme starts on Thursday and I'm really looking forward to it! There's a programme on TV at the moment called \"Sugar Free Farm\" which takes 6 celebrities (British ones, and I'm only vaguely familiar with one of them) and puts them on a farm in Hampshire for two weeks with NO SUGAR: no fruit, no alcohol, no honey, no sweeteners, no sugar, etc. - nothing that sweetens food in any way.It could be argued that putting them into a situation like this where they have everything at their fingertips should make it a doddle (hee hee - I love that word = easy), but on Day 3, one of the girls needed medical attention (!!). The withdrawal symptoms vary in degree, but seem to consist of headaches, irritability, and exhaustion among others. I think the severity and duration of the symptons depends on the amount of sugar you usually ingest. I'd consider myself pretty hard core.The expert walking them through this is actually one of the experts on the panel for my no sugar programme, and is what prompted my interest in the show. I also have access to a forum to talk about things during the process - there are about half a dozen ladies or so who have done this once or even twice before, so it'll be interesting to pick their brains as we go along.I'm planning to diarise my journey from Day 1 to Day 56 to keep track of how I'm feeling before, during and after the initial 8-weeks. I want to capture the physical, mental, and emotional aspects of this. The programme really focuses on fructose, so the first 4-week block eliminates even fruit! The second month re-introduces it slowly with items like berries, which are very low-sugar, but high in antioxidants.I can't say I'm not nervous, especially after watching the show!It was a mixed bag, money-wise.Rent Â  Â  Â Â Â  Â£450.00  30.9%  Â£450.00   Â£- Â Â  Food Â  Â Â Â  Â£250.00  17.2%  Â£226.28   Â£23.72Mobile Â  Â Â Â  Â£18.00  1.2%  Â£27.00  -Â£9.00Â Petrol Â  Â Â Â  Â£40.00  2.7%  Â£- Â   Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â£40.00Toiletries Â  Â  Â Â£10.00  0.7%  Â£3.71   Â£6.29Medical Â  Â  Â  Â£- Â   Â  Â  Â  Â Â 0.0%  Â£8.44  -Â£8.44Â Eating Out Â Â Â£25.00  1.7%  Â£14.90   Â£10.10Car repairsÂ Â Â£20.00  1.4%  Â£60.60  -Â£40.60Â Car Ins.

Still, that's what tracking is for, n'est ce pas?The mobile phone bill was a bit of a shock and I still can't quite figure out what I did that garnered me the extra cost, but I've just received my new bill and it's back down to just under Â£18, so it's all good.Medical was unexpected, but necessary and it could have been much worse. This was the cost for 200 tablets, which should last me about 6-8 weeks. I'll likely be ordering from the same place when I need more because if I order direct from the business I can save 7.5%. Not much on such a small amount, but every little bit helps. I've added Â£10 to my budget from February for that.Car repairs - I've increased this amount to Â£30 as she's an older car and the driver's side door lock has already gone again, so will need repair sooner rather than later. Again.My treat - not awful, but again, I've increased it to Â£25 a month which is a bit more comfortable.But look at that Miscellaneous line! Â£80 of that is for my no sugar programme, but that's still a ridiculous amount. I've increased the amount there to Â£100, to cover myself.But despite all that, I HAD MONEY LEFT OVER in my envelopes and from a little bit of snowflaking and deposited Â£190 back into my account today!! I did a little bit of envelope tweaking and am beyond thrilled. I split it evenly between my savings accounts.Oh, and Jane and I are going hiking in Ireland this year!And that's about that.Â 'BYE, JANUARY!"},
{"title": "Can you believe it's almost the end of January already?!", "date": "Sunday 24 January 2016", "text": "Here we are, heading into the last week of January. Already! Where does the time go?So what are my finances doing this week? I'm officially marking January down as a 'What NOT To Do' month (ahem) as far as spending goes. I did not do at all well.Â My 'misc' column is ridiculous - well over Â£200 MORE than I'd budgeted. This will be adjusted UP in the coming months, so that I have wiggle room - FAILI've had to add an amount for medical - Â£8.44, which in the grand scheme of things is not much. I'll have to budget this amount for perhaps another 3 months - NEUTRALI'm within my budgeted amount for groceries. Not by a lot, but it's definitely a positive Â - GOODThe month has gone by really quickly! I get paid on Friday and can start my budget fresh. My no sugar programme starts on Feb 4 and I'm really looking forward to it. I've been making a few of the recipes over the past week or so and my cousin enjoys them too, so I'm hoping it's sustainable and that I can encourage her by not beating her over the head with anything, but with visible results instead. She's not at all a fussy eater, so it's easy enough in that respect, particularly if the meals are quick & easy to make. I'm planning on keeping track of the changes I see & feel on a weekly basis. I'll be making notes on everything: physical, mental and emotional.Â The programme has an online forum with people from all over: the majority are from Australia/New Zealand - the programme originates in Australia - but there are a few of us in the UK and the US, too. A few have done the programme before, so will be able to talk us newbies through the withdrawal symptoms (of which there seem to be several and which come on in varying degrees).I had a doctor's appointment two weeks ago and got a bloodwork and chest x-ray referral, so those have been done. I am probably one of the laziest people around, but the past year or so has really seen me gasping for breath at even the lightest sustained activity, so I went to get checked out (ostensibly for this exercise class I want to start next month). I went for a chest x-ray last Tuesday. No word on the results there just yet, but if anything unusual shows up I'm sure I'll get a phone call.The blood panel, however, showed that I'm anaemic. Just how anaemic, I'm not sure as I didn't get numbers, but the doctor said I needed to start taking Ferrous Sulphate 200mg tablets twice a day for three weeks, then once per day for 4 months and that should bring me back to normal. That's a LOT of iron! I don't feel awful (not as awful as I was feeling in London, at least), but I imagine I'll feel better once I start taking it. As this is, in all likelihood, stemming from the onset of pre-menopause (and my months-long periods), the next step is to work on that. I hope that isn't code for HRT, because I'm unlikely to agree to that although I will take advice.Firstly, though, I'd like to get my breath and energy back so that I can do walks and exercise without feeling like I'm going to keel over. There's a 'hill' I walk up every morning on my way to work and by the time I reach the top, it takes me two blocks to recover from the climb.So one thing at a time.My sister and I are currently looking for a holiday let around the New Forest. My mother has decided to visit during the two most expensive holiday weeks of the year (Easter break), yet wants a 'cheap' place to stay with room enough for about 6 people so visitors can come to her, rather than her going to them. A good idea as it means the cousins and their kids can come for a visit, but it's definitely not cheap. My sister did at least manage to dissuade her from making it a surprise for me, as she'll be here over my birthday. Am I looking forward to it? Not particularly. And I'll just leave that there.I'm looking forward to February - a new budget, a new eating plan, perhaps a bit more focus, clarity and energy. And an extra day! :)"},
{"title": "Week in review - how am I doing?", "date": "Saturday 16 January 2016", "text": "Another week gone already - and we arrive in mid-January. The weather has been cold and wet all week, so people have been miserable (that'd be the rain). Woke up to heavy frost yesterday - that I know what to do with: woolies!! It sounds ridiculous, as a Canadian, to constantly whine about how freaking COLD it is here, but it's true. A +2C day, if it's raining, can feel much, much colder - it's that damp. It goes right through you. I've spent several days at work this week just unable to get warm, huddling in front of my oil heater.I can deal with frost and ice - I'm welcoming it actually, even if the cold - again - goes right through me. The Yukon was so dry that several layers ensured that as long as you kept moving, you'd be sweating in no time. It's a tricky thing dressing for cold, wet weather, never mind the fact that it's hardly motivating to get out into.Ick.But there's rumours of S-N-O-W in Hampshire and Dorset overnight, so fingers crossed. I'm probably the only person in the entire country to be happy about that, but so be it. I can get bundled up and go for a walk. I hope to see the New Forest under snow, but it is unlikely.Anyway, what are my finances looking like?I did a grocery shop today which cost me Â£73.46. 90% was veggies.Â Meat: roast chicken, 2 x salmon, pork chops: Â£11.02Non-essentials (cider x 1): Â£1.65Veggies: a bazillion greens, cauliflower, lettuce, cucumbers (x 2), avocadoes (x 4) and various other bits: Â£30.34Fruit: lemons, limes, berries (various), 1 x grapefruit, 1 x granny smith apple: Â£13.87Dairy: 4 x greek yogurt, 3.23L milk: Â£5.30Other: rice, coconut milk, cat food: Â£11.28Very pleased with the result as I'm hoping that will take me over more than a week's worth of meals. Some of the cost in the 'veggies' section is actually herbs & spices (bottled). Like the rice, they're items that will stick around for quite a while.I printed off a bunch of recipes from my no sugar programme and thought I could get started a bit early. Sure can't hurt! The recipes are truly delicious, too, and quite simple and straightforward, which is even better. I've decided that I'm not going to stress out about finding the exact ingredients for these no sugar recipes - it can be time consuming and a pain (never mind expensive) and will substitute as and when needed. I wouldn't buy items I don't like simply because a recipe calls for them, so why spend more than I need to on anything else? It's not the letter of the programme, but I think 98% is better than stressing out about an elusive ingredient or two.I confess I bought my Feb treat(s) early! I got my little food warmer yesterday, along with some cocoa powder and arrowroot powder. I also have another book coming. As I'm not intending to go to the coffee shop while I'm on my no sugar programme, I'm hoping I can stay well within my Â£40 monthly 'misc' budget, possibly rolling some of it over towards debt payments instead. I think that would be wisest thing to do, particularly as the Canadian dollar is so low at the moment. It makes sense to take advantage of it while I can.I had car repairs today: Â£57.20, so not as bad as I was expecting, but still a pain. The auto locks on the driver's side (both doors) weren't opening all the way, so I had to clamber across the passenger seat to open the door. Not a big deal, just annoying. The lock mechanism is old so will, eventually, need full replacement. Those will be Â£70 (incl VAT) each. At least I only need two - so far - and can do them independently of each other if I need to. But fingers crossed I'm good for a while yet.I returned one of the shirts I bought last week, too: +Â£10 and deposited Â£10 in coin, too.While I was in town returning my shirt, I stopped at the library for my book that arrived (The Pale Horseman, No. 2 in the Last Kingdom series). Apparenty it costs .50p to bring in a book from another library branch. This is good to know for future reference. On top of DVD/CD rental costs (Â£2), this is another one I'd like to avoid, as it's possible it could add up. I certainly don't begrudge the library some small charges - god knows they're fighting for every penny they can here, sadly - and in the grand scheme of things, I am happy to pay for a service like that. I'll stick to what I can find at the smaller local branches and in Southampton at the central library.So the weekly spend looks like this:          11-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â   10.00   misc  cash  PAID  Costa  weekly draw for tea   11-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  5.55   savings  cash  TRNSF  savings  tea/muffin NOT bought wk of Jan 3 + Jan 7   11-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  4.75   groceries  cash  PAID  Co-op  soup, 2 x buns, ibuprofen, pain au chocolate   12-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.95   misc  cash  PAID  Costa  tea   12-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.00   misc  cash  PAID  Co-op  2 x chocolate bar   12-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â  31.24   misc  CC  PAID  Amazon  crockpot, arrowroot, cocoa powder, book   12-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  0.60   misc  debit  PAID  FB  game tokens   13-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.95   misc  cash  PAID  Costa  tea   13-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  8.85   groceries  debit  PAID  Sainsbury's  buns x 2, soup, blackberries, bag of cookies, carrots, Kleenex   14-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.95   misc  debit  PAID  Costa  tea   14-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3.29   misc  debit  PAID  FB  game tokens   15-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.70   groceries  cash  PAID  Sainsbury's  1 x bun, 2 x pain au chocolat   15-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.95   misc  cash  PAID  Costa  tea   15-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.50   savings  tnsf  PAID  Barclay's  covering cost of muffin   15-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  5.32   groceries  debit  PAID  Ethical groceries  truvia (for Jan, got cash)   16-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â  73.46   groceries  cash  PAID  Morrisons  veggies for week's detox   16-Jan  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â  57.20   car repairs  debit  PAID  Cadnam garage  auto locks And the totals look like this:          Rent/Mortgage  Â Â£Â 450.00   30.9%  Â Â£Â  450.00   Â Â£Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â -Â Â       Utilities  Â Â£Â  Â -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -Â Â    Â    Groceries  Â Â£Â  250.00   17.2%  Â Â£Â  188.13   Â Â£Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â 61.87   Internet  Â Â£Â  Â -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â -Â Â    Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -Â Â    Â    Mobile  Â Â£Â  Â Â 18.00   1.2%  Â Â£ Â  27.00   -Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  9.00      Petrol  Â Â£Â  Â Â 40.00   2.7%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 40.00      Toiletries  Â Â£Â  Â  10.00   0.7%  Â Â£ Â  Â  3.71   Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 6.29      Medical  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -Â Â    Â    Home  Maint./Stuff  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -Â Â    Â    Laundry  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -Â Â    Â    Eating Out  Â Â£Â  Â Â 25.00   1.7%  Â Â£ Â  14.90   Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  10.10      Car repairs  Â Â£Â  Â Â 20.00   1.4%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   20.00      Car Insurance  Â Â£Â  Â Â 27.43   1.9%  Â Â£ Â  27.43   Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  - Â    Cat Protection  Â Â£Â  Â Â 10.00   0.7%  Â Â£ Â  10.00   Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  - Â    Car Tax  Â Â£Â  Â Â 12.68   0.9%  Â Â£ Â  12.68   Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  - Â    Train Pass  Â Â£Â  Â Â 72.20   5.0%  Â Â£ Â  72.20   Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  -Â Â    Â    Chinese  doctor  Â Â£Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  -Â Â    Â    Naturopath  Â Â£Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  -Â Â    Â    Monthly Treat  Â Â£Â  Â Â 20.00   1.4%  Â Â£ Â  24.96   -Â£4.96     [Insert Name]  Â Â£Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -Â Â    Â    Miscellaneous  Â Â£Â  Â Â 40.00   2.7%  Â Â£ Â 196.41   -Â£156.41     LLP  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -Â Â    Â    Credit Card  Debt  Â Â£Â Â 411.26   28.2%  Â Â£ Â 100.00   Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   311.26   LOC Debt  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â -Â Â    Â    Enter  \"X\" Fund Name  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -Â Â    Â    Savings  Â Â£Â  Â Â 55.00   3.8%  Â Â£ Â  65.35   -Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 10.35      Retirement  Â Â£Â  Â Â 55.00   3.8%  Â Â£ Â  55.00   Â Â£ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - Â    Emergency  Fund  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    0.0%  Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   -Â Â    Â Â£Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -"},

As you can see, overall it's pretty much on track, with even a little extra savings thrown in (Â£3.30, which is actually Â£9.30 with a Â£6 deposit yesterday).However, you can see that my monthly treat budget is slightly over - it will be next month, too, as the mini-crockpot isn't a book (obviously) so the minimum purchase for free shipping from Amazon rises to Â£20 from Â£10. Annoying? Yes, and this means that I will need to amend my budget for next month - perhaps it should be Â£25 a month.But look at the Miscellaneous line - I'm already Â£140 OVER my budget for this month, so this really needs to be looked at. Am I not being flexible enough with this? Let's do a check and find out, shall we?Yesterday I went to town and deposited Â£6 into my savings account (coins) and then took out Â£10 for my weekly coffee. On track so far (the Â£40 'misc' budget is for my weekly teas), but then I decided I needed to look for some more pants for work. I ended up in a shop up the lane but didn't buy pants (wretched selection) - I bought two shirts instead for Â£16. I was okay with this as I had got rid of about 3 shirts I didn't like or wear in a bag I'd just dropped at one of the charity shops. These are for work, although I didn't technically need new shirts, but I kind of of did. One of these might get returned next weekend - I'm not sure I like it as much as I thought I might.I went to the library next and found 3 books (to borrow, not buy!) that looked good and were also workable for my reading challenge. I put 'The Pale Horseman' on hold, too. It's book 2 in The Last Kingdom series, so am looking forward to that arriving.Finally, I went grocery shopping and spent Â£14.33 on eggs, bread, 3 x ciders, milk, cinnamon buns, 2 x hummous, sugar cubes and a reusable bag. How much of that is unnecessary? Over half: Â£7.65 - the ciders, cinnamon buns and the reusable bag (only because I thought I had one in the car and didn't want regular plastic ones - note to self: put bag in car!).Â Today my cousin and I went to pretty Romsey to go grocery shopping for the week (for the both of us). I also wanted to look for a new pair of work pants. I didn't realise Romsey is basically closed on Sundays. There were a few places open, though.Â We went to a coffee shop and I bought us lunch: Â£12.95 for two sandwiches, a coffee, a tea and a piece of lemon cake. Next stop was WH Smith for no other reason than 'why not?' I was thinking of my 2016 book challenge when I went in. One of the categories is 'first book you see in a bookstore'. I cheated a bit here, as technically the first book I saw on the endcap was one by James Patterson or someone like that, so I shifted my gaze upwards a bit and found something that looked more interesting. Here is where I fall down. Bookstores are my drug, I admit it. I bought 3 books and some Christmas cards for next year (which I've been looking for). I spent Â£19.98 on the following:Christmas cards: Â£.99 (30 cards, so a very good price)\" The Version of Us\" by Laura Barnett\"Our Endless Numbered Days\" by Claire Fuller(these two were buy one, get one for Â£1)\"Amelia Freer: Cook. Nourish. Glow.\" A hard cover cookbook that I can use on the no sugar programme, half-price at Â£10.Needed? None of it.I did find a pair of new pants for Â£20 as well - they fit really well and will work with my new shirts too (black jeans), so I'm pleased. Again, not technically needed, but the pants I currently wear almost daily do need a break and, because I'm eating lots of stuff that isn't good for me, are fitting more snugly than is comfortable...ahem...Fat Face was next and I bought yet another shirt - again, not needed, but is work appropriate: Â£15 (on sale).Groceries were next and my cousin and I spent a squeak over Â£40 between us, so at least I'm doing well with the grocery budget! She put it on her card and I gave her Â£20 cash.Still, a very spendy day: Â£87.93. Yikes!I'm not going to beat myself up about it though - that doesn't solve anything. I'm just going to be very, very careful for the next three weeks. I have 19 days until payday, so if I can manage two no spend days a week until then, I will be happy with that at this point. I don't generally buy a lot of clothes either, so changing a few things in my wardrobe is okay, considering I get rid of stuff on a fairly regular basis.I will do better next week. :) That's what tracking is supposed to do - make you aware of where you fall down, so you can be aware of your spending habits."},
{"title": "Looking ahead to my February treat!", "date": "Friday 8 January 2016", "text": "Food is my February treat?Not really, although I AM looking forward to starting my no sugar programme in February. I've had far, far, FAR too much sugar this week and am feeling very 'blah' at the moment.No, what I found on my FB feed this morning was this:This is designedÂ as a food warmer for one person, rather than an actual slow cooker - perfect to take to the office to (re)heat your food, ready forÂ lunchtime. I'm not a fan of thermoses and not really of microwaves either, so this is the perfect solution and less than Â£20 on Amazon.I do love a hot lunch and this canÂ stay at the office.With the recipes in the no sugar programme, this will be perfect! :)"},
{"title": "Fantastic!!", "date": "Thursday 7 January 2016", "text": "I am very, very impressed with the money transfer service I chose for sending my money back to Canada.It's already been deposited!! That took, what? 2 or 3Â days? Absolutely fantastic.If anyone's wondering, I chose this one: TransferWise. Brilliant. Part of the reason I chose it is because Sir Richard Branson (he of the Virgin empire) has investedÂ in it. I like Sir Richard - although I can't honestly say I know much about him or why exactly I have this \"I  [heart] Richard Branson\" mind-set - so I thought, \"That's the one for me.\"I willÂ be using it from now on. For what I need it for, it's perfect - simply transferring money from one account to another as and when/if needed for very little cost. Once you're set up, you just need to transfer money to them and they take care of the rest.I now have enough money to pay down some nagging numbers for about 3-6 months, depending on how hard I want to hit the debt. I'd like to hit it harder than is realistic at this point, to be honest, but this will take a huge weight off my shoulders and that's something in itself.I love it when something as simple as this can make life that much better!"},
{"title": "Here we go - 2016!", "date": "Tuesday 5 January 2016", "text": "Here we are, another corner turned and into another year full of promise. That's what's so great about them - there's always something to look forward to! :)New Year itself was very quiet. My cousin gets back today sometime,Â so I spent it by myself although I had an invitation from a neighbour to join them if I were so inclined.What I did instead was some tarot card readings. I did a couple for me and one for my sister, which turned out well. I re-did one of mine the next day as I didn't feel quite 'on' when I was doing it the first time and was much happier with the result. I'm not sure if that'sÂ cheating, but there we are. :)I spent loads of time over the holidays going over and over my budget andÂ it's looking good. ObviouslyÂ there will be tweaking here and there if things don't quite work out as I have it set, but I'm okay with that. It's got to be a bit flexible or what's the point? This month I'veÂ allotted and set aside a monthly amount for groceries, but think I will go back to weekly envelopes starting in February - the way Gail says to do it.I have already, for example, gone over my allotted monthly treat amount of Â£20. I bought two books on Amazon and the total came to Â£24.69. The premise behind the books, however, is to work on something fun and writing oriented that might (!) make me a bit of money on the side. We shall see, we shall see.I've alsoÂ organised how I'm going to pay the debt I still have. I've found a money transfer site that has excellent reviews, I've asked a few questions and setÂ up an account. Banks charge ridiculous fees for this kind of thing, it's not wise or safe to put money in the mail (although I have done it the past - better safe than sorry), and this seems to be a safe and direct way of doing things for very little fees (Â£3.23 on my first transferÂ to be exact). I'm not sure what the other end looks like as it's my first time using it, but if all goes well, thenÂ I've found a way to send regular payments. The rate, while still excellent at the moment, fluctuates constantly, but once you've got yourself set up you can keep an eye on things and see what you can do. In the couple of hours since I registered, for example, the exchange has sunk from 2.0440 to 2.04226 and is now up to 2.0460!Â The rate you 'lock in' at is valid for 24-hours, so by the time my details are confirmed,Â I'll likely have a different rate, which is fine. It's stillÂ over twice what I'm sending from this end.If I canÂ send Â£200-Â£300 per month, I should be able to bring my debt downÂ substantially by the end of the year. My outside goal is to reach $10k, but I'd be thrilledÂ withÂ $11k.Â I'd like to aim for $1k into my RSP (to go towards my LLP),Â clearing my MasterCard and making a big dent in the LOC; both of these have beenÂ hard hit this year. As well, if I'm not able to manage it on a monthly basis, I still have enough goingÂ this first time round to cover me forÂ severalÂ months while I save upÂ to send more. So a win either way!I have to remember, of course, that I still have bills to pay here. My UK credit card has aÂ Â£500 limitÂ and I've set up a direct payment of Â£100 per month to pay it down after using it to buy supplies for myÂ (now-abandoned) no sugar eating plan. Some of those supplies have since been returned, but the card will be clear by May.As I mentioned above, I abandoned my no sugar plan for the time being, butÂ there's an online program startingÂ February 4 and I've joined that for some structure and guidance. I'llÂ use what I can andÂ modifyÂ - it simply costs too much to get specific stuff. It cost me Â£80 for an 8-week program (just gone up, apparently), but the background work is done for me: meal plans, shopping lists, etc.Â That will make it easy to budget for.Â This isÂ something I *need* to do, regardless of whether my cousin joins me or not.I called my doctor's surgery yesterday to see if I could get an appointmentÂ (two weeks seems to be a standard wait time). Once IÂ got through to the office, I was, surprisingly,Â given a choice of 9:00 a.m.Â or 7:10 p.m. today, so I took the evening appointment. IÂ want to ask for a blood test (to get a baseline for a few things that will hopefully change for the better whilst on the no sugar programme) and have aÂ check up to make sure that I'm fit enoughÂ to take an exercise classÂ close toÂ home. It's called \"Boogie Bounce\" and utilises those mini-trampolines for 40-minute cardio sessions. While it runs 4 times a week, I'll only be able to make it once a week as I don't get home untilÂ just before most of the classes start.Â It's Â£5 per session, and I'll have to budget for that now, so will consider this one of my February goals.Another plan this month is to visit the local library, check out the selection of books (DVDs costÂ Â£2 each to borrow, so it's not really worth it) and see if they have a meeting room that is useable by the general public and get some details about it if they do. I've been looking for a writing group to join since I've been here and have approached several, hoping that one would be a good fit. One that I liked met mid-afternoon, one I thought was nearby in the Forest but turned out to be almost an hour's drive away, and although it's technically not far, I don't really want to come back into Southampton after I'm finished work. So I thought I would try to start my own group and a notice at the library seems like the best place to do it. I've never done one before, but want to start fairly small and try to figure out what we DO at a writing group (do we write or just review our writing? Do we have speakers or opt not to? How many can we work with? Do we charge a modest fee or meet at someone's house so we don't have to?). We'll see how it goes.Anyway, that's about it so far. January could turn out to be quite interesting actually. We'll see how things go!"},

It sure feels like it, but here we are again, at the cusp of another new year already.I'm not sure when 'Resolutions' became 'Goals' - it's a bit of a passive-aggressive cop-out for those of us who aren't as disciplined as others - but I'm all in. I was looking for last year's goals, but couldn't find any! Hahaha! No wonder I was a bit all over the place.Anyway, I'm taking a page out of Sam's book and choosing a word for the year: this word came to me quite clearly several days ago, so that's what it is. :)And what do I want to experience?good health - mental AND physicalsuccessnew people and placesclarityfocusabundanceI've spent the past couple of days scratching away at a few things that will help me with this. I don't want to overcomplicate things, but without specifics it's hard to reach your goals too. I've broken it down into the following:Without this, there's no point focusing on anything else. I'm putting this as No. 1 this year because I've been feeling unwell all year. There are things I can and need to doÂ better, outside of my hormones running rampant.drink water - 1.5L per dayeat well - am I NOURISHING my body or just feeding it?exercise - walk, if nothing else. I have an hour for lunch and I have been staying at my desk. Southampton isn't the prettiest city by any stretch of an imagination, but I can still go for a walk.As well as my physical health, I'm going to spend more time focusing on my mental health because that plays a HUGE part in how everything else does or does not work.stay off the electronics (FB & Candy Crush mostly) and away from the TV moreread more - stretch my genres, 2016 Reading Challengecrosswords, colouring, musicbe cautious with my thoughts and actions - be truthful to myself and other; less compromisebe more mindful - how does what I'm doing make me feel?Tying nicely into mental/physical health is \"create\".drawwrite - (to incude emails and/or letters to friends), start or join a writing group, blog more regularlyphotography - do some more workshops and also just get out there and DO it Â :)baking - because it's fun and I love itFinances are important. We need money to do (most) things in our world, but I have a ridiculous relationship with money, falling into the trap that someTHING can fill the space of (the lack of) __________. We return to 'mindfulness' here. How am I spending my money? Is it actually bringing me joy or simply a habit that I no longer think about? I'm thinking here of my daily morning visit to the coffee shop. It started as a habit, but has become a truly enjoyable start to my day - because the staff are fantastic and I genuinely like seeing them - even though, if I'm perfectly honest, the drink isn't that great.So here are my financial goals:4 days a week at the coffee shop - save the extra, weekly Â£2 to put towards something nice at the end of the year. A visit to a European Christmas market, perhaps - Prague? Cologne?save my 'bonus' every month - I get Â£10 for changing a survey enquiry into a 'sale'. My goal each month is Â£100. Haven't reached it yet, and although I'm keeping track, there seems to be some discrepancy.reduce my debt - I've racked it up this year and am currently borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, which helps nothing.a pay risetrack spending - I have a brilliant spreadsheet that I bought from a blogger a few years ago and it's been languishing, unused, pretty much ever since.no spend days/weekslook at what motivates (or de-motivates) me about money"},

{"title": "I Quit Sugar (or have I?)", "date": "Wednesday 9 December 2015", "text": "It's one of my favourite foods and because of this, I've decided I need to cut it out. I eat it in concentrated amounts, daily, and it's become unsustainable and extremely unhealthy.This is the sort of thing that I KNOW isn't healthy for me - sugar is aÂ delicious poison (the amount that I eat, at least - all that processed sugar is in literally EVERYTHING) - and I need to take control andÂ let it go. So, as I think I mentioned in a post or two ago, I'm embarking on a new programme - \"I Quit Sugar\" - that is designed toÂ encourage better, healthier eating, and overall there is nothing wrong with that no matter how you look at it.I had an appointment with a naturopath on Friday morning in the pretty market town of Romsey. She was fun and very knowledgeable and really my intent was to find someone who would do a bit of gentle handholding and be available for advice and suggestions on maintaining my health in as natural a way as possible. I don't dislike or distrust Western medicine obviously, I just don'tÂ believe it actually focuses on the right stuff as much as it needs to, like prevention and maintenance. It's all about pills, surgery, prescriptions, poking and prodding and invasive tactics to fix what's broken, rather than guide you to focus onÂ preventing problems in the first place. Eastern and homeopathic health is, overall, aÂ more gentle and wholistic view of health.Â I'mÂ generalising enormously of course, but the two working together,Â in my opinion, is the best option, as long as you keep talking to your doctors.As I head into menopause and my hormones start taking on minds of their own, I need to realise that in that respect there'sÂ little I can do, but I CANÂ make clear minded, rational andÂ pro-activeÂ decisions about (most)Â things outside of that. That includes what I (choose to) eat.Up to now it's been lots of processed foods, sugary treats, bread, dairy, etc. I've been feeling increasingly sluggish, heavy, fatigued, dull and frustrated about \"it all\". Never mind that I'm not 25 anymore and my body doesn't work the same way. Damn it.I sat down and reviewed this programme, read about it, bought two cookbooks and flipped through them several times, listened to what was pushing me and what my health practitioners were saying and it seemed the best fit. People are saying I'm crazy to be doing it at/over Christmas, but I was really feeling the need to start sooner rather than later,Â so why not now?The programme focuses on removing fructose from the diet, but allows a bit of glucose in the form of stevia or rice malt syrup, although it is very savoury based. There is a huge range of recipes covering every possible meal plus snacks, which is important because I find myself craving food during the day while I'm at work.I've spentÂ well over Â£400 on food in the past week and a half, most of which is dry goods that will last - I hope - a few weeks, so the only replenishment I'll need to make is the produce. I started the programme on Monday, so am only three days in, and have decided that I am going to follow the spirit of the programme, if not the letter. The recipes are simple and tasty (thankfully!), so take hardly any time to make, which is great, as I don't like cooking. I did some baking on the weekend and have some muffins, macadamia nut treats and some (badly turned out) coconut lemon balls. Every recipe is created so that any ingredient can be swapped out for something else if allergies, intolerances, or dietÂ affect it in some way.How am I doing so far? I'm loving the food, which is a big deal. Am I sugar free? No. As I said above, I'm currently following the spirit of the programme, meaning that I've more than halved my daily sugar intake, but aim to wean myself off sugar in my tea at some point. I'm eating lots of protein and veggies daily, am already feeling better (if struggling a bit with the sugar urges), and am eager to see what the next several weeks hold. I have a Christmas work do tomorrow now, so will have to start fresh on Friday morning, but I'm okay with that. I know what I need to do and as long as I have options for meals and think ahead a bit, I'm finding it relatively easy so far.ItÂ won't be bad, regardless of whether I'm following it exactly or not!"},
{"title": "Hadrian's Wall, Day 6 - Walton to Carlisle, 18 km", "date": "Sunday 29 November 2015", "text": "Another lovely start to the day in pretty Walton. We got started a bit later this morning - about 9:00 instead of our usual 8/8:30 goal. We had to wait until the morning duties were done, but that's part of the process.Regardless, we were anxious to get started, seeing as we were on the penultimate leg of our journey - already! Where has the time gone? It seems like only yesterday we were heading out of Newcastle.Â 12 miles! Easy peasy :)Clouds moved in quickly, but the temperature was pleasant enough. It was about here that the group of 6 Canadians caught us up and overtook shortly afterwards.If I ever have a house, I'm getting a weathervane exactly like this!We took the sign at its word - I didn't feel the need to check, even though there was no sign of the bull in the immediate vicinity.We reached this sign shortly before noon.Little Crosby on Eden - bursting with energy on a Saturday morning. My kind of place! We ran into the Canadians here, sitting outside the pub (by the white van waaaay at the end of the road) and having their lunch. We kept going and took a wrong turn just past that. We may have been talking too much because we missed the sign post and had to double back, adding about another 1.5 miles to our walk.The peaceful River Eden.So close!! Less than two hours' walk. :)We have reached the fringes of Carlisle, the city of lovely red stone.The folly (see Jane's post to get the name of this). This part of the walk wasn't as scenic, although it was flat, so we made excellent time, covering 12 miles in about 5.5 hours.Our daily motivation. Ha ha! Not really, but it did help. We sat at the pub, after getting the stamp for our passports, for almost two hours. We needed to figure out which way we needed to go to get to the B&B. I bumbled about with Google maps and asking the pub staff, and Jane went to find a city directory.We eventually found our way and I enjoyed the walk to the B&B. Carlisle has lovely colours and the houses are 3-storied in most cases, rather than the typical two-storeys you find everywhere else. I'm unclear why, but it's a city I'd like to come back to and explore. It's smaller than most - only 80,000 - so quite easy to get around. And only 1.5 hours from Glasgow by train!Fern Lea B&B, our destination for the evening.Â Staying true to the hike, we had actually passed this earlier on, so had effectively double back on ourselves. Ah well. We couldn't check in until 4:00 anyway, so time at the pub was an enjoyable way to rest up before check in.Our cosy room in the eaves. Cosy and quiet, despite being on a main road. The bathroom was roomy, and breakfast in the morning was delicious. Another terrific stay!Dinner was at the packed and noisy Beehive pub, just down the road. I have to admit, had Jane not been there, I wouldn't have gone in on my own - I'm very nervous around lots of people drinking (it's an English pastime). It was football on all the TVs, with loud, rowdy fans in attendance. As it was the World Rugby Championships that week, they had gathered to watch Wales and England play once the football had finished. I'm glad we didn't have to stay for that. We ate and left.Â Tomorrow would be our last day of this amazing journey!"},
{"title": "Hadrian's Wall, Day 5 - Gilsland to Walton, 11 km", "date": "Sunday 22 November 2015", "text": "After a deluge the previous evening, we awoke to sun and beautiful blue skys for our walk today! Only 7 miles (11 km), so plenty of time to poke about and linger a bit if we found somewhere particularly scenic or interesting.We had arranged for a packed lunch today, as there weren't really any places to stop en route. After a hearty breakfast (with slightly over-salted oatmeal - my only real complaint with this superb B&B), we set off.Â The lovely warm stone of Brook Side Villa B&B, our home for two nights.We crossed into a new county today (technically on our arrival the day before, but I didn't think to take photos then) - Welcome to Cumbria, more understated than its neighbour apparently - certainly with a softer \"accent\".The remains of another milecastle, in Gilsland.Â There are those in Gilsland who want to re-open the train station, I imagine to bring in some needed tourism from people other than Wall walkers. It's a pretty place, and definitely has some history. There's currently a petition for this.The Roman wall was fairly easy to distinguish from the other field walls - it's built of square blocks and is much wider and flatter. It also uses mortar to hold the bricks together, whereas the fieldstone walls don't. You can see the footings here and portions that remain. It's been heavily 'recycled' into various local buildings (churches, manor houses, barns, etc). It was originally about 5m high (approx 16.5')!Rights of way through farmyards often brought us up close and personal with some of the residents. These chickens were getting some sunshine and had absolutely no fear of us. Isn't she lovely?You can see here the remains of the wall after years of pilfering. It's good that UNESCO stepped in to save it, really. It's a fascinating history and this party of the country - all the way from Newcastle to Bowness - really benefits from the remains of the wall, the forts, various Roman artefacts, etc.Rebels at heart!Remember the part where we're not supposed to be ON the wall?This was the remains of an old bridge that crossed the River Irthing (to the left of the photo, just behind the trees). The river has changed course in the interceding years, so all we're left with is a bit of a confusing jumble of stones. There is a board here with an explanation and drawing of what it looked like and what the remnants are.We arrived at Birdowald Fort mid-morning and decided to have a look around.This fellow doesn't look particularly happy with his job!Perhaps because this one is shouting at him from 5m up?\"You there! Work harder, go faster!\" Sound familiar?A display about what the Romans ate. It was surprisingly diverse and healthy (not that I was expecting bags of crisps and chocolate, but still!).Avenues and barracks for the Legions stationed at this point.Back to fields. It was advised and encouraged to please walk side by side, rather than single file to ensure even wear on the land. It wasn't always possible, but I think we did pretty well for the most part.Beech trees have the most amazing root systems!More fields......through a lovely wood......and arriving at an Honesty Box, where we paid Â£1 each for a can of cold Coke (the Â£1 goes into the black box on the date marker). The young fellow who set this up is in the photo beside Jane. His name is Matthew and it shows him with his dog (who was in residence at the time).Â Â It was nice to take a few minutes to rest and relax. It also started to rain a bit at this point, so I took the opportunity to get myself sorted for that.Â Thanks, Matthew! :)Â Looking back - less spectacular than the previous couple of days, but better in terms of easier movement. We made good time today.The view from our lunch spot.Pretty cottages everywhere!Some mysterious trees......and some more pretty flowers. These grew mainly by the roadsides in semi-damp areas in particular. They look like orchids, but as that's highly unlikely, does anyone know??Lanercost Priory - a 12thC priory standing through revolutions (apparently there are musket ball holes in the face and walls!) and 900 years of change.,And no, it's not your eyes - it IS slightly off-centre.It was approximately a mile from the path, and definitely somewhere worth visiting. The Â church was still in use, although the priory behind it was in ruins. There is a B&B on site, a cafe and a self-catering section. I think it would be a fantastic place to spend some time. The area has plenty to see and do.Autumn colours already! So pretty.Â The lady in the gift shop was quite a talker. I bought a book and had decided not to go into the priory behind, but she (somehow) convinced me that it would be free if I bought an English Heritage membership, which I did after much confusion and time. My \"free\" visit cost me Â£50.To be fair, it's an annual membership, and there are hundreds of places around the country I can now visit free of charge. I just have to do it! It would be silly not to visit at least a few of them.Â I was hoping that maybe one or two orbs might show up in here, considering the age of the place. Surely there are a few residents still hanging about...Â It's a beautiful place, though.Off we go again, following the fieldstone road!Idyllic places everywhere.And there's our destination, the village of Walton. On the hill.These young ones were curious, but more hungry than anything, waiting for their dinner to arrive.We got picked up in Walton by the B&B owner, who arrived at the same time we did! It would have been nice to spend a bit of time poking around the village once we'd got there, but there we go.We learned about the Reavers on the way back. Part of what I find fascinating about England is that so many people stay put in a place. Less so now, I think, with the younger folks off and about for work, etc., but the English put down roots and let them sink into the earth for a solid foundation. There have been families here - much like the New Forest - for hundreds and hundreds of years.Reaver is defined as this:reaverÂ Â n.OldÂ EnglishÂ reafereÂ \"plunderingÂ forager,\"Â agentÂ nounÂ fromÂ reafianÂ (seeÂ reave(v.)).Â Cf.Â OldÂ FrisianÂ ravere,Â MiddleÂ DutchÂ rover,Â DutchÂ roover,Â OldÂ HighGermanÂ roubari,Â GermanÂ RÃ¤uber.reaveÂ (redirected fromÂ Reavers)Also found in:Â Legal,Â Wikipedia.v.Â reavedÂ alsoÂ reftÂ (rÄft),Â reavÂ·ing,Â reavesÂ Archaicv.tr.1.Â ToÂ seizeÂ andÂ carryÂ offÂ forcibly.2.Â ToÂ depriveÂ (one)Â ofÂ something;Â bereave.v.intr.ToÂ rob,Â plunder,Â orÂ pillage.Basically, life in the north was harsh and hard and reavers were those who lived on the borders (Scotland & England) who would rob and plunder homesteads of their stock (sheep, cattle, horses, etc). They raided both ways across the borders.Â The Wikipedia page is here.Some of the reaver families are still there! The B&B owner, Gerry, said that at least 5 of their neighbours had \"reaver\" names. Amazing.We had a pub dinner that night, along with the rest of the crowd at the B&B. I don't remember what I had, but I know I polished it off, whatever it was. My appetite certainly didn't diminish while we were walking, that's for sure."},
{"title": "Building credit", "date": "Saturday 21 November 2015", "text": "I got a credit card today. It's been set up and is ready to go with a stupid interest rate and a low balance (Â£500).My cousin asked me if that was actually a good idea (seeing as I'm currently borrowing from Peter to pay Paul), but I'm determined to start building credit here and do things RIGHT this time.Â It shall be gas and groceries ONLY.I'm still debating a part-time job and wanted to apply for one this weekend but left my USB stick at work. It has all my bits and pieces on it, including my Nanowriomo work! So I'm left without much to do today, although I could write some emails and am Skyping with a friend later.Having one of those days where I started out well and relatively productively (returned boots, updated budget spreadsheet, did laundry and dishes, making a 'to do' list of what I want/need to do on my day off on December 4, and posted on the blog), but can't progress much as what I wanted to do I can't. Then I get bored and frustrated.I think while I'm watching TV tonight, I shall make a concerted effort to go through my I Quit Sugar books and figure out what I need for the first couple of weeks, then visit Amazon to see what I add to my grocery necessities list. Some of the recipes look fantastic, but as I don't enjoy cooking, I hope they're quick and straightforward. I KNOW this will be good for me (even though I'm already getting the 'but your body NEEDS sugar' talk - sure it does, simply not in the concentrated amount that I feed it daily. A break will not hurt. At all.).Strictly Come Dancing tonight is in Blackpool, kind of the pinnacle of the show as we're now halfway through it and Blackpool is THE dance mecca of the UK. I'm still unclear why, but the theatre is gorgeous. A good bunch of celebs this year, too, and it's hard to say who's going to win.I'm meeting my friend for a leisurely coffee tomorrow which will be great. I haven't seen her since August and I'm really looking forward to getting caught up. She went on a date last night, so am keen to hear all about that! :)After a breakfast of champions (I had the pancakes, Jane probably porridge or at least muesli!), we were given a lift to where we had left off the day before, the parking lot at Steel Rigg Craggs.It started off beautifully, if a bit chilly, and you can see what it looks like in the sunshine in the picture below. We had rain on and off during the walk today, but nothing too intolerable. The temperature was definitely cooler, however, and I needed my fleece today. We were still climbing up, but the worst was definitely behind us, meaning that most of what lay ahead was D-O-W-N... :)We reached the highest point on the trail quite early on, Winshields Crag, at 345 feet above sea level.The scenery just gets better and better.I believe that's Saughy Rigg, aka \"Soggy Bottom\" in the photo. Look at the location! The beautiful Northumberland National Park.I didn't check particularly carefully, but I THINK this marks the highest point on the Winshields. The views were breathtaking.This is how easy it is to see the weather changing - literally right before your eyes!Can you see the rainbow??We've come SO far, but we still have so far to go. Basically if you follow the line of hills, that's the route. Silly Romans. Made it harder on themselves really.I loved these little flowers - I think they're bluebells. They struggled along in all these cracks and pockets in the wall, and really stood out.Another Milecastle - on a slope. Those Romans did a lot of climbing.Over streams......through fields......past beautiful, isolated crofts...(this is their view, btw!)...along ridges......and up more hills...The remains of Walltown Quarry.Once I stopped seeing so many spirals, I started seeing feathers. If I saw feathers on the ground, I knew we were going the right way. This one was at our lunch spot.I saw many grey & white feathers (wood pigeon) and plenty of black ones.As signs go, they aren't bad:GREYÂ - peace and neutrality (as it is in theÂ middle of black and white), authenticness, flexibility.GreyÂ and whiteÂ symbolise hope (like the pigeon feathers).Â BLACKÂ (crow feathers)Â - protection, warning, repelling orÂ  warning of negative energy, death (as in a closed chapter), mystical wisdom - aÂ sign that you are undergoing a spiritual initiation, growth or increased wisdom. When the feathers areÂ irridescent, oir represents high mystical insight (especially if there is a shiny irridescence).The whole scene changes when you look behind (and have sunshine!).We took time to walk the Labyrinth. We had time to explore a bit today as we were making good time. It was brand new, the shrubs only hip-high in places, but it was peaceful and pretty and tied in beautifully with our spiral-themed hike! :)Climbed this stile towards the small, pretty village of Longbyre, which contains the remains of Thirlwall Castle. In the field were over a dozen calves and their mamas, quite content and not the least bothered by the intruders. But dog walkers take note: mama cows are fiercely protective of their babies, so to keep all safe, put your dog on a lead and be very, very respectful as you pass. Apparently you are to let your dog go and fend for itself if the cows run at you. Difficult, but sensible really. The dog will be more able to take care of itself and move faster without you.Thirwall Castle. Oh, look. It's at the top of a hill.Â The sun came out in time to show us the true, warm colours of the stone.Rolling hills now, wrapping around pretty villages and cottages.Through the Vallum (the protective ditch that ran behind the Wall).People really know how to make the most of their gardens up here!Coming into Gilsland. We took a slight wrong turn trying to find the High Street and headed straight along the trail again.But eventually found the delightful, cozy, warm and welcoming House of Meg Tearoom. We had a lovely hour of relaxation, tea and cake before heading off to find our next B&B.Not too much further to go (3 more days)! We're still on the right track - the B6318 is our roadway guide.The creative front garden of the Brookside Villa B&B.Relaxing in our lovely room after a long walk. This was nice to arrive at, as we had this for two nights, so could leave our things UN-packed for a change.Â We had a superb, filling, delicious dinner after arriving just in time for Pointless (I'm a bit of an addict).Â Only 7 miles tomorrow!"},
{"title": "General life update", "date": "Wednesday 18 November 2015", "text": "As it's been a whileÂ since I've updated about anything in general other than Hadrian's Wall - which, let's face it, is pretty fab in itself without me thrown intoÂ the mixÂ - I thought I would takeÂ the opportunity during my short lunch break today to post the few bitsÂ and pieces that have been happening around these parts outside of that.So, what's been keeping me busy (and \"busy\")?Work, mostly. After a bit of an uncertain start,Â where I wasn't sure I wanted to stick around, I have found my feet and I'mÂ feeling much more confident. Admittedly, it's not the most challenging position, but it's steady income, reasonably busy, IÂ like the business, and I am actually doing well. Compared to the last job -Â where I cried, had the memory retention of aÂ goldfish, and was generally more miserable than I cared to admit - this is fantastic. And it's showing in my performance. I CAN do this work and do it well, and it feels good to be inÂ aÂ place where I can prove my skills to both myself and my employers.The only bad thing then, if I'mÂ really honest, are the work hours. The office is openÂ 9:00-5:30, but I'm generally in by 8:00. This is purely because if I catch the 08:11 train, there will be nowhere to park. It's a small lot with free parking all day and it fills up quickly. Parking in town is expensive and the hassle of driving to and from the city simply isn't worth the wear and tear on the car or the time it would take. It makes for a long day, but I'd really rather this option than stressing about finding a parking space later in the morning. I can adjust accordingly during holiday times.For the month of November, I have temporarily deleted my FB account. This hasn't been nearly as hard as I thought it would be. I have done it before, several years ago, in a New Year experiment that lasted three times longer than I had intended. Anyhow, this particular reason is because I'm (ostensibly) doing Nanowrimo again. Last year,Â I was interrupted by my sudden daily commute to London Hell, and my attempt was aborted. IÂ started again this year,Â and have once again fallen by the wayside as hasÂ my motivation. I think it's because I'm starting fresh and it's just not working for me. I'm forcing it, and that's a recipe for disaster. I think the best route is to simply pick up where I left off last year, although that's not exactly the intention of Nanowrimo, or at least never used to be. It appears that over the years, people have played fast and loose with the rules/guidelines and pretty much anything goes these days. I suppose the focus is on the concerted writing effort you put into things, not necessarily what it is that you're writing.My cousin and I went to visit another cousin and her family near Bristol over the weekend. It was a good visit, as it always is, and we talked and talked and talked. I was feeling a bit rough yesterday morning, though,Â as I ate too much junk and drank too much wine. I generally don't drink wine at all - I don'tÂ like it much - and the combination of drink, sugary treats, and a mediocre pub breakfast the next morning (lots of sodium-laced food - sausages, etc.) just made me feel kinda rubbish. Ick.I've startedÂ visiting a Chinese doctor for acupuncture and have also arranged an appointment with a naturopath in a couple of weeks. She'll be doing a food intolerance test during the intake which is what I want, as health-wise I'm not feeling my best. The Chinese doctor isn't cheap (but not as expensive as others, I'm learning) and I know that to make a difference I have to be consistent, but I also have to watch my pennies. According to the Chinese doctor (after some initial miscommunication) is that I'm 'damp.'I had to Google it too!What I've determined - in layman's terms, at least - is that my spleen and kidneys are not working as they should, hence my bloating/swelling, sluggish circulation, wacky hormones, etc. There's way more to it, but essentially reducing the amount of dairy and sugar I eat should help.And this segues me into this: I Quit Sugar, an 8-week program to completely remove sugar from your diet, detox, and reset yourself. I have decided that this is something that I need to do, so have bought two of the books and am going to spend some time over the next several weeks figuring out what I need to buy to get started. It's not quiteÂ Paleo, but does incorporate whole, fresh foods like Paleo does, so it's a good process. It's not going to be easy, I know that much, but I need to do something to make myself feel better. And I'm an all or nothing person. I have to cut out everything or it's just not going to work, as cutting out bits at a time just makes it easier to put bits at a time back in.The program cuts out sugar entirely for the first 4 weeks of the program and then allows a bit of sweetener to come back in. It's quite drastic, but I'm feeling the need and all these appointments and thoughts have come together quite nicely to point me in this direction, so I need to go with that and take the time to clear out the junk and toxins that have been building up over a lifetime of crappy eating.As long as I'm organized and get in a base of ingredients, I think I'll be fine. I have to start sourcing items, but Amazon is generally good for most things and I've been putting things on my wish list as I come across them.I ordered some boots from Amazon the other week - some (cheap) knee high waterproof ones that I thought would replace my 10+-year old Clarke's rain shoes. They arrived yesterday and are going straight back. The photo on the order page shows them as black and it even describes them as black, but what I got was some kind of weird brown. Not even a nice one. Plus the quality is rubbish. So I have Â£25 coming back to me, so that's something.My mother has been on the phone several times wondering if I (and my sister) would want to become a joint tenant in her house with her. I am not entirely against this, but prior to this idea materialising, we thoughtÂ she was moving over here to live/retire. I have no idea what's happened to that idea now (and I have asked). After speaking with her initially, I emailed her to say that I'd talked to my sister and that she's not interested in this idea, at least not right now. I said that I was interested, but needed more information with respect to financial and tax obligations, etc.,Â so I could make a fully formed decision.That was almost a month ago and I've heard nothing about itÂ since, but had a phone call on Sunday in which she told me we're not allowed to go to the Continent (after the Paris attacks).She makes my head hurt.Anyway, I'm off to London for the weekend to see my friend. I haven't seen her since I escaped left, so I'm really looking forward to catching up. Not sure about the weather as we've got tail ends of storms of all kinds all week and it's been, as my cousin says, \"blowing a hooley\" out there all week so far. Fingers crossed for a little sunshine!"},

Only they're using their own twisted version of religion to get the non-Islamic world worked up about and hating and being paranoid of Islam and Muslims and then when we retaliate -Â as we will, of course, because 'an eye for an eye' and all that - they use that as reasons for THEIR reasons to do something like this. Again.But this isn't the time or place to soap-box about religion or politics (or the one that's on the tip of my tongue about Syria), but to just spare a moment or two of thought for those who died and those who are fighting to live in a locked-down, terrified city, while those who can do what they can, and the politians spout platitudes and promises because they really have no idea what to do.Be safe, France. The world is behind you."},
{"title": "Hadrian's Wall, Day 3 - Wall to Once Brewed, 20 km", "date": "Sunday 8 November 2015", "text": "The day, as you can see, dawned bright and cool, giving us the energy we needed early in the morning to get started. We had big packed lunches from the hotel (an excellent lunch and a great deal for Â£7.95!), so didn't have to rush to get to a particular place en route. There are plenty, so it's not like we would have starved, but it's always comforting to have an idea of our own modern day version of 'mile markers' - pubs, tea rooms, etc.Obviously the modern route of the walk doesn't follow the exact route of the original Roman wall, but it does a pretty good job.Â Over the years, the wall has been pillaged for its stones to build churches, homes, other walls and various other buildings in the area. It was an easy and, I suppose, sensible resource for this. Why make extra work for yourself when there are ready made building materials already formed and standing idle? So, while there is sadly (comparatively) little remaining in situ, there is still plenty around to see. It's a UNSCO World Heritage Site, so hands very firmly off these days, please.A beautiful Roman-built bridge in pretty Chollerford, our first destination of the day, 3 miles on from Wall. It's a very narrow bridge, obviously not designed for anything wider than a cart or a Roman legion, so it's single traffic only in turns.Feeling good about our day so far, standing atop such an historical creation.Taken from the lovely gardens of the George Hotel.This lovely creature was very curious and stood watching me for ages. I gave her the name Harriet, although I have no idea why. :) I stood with my hand out, hoping she'd come closer, but she wasn't quite brave enough to touch it.This is why Harriet was so curious - all these people in her field!Yay! More of what we came to see - the Wall. We're still smiling, see?This is Black Carts Turret, one of the 158 turrets en route - they have all been designated a number (not necessarily all have names) - this is probably in the 30's. There are always signs posted, but unfortunately not all are legible - some were just blank metal stands. I suppose the weather is not particularly kind, but it would be a good thing for the UNESCO people and the Northumberland Parks to get some funds together to refresh them. You can see the damage on the one next to me.Remember to always look back! :)More beautiful views, but the clouds are moving in, not boding well for the day.The Carrawburgh Temple of MithrasRemnants of the alterThere were two of these figures, this one the more complete of the two (I think I may have been sitting on the remains of the other...).Look where we are! In the middle of nowhere. It was fab. The North is beautiful. Still smiling too...for now.Wind had picked up a little bit and the temperature had dropped by this point. We were bundled against the weather.At least we're going the right way - the acorn was our friend. The path is very well marked and we only got lost twice, nearer the end, once when we weren't paying attention to where we were going. That added a couple of miles to our day too.The wind had become much more noticeable as we climbed and the temperature fell further. It hadn't started raining though. Yet.But look at those views!Coming up to Housesteads Fort, in a steady drizzle. Neither of us was feeling particularly on form at this point (Jane's Achilles tendon was very sore and giving her trouble and my feet were killing me), but I was determined to see Housesteads after coming this far. We walked up that hill and took the path to the left.There is ONE entrance and it was exactly opposite the junction of the walls at the top. They didn't make it easy (fair enough, really) although we managed to wander in without a ticket. 15-stubborn minutes later, we wandered out (Thanks, Jane!!), less happy than we were before and still with miles to go.Those nasty cloudses with their cold, drizzly rainses...The only portion of the wall you can walk on. Housesteads is a big tourist attraction and most of the people we saw there, I would say, are the day-trippers.The rain made the rest of the route quite treacherous. It took us longer because there were points where we had to go quite slowly and carefully up and down the crags.A beautiful, isolated croft, with Crag Lough in the background. I think I had cried a little by this point, wondering what exactly I had signed up for. I was really strugglings.But still such lovely colour to be found struggling in this gray, wet, cold day.Sycamore Gap.Another milecastle. I'm not sure where Jane is - either climbing down on the right or over the crest of the hill already. I was determined that even though I was pretty miserable, I was going to record as much of this as I could.Looking back on what we've done!It was a really treacherous, steep trek down Steel Rigg crag. By this time, however, the rain had stopped, but it was still wet and muddy and cool.It looks so easy from here. We were finally (almost!) at our destination. A couple of calls to the B&B got us nowhere, so we had another couple of kilometres to walk. It was a very, very, long day - about 10 hours of hiking. I had trouble getting up the stairs to our room (I'm badly out of shape), and we only had the energy for a bowl of soup and a bun.Â The soup was delicious, though, and the stay was great. The conservatory below is the dining room and captured all the sunshine. It was quite a lovely, modern and comfortable refurbished croft.Â And we're already almost halfway through our walk!"},
{"title": "Hadrian's Wall, Day 2 - Heddon-on-the-Wall to Wall, 20 km", "date": "Saturday 7 November 2015", "text": "Day Two dawned bright and cool. After a hearty breakfast (we got good at helping ourselves to aspects of both breakfasts - either porridge or eggs for me, porridge for Jane on most occasions - and the Continental side of yogurt, fruit, etc., which fit neatly into our daypacks and were used as snacks or lunch supplements) we were off into the early morning air. We aimed for 8/8:30 departures, which was achieved most days.Our luggage was on its own journey, being picked up and dropped off at each destination to await our arrival each evening. There were then generally stairs to carry it up...and down...and although some might say this isn't the 'real' way to hike the Wall, I say stuff it. I've reached the age where I like to sleep lying down (in a bed), indoor plumbing, warm breakfasts, and the opportunity to walk feeling less encumbered. It's YOUR wall walk, to be done how you like. We still walked it, still had aching feet and legs, met the same wind, rain and mud. Love the experience, however you experienced it.Â I would do it exactly the same way again! :)Without further ado, Day Two...Ironsign B&B, with the magical approach past a field of Highland cattle and sheep, through a tunnel of trees and our first overnight on the trail.The neighbours - Two Hoots! It was a BEAUTIFUL home. Loads of moneyÂ inÂ these little villages.Through gates and many fields......along fieldstone paths......beside roads (keep the B6318 in sight though this part of the walks - then you know you're on the right path!)......and into pretty villages. I think this one was called Harlow Hill. The path took us on a journey through almost every landscape I could imagine. The least pretty part was our day coming into Carlisle, following the lovely-named River Eden. Flat and, well, uninspiring really, but that's 5 days away yet!Harlow Hill was our first hill - one of those sneaky ones where it's not particularly steep, but goes up and up and up over a long stretch. I'm pretty sure I was using the photo op as a cover for an excuse to catch my breath.Industrious bees were everywhere, gathering the last drops of nectar for their winter stores.And snails (and spirals) all over the place. I particularly liked the colour of this shell. I have a habit of rescuing them from dangerous-for-snails places. Where I took this photo were actually more than half a dozen around the wall of a stile. I trod on a big one on the first step of a stile as it was right behind the wall as you come over the top. I felt wretched, so vowed to save 9 or 10 more. I managed about 2 because they seemed to disappear after this day! Hardly saw them again.Our second stamp at Halton Chesters Fort, which was on the verge of opening when we arrived. We didn't have time to stop, however, and kept our focus on the miles we had yet to cover before our evening's stop.Fields were the majority of Things We Walked Through, quite often filledÂ with sheep or cows.Stone stiles - we quite enjoyed these.There's Jane, waaaay out in front again. I was trying to show that her jacket actually almost exactly matched the colour of the lupins in the verge to the left.The sun was out for a good portion of the day, making it a beautiful walk.A Google search shows this little beauty as a Tortoiseshell.The Errington Arms, where lunch was welcome, if mediocre, and the clouds started to move in, bringing the temperature down and the threat of rain up.This was a bit of a surprise when we rounded a corner. We'd (sorry, *I*) had marched off in the wrong direction after lunch and we had to clamber over some fences to get back en route. Jane spotted a fellow off to our left crossing a field, so we improvised a way to get back on the path without hurting either ourselves or the farmer's fencing. Fortunately, he build strong fences and we managed to make it safely from the road back to the proper path.Tramping through woodland could get a bit messy, but it was lovely and quiet.Look! Only 39 miles to go. Our next stop was close to Chollerford, so we're getting there.You can see how the weather has turned. At least in the part of the world, you can literally see the weather as it changes and we did learn quickly to anticipate what was coming, so we could change accordingly.The trees en route were amazing. Not sure if someone trained these two like this, but I think it more likely they grew naturally but that the wall in between was more substantial when they started. It in quite a state of disrepair as you can see.This was an oak tree! The oaks and beeches were amazing. It was actually three or four beech trees at Avebury that partly inspired J R R Tolkein to write Lord of the Rings. There are several on a rise that are fantastic.Cows, the Wall, and miles to see. See what I mean about the scenery getting better and better?The little village of Wall, our destination for the evening. We made it in good time, arriving before 5:00 if I remember correctly.The pub was called Hadrian's Hotel (Jane has some photos on her blog) and Jane was directed by a couple of very attractive fellows at the garage you see just at the top of the photo. It was at the bottom of the village (of course). We were quite tired by the time we reached Wall and all we really wanted was a cup of tea and a bit of a rest.We were delighted to find ourselves with a bath and we both had a good soak. Dinner was delicious - I had the biggest beef and ale pie I've ever eaten PLUS a little bowl of potatoes PLUS a side of veggies. Oh my! I couldn't manage to eat all the potatoes unfortunately, but made short work of the rest of it.Wall doesn't have a shop of any type, so we arranged for a packed lunch for our hike the next day. A rest, sorting of laundry/luggage, Pointless (my fave quiz show), and our evening was complete."},
{"title": "Hadrian's Wall Adventure - Day 1, Newcastle to Heddon-on-the-Wall (photo heavy)", "date": "Saturday 31 October 2015", "text": "It's been over a month since JaneÂ (Mrs Crabapple of Crabapple LandingÂ - hee hee) and I got back from our Northern adventure. Beyond time to get starting on recounting my adventure, especially as Jane has already posted two days worth of travels! I wasn't feeling up to posting in October, though, and as this blog is supposed to be fun - amongst other things - I didn't want to push it. Tomorrow, being 1 November, I'm starting Nanowrimo, so I won't many more opportunities until December and that's just too far away.I have 7 days to get through for the trip, however, so I will be posting updates so everything is up to date. Jane has some fab photos up - go check them out if you haven't already! Between us, I'm sure we have pretty much every square inch of the Wall covered, so I'll try to keep them at a reasonable minimum, but it was SO AWESOME!! Jane takes way more photos than I do, and each one brings back fantastic memories made with a great friend.So without further ado...This was part of the refurbished Quayside area. This lovely art piece reflected the important part the sea played - and continues to play - in Newcastle's history. Rum, too, apparently, is important.Â It also had a bell, which fortunately for Jane I did not realise until we weren't near it anymore!This is the Millenium bridge, which raises to let ships through. It's actually much bigger than it appears and there are even times posted of when it gets raised. Our tour boat got to go under it to get turned around, which I thought was great! It's the little things. ;)The iconic Tyne bridge. Where there are pictures of Newcastle, there will be pictures of this bridge. I remember seeing it on a show called 'Minder' back in the 80's when I was living here ('here' being England, not Newcastle, just to clarify).There was a zip line set up on the brown building in the foreground and no, we did not go on it.This is a statue of a sea god. Below is the statue of the siren he's facing - it's not a very good one, though. She's in the middle of the picture, just at roof level with the building behind.Newcastle is pretty cool.Dinner at the Slug and Lettuce. This Mac 'n Cheese was fantastic as was the refreshing run and coke. You can see Jane's macaroni & cheese burger across the table. Delicious! I helped Jane over the weekend translate from Newcastleonian into English. They do speak quickly, but it's one of my favourite English accents (sorry, dialects!)Manor Station, our first walking day. We took the Metro to Wallsend station, just two stops away.Segendunum - the Roman fort where the wall starts. The tower was closed, but from the top you can see the remains of the Roman town that was there. We got our first stamp for our passport and then we were off! Tramped through rain for most of the day and made excellent time in our enthusiasm.The River Tyne.I love the row housing of England. No matter which part of the country you're in, it's there, just built to reflect regional building materials - usually some kind of brick.Patience the cat perpetually stalking the seagull.Back in familiar territory! That was fast...There were two of these remembrance benches. A lovely tribute by the river.Newscastle Castle, which gave the city its name. It's a 12thC castle and had we had more time, we definitely would have taken time to poke around. We took the opportunity to get as up close and personal as we could, though, on our way by. We'd taken a boat tour of the river on Sunday, otherwise I think this would have likely been on our agenda. Looks like I'll have to go back for a more thorough visit.Quirky mile markers through Newcastle (I actually took this to show how short Jane really is...shh!)The path wound through the urban landscape of Newcastle, past suburban pubs, and slowly into more rural landscapes.The rain cleared and the sun came out in time for us to CLIMB THE HILL into Heddon-on-the-Wall, which I kept calling Heddon-on-the-Hill because...well...it IS! Phew! But what a view.We had a fantastic early dinner at a pub called The Three Tuns. Huge plates of food, but we ate every scrap. We made excellent time into the village - about 6.5 hours to cover 25 km - so had a couple of hours to rest and relax before making our way out of town to the B&B.Our first glimpse of 'The Wall.' 2,000 years old...amazing!The best thing about English scenery is that you can see for miles and miles and miles...but I still miss the mountains.Feeling a bit giddy and quite confident as we approach our B&B for the evening. It was a beautiful walk around some pastureland.The B&B was comfortable and roomy, and we slept very well after our 27 km walk. There was some questionable DIY about (lighbulbs in the shower?!), but the owners were welcoming and friendly and we were well pleased to get settled in for the evening. We needed to rest up for Day Two."},
{"title": "Update and countdown", "date": "Sunday 16 August 2015", "text": "5 weeks today, Jane and I will be setting out on our walk! 135 miles from Newcastle to Bowness-on-Solway along Hadrian's Wall. As beautiful as this is, I'd like to hope that if we see any clouds like this, that we'll be relatively close to our evening's B&B.And I'm anticipating it will be like the first photo, i.e., empty wilderness (more or less - England is very crowded...). I'm telling you now, Jane, that if we run into something like the above, I might just turn around and head home...euntes autem puellae! (*you go, girls!)With the Roman legion behind us, surely we've got this?We were having a bit of a chat last night, Jane and I, and have arranged to meet in Manchester and travel on to Newcastle together. It's going to be a long day for both of us. I've booked myself a train to Manchester from Southampton leaving at 7:15, but it's a direct service, and will only take just over 4 hours. I want to avoid changing in London. I hate fussing with the underground, particularly when I've got luggage to contend with too. Jane will be arriving into Manchester after a long-haul from Ontario. Phew!I went out last weekend with my sister and bought a few necessecities and it was lucky I had her with me because she limited me on my spending. As I'm currently using my Canadian credit card, everything is costing me a fortune, so it's good to have someone with you who can cut you off when necessary. I bought a waterproof jacket and pants, hiking pants, two pairs of socks and a microfleece which will be beautifully warm. I'm going to ask her to come over a few of days before I go too, to help me pack and organise.Otherwise, things are going well. I started my job two weeks ago and so far, so good. It's not particularly challenging, but I don't hate it (so far), like I did the other one. It's a very small company - less than a dozen employees - but well run and far, far less chaotic than the last one. It's a job I can walk away from at the end of the day and simply forget about and there's a lot to be said for that. I've got my train pass, the morning coffee shop crew said they'd missed me and even remembered what I drink (I've been gone 9 months, so their collective memory is pretty fantastic), and it's an easy walk from the station, so it's a pleasant enough commute. I know it's only been two weeks, but why do I feel like this is temporary?Anyway, it's been going well enough so far.I spent yesterday clearing, cleaning and tidying my room and it feels SO much better. I still had stuff hanging around in bags and containers from when I moved back from London several weeks ago and it was beyond time that I got myself sorted out. Almost everything now has a place. There's still some stuff to be sorted and/or organized, but it's looking and feeling a hundred times better. I lit a little bowl of incence too, and that's helped renergise the space.I feel a book (or 5) bursting to come out but I can't seem to find words to put on a page. I know it will come and certainly being back in the Forest is the right place to be. It's wonderful to be back here - Sunday morning sounds are so peaceful: birds, horses' hooves, the odd bawling cow or pony in the distance. I was up and at it by 7:00 this morning. By 9:00 I was feeling restless, so was happy when my sister said \"Let's go for cake!\" I drove down to the village where she's staying and we spent a few hours hanging out. It's great to have her so close by.It's a beautiful Sunday evening here and I feel relaxed and calm and content (and still a bit restless, but I'm okay with that). It's nice to feel like this again after having such a hard time in London. Amazing what coming back to where you belong can do for you.Have a great Sunday everyone!"},
{"title": "Looking up!", "date": "Tuesday 21 July 2015", "text": "Well, I finally heard from the Donkey Sanctuary and unfortunately I was unsuccessful there. I got some great post-board feedback though, which is always beneficial, so can learn a lot from that.I was getting anxious this morning, as I had the other job offer hanging in the wings, and leaving it too long looks bad for many reasons: it could indicate that I can't make decisions, it leaves the Agent in an awkward position as the go between, and the employer could change their mind because they don't think I'm serious about it.I called the Sanctuary and fortunately it didn't take someone long to get back to me and update me. I was then able to accept the job with the chartered survey company. I am genuinely thrilled to be starting there - I'm a bit nervous as it sounds like it can get quite busy, but the more confident and comfortable I get, the better I'll be. I'm confident the right choice has been made, although I'm a bit disappointed Sanctuary job didn't come through after all. But to be able to stay in the New Forest is not a bad consolation prize by any stretch of the imagination!I was offered the opportunity to do some temp work if it came up, but opted to just enjoy the rest of my time off before I start working again. It's been really good for me, and overall I feel much more positive and relaxed.My sister and I went to the oceanside village of Lymington yesterday for a few hours. It's quite a pretty village, although it was drizzly and cool for the most part. We had lunch and poked around a little bit. I bought some t-shirts for my hike in September, a book (Â£1!), some cake, went to the bank, and I picked up a few things at the chemist. Then we went to another, smaller, inland village called Burley. It's in a lovely spot, but is limited with respect to village business. It's got some witch shops and I bought several new crystals there, but otherwise there isn't much around and we left after a brief visit.Today is puttering on the computer, but tomorrow needs to be a bit more focused and productive: laundry, unpacking the bags that are lying around my room and putting things away, some reading..."},
{"title": "Interviews and photos and whatnot", "date": "Sunday 19 July 2015", "text": "It's been a busy two weeks - and I'm definitely not complaining. It's been really good to spend time with family and keep myself moving, rather than lazing around my room in London and spending too much time by myself and in my head.First up was a trip to Wales, which is always lovely. The weather was fantastic for the most part and my sister, cousin and I took a walk one day to a place called Ogmor Castle, about 1.5 hours from Carmarthen. We spent most of the day there, returning about 5pm.There's a nature preserve in between the castle and the coast and it takes quite a long time to slog through the dunes to reach the beach, but reach it we did and we spent some time relaxing by the water.While we were in Wales, my sister, cousin and I started our own investment group! We got very excited about learning about the stock market, buying shares, etc. so set up an online bank account for our funds. We're each going to invest Â£20 per month and when we get to a particular amount, say, Â£250, roll it over into some stocks or shares on the stock market and see where it takes us. We've started the initial research into the FTSE 100, how to buy, where the best place to invest is, etc. It's tapered off a little bit the past few days, but I certainly have time over the next week to clarify a few things with the bank we chose, do a little research, and send out some thoughts on some stocks I think would be a good buy. At this point, it's small potatoes, so we're not going to see big returns, but the more comfortable we get, the more we learn and the more risks we're willing to take (diversifying as much as we can when we get to a point that it's feasible) then hopefully we'll be able to get to the point of seeing our money working much harder for us, rather than us working harder for it.As I had an interview with an agency on Monday, so we headed back to England on Sunday, stopping at another cousin's place near Bristol to visit for a few hours. Although it's always fantastic to see her and the family, it's never often enough.Tuesday afternoon, my sister and I headed to Sidmouth, in the beautiful county of Devon. We took a bit of a roundabout route to get there (unintended), and it took us almost 4 hours - the regular route takes 2.5. Still, we weren't in any particular hurry and it was quite a lovely trip. A bit drizzly and foggy (!) once we got closer to the coast, but otherwise uneventful. Our hotel was basic, but comfortable and only a few minutes walk from the seafront. Sidmouth itself is a typical seaside town, a bit tired and in need of some TLC, but has everything you would need (including a great looking art store, a health food store, a cinema, and a fab yoga studio). It's located on the Jurassic Coast of England, which is filled with the bones of prehistoric creatures, millions of years old. It has soft red cliffs, which is a bright contrast to the green fields and pastures and not what I was expecting. For some reason I thought they would be gray!Anyway, I had my interview at the Donkey Sanctuary on Wednesday morning and am still waiting to hear the results. I feel it went quite well, but it can be hard to tell sometimes. I know I could have answered some questions much better, but did very well on others, so it's up to the interviewers now. I hope to hear tomorrow.I would love this job. It's a new position, so is a 'make it your own' position. I can start with a blank page and get myself organized and set up just how I like. The area is beautiful, it's in the middle of nowhere (as far as anywhere in England can actually be at least), by the ocean and I'd be working with animals, something that I would really be able to get behind and honestly get joy from. Fingers crossed please everyone!There are a few blind/vision impaired donks in this paddock. They have their own sighted donkey pals who lead the around!We spent a couple of hours wandering the grounds after my interview and it's beautiful. There are 500 donkeys at this sanctuary (the 'HQ' of 5 around the UK), each with its own story. They have sanctuary for life and some are used as therapy donkeys, some are blind, some are just old. They are well cared for and well loved here for the rest of their days. They really are quite lovelyÂ animals.Thursday afternoon I had an interview with a chartered surveying company in Southampton. I challenged myself and drove to town (!) and once I'd parked, promptly got myself turned around trying to get out of the parkade. I arrived at the office several minutes late after taking the long way around, but that was okay because the interviewers were trying to fix an Internet issue so were later than me! Phew... :)The interview went well (I have since had the job offer, so if the sanctuary position doesn't come through, I am still good to go - as soon as I accept it that is) and it sounds busy and challenging, so I'm well pleased. I'm still also getting calls from agencies who have found my CV online and are calling about positions I might be interested in, so overall the time away from work has been positive, fun and very worthwhile. I'm feeling better and now that I'm settled back in the New Forest - for now - already I'm more relaxed and happy.Friday my sister and Â I headed back to London to collect the last of my things and my rent deposit. We spent the morning in another New Forest village - Brockenhurst - and found ourselves at one point in a herd of donkeys (hmmm...how's that for a sign?).This little foal is less than a week old. The babies are so cute!Beautiful ponies.Traffic jamming. No matter what, you are NOT allowed to rush the animals in any way. If that means getting stuck behind them while they wander, so be it. Which is exactly what this herd did. There were more than half a dozen vehicles behind them crawling along until the donkeys decided to get off the road.Â Truly, who can stay miserable around here? It's magical!"},
{"title": "Planning to plan for Big Plans - plus photos!", "date": "Saturday 4 July 2015", "text": "Look at me, blogging twice in a week! It's almost like I have time on my hands or something...I've had another up and down week, but am feeling quite positive today. I'm off to the Hampton Court Flower Show with my friend and her mum, so am really looking forward to that. Hampton Court was on my 'to do' list, so this crosses that off with a bit of a bonus. The flower show is a big one, on the scale of the Chelsea Flower Show, so it will likely be busy and quite fantastic. We're heading over about 11:00.I've been awake since just after 5:00 - not unusual. There was a thunderstorm and some rain last night, which has cooled things nicely. It's supposed to get sunny and warm later in the day, but I for one am certainly appreciating the drop in temperature this morning. Quite refreshing!So what's been going on?Monday I took myself to Wisley Gardens, a Royal Horticultural Society garden about 20 mins drive from me. I'd been once before, but just sequestered myself on a bench by a pond to do some reading in the fresh air rather than walking around. This visit I spent time wandering around the acres of beautiful and well-tended gardens. I was there for about three hours, stopping on occasion to just relax and read my book. Some photos below, showing only a small selection of the huge variety of plants and flowers they propogate. There's still more to see, as I didn't see the entire place - it's very big! I've got plans to go back with a friend sometime in the next couple of weeks.These are very new, very fuzzy Moor Hen chicks. The sun was directly behind me, so I couldn't see the screen on my phone very well, hence the slightly out of focus photo.The past couple of days I've been feeling a bit better about things (except the heat). A woman at one of the agencies I've been in contact with (and with whom I've got an initial interview on 13th July) sent me an online assessment to complete - audio typing, Word processes, etc. I blew the audio typing one, but the rest of the assessments put me in the Advanced category for Word & typing speed, which negated the audio portion. Regardless, she sent me the audio typing one again and I did MUCH better the second time around, which pleased me no end. I know I'm good at this stuff; sometimes you just need a little reminder now and again to boost your self-confidence again.I was also told that the company she was recruiting for - a chartered surveying company - wanted to interview me as well. So I now have an interview with them on 16th July!! Very excited. I won't know about the job at the financial company probably until some time next week, but hopefully I'll at least get an interview. Always good experience, even if you don't get the job. I'm still terrible at interviews, so have to take some time to prepare properly. There are loads of interview websites out there with excellent suggestions about what to say, what to ask, what NOT to say (!), etc. An hour or two spent on there, along with some thinking about my work experience and various scenarios and finding something appropriate to wear (I'm not a clothes horse) and I should be fine.I ALSO got a phone call from the Donkey Sanctuary and was invited to interview with them on 15th July!!! So excited!!! It's 2.5 hours from the New Forest, so I've provisionally booked a hotel for the night of the 14th for me and my sister. It's definitely doable as a day trip, and the hotel can be cancelled up to the 13th July if needs be, but I just thought that we might as well enjoy it a bit while we're at it. Either way, it will be fun.I took myself to the town of Weybridge on the train on Wednesday. I hadn't really been and wanted to find myself some new thrift store duds. I'm not sure I have the patience for that sort of thing. I stopped in a few and saw a bag I really like, so I'm planning a return visit on Monday to get that. I may do another, more thorough, search for clothes. I wasn't there long, as I wanted to get a few items and once I'd done that, I was pretty much done. One high street, after all, is much like the next really.Yesterday I paid for my walk at Hadrian's Wall, which I'm doing with JaneÂ in September. I ended up putting it on my CC (my Canadian one). I've been putting aside money each week to this point for it, but I simply wasn't going to make it, particularly as I'm in that in-between place where I'm not replenishing anything and still have two weeks to go before I get my rent deposit back. The CC was the only way to go if I wanted to do this and I reallyreallyreallyreallyreally did. I need to do the walk and I have to say that, when I emailed Jane to let her know, I did tear up. It was the same feeling that pushed me over here, so I know it was the right thing to do, regardless of the additional debt I've taken on for it. It will be SO worth it. And so much fun! I'm really excited about doing this with Jane, too. It'll be amazing.So, definitely feeling much better today. I suppose it's just a matter of DOING things and feeling like something gets accomplished every day, pushing you forward rather than just letting it pass you by in a blur of pajamas, Facebook, reading and overanalysing everything that enters your head."},
{"title": "Mid-summer", "date": "Tuesday 30 June 2015", "text": "Stonehenge, March 2014Unlike Dannie over at \"My Ultimate Life List\" I didn't attend the Solstice celebrations at Stonehenge - 23,000 people is a BIT out of my comfort zone (btw, if you haven't read her blog, I suggest you have a peek - she's got a truly amazing bucket list!). Although having said that, it would be kind of cool place to go, particularly as you can apparently get right up and personal with the stones, rather than viewing them from a safe (for the stones) distance.We're in the middle of a bit of a heat wave here - I know! Where AM I, right? - and I think most of the planet must have a much higher heat tolerance than I do because I hibernate when the temperatures go above about 20C. I swell up and it's incedibly uncomfortable for me. This week we're supposed to get in the neighbourhood of almost 33C! Yikes! I had a couple of outings planned, but may postpone until it cools a bit.I finished work on June 12th - a week early! - and am really happy with how it worked out. I wasn't supposed to finish until the 19th, as I mentioned in my last post, but on the 9th, the Tuesday, I mentioned to the accountant that I wished I had said the 12th when my manager and I were first discussing this last month after she got back from holiday. I was feeling all over the place that day - frustrated, angry, like I wanted to cry, missing The Scot...I don't get emotional generally, not even when I get my period, so this was a bit confounding to me. The accountant said she wasn't going to say anything, but saw an opportunity and did. My manager/friend called me that evening, we had a bit of a chat and she was perfectly okay with me leaving a week early. We both knew I didn't want to be there and my mind wasn't in it. I was so relieved I cried! On and off all night actually. I didn't realise quite how heavily it was weighing on me.So. That's done. I've learned a huge amount, but it's now almost 3 weeks on and quite frankly? I'm bored. I'm having to delve into my savings to ensure that I've got enough money to cover my expenses the next several weeks, until I go back to my cousin's. I've been catching up on loads of British dramas (\"Broadchurch\", \"Scott & Bailey\", \"Vera\", and I'm currently watching \"Whitechapel\", which are all excellent), reading, and unfortunately, starting to feel really down and depressed. Part of it is because I didn't really start looking for work until last week, so have just been 'coasting' along. Being proactive makes everything so much better!I don't have much \"free\" cash either, which is also part of the problem, so I'm a bit limited in what I can actually do. Driving means using petrol and parking fees, trains mean tickets, places mean entrance fees, etc., but I'm planning a few outings at least. I'm going to the Hampton Court Flower Show on Saturday with my friend and her mum, and I'm really looking forward to that as Hampton Court is on my to do list before I leave London and the Flower Show is just a bonus. It's going to be fantastic. Heaving, hot and likely will push the limits of my 'people patience', but fantastic nonetheless. I have Windsor Castle on my list, too, and will be taking the train there - only 1/2 an hour and I won't have to contend with the horrific parking options (or lack thereof) here.I've made more of an effort to get myself out there the past few days. Last week I updated my CV and sent it back to the agency I was with in Southampton last year. I also updated it on a couple of websites, sent off to a few vacancies, and on Friday things started to trickle in. My cousin sent me an email early this morning with FIVE agency phone numbers in it! I've already spoken several times to one of the agencies on it, but I took myself over to the library today - ostensibly to take out some books, but it didn't open until 2, so I instead spent an hour and a half having a picnic and making some phone calls. I'm now registered with two more agencies and one lady is even going to forward my CV to a job that she thinks will work really well for me - working with a financial advice company. The recruitment closes on Friday, but I was quite keen, especially as both the offices are in central Southampton, less than 10 mins walk from the main station.Â Another job I've got my fingers crossed for is a position with a donkey sanctuary in Devon! I'm not sure I've got all the necessary qualifications, but when I saw the job advertisement I cried a little bit, so I think that's a good sign! I should know one way or the other about that in a few days. That would be a much bigger decision and a huge move, but I think it could be really worth it.I was feeling quite down when I headed out this morning, but after making my phone calls, having my picnic (sans books, sadly) and spending some time in the fresh air by the river with some ducks, I feel much more buoyed up. Knowing that I'm being SEEN out there is a huge boost and I've had some very positive feedback too, so that helps.My sister is back in the UK after a long walk in France. She managed 450km and felt it was time to stop. She's here for a few weeks then heading back to Canada to walk around Newfoundland with a group of women writers. After that, she'll likely head back to the West Coast to see our mother, then I believe, unless it's changed again, the plan is to head to Australia. Permanently. The plans could change again tomorrow and possibly already have!) but that's the last I'd heard. She and I are planning a trip to Wales in the next while, although it's becoming a bit tricky as we don't have any set dates and I've got a few commitments to meet in there too.It'll work out. It always does. :)"},
{"title": "More changes and stuff...", "date": "Saturday 6 June 2015", "text": "One of the breathtaking cakes created at Choccywoccydoodah in Brighton.Two more weeks of work to go! I still regret (a bit) not negotiating the 12th June instead of the 19th, but here I am, with the end in sight - at last! I don't feel unhappy about it at all and am looking forward to simply not being at work. I'm planning at least a couple of weeks off, just to relax and try to organize my thoughts and my plans and spend time doing a bit of sightseeing around the area. My sister has suggested I go to France and visit her (in Toulouse) for a few days, which I'm seriously thinking about. I just have to try to justify the expense, although I can get pretty cheap flights out of London. I haven't been anywhere 'international' yet, so the lure is definitely there. Hmm..I saw a psychic last Friday which was great! She was lovely and the reading was very positive overall, and actually mirrored my reading in January in several aspects which I found quite neat. Namely, my current job and the fact it's not for me, I'll be moving onto another one that is and which will include learning (possibly a language!), and a new, proper love. Horses were mentioned, money was mentioned, travel/work 'over water' was mentioned (she seems convinced I'll be moving back to Canada for work and not too far in the future. I don't believe this or, rather, I don't WANT to believe this...not yet, at least). I recorded this one as well, so it will be interesting to spend some time reviewing and seeing what information overlaps.On a sadder note, The Scot and I are definitely over. I am both sad and a bit relieved by this, although it didn't end particularly well. It's a bit tricky to explain, but suffice it say he blames me and I refuse to accept 100% responsibility for a relationship that had the both of us in it. I think we both did well at not bringing the relationship into work, but while we did talk about work to a degree (something I was never really comfortable with), the past several weeks I've felt like he was interrogating me. He got the feeling I was 'playing' him. For someone who prides himself on reading people, he couldn't see that I was uncomfortable and reluctant to discuss what he was asking me about. For my part, I simply did not say that I was reluctant and uncomfortable. He has since accused me of lying about what was going on and he's hurt and feeling disrespected on a personal level because of it, after giving me every opportunity to talk about it. I respect that he takes honesty very seriously. I shut down when confronted with uncomfortable things and it's not that I lie - I omit. Definitely a gray area, I know. My take on this whole thing? Two imperfect people who liked each other really a lot fumbled their way into a relationship with ghosts of past relationships tagging unceremoniously along with them, and subconsciously or otherwise, brought in the same reactions and expectations and sabotaged it. I REALLY, REALLY need to communicate things so that I set healthy boundaries, garner a little respect for myself and learn that what I like, need and want is also important and necessary in a relationship. I compromise far too much to please other people and keep the peace and it backfires every single time. Compromising what I want and need only hurts me in the end.I don't want to spend time overanalyzing things and wondering what coulda, shoulda, woulda happened because that will just make things more cloudy. It doesn't help him, however, that he called one of the other installers on Monday morning and ranted down the phone to him (prior to 'having a chat' with me at work) then got into it again with him on Tuesday morning, afterwards having words with my manager. She's sufficiently fed up with his attitude and lack of work that she's decided to manage him out. He's really shot himself in the foot with the way he's been acting lately. I've had a couple of good chats with her about the whole thing and while I'm not proud of acting so unconsciously when I was trying hard not to repeat my past mistakes, I do not regret for one instant getting involved with him. He has many redeeming qualities (as we all do), but also some not-so redeeming ones that he needs to see and pay attention to (as we all do). Much of this stems from his background (rather dark, lots of street smarts, having to keep on your toes and be hyper-aware of what's going on around you), but I suspect that on some deeper level he's actually looking for things to prove his suspicions are correct that you're untrustworthy, a liar, a cheat, etc. The installer he argued with said that he doesn't like talking with The Scot because he manipulates a conversation and when I heard that, my little inner voice went 'ping!' as that was a big issue in my last relationship.Anyway, that's enough of that. I accept that I have some responsibility for the way this ended, but am obviously getting ready to move on and start fresh - again - in the New Forest."},
{"title": "Overdue update", "date": "Monday 25 May 2015", "text": "Can't really seem to get focused to update more regularly these days.I guess the biggest news is that I've finally quit my job. I sincerely hate it and although I'm staying longer than I'd like (to June 19), at least I'm actually going this time. It's been too much of a struggle since the new year and I'm done. My heart was actually done a long time ago, but my head (stupid ego!) kept going 'okay!' to new work options. My boss was away for two weeks, the MD should have been there - but wasn't - and, well, I just hate it. It's that simple. Simply cannot find the love for insulation. And there's far too much chaos. I see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel, I'm just not prepared to spend more time chasing it.Plus, it's making me sick. That I know for sure. Apart from the perimenopause - finally got a prescription to stop the bleeding! - I've been stressed, frustrated and angry, which doesn't help. I'm going to take some time off, get myself healthy again and start fresh with work. I'm going back to the New Forest, to my cousin's place. Somewhere I can feel relaxed, comfortable and get myself back on track, so I can start making rational decisions again. I'm so far from where I was when I arrived and I think I knew that even at Christmas, when I went back to this job knowing it was completely wrong for me. I ignored my instincts - again - and this is what happens. I'm also becoming increasingly aware that I compromise myself to please other people far too often.The only thing I'll miss is the Scot. We've been spending time together in Brighton - which is lovely - and I spent a whole week with him last week. He cooked for me, ran baths for me after my runs, I got to talk with him and wake up beside him...a whole week of spoiling and it was marvelous. Just what I needed! We're planning another visit to Brighton, a couple of picnics and a week in Scotland. Then it'll be the process of easing off until I leave because we both know that once I leave London, it's over. I'm trying not to think that far ahead, but I can honestly say I've enjoyed every single minute I've spent with him and it was worth following through with \"this.\"Even though I'll be miserable as sin when it's actually over.My cousin from Canada was here at the beginning of the month and my auntie, cousin and I went to London to meet her and her partner. I hadn't met him before, but he's a great guy and they're really happy, which is all that matters in the long run. They were staying at the Savoy (she works for Fairmont, so gets a big discount) and we went to an Italian restaurant nearby and had a very long, enjoyable lunch. Then we had a short walk and went back to the hotel for cocktails. There's a menu. The most expensive cocktail - and why you would even drink it, I have no idea - is Â£5000. That's correct: Â£5000. It's called Old Sarazen, and there's a single bottle of 1858 whisky so a limited number of drinks. Still... I can check the Savoy off my bucket list, although I'd still like to ask my cousin for a 'friends & family' rate and stay just one night. Likely would have to eat at McDonald's for a couple of months afterwards, but what a fab thing to do! Tea at the Ritz is now on my bucket list as well: a measly Â£77 for a champagne tea. A girl has to have some fabulous-ness on her bucket list, right? :)I'll be giving notice on my (depressing) room on June 1st. It means I don't have to put aside any money for rent in June, and still have July to organize myself. I'll be able to get myself a little bit ahead with savings and expenses which will be really nice. I still have Hadrian's Wall with Jane to look forward to in September!"},

Not only do I have to claim any income I make in Canada (I cashed out an RRSP last year), but also any income I make OUTSIDE Canada - my world income.

{"title": "Checking in", "date": "Friday 3 April 2015", "text": "Birthday flowers from my not-so-secret-except-at-work-admirer!So what's been going on exactly?it was my birthday yesterday and it was a lovely, low-key day spent with my sister who came up on Wednesday (and is currently en route to France for a big walk); dinner and drinks withÂ my friend and The Scot; phone call with my brother; a couple of cards, thoughtful gifts and just feeling very happy and blessed.Have been out several more times with The Scot. We've sat down and had a grown up chat about \"this\" and made each other very happy by realizing we both wanted to pursue it. He's asked me if I will read to him, which I thought was really neat. He's chosen Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" to start, and I've bought a book that I read a couple of years ago and loved, and from the sounds of things, that he will too. But that's for after \"Dracula.\" He wants my interpretation, thoughts and excitement of a story as well as hearing it in my voice (which he apparently likes). So... :)I go from feeling really great at work to hating it, sometimes within minutes, so I really have to figure out - in my head and my heart - what I need to do about that. Updating my resume will be the first thing, getting a couple of copies printed off and handed out (Costa in town is hiring) will do me good, and starting to try and focus on what brings me happiness outside of work would be a good idea, rather than just hiding behind computer games all the time once I make it home every night.Health-wise I'm doing a bit better than I was several weeks ago. I've been to the doctor twice recently, however, because I'm concerned about my monthly cycle. I've been \"on\" (as they say here) for 6 full weeks now and I'm fed up to be honest. I realize that I'm now at an age where I'm most likely in pre-menopause, but I'd like to rule out anything else and just want it to stop. The doctor wrote me a prescription for something that's supposed to stem the flow (but only during heavy days) but it doesn't seem to work, although I should give it more than just one try I suppose. I'm supposed to take it on heavy days and for no more than 3 days, butÂ every day is a moderate to heavy day and I can't judge past that, so can I take it weekly? At any rate, I have to call on Tuesday for my bloodwork results then make another appointment with the doctor to do a few further tests and then...who knows? *sigh*My sister (the energy worker) has the alternative suggestion that I'm purging 'something' from my body (literally & figuratively) and that it has something to do with the past and our upbringing.It does make sense - she seems to think that once I've made up my mind about clearing a few things up (job?) that it will stop when I have cleared \"it\" out. This makes sense to me, so I have a couple of days right now to focus a little bit on what I need to do and sort myself out.Otherwise, I've been pretty happy. I've had a couple of weekends in the Forest, getting caught up with my cousin and a friend, cat sitting, etc. Have been reading a couple of books that I'm enjoying (The Time Traveller's Guide to Elizabethan England\" and \"Finding Your Own North Star\") and have just bought myself a colouring book and coloured pencils!I'm really glad it's a long weekend! Hope you all have a great one!"},
{"title": "Date details...for real! :)", "date": "Friday 13 March 2015", "text": "While the day wasn't so great at work - one of the installers mentioned I didn't \"look very happy today\" - the evening WAS.I opted to just wear something I'd be comfortable in, rather than feeling not entirely myself in a dress or something, even though I have a dress that I really like.He picked me up (!) and we went for Thai food at a place in a village called Weybridge, which is very well-heeled (has the street with the priciest real estate in England so that should tell you a bit about the High Street too) and about 15 minutes drive. He ordered the wine - I don't usually drink it, but...okay! - and bought dinner and we spent three hours just chatting. The restaurant actually closed at 10:30, but we were there until 11:00, along with a couple of other tables. The servers were hovering a bit, bless them.The food for the most part was delicious. He had some prawns which were a bit overdone, but overall it was terrific. If there's one thing I like to do, it's eat, so I think I have a box very firmly ticked there.He's funny and interesting and entertaining and easy to talk to, even though he goes off in tangents. I do the same thing if I'm honest. It can take me ages to make a point, if I even get there, which I don't always. He told me he finds me really hard to read - I do tend to play my cards pretty much superglued to my chest - so was (pleasantly, I hope) surprised to find out that I was working up the courage to ask him out, pretty much the same way he asked me. So there's definitely a mutal attraction, which is always a good way to start...something. The co-worker aspect is a bit awkward, but as this isn't a \"thing\" yet, I think we're okay.But I had one of the nicest evenings I've had in a very long time.

I've sent him a text and am waiting to hear confirmationomgIn other news, I've given notice atÂ my job. I called my sister one night last week in tears and we talked for over an hour. I've been really unhappy, unproductive and unsupportive for ages and it was starting to affect me physically, mentally and emotionally obviously. I've given 3 months notice, but if there's a possibility to stay on in a less stressful position I'd like to. Otherwise, I'm going to peruse the job sites for a new position. I think I want to stay in the area, just not the job I'm currently in. We'll see how things pan out. I do, however, already feel better for having given it up. My friend needs someone she can count on, rely on, who can back her up and support her and I'm currently doing none of those things. She interviewed a fellow on Friday who seems quite keen and has a background in surveying, purchasing, construction and admin, so I think it will be a good fit. He lives in the next town and strikes me as very sharp. She's worried he doesn't have a sense of humour, but it's not like if it's not a good fit (either way) we can't get anyone else. It would just be nice to have someone very business-minded, like my friend is.I joined the gym last week, had my induction and then promptly got sick, so haven't even gone once yet! Got a great routine, though, from the young lady who toured me around. It's going to be quite challenging, which is terrific. Determined to start this week, as I'm feeling much better. The Crush brought me soup (homemade to boot!) which was delicious - tomato, red pepper and a 'hint of chili' which was actually a BIG hint. Fantastic, but boy oh boy, I'm a lightweight!I'm becoming friendly with my rooming neighbour as well, which is great. She's a Bulgarian woman and we spend time chatting sometimes when our paths cross. It's nice to have someone to talk to on occasion. I've been going out for drinks with work colleagues too once in a while, so I'm enjoying my time here a bit more. Catching up on my reading and watching \"Dexter\" on DVD in the evenings, texting with The Crush.It's all good. :)"},

I thought for sure the garage had forgotten about me and fixing the rear taillight, but I got a call on Friday to let me know that the car would be picked up today to finally be repaired. I requested a courtesy car and got a brand new little Nissan Micra. Nice, zippy little car. No idea how long I'll have it, but as none of this is costing me anything, it doesn't really matter.I've just settled into a new space, where I've committed to be for six months. It's not as cosy or colourful as my room in the Forest, but it's all what you make it and as I've only been here about 3 hours, this is its current state. The landlady is clearing out a cupboard for me in the kitchen, and a small space in the fridge (which is slightly larger than bar size anyway, typical of English kitchens), so I'll have a bit more room when my dishes and food items are tucked away elsewhere. Despite moving only from one room to another, it would appear I have too much stuff. It seems I'll have to spend time decluttering, which is not a bad thing at all.I have only one wardrobe and a small one at that (the door on the right). The other door holds the boiler/water heater so is of no use to me. I do have the spaces on the top of the built ins, however, although I'll stick with just putting my plants there, as I don't know how sturdy they are. I have a small storage dresser and that's about it right now. I'll be making another run to the Forest on the weekend and will be bringing back another storage unit with me, but I don't want to get carried away.The pros:1) 5-minute commute to work!!2) free time again - to read, stay up a bit later, go for a walk...3) reasonable rent - Â£450 p/m, which is only Â£50 more than I was paying my cousin. Plus I'm saving over Â£300 a month in gas, so really a win-win there.4) Close to a gym & a library!5) I have a new place to explore!6) I'm feeling a bit more independent, even though it's not a full flat of my own (which is not doable on the salary I'm currently making)Cons:1) No cousin company!2) No cat!3) No full house access4) No New Forest5) I have to make my own dinner (:P)6) the mattress is hard...I'll be collecting my foam topper this weekend.I can't really make a thorough list either way until I've been here a few weeks and seen how things go. The walls are thin and I can hear neighbours, I overlook the rear of the building and as we're in flats situated over businesses, it could get noisy at stupid o'clock.Â Still, here I am. Let's see where we go from here..."},
{"title": "Up and down and up and downupdownupdownup...", "date": "Saturday 24 January 2015", "text": "My home away from home. :)It's been another rocky week work-wise. It started out well enough, hit a rough patch in the middle and then smoothed over by Friday, which is not a bad way to end a week all things considered.On an UP financial note, the funds from my cashed out CSBs were deposited into my bank account and I now have the funds to hammer down my debt for at least 6-8 months if I manage them properly. Hurrah! A bit less stress there at least.I am realizing that I'm spending far too much time stressing about my finances than I need to so am trying to figure out the best way to clear them with the least fuss possible. I've sent an email to my mum's lawyer in Victoria to get some details about Power of Attorney (approx $250) so that once I decide what to do, it can be done. My choices are (short term),pay off the LLP/RRSP with my LOC & funds from CSBs, leaving me with a $5k increase in LOC and not much to cover my MC & LOC repayments;put $1k into my RRSP from my CSBs, leaving me with enough funds for MC, LOC repayment and meeting my obligation to the LLP repayment scheme for this year; orpay off my MC with the funds from CSBs ($1662.38), put $1k into RRSP for LLP repayment scheme, and use the rest to chip away at the LOC with mostly min payments until I get myself sorted out.The least stressful option is #2, the most ideal #3. Long term, the amount I'm looking at cashing out is over $30k and miserable exchange rate notwithstanding, once everything is paid off and exchanged and whatnot, I'll wind up with less than Â£10K, but it's still a deposit on an apartment, car repairs, emergency fund, savings, a trip somewhere, fun, etc., etc. It will count as income for next year, but that should clear everything and I'll be able to leave it all behind me.Then that will be that.Down: Work wise things are still not without curve balls. One of the fellows who opens the yard at 6:15 is on holiday for two weeks, so that means someone else has to open early until he gets back. That came down to me and my friend. I tried for two days - getting up at 4 a.m., on the road by 5, but home at 3:30 - and it was a disaster. Does. Not. Work. So my friend is doing it instead, as it really doesn't seem to bother her. Quite the opposite, actually. She was on fire Friday. I rolled in at 7:30 and had a great day, so now we know.Up/Down: we had another chat about various things, mostly work-related and cleared some more air. She realized that no matter how hard she is on me, she will never match how hard I am on myself when I do something wrong.Down: It ended on a very sour note when we learned that the funding for our main installation scheme has been stopped until at least April (industry-wide, not just us) which meant immediate installer layoffs. Shitty. Really, really hope to see them back sooner rather than later, but it's unlikely. The funding process is quite complicated, involving the Goverment and the energy companies, carbon scores, etc. and if the funds to pay for these schemes (there are several) dries up, so does the work. It's unclear at this point if we in the office are totally safe, but for the time being, yes.Up: The Crush was in for a good part of the day and I managed to make some conversationÂ with him at the end of the day while he was waiting to see the MD. He made tea, I shared biscuits and we talked a bit.Â UP: He looks superb in a t-shirt. There are worse images than a well-built man in a t-shirt that can be burned into your retinas."},
{"title": "Cash outs, cars and work stuff", "date": "Saturday 17 January 2015", "text": "The Blue Rooster of Trafalgar SquareI believe I've shared the above photo before, or at least a similar one, but I think it's just so much fun I had to post it again!This week has been a bit crazy. I've had several bollockings (I love that word!) at work for things that were - or weren't - done as asked. All deserved, but something I need to work harder at avoiding, so have noted the issues. Part of the problem is that my brain seems extra-fuzzy at the moment (I'm not eating right or drinking enough water) and nothing is sticking, not even when I write it down. I'm feeling desperate to get to a gym, but unclear where exactly it would fit into my current lifestyle. Do I rejoin the one in the Forest and go when I get back from work (7:30) or go straight after work in Chertsey and get home an hour later? I'll have to look into the Chertsey gym as it would mean missing the worst of the traffic if I did that, so that should count as motivation on its own.The commute hasn't been too crazy this week. The drive home always feels faster and I seem to arrive at my travel points much more easily than I do on the morning run. It's absolutely miserable when it's raining, but on a typical night it's not so bad.Renee Verde is running well. I FINALLY managed to get her into the local garage this morning to have the temperature sensor replaced (it's only taken me two weeks). I called my CC company this morning to prepare them for a big hit and to let them know it would be okay, as it was me doing it. An hour after I presented my car for the work, it was complete and I took a deep breath as the jobsheet was handed over. I think I squawked. Â£83.10!!! I was anticipating two or three times that amount, so to say that I'm pleased is an understatement. I also want to take her over to have them look at the list of things I was given in Chertsey and give me a second opinion. I still have to get a few things done and want to make sure it's all absolutely necessary. If I can save some Â£Â£Â£, it will be worth it. The new temperature sensor will stop me worrying if the car is overheating and the fellow topped up the coolant as well, so I'm all set there.My cousin and I then went to do a grocery shop and spent over Â£100! That's a big one for us, but we got lots of stuff for the freezer and I got more apples and snacks for work (like hummous & rice cakes, some fruity biscuits and things like that). New Year's resolution for both of us: stop wasting so much food! We're truly terrible in that respect. I bought some coconut milk this time, too. I don't like milk much, but drink a lot of tea and feel that I can cut back a little bit there.On an accomplishment roll, I then figured out how to cash out my Canada Savings Bonds. I was a bit sad to do it, as I do like the CSBs, but it simply doesn't make sense to have money \"stored\" when I still have debt. Besides, the amount of interest I'm making on the CSBs is so small, it's hardly worth it, because the of the higher CC and LOC interest rates. So in about 4 days I will have another $2,899.17 towards my debt!The next step is to find out how much a Power of Attorney costs, as I need some \"fiddling\" to clear the remaining debt. I'm not sure what I'd like to do is possible, or makes sense to do, but it's the only way I can think of to fully clear it. I have two RRSPs. One is locked in, one is flexible. I'm hoping that I can cash out the locked in one and use the funds to pay off the remaining LLP amount (approx $8600) owing to the flexible plan (which is where it came from), my LOC ($5800), and then just get the rest transferred to me here, although the exchange rate is horrendous right now. I can't do anything at all from here, so it would have to be done with a PoA. Hm. I have to look into this. I'll ask my mum to ask her lawyer how much it would cost to get a PoA done and get some guidance from my bank about cashing out over the next couple of months. I'll have plenty in the bank to continue monthly payments in the meantime, so at least I'm not stressing about that on top of everthing else. This is part of what the psychic said - I know what I need to do, I just need to do it, clear it and let it go.Anyone have any insight/thoughts/etc on that? I'd love some feedback."},
{"title": "Finding some direction - in just a week!", "date": "Saturday 10 January 2015", "text": "This time last week I was feeling melancholy and a bit directionless. I was looking forward to a reading from a psychic and needing to talk with my friend on Monday when we started back at work.Thanks for your comments and support. It means a lot and honestly helped.I was dreading the drive to Chertsey on Monday morning, and of course didn't sleep well the night before because of it. When I arrived I was tired, which always makes things seem worse than they are (because then you start to look for - and find! - things like: why no one loves you or ever will and why you suck at work/in general and why am I here and what's going on in the world anyway, etc., etc., ad naseum). The first thing my friend said to me was, \"You and I are having a conversation this morning.\" !! So we did.The peanut shell version of the \"Friend as Boss\" chat is this: I am NOT obligated to stay at this job if I'm not happy or if something better comes along (I was feeling like I'd trapped myself by saying 'yes,' when that is quite distinctly NOT the case); she separated the friend vs business aspect of things; I have a new job title and a new wage starting Feb 1; there is a 6-month probationary period on said new position; I went to look at a room; and I feel a gazillion times better.The new job title is Admin Supervisor and comes with a Â£2k - Â£3k p/yr raise (!) and I'm absolutely fine with the probationary period. I'm not convinced it's for me (or me for it), so having a finite period of time gives everyone options.The room I saw was much nicer, brighter and bigger than it looks online (as they tend to be), it was in a good location and the price is definitely right, but the kitchen is teensy and it just doesn't have the tranquil, comfortable aura that I'm looking for. More student-ish than professional grown-up. I sent a query for a room that's just a few minutes drive away which I think will be more comfortable, so we'll see what happens with that. I can't say I'm putting considerable effort into it necessarily, but I feel much better for being proactive, even if I get so ridiculously picky/fussy that nothing ever comes of it.The first part of the week started off well, but ended with a bit of a bump only because I was so tired after the first full week back. I have incomplete workÂ on my desk and lost my mojo halfway through Thursday AND Friday. Our office junior wasn't in Wed & Thurs because she didn't have any bus fare. Friday we got paid and she tried, but the Transit Gods weren't on her side and she texted at 11:00 to say she'd been waiting 45 minutes for a bus. We sent her home because it just wasn't worth her coming in at that point as we were winding up at 4pm anyway. It just means work remains undone and looming, so we're considering a new junior. Preferably one who has a car and can get to work when we need them. Anyway, it's a discussion for next week. I'm going to have a gentle conversation with her before my friend brings down the hammer. So that's disappointing. We're hoping she has a good think over the weekend and decides that it's not the best job for her after all.Otherwise I think I've been doing much better as the \"obligation weight\" has lifted and I'm not feeling so trapped. Even the commute has been better, partially because I've actually been sleeping much better!Â It was a quiet week, no installers (they're back on Monday) and for the most part just me and my friend in the office. It was nice, actually. Quite chill.This morning I took myself to the psychic. It was an hour's drive (easy peasy these days) to a very pretty market town called Farnham. She has a delightful little cottage just off the High Street and I spent an hour with her. I recorded it and I'm really glad I did, as I wouldn't remember half of it had I not. She said she doesn't usually let people record it unless they ask, and she's glad I was able to as it was a lot even for her.She does several tarot card spreads and elaborates on that. But, for the sake of clarity (and the fact I have to review it again) this are the basics of what she said:I arrived (at the appointment) with my guardian angel, who she could see. He andÂ I have been together in a past life; there was also materal energy around me, likely my maternal grandmother. She vists and sits with me at night sometimes apparently. They are there to let me know I'm not alone, although I feel like I am.There was a 'baby' card (The Empress) which didn't really make any sense to me because children aren't something I've ever spent much time considering, although I have lost one in the past, so that's possibly where that came from.Sadly, the handsome Scot does not feature (as I'd like) in my future, although a mad crush is never a bad thing. There is definitely a man, however.There was a lot of information coming in which she said was quite scattered and seemed a bit unrelated, but would all eventually mesh together as it's meant to.The job is not what I want either (true) and doing admin work isn't what I love, but a new job will come after I meet this mystery man, which is approximately six months time. I need to stay put (home wise), so the commute is, at this point, a necessary evil so to speak. If I move, I won't meet this man, you see...She touched on feeling lonely and depressed; I need to stop \"opening the box\" on my last relationship, lock it up and be done with it for good.My concerns/issues/worries over money are affecting my health (!), so I need to just deal with it - do what needs to be done - and let it go and simply believe and trust that I have enough.Any and all decisions must be made with my heart; letting my head get involved will be disastrous. I'm far, far more spiritually sensitive than I acknowledge and have to remain open to that, pay attention and just know that my heart will never steer me wrong.People see me much differently than I see myself; I'm not allowing myself to really be me, to my own detriment.I'm staying in England. Canada is more or less done and dusted, and I'll return for visits, but not to live, at least not for another decade or so.This man is \"IT\" - the love I've been waiting for and wanting and I'll end up moving to be with him - not necessily moving in with him to start, but definitely close, to be with him. Ultimately we will end up living together though (\"marriage\", but not necessarily married - committed).I get in my own way...I know what I need to do, I just don't do it...Â :PThere's more, but I need to listen to it again a couple of times. I found myself in tears several times during the reading, but not unhappy tears. It's more I felt...overwhelmed, but not in a bad way. It's hard to describe exactly.Overall, it's been a good week. The installers are back on Monday, including The Crush (which I'm looking forward to regardless of how he figures - or doesn't - in my future) and I have things to plan for and look forward to and take care of.Clarity is nice."},
{"title": "Feeling a bit melancholy...", "date": "Sunday 4 January 2015", "text": "Only 4 days in and I'm feeling a bit melancholy and am having difficulty gathering enthusiasm for the new year. I think part of the melancholy is that it's my dad's birthday today. He would have been 83, but has been gone for 33 years. I'm almost the same age he was when he died and sometimes reflecting on things makes me wonder who I'd be, what I'd be like, what I'd be doing, etc., if he were still here to guide me. He is, of course, but just in a different form.But of course I am who I am and where I am partly because he isn't here. There's still unresolved & untouched grief, which is incomprehensible to some people, but I think I've mentioned before that I work really hard at keeping my emotions under lock & key. Although, as I get older, I find them sneaking out unexpectedly, so perhaps this year I really just need to be okay with them as they are and let them come and go as they need to.Otherwise, generally things are a bit...I'll say unclear. I'm broke. I still have a list of car repairs (which is why I'm broke), I'm not convinced that my job is where I'm going to be by the end of the year, unless something really big happens (a move &/or more solid staff/managing), and I'm struggling at this point not to just say 'F&*!k it' and give up on everything and go to bed for a year instead.Being proactive is the key, I think. Searching out rooms that are closer to work, going to see them and chatting with people about them, will do wonders for my mindset. There are some really lovely places out there. Being able to have a LIFE outside work is vital, and that's the part that's eluded me since I started this job. There's a gym in Chertsey, but unless I'm nearby, there doesn't seem much point joining at the moment (plus, I have no cash to do so). One thing at a time. I think that's a good place to start.Too much sugar and junk over the holidays, feeling unfocused and the \"re-impending\" commute have all conspired to gang up on me and make me a bit morose. I think I need to have a conversation with my friend about the job and where she honestly thinks it's going and let her know that while I trust and have faith in her that there's a proverbial light & tunnel thing happening, I don't have the same trust & faith in the managing director and if he can't pull his thumb out in the next 6 months, I'm going to look for something else. I'm making Â£20 a week more than I was when I was working at the hospital and it's so not worth it right now.Anyway, thanks for listening all. Hope your New Year is off to a better start than mine! xx"},
{"title": "Happy New Year!", "date": "Thursday 1 January 2015", "text": "How many will be starting the New Year like this? ;)Here we are again, at the cusp of a brand new year and brimming with enthusiasm, potential and - always! - hope.I had a very quiet New Year. My cousin went to stay with a friend she hasn't seen properly in ages, so I was left to my own devices. Those devices were:decks of Tarot cards for a reading or twoCrabbie's Raspberry Ginger Beer x 2 (the second of which, er, precluded a second card reading *ahem*)Facebook (not always a good idea, but in this case actually quite good because it led to the idea below)Watching the movie, \"New Year's Eve\"Overall, 2014 has been pretty amazing. I honestly can't think of anything ridiculously tragic or awful that happened to me - I'm very fortunate in that respect. I've had a year of learning and growing and just being genuinely happy with my experiences.I've had a great holiday so far. I spent 5 days in Somerset with my sister where we did lots of dog walks, resting, relaxing and riding! I haven't been on a horse in years and I got to go TWICE while I was there, which was fantastic. I went with someone - fortunately who has much more experience than me - and both times enjoyed it immensely. Horses are really amazing creatures. If I were more tecnologically inclined, I would upload the photos to the computer from my phone, but the logic is completely eluding me today, so perhaps the next post.So what of my challenges for 2015? Well, the furthest I've got is having someone to kiss at midnight next New Year's Eve! Hahaha! Preferably sooner, but it's a start. Also to take on the aspects of the Goddess Aphrodite: wild & lustful, yet soft, femininity. Be more girly (The Crush makes me want to be a full-on girly girl - a surprise, as I'm barely 'girl' as a rule - hahaha!) but kick it up a notch basically. So, we'll see. Definitely a challenge for someone who prefers to blend into the background!I've also booked a reading with a psychic for January 10. My friend has highly recommended her and although it's about an hour's drive from here, I'm really curious to see what she has to say! All she has is my name, which she sits with until she sees you apparently.I'm going for coffee on Saturday with a lady I worked with at the hospital. She's very funny and we had some great conversations, so I'm really looking forward to it. I want to start the new year out basically fresh and with less stuff, so a good declutter of my drawers, wardrobe and shelves is also on the to do list. I still have time to write my list of goals/challenges, which will hopefully happen over the next few days too. I'll post it when I've got it finished.My car was in the shop yesterday for yet another repair. *Sigh* The temperature sensor is broken, so the car has no idea if it's overheating or not. This apparently also affects the anti-freeze, which was empty when I opened the hood the other day. I wangled an appointment at the garage up the street thinking it was an easy fix (take the cap of the fluid container and buy some new fluid, 10 mins tops) and it's turned into another epic. The part needed has to be ordered from Renault, in France (damn those foreign cars!) and it'll take approximately TWO WEEKS to get here. This is partly because the age of the car precludes them from carrying it in stock, I imagine. I wasn't charged for the work done yesterday, but they are leaving the job sheet open, so it'll be added to the next lot. In the meantime, I have to keep an eye on the antifreeze and top up when needed, which I hope isn't going to be a daily occurance! I'll buy a couple of container and check it regularly to make sure all is well(ish). Man. The lady took great care of her car - but only to a point obviously as I've got stuck with seemingly every general maintenance repair there is.Anyway, what are you going to do? I can't afford a new car, so it's patch up the current one and make it last as long as I can.Happy 2015 everyone! I'm looking foward to following you all again this year and seeing what's in store for everyone. It's always so exciting! xxx"},
{"title": "Rushing headlong into the season", "date": "Saturday 20 December 2014", "text": "MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU!Thank you for continuing to follow and support me through my English adventures.Â It means more to me than you know.This is likely my last post for this year, so wanted to post an update before everything (including my brain) shuts down for the season.It's getting to that time where I need to make some more challenges for myself - real, honest to god challenges this time, ones that not only push me out of my comfort zone but actually forcefully throw me. I need some shakeups this year - I'm feeling a bit complacent and need to show myself what I can do. I have two weeks to think about it.Yesterday I told my friend I have a mad crush on one of the men we work with. He's Scottish and has a bit of a dark history apparently. So it's a mix of bad boy, a fab accent (a very broad one) and pure sex appeal. He's also just a really decent guy. Reason 'A' the crush is good: it means I'm not dead (it's been a long time...)! Reason 'B': see above re: challenges, as my friend told me he's single. I now have to push to change my thought pattern from \"Why would he go out with ME?\" to \"I'm a helluva catch. Why wouldn't he?\" Right? :) And try not to go ridiculously girly in the meantime.Work is frustrating to say the least. It's ridiculously unorganized and pressured, but we are slowly (so. very. slowly) making headway. Part of the problem is that the MD throws out so many ideas and to dos that no one can get anything done because he keeps changing his mind and adding to things (we have a bit of a reprieve right now as he's on vacation until Jan 15). Also, there's no follow-up on problems that should have been taken care of months ago. Add to that the fact that I'm so tired that I was in tears mid-week and you can see where we are with things. Despite it all, I still have faith that we'll come out ahead on the other side. Somehow.My car is undergoing weekly repairs right now. I've already spent Â£500 tackling a laundry list of necessary repairs and I have at least that much more to go by the end of January. *Sigh* I've gone through my savings, but if I don't do the repairs, then the car is hooped and I have to start over again with job hunting, etc. and quite frankly, I don't want to do that, despite my ridiculous commute. Brakes, brake hoses, CV joint, alternator belt, timing belt & water pump (have to do this, the sooner the better) - all that fun stuff. PLUS she still needs the rear taillight fixed from where the delivery driver damaged it. But that's not coming out of my pocket, so that's something.I went looking for molasses today, as I want to make gingerbread this weekend. I'm still learning about what I can/can't get here: I can't get molasses. The grocery staff I asked knew what it was (well, most of them did), but no one could tell me if they had it. It turns out that to make gingerbread here, I need black treacle. I can get away with being a bit 'dumb', as it's quite obvious, once I open my mouth, that I'm not English and therefore need more help. ;)I'm also frustrated right now because I don't have a life outside of work. I'm on the road by 6 a.m. and home at 7:30 to eat dinner, spend an hour with my cousin and then I'm in bed by 9:00! I need to make more productive use of my weekends and go for walks in the evening, despite it not being the most ideal area for walking (sidewalk & light wise, I mean, not safety). I have some time off between Christmas and New Year, so will make myself go for walks in the Forest, to get some exercise and out of the house.I'm so looking forward to the holidays and having a rest. I'll be spending a few days with my sister in Somerset, then coming back to the New Forest. I'm hoping to relax enough that my first day back at work goes perfectly - from morning commute to evening return. The installers won't be back at work until the following week, so it's just us office angels that will be holding down the fort... :PBest wishes to all of you over the holidays xxxxxxx"},
{"title": "Pooped!!", "date": "Saturday 6 December 2014", "text": "The fam.What an exhausting week! The commute hasn't been too bad, considering there are billions of people on the road every morning (okay, a SLIGHT exaggeration: I actually mean millions). The only drawback is the lack of good sleep I feel.I get home each night by 7:30, eat with my cousin, chat and watch some TV for an hour, then am in bed at 9:00 to read a bit, and lights out so I can get up and on the road by 6:00. To be fair, that gets me to Chertsey up to an hour before I start work, but if I left it any later, the traffic would be horrific(er). I can sit at the coffee shop for a half hour and relax a bit after my drive, so I actually prefer this routine.I decided not to take the room that my co-worker has available (I still do have to tell her this, however), mainly because I'm not convinced of compatibility, personality-wise. She's nice enough - as am I - but I'm not convinced it would be a great fit. Plus, my cousin is feeling quite down at the moment, and I want to be here as much as I can for her. My friend did mention that her cousin might be amenable to a weekday renter, as he had offered her his spare room. I said I would think about it and let her know on Monday. He lives about 30 miles away, in the Gatwick airport vicinity. So, possibly another option.As I said, though, the drive hasn't been too awful this week. I did have an awful night on Tuesday. I woke up at 2 a.m. (no idea why) and just dozed until 5:00. Needless to say I was pretty much a drooling mess by the time 2 p.m. rolled around and ended up booking a hotel for Wednesday night. The hotel was at Gatwick Airport (cheap!), a bit of a dump and - likely because I forgot my earplugs - quite noisy, so I had a miserable night there instead.Yesterday should have been a good day, simply by virtue of being Friday, and it started out okay, but fell apart around noon. We had some deadlines to hit (barely made them), had work returned to us because some of it was improperly filed by the company who sent it to us (it meant I had to fiddle about to get the proper paperwork, adding time to the process), the installers had an hour of frustration and ranting, my friend was near tears as she was being pulled in so many directions - many of which are completely unrelated to her office manager position - but she always seems to rally by the end of the day. She deserves 4 day weekends as far as I'm concerned.I do like being busy, but I don't handle stress well and I keep forgetting to drink my water, even though I take a 1L bottle with me every day. I'm still doing okay with the eating, but can do much better, so have to focus more. Still feeling a bit more clear headed now that I'm not eating bread as often as I used to. I love my bread, but apparently it doesn't love me, so I'm learning to leave it alone.Several hours in pretty Lyndhurst this afternoon helped raised my and my cousin's moods. We had an okay lunch at one of the many restaurants (we try to go to a different one each time we go) and I picked up a few things, including a pair of new slippers, which are cute AND comfy. My old ones have too many holes to keep my feet warm anymore, but I'll be keeping them around as an extra pair for a little while yet. I also bought a couple of books and a Christmas present.One thing I love about England is that it's so dog friendly. We were having lunch and a couple with a beautiful Bernese Mountain Dog came in and sat down for a meal. No one blinked an eye and the owner piped up with \"How's my favourite dog today?\" People at home would s*%t if a dog was brought into any kind of building, never mind a tiny restaurant where they cook basically out in the open. I love the fact the dogs (as long as they and their owners are well-behaved) are welcomed so warmly. Not everywhere, of course, but many, many more places than at home.Strictly Come Dancing tonight - week 11 - and thoroughly enjoying the show. It's the quarter-finals and very exciting. Who knew that I - who is most definitely not a dancer - would love a dancing show so much?"},
{"title": "Commuting costs and update", "date": "Saturday 29 November 2014", "text": "Lyndhurst Village High Street.The pictures were taken earlier in the year, but still highlight the charm of the New Forest. Lyndhurst is the Administrative Centre, where all decisions concerning the forest are discussed, decided, recorded, maintained and put forward.One of half a dozen donkeys grazing in the area.Cows at large near Bolton's Bench, Lyndhurst.Ponies at Bolton's Bench, Lyndhurst (one is wearing a reflective collar, which is designed to help prevent collisions with cars - but drivers, it's actually YOUR responsibility to prevent this, so please SLOW DOWN in the Forest).Hard to believe November is, for all intents and purposes, over. Christmas is looming and then there's another brand new year right around the corner! I started the month with a week off, a plan to join Nanowrimo to write my No 1 Best Seller, and a two-week job trial and I finish it off with a permanent job, 1500+ more miles on my car, no book, a hit to my savings, but also down another $400 in debt.The new job is great if I'm honest. Absolutely frustrating and exhausting but there's so much potential for growth that if we can make it through the next few weeks, we're golden. There's a huge amount of organization needed, but we've just hired an office junior to help with the little things (filing, photocopying, scanning, answering the phone, etc) which allows the Office Manager and me to get on with the bigger things - the ones that bring in money.The commute is 1.5-2 hours each way and is deathly boring, but I'm actually already getting used to it (scary!). I get more stressed out if it's raining, as I don't like driving at night and when you add rain, it just makes it worse, but ultimately my goal is to find somewhere mid-way between my cousin's place and work. That won't be for awhile, though, but I'm already looking. There are huge costs involved in a move and I just don't have funds for that at this point. It's actually easier for me to drive every day and fill up twice a week.It will be easier to set up a budget now that I've had my first paycheque and have an idea of what I'm earning. We get paid weekly, but two weeks behind. There is overtime available sometimes, which I'm happy to do, but I would stay in town overnight in that case instead of coming all the way back to the Forest (which, I realize, slightly negates the point of overtime, but makes more sense) and then going back again in the morning.Cash-wise I'm down more than I'd like in my savings to cover some of the initial travelling expense (gas), but will now be putting that money back weekly, so am not worried and hope to see a steady increase there.My debt is also steadily decreasing and I'm down to $7600 from almost $14000 at the beginning of the year. I removed my ticker thingees because I wasn't keeping up with them and could never remember my password to get into them. I know I won't make my goal of paying it all off this year, but I've managed to get almost halfway and I'm very, very pleased by that. I'd like to see my debt at zero by the end of next year and my savings over Â£1000.I'm doing well with my eating too. I started out buying lunches and breakfasts from the cafe on the trading estate, but it's all fried food which, while quite delicious, is absolutely no good for me on a daily (or twice-daily) basis. So I've been eating apples (Pink Lady), hard boiling eggs, nuts, and buying ready-to-eat salads from the grocey store and have been managing very well on those for the past week and a half. The salads are very simple, but they fill me up and they aren't expensive. I've also had containers of pineapple to snack on during the day too. If I'm spending 12 hours a day sitting down, I need to make sure that whatever goes in my mouth is going to work for me, rather than against me. So far, so good.My cousin and I went to a pub quiz last Sunday and came away with a Â£10 gift card as third place winners (our second win!). It was a lot of fun, but quite a tricky one, and I find them challenging because they're very English-centric - obviously. There was actually a Canadian question, but I got one wrong (not really), which I absolutely questioned. Canadians, back me up here: Ottawa is NOT one of the top 5 Canadian cities by population, am I right? According to the quiz answers it is. Vancouver, our number 2, was nowhere in sight and that's what I questioned.Regardless, I get stupid excited about quizzes, pub or other. I love them. I'm not particularly good at them, but they're fun and that's the part I like. There are about half a dozen quiz shows on TV and I'm going to fill out an application form for one for my cousin and I. No guarantees, but what the heck. We went to another one on Thursday night which was a charity fund raiser. It started at 8pm and we didn't get home until after 11:00! There were about 200 people there. It was fun and dinner was included (a delicious but titchy one), but by the time we'd finished we were hot and had mostly lost our enthusiasm and motivation.Â We didn't win, in case you were wondering!My Nanowrimo efforts have been, for the most part, a bust. I'm not even halfway to my 50,000 word mark, but have been surprised where the story went. I had hoped to start my first mystery series, but I'm getting more of a romance with an unexpected character popping up. There's a vague mystery (I've killed someone off), but I'm not sure how - or if - I'll carry on with that. Still, it might give me something to chip away at and who knows? I may come up with something complete after all.This weekend is quiet and restful. I have a Skype session with a friend tomorrow evening and that's the extent of my excitement. I am going to add a bit more to my writing, get some supplies (food) for the coming week and add a touch of oil to the car, but that's about the extent of it."},
{"title": "What a week!", "date": "Sunday 16 November 2014", "text": "Cemetary near Winchester, where we went hunting for a family member.I looked to see if I could find what this building actually is, but no luck. It looks to be churchlike and is obviously medieval, but that's the best I can do for the moment, unfortunately.We visited the city about two weeks ago. My cousin is the genealogical whiz of the family (for my mother's side) and her search has led her all over the UK. One of our distant relatives is supposed to be buried in the cemetary, but it was a bit of a futile search, as we had no plot number or specific area. We spent about an hour or so looking with no luck, so will return at a later date with hopefully better luck.Â I hadn't been to Winchester yet, but it's quite a lovely city, from what little I saw. A medieval market town (so very expensive), but with a river - the Itchen - flowing through it. Definitely a place to return to. Plenty of buildings built in that random medieval way - not a straight line to be found!I had a week off after finishing my job at the hospital. It feels like so long ago now, but was only two weeks! During my week off, I started my Nanowrimo project and did quite well - I got over 13,000 words written, which is not bad. Since last Sunday, though, I've done nothing.I started a new job on Monday - ostensibly as a two-week temporary position, but really as a permanent one - and that's been keeping me stupidly busy. Not least because it can take me over two hours to get there! It's in a town called Chertsey, which is almost London (I would consider it Greater London, as it's just inside the M25). On a good day, it's a straightforward, fairly easy drive of about 1.25 hours, but otherwise it's a stop-and-go and can take much longer. To the point that after only TWO days doing this, I had to take a day off because I was so fatigued I didn't feel safe to drive (after coming home in the rain the night before too, which just makes things worse). I also ended up staying in town at a B&B for two nights so have now essentially worked a week for free. :OMy decision, therefore, is to find a place to stay during the week and then come home on weekends. I don't want the wear and tear on my car (or me!) and this seems the best for all concerned. I like my sleep, don't like driving at night (particularly in the rain) and hate that my days are now all work-related. I basically get up, drive, work, drive, eat and go directly to bed. It's only been a week and I feel like I've been doing it for months!I'm sure it'll work itself into a routine eventually, but I'd still prefer to have a much shorter commute to be honest particularly if there are issues on the main routes. There are a variety of rooms available, most Mon-Fri, which are good to a point, albeit quite pricey. I'd prefer the option of a monthly rental that would allow me some flexibility of staying over on a weekend if I preferred or to leave Saturday morning and come back Sunday night sort of thing, rather than having to arrive Monday evening after work and then heading home on a Friday night, when traffic can be manic. Obviously I'd love a 5-minute commute, but I think that's a bit unrealistic at this point. So it means looking a bit further out, a little more driving but paying a bit less.I did go and see one on Friday that was quite lovely, but a bit pricey for what it is. And it's Mon-Fri and having thought about it, I don't have enough money for a deposit + rent and I'd really like the option of staying Friday night if I wanted.But I've just remembered that another staff member has a room she's desperate to rent near Heathrow for Â£400 a month...so I think I've just solved my problem! It'll only be temporary until I can get my own place, or something more suitable, but it would solve my initial issue. I'll talk to her on Tuesday when she's in.So far, though, I quite like the job. I've worked in a similar one (energy), the money is very good - and since I'm really focused on getting myself out of debt sooner rather than later, this is a good thing - there's huge potential for growth and it will ultimately lead to the next stage of my independence: having my own space to care for again (hopefully with pets allowed, as I'd love another cat or two). The town of Chertsey is very old - established somewhere around the 7thC! - and a mix of medieval, contemporary and everything in between. I haven't managed to explore it very well at all, although I have found the grocery store and the coffee shop (!), so I suppose that's a start. If I do move, I'd prefer to live south of the M25, still in Hampshire, somewhere between Chertsey and my cousin, so I don't have too much driving to do in either direction.I'm exhausted from having to concentrate so hard on the road. There are hundreds of thousands of people on the motorway, speeding along, and I get really stressed out, although sometimes you can't tell that you are until you get to your destination and you unclench everything! :P I'm just not used to the speeds, amount of traffic and small roads yet, but it's getting there. I just like to make sure I'm well rested before putting myself behind the wheel that's all. Sometimes I am and sometimes I'm not as much as I'd like, which is why I erred on the side of caution last week and begged off (good thing my friend knows me).So at the moment the only downside is the awful commute which will hopefully not be so much of an issue shortly."},
{"title": "One year anniversary!", "date": "Sunday 2 November 2014", "text": "It's truly autumn when the pigs are on the Forest hoovering up the acorns.Â Okay, so technically, my anniversary was LAST Sunday, but the fact remains that I've been here a year - ALL READY!!! Unbelieveable really, it's gone so quickly.And it's been fantastic so far. Honestly! I've been thoroughly enjoying myself and feel more at peace - and happier - than I have in a long, long time. I've had a few down days, but nothing out of the ordinary and have picked myself up much more quickly. I attribute much this to living with my cousin. Having someone to talk to at the end of the day, do things with, and just spend time with makes a HUGE difference and it's been wonderful getting to know her again. It could have gone very badly, but after an initial \"getting to know each other\" phase, we're very compatible (for the most part) and have a great relationship. We spend a lot of time giggling, which I'm sure accounts for part of my improved frame of mind. Spending time on my own is fine, and necessary for my state of mind, but too much time by myself was the cause of my ultimate stagnation in Whitehorse (hindsight and all that).Anyhow, more changes are now afoot here in the New Forest.Â Two weeks ago I was told that my assignment was coming to an end (budgetary issues). My supervisor came down from one of the other sites to tell me in person. Apparently, I was supposed to be gone at the end of August, and she'd been pushing for me to stay, but could push no more. Disappointed is an understatement, as I've loved this job and had it been possible to stay on permanently, I would gladly have done so. But it's not my say-so, unfortunately. That's the thing with temping - the good jobs can come to an end too quickly and the not-so-good ones not soon enough!Â My last day was Friday and my manager ensured I had both his phone numbers (for referencing purposes). He and I got along well and I'm leaving confident that I will get support and positive recommendations from him. He dropped my name for a really decent position at the other site, too, so I have to finish that application before I forget. Â It's a Big Deal, as he's put his reputation on the line for me for that.It wouldn't be everyone's first choice for work, as I spent the majority of my days on my own. But I found it perfect because, a) there was zero contact with the public (a nice break), and b) I could get on and just get my work done. I listened to the radio and just concentrated on getting stuff done without any gossipy co-workers distractions apart from chatting occasionally with the guys, the parking attendant and various other visitors.The one surprising point of this was that when I contacted the Agency last Monday to ask 'what's next?' I was told they hadn't been informed that my last day was Friday. ?? Kind of weird (but not surprising according to one of the guys). Regardless, they now knew and while they didn't have anything at the moment, something would turn up. In the meantime, I accepted a two-week temp job from a friend who works near London, with the potential for permanency and then when I found a terrific sounding job opportunity in my in-box on Friday morning for a job 10-minutes from home, I was really torn. I sent my CV in anyway (just pre-interview stage at this point, so not actually worth getting worked up about...ahem...) and let the Agency know what was going on with the London job.I'll be commuting to the job near London every day at this point to try it out (1.5 hours each way - not a big deal Canadian distance-wise, but potentially a Big F*&^ing Deal here, as traffic gets utterly stupid along the route I have to take; train travel takes twice as long - I've already checked, as that's my preferred method of travelling that distance - and is ridiculously expensive, Â£55 PER DAY return. Option 2 was a B&B/guest house, but again, too much Â£Â£ for what I'd be making at this point).Â If I like it and take it on, I'd ultimately move to be closer. I'm leaning towards this job as I feel it's part of my next step: full independence. The money is decent, I'll be able to pay off my remaining debt more quickly than I am (O/T available!), and there's 'massive opportunities' according to my friend, which is great. In the current economy, a permanent job is a gift. Particularly one I've essentially been handed.Anyway, it's all quite exciting, but I've got this week off to reflect, rest and get a few things done. I've also started Nanowriomo (National Novel Writing Month), which happens every November. The idea is to write 50,000 words in a 30 days. I've done/\"won\" it before - 2004, if I remember correctly - and thought, 'what the heck?' I'm going in without a real idea (TheAsianPear is also taking part, but she has a concrete plan - very exciting!) and will see what happens. When it began, oh so long ago, the idea was to write without plot or plan. It was just you and a blank page, so the rules have become more flexible over the years.It started yesterday and where am I? Still at zero words, so I have to make serious inroads today and the rest of this week or I won't get it done. I'm basically ruling out progress during my time commuting, as it's going to be 12-hour days minimum and the last thing I'll feel like doing is writing. Still, it's a challenge and I'm curious to see what will pop up - I certainly surprised myself during my writing course at College, so who knows? I may actually end up with something that's feasible to pursue further. :)Along my morning route - the SeaCity Museum.Morning light in East Park. There are worse commutes!My little car had it's annual MOT (safety check) and passed with no isses, as I thought. Then I had to get my road tax (Â£145 p/a) so I can drive it. This is a new thing to me, as we don't pay car tax at home, so it's one of those things - like a TV license - that's new to me. I'm confident she'll tackle the commute with no problem, just not sure how I'll be feeling at the end of two weeks! Phew!Anyhow, my outstanding debt is coming down bit by bit, which I'm very pleased about. I won't be paid off by the end of the year as I'd hoped, but it will definitely be much less of a burden, particularly if I manage to secure a permanent job and have a regular, steady income. Much easier to make a budget and plan.Anyway, I must start my novel or it will never get done."},
{"title": "Fall (already!) update - photo heavy!", "date": "Sunday 5 October 2014", "text": "Renee Verde, a 1997 Renault Clio. Proud owner: ME! :)There I go again - sneaking away without telling anyone where I'm going and when I'll be back! I don't always feeling like posting either, so tend to put it off whereas it would be better to just pop in to say 'hello.' A very lovely lady (Jane) assures me that the community does like to hear from me, despite my less-than-regular updates. I appreciate that.All I can say is that I've been having a great time and am SO very glad I didn't put a time limit on this adventure. As it is, I'm finding it hard to believe I'll have been here a year at the end of October. Wow.So what have I been doing exactly?Work is going well. I'm at the same job, still enjoying it. I'm looking for a permanent job, but not very hard. It's the whole interview process that's sort of holding me back, as well as trying to figure out what I want to do. Admin is NOT well paid here - although admittedly, Yukon Government wages aren't necessarily a realistic comparison - depending on what level you're at, and although a PA is good money, I don't have the right type of personality for that and I'm not keen on the \"baby sitting\" aspect of it. So in that respect I'd like to go back to school, but I'm just not sure what I'd like to do. HR keeps popping up, so I'm considering that, but have to have a good think as education isn't cheap here either.I got a car (see above photo) at the end of July! Ridiculously excited about it, too, as it gave me my freedom and independence back. I bought it from a co-worker of my cousin - who had bought it from the original owner just six weeks previously - as her daughter was visiting from China for the summer. The car is PRISTINE - honestly! - as the original owner babied it and essentially kept it in a garage the whole time. She hardly drove it at all, really. The purchase price was less than Â£600, I got a great price on the insurance, and am looking to the end of October now, when both road tax & MOT are due. I have to change my Canadian driver's licence over, but need to talk to someone at the DVLA about that as I actually already have a British driver's licence, but haven't seen/used it since 1986, so have to figure out which is better to do. Sometimes this dual citizenship thing is a bit tricky...I was in Wales in July with my brother, SIL & sister for a weekend. We went to Skomer Island, which is a bird sanctuary in Pembrokeshire (far west) and home to tens of thousands of puffins, kittiwakes, razorbills, guillemots, various gulls and Manx Shearwaters (the bird nerds were particularly excited to see these lovely creatures - approx half the world's population of these birds nests on the Island!).Puffins are smaller than I thought, but lovely, funny little birds.The start of our evening boat trip.Herring gull guest. He smelled our fish and chips.Kittiwakes and Guillemots make their nests along ledges such as these.The evening was perfect, warm and sunny.Skokholm Island lighthouse.Puffins at their burrows.Pretty snail shells I found.Part of an old farm on the Island. Now a small hotel and the only building on the Island.Our lunch spot, on the North side of Skomer.Warnings in English and Cymru!I had a photo workshop in August, which was great. A group of only 3 of us (plus instructor) went onto the Forest to catch the colours of the heather. I enjoyed it very much and have another one booked with the same fellow at the beginning of November.If there are ponies anywhere in the vicinity, I will find a wayÂ toÂ include them in my photos. :)I start out doing what's we're working on (in this case the fall colours of the heather) and then get drawn into what's closer to the ground. The instructor suggested I might like his macro workshop. He might be right! :)My cousin is on holiday in Canada for 3 weeks - the first time in almost 20 years! - and is due back on Wednesday. From all accounts she's thoroughly enjoying herself and has managed to do both a lot and very little, which is great. She started out in BC, visiting family in Vancouver and Victoria and is now in Toronto, visiting an auntie and cousin there. I've missed her and I'm looking forward to hearing all about her time away.Â I've had two weeks off myself which has been absolutely fantastic! A friend from Whitehorse visited me for a week and we went to London for several days. We stayed with my brother & SIL, which will be the last time I see them (here) as they're moving to South Africa October 15th on a new adventure of their own. My friend and I walked for MILES and saw plenty of sights:Grand Union Canal, NW London.Daniel Craig at Madame Tussaud's!Regent's Park.Piccadilly Circus & the (in)famous Eros statue.Trafalgar Square - with a slightly surprising addition!Houses of Parliament & Big Ben at Westminster.Westminster Abbey.The London Eye.Tower of London and the WWI remembrance project. Those poppies are handmade in ceramic and 888,294 will be 'planted' until November 11, in remembrance of all the British soldiers who perished in WWI. It's quite a sight.My second week has been quieter but started out with a visit by the fabulous Jane! I was so excited to meet her after her week of walking in the Cotswolds. I picked her up at her B&B in Gloucestershire, and after a couple of wrong turns, we made it safely back to the New Forest where we sat and chatted over tea. After a week on the hoof, all she wanted was to sit and relax. We had a pub dinner and off she went the next morning on the final leg of her trip! I can confirm that she's as awesome as she comes across on her blog - thank you, Jane, for taking the time to come and seeÂ me. So fantastic to finally meet you!I joined the gym a couple of months ago and have sort of been going regularly. I've been almost every day last week, to get myself into a routine, but the evenings are the only time I can go and it tends to be packed, as that's the only time everyone else can go too, apparently. It gets a bit frustrating to wait for some of the machines, so I have forsaken an exercise on occasion and just kept moving, which I figure is better than standing around. It does help me relax and I am enjoying it, but I've also come home feeling really wound up because of the sheer number of people in the small space. I would go before work, but they don't open until 6:30 and I have to catch a train at 7:10. If I worked closer/started later, that would be ideal, but unfortunately that's not the case. It's been nice going during the day because there's hardly anyone there! :)Anyway, I think that's more than enough right now. I can't think of anything else really and those are definitely my highlights. I promise to try harder to post more regularly..."},
{"title": "England's New Forest", "date": "Saturday 12 July 2014", "text": "ND Chic had a few questions about the New Forest. I'm still at the beginning stages of learning about it, but it is one of the prettiest, most unique places I've ever been, so I thought I would try and share a little about it. My cousin's neighbour is very knowledgeable (and can get quite worked up) about the Forest and issues around it. I've got to put it on my to do list to go and visit her and take some notes.New Forest Pony at Bratley View.Keep in mind, there are various levels of management, many groups with their own agendas (for lack of a better word) and thousands of people involved with the Forest and its use. I am no expert, but this is a little of what I've learned since I've been here.The history of the Forest (at least recorded) goes back to William the Conqueror, in 1066. There's an entire Wikipedia page devoted to it, but suffice to say it's been around in it's protected form since that time. The ponies it's famous for (like the one above) pre-date his arrival. He created the area as a hunting ground for himself and it was first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.The management of the Forest falls to the following:Commoners: those who live in the Forest and have the Right of Common. I'm still a bit unclear on what exactly it is, but essentially it gives some New Foresters (not all) the right to depasture their animals in the Forest to graze. If I understand it correctly, the Right is attached to a property, not a person, and not everyone who has commoning rights attached to their property uses the right - there isn't money to be made by it these days and not everyone has animals to depasture. Still, without commoning, the Forest would be unmanageable, as it's the animals who shape and manage the foliage.Above the commoners there are a lot of levels, all responsible for different aspects: Verderers, Agisters, Keepers, Forestry Commission and the National Parks. Most of the land still belongs to the Crown.This link explains it much better than I can. It's quite a complicated chain of command. Maintaining the Forest bylaws - of which there are many - and being the people whoÂ \"arrest settlement by the local inhabitants\"Â are the Verderers. Basically, if you want to build, add to or modify your property in any way and your plans infringe on the Forest, you will need to modify or start again if they don't approve it. The Verderers also have the 'bible' of Forest Rights which, for a fee, you can review to see if your property holds any of these:\"Commoners of the New Forest are those who occupy land or property to which attaches one or more rights over the Forest. These rights are:Common of pasture: commonable animals - ponies, cattle, donkeys and mules - are turned out into the Open Forest;Common of pasture for sheep: although some of the large estates have this right, it is infrequently exercised;Common of mast: the right to turn out pigs in the autumn to devour the acorns - this provides food for the pigs and reduces the threat to ponies and cattle from the poisonous acorns;Estovers (Fuelwood): the free supply of a stipulated amount of firewood to certain properties;Common of marl: the right to dig clay to improve agricultural land - this right is no longer exercised;Common of turbary: the right to cut peat turves for the Commoner's personal use.The most important right is the Common of Pasture. Those who wish to exercise this right must apply to the Verderers' Clerk who will confirm the existence of the right and allocate a brand for the animals. Once branded, they may be turned out into the Forest upon payment of a Marking Fee to the local Agister.\"The Marking Fees pay the Agister wages, which is why one bone of contention is those who allow their animals to wander into the Forest (from boundary areas), but don't pay the marking fees. The Agister is (partially) responsible for the care of (domestic) animals within the Forest, so even those who don't contribute to their work get their animals taken care. If an unmarked animal gets hit by a car, the Agister is called to the scene and sometimes has to put the animal out of its misery, the same as he would if a marked animal got hit. It's the lazy way to get others to take care of your animals.This link is full of details about how it all works. I pick and choose what I want to read, but it's got everything from monthly Court minutes, to bylaws, to job descriptions, to animal accidents, etc.Domestic animals on the Forest are ponies, cows, donkeys, sheep, and pigs. The pigs are generally allowed out only in the fall, as they eat the acorns that fall from the oak trees, which can be harmful to the other animals. The ponies can trace their bloodlines back to pre-1066. They are beautiful animals, sturdy and hardy and unless they're unhealthy in some way, generally spend all year on the Forest, wandering the hundreds of acres. The animals are marked (hence the marking fees) by brands (owner) and cut tails (Agister), so you know immediately who is responsible for the animal if something happens.Â This is how comfortable the ponies are around people. And also why you have to be so terribly careful when driving. All the animals wander where they will and unfortunately, some drivers are not careful. Hit and runs are, sadly, not uncommon and particularly disliked by Forest folk.There are 5 Agisters. The Forest is divided into 4 areas - one for each Agister (this is the only map I could find - it loses clarity if it gets any bigger), and with Area 1 shared between two Agisters. Lyndhurst is the Administrative 'nerve centre' of the Forest and where the Verderers and Agisters are headquartered.There are annual pony 'drifts,' which is essentially a round up of the ponies on the Forest for health checks, weaning of foals and marking. There are several over the course of late summer/early fall and the commoners and Agisters work together to round up their animals and do the necessary work.The Forest is cool and heavily wooded in the north east, where I am, but opens to heather and furze (scrub) as you travel south. I prefer the trees - ancient oak, beech and maple - but the open areas allow the animals more grazing space. It's not better or worse, just my preference.The public is warned to stay away from the animals for their own safety, as the animals are generally semi-feral. They can still hurt people and still get hurt by human carelessness (and callousness and stupidity and ignorance). The majority of ponies are mares, and stallions are only allowed on the Forest once a year for aÂ short period of time and in specific places.Forest at Bratley View.There are 5 types of deer in the Forest and a myriad of birds and other wildlife: foxes, rabbits, owls, and reptiles of various sorts. And that's not to mention all the flowers and other plantlife!Â It really is a magical place and I am beginning to understand why there is so much passion (on all sides) to protect and use it wisely. I'm not sure I've done it any sort of justice here, but do take a look at the links. There was a lot of use of the Forest in WWII and more recently, too, when an Al Qaida training camp was discovered prior to the current Middle East conflict operating in the Forest under the guise of a holiday camp! O_oAll of this is why I wanted to interview a couple of the officials for my novel. So. Much. Information!! I haven't heard anything, so am going to safely assume this first attempt was rejected. Not to worry, I'll try again at a later date.And just because... :)_________________________________________________________________________________I'm currently somewhat village-bound, as my bike was stolen three weeks ago and I'm relying on my cousin to drop me at the train station in the mornings instead of having a lovely ride. I've been given the opportunity to get a little car in August, which I'm really excited about, but still need to replace the bike. I'm upset because I had the bike I really wanted - I simply can't replace it for the price I paid and what I got with it. It angers me that someone can be so casual with other people's property. I've gone through all the proper steps of reporting it to the police, filling out the paperwork and logging the info online, but as there's only a 1% chance of getting it back, I'm resigned to replacing it.My cousin is away this weekend, so it's just me and the cat for a couple of days. I'm going to do some baking as well, and then I'm away in Wales next weekend. My SIL, brother & sister and I are going puffin watching in Pembrokeshire - far western Wales. Very excited as I just found out today that my sister was joining us. It's going to be a long trip, but I bought a 1st class ticket for the trip out (at a ridiculous price, to be honest, but I was feeling sorry for myself over the loss of my bike and decided I needed a treat and it's too late to change it now...), so I should at least have a little more legroom and a slightly more comfortable seat.I didn't get the job I interviewed for either, which is fine. I wasn't expecting to and it wouldn't have been a good fit - it was uber-corporate and I'm not. I'm happy in the job I've got for the time being and I think having a car is going to make it that much easier to find the perfect one. Certainly it'll allow me more freedom and not have to limit myself so much. However, I think once I get a car I will try to find a p/t job to cover costs and earn a bit of extra cash. I still owe a lot of money and am getting a bit stressed out about paying it all back. I think a p/t job is the only answer and that's okay.Anyway, I hope I've answered some questions and you've enjoyed some of the Forest info I've given."},

And sometimes those little breaks turn (unintentionally) into muchlonger ones. This is one of those breaks (again).So. What exactly have I been doing since January anyway?Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Working1.0. I wrote briefly about my job at the end of November. It was a temp jobthat had the potential to go permanent, which initially I thought would be perfect.As time went on, however, it started to wear at me and when the company shiftedgears to downsize in mid-March, I was ready to kick some heads in. Theyeventually let me go, as you canât justify keeping a temp when permanent jobsare on the line, and I was quite relieved. Despite the fact I could walk fromhome, the work environment, well, sucked. Ridiculously unprofessional behaviourâ and perhaps that makes me sound a bit of a stick in the mud, but really,making dates during work hours? â and way too much gossip and general chitterchatter. Exit stage left!Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Working2.0. I was off for 2.5 weeks before I got another job. I started beforeEaster and so far, so good. Iâm working at a hospital in the maintenancedepartment (no public!!!!!) in a long-term position. The wage is better,although the job isnât particularly challenging, but I have an office to myselfand the guys are a good bunch. I have a lot of downtime, so feel that a perfectjob for me is one like this but with enough work to keep me busy and make theday go faster.The downside is the early start.Iâm up between 5/5:30am to catch the 7:10 train. I ride my bike to the trainstation, which is 3 miles and takes about 20 minutes. Itâs a beautiful ride âthere are foals in the Forest now (!!) â perfect to relax me in the morning andwind me down in the evening. Plus I get a workout! I stop for tea then have a15-20 min walk to the hospital, which is on the fringes of the sketchy part oftown. Iâm prepping for the wet season, but am enjoying the sunshine right now.*Update: I have an interview for a permanentjob on Thursday afternoon! Iâm nervous because I have a feeling itâs going tobe quite professional and Iâm really not (Iâve never worn makeup in my life!),but Iâm excited because itâs a company dealing with investments, so it soundsgood. The lady who called said she really liked my CV/resume, so hereâs hoping Ican live up to it!Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Visiting.We had a family reunion of sorts for my birthday at the beginning of April. Mybrother, SIL, sister and cousin went to Avebury (in Wiltshire county) for aday. Apart from a pretty village, there are remains of HUGE stone circles andpathways. Since I was last there (forever ago), a museum, gift shop and cafÃ©have been added. The weather wasnât great, but it was April. Itâs England. Itwas my birthday. We had a great time visiting and while my sister had to leave,the rest of us spent the night at a hotel in a town called Calne, 6 miles west.Easter was spent in Carmarthen,Wales, with family. There were 6 cousins (3 sets of sisters), two husbands, 6kids (7-16), an aunt and uncle and a beautiful Welsh locale. A movie was made,lots of food was eaten, plenty of drinks drunk, and we had a great time. It hadbeen 40 years since all us cousins had been together like that, so it was terrificto spend so much time with old family and new (to me). Us girls are trying toarrange to go away together for a long weekend, so Iâve volunteered to lookinto affordable options for that: B&Bs or self-catering most likely.I also went to see my sister in thepretty town of Rode for a long weekend. She works as a housesitter (among otherthings) and is sitting at a lovely place. Itâs in the county of Somerset in themiddle of fields. Sheâs looking after two dogs and a cat, so we had lots ofwalking, talking and relaxing. Proper sister time. J It was great.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Learning.I took a photography workshop in May and have signed up for two more, inAugust and November. Various partsof the New Forest and whatâs called the Jurassic Coast in Dorset. I believethatâs because many fossils from that period have been found in its shores. Thefellow leading the workshop was excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Theother workshops are with smaller groups, so thereâll be more one-to-oneassistance and guidance.Iâve also signed up for twoonline courses: a novel writing course and a Teaching English as a ForeignLanguage course, something Iâve wanted to do for years. Iâm almost finished thenovel writing one, as Iâve got ideas for a cosy mystery series set in theForest floating around my head. Iâve even written a letter in hopes ofinterviewing the officials who care for the Forest and her creatures. Itâs a uniqueplace and Iâve become quite enchanted by it.*Update: almost a month in and no word from theofficials Iâd like to interview. Theyâre either considering my request reallyhard or not at all. Iâve decided instead to leap in and just start writingbecause if I donât, I wonât have anything to put this into if they do grant mean interview.Iâm also learning that Iâm moreadaptable than I thought. England isnât a great deal different from Canada inmany ways, but there are definite differences. Iâve not used the health system(NHS) to a great degree yet, but itâs similar to our universal health care athome, so thatâs not a big adjustment I have to make. Different items on thegrocery store shelves and a lack of, or difficulty getting, certain other items(ah, Amazon. What would I do without you?); and mostly, the sheer number of people.Iâm just not used to it after living in the Yukon for so long.I did some Googling about thatlast bit. Canadaâs population hovers around 35 million, the UK at almost 63. Now,WHERE DO ALL THESE PEOPLE LIVE??!! Comparing the Yukonâs population (approx.35,000) per square mile vs. Englandâs, we get this: 0.01/661.9. No wonder Isometimes get dizzy! My brother and sister also have big personal space bubblesand we were talking about this at Easter. I think it stems from growing up inCanada, where there is the luxury of having that, whereas here youâre jammed upagainst people everywhere you go. The idea of âremoteâ is quite different herethan what Iâm used to and thereâs never complete silence either; you can alwayshear traffic, no matter what time of day it is. The Yukon could be perfectly,beautifully silent. That said, Iâm finding it easy to spend time on my own,away from people, although Iâm finding I really like having my cousin around. Thecompany has been good for both of us.Itâs fun having an accent! Youwouldnât believe the number of people (men) who have said âwhat a lovelyaccent!â Women just ask where Iâm from, but I have no doubt that were I a man, Iâdget exactly the same reaction from them instead. Hahaha! And I canât get overhow many people actually know itâs Canadian, not American â heck, *I* canâttell most of the time. I just tell who donât know that we just have softervowels, but like any regional dialect (Newfies anyone?) it changes depending whereyouâre from. Personally, Iâm finding the Welsh accent quite lovely. Itâs somusicalâ¦Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Payingdown debt. Iâm getting there!! Iâm down to $2500 on my MC and $7700 on myLOC. Iâm picking away at paying back my RRSP, too, but still have to make adecision about cashing out my secondary one. Why Iâm wavering, Iâm not sure. Isuppose because I worked to set it up and added regularly, although I stoppedthat when I went to school and didnât start it up again. Itâll just take anemail to find out where I stand and whether itâs even possible from here.Overall, Iâm thoroughly enjoying my new adventure. Still spending fartoo much money on books and clothing (had a terrific haul yesterday at acouple of thrift stores â essentially an entirely new wardrobe for lessthan Â£70!), but Iâm definitely happy. Even my health has improved! For 7 years, the whole time I was in theYukon, I was having troubles with my kidneys. If you know anything aboutkidneys, itâs that their health and function is numbers-based. The numbers varydepending on various factors (age, sex, etc) and mine have been on the highside of things since about 2004 (shortly before I went North). I registered andhad an appointment with a doctor here who sent me for bloodwork, based on thathistory. What came back? The numbers are exactly where they should be for myage. Whatever the issue was, it is no longer.If that in itself doesnât prove to me that I did the right thing,nothing can. In alternative healthcare, the kidneys are where guilt and shameare kept, which I believe is the root of the problems.At any rate, it certainly proves that following oneâs heart can dowonders. England isnât everyoneâs dream (heck, even amongst the English), but Iâmcontent, happy and thoroughly enjoying everything. Everywhere I am is âhomeâ tome, but itâs hard to explain why this just feels soâ¦right. The pull of myroots? The opportunity to release old stuff and just start over? Who knows?But it was definitely worth taking the chance. Can you believe itâsbeen almost 8 months already?!?!"},
{"title": "Week two update", "date": "Sunday 12 January 2014", "text": "Not a bad week, although I've done unnecessary spending, but not nearly as much as I normally do, so that's something! My week looks like this:Jan 5/14: Â£16.12 - FB game tokensJan 6/14: Â£2 - 4 rolls papertowelJan 7/14: Â£3.64 - Â£1.89 for butter, Â£1.75 pkg of chocolate digestivesJan 8 & 9/14: NO SPEND!Jan 10/14: Â£11.98 - Â£1.29 bread, Â£10.69 dinner at the pub + dessertJan 11/14: Â£9.03 - FB game tokensSo you can see where the majority of my unnecessary spends have gone - Facebook eats them. It's quite ridiculous.I did ADD a little bit of coin to my snowflake jar: Â£5.33, bringing the total to Â£31.95. I also have a GST cheque that arrived for me for $101.00. I'm not quite sure what to do with it, however, as it's in Canadian dollars and if I deposit it into my account here, I'll lose half of it with the exchange and any associated fees. It has my English address on it, though, so I'm uncertain I can deposit it at home (via a friend). I'd like to deposit it into my Canadian bank as it can go towards my bills. I'll send an email to my account manager at home and see what she says. I imagine I'll get one more in April, which will be nice, but that will be it.I also added Â£25 to my savings account here, which is something I'm planning to do on a much more regular basis. I'm currently getting paid weekly, as I'm with an agency, but once I start working for the company full-time, that will change to monthly - something I'll have to adjust to - and I'll have to be much more careful.It was a busy week at work, the first full week after the holidays. The phones were busy and I keep getting given all kinds of work to do, which is not bad in itself, just a bit stressful when I'm already feeling behind. Ah well, just a few more days of doing reception and I can move on to the new job."},
{"title": "January No-Low Spend: Update", "date": "Saturday 4 January 2014", "text": "I've actually been doing really well! I've cleared two of my January goals already, and am halfway to my third.I've been tracking my spending and the month thus far looks like this:Jan 1: NO SPENDJan 2: Â£5.95 - fish and chips for dinnerJan 3: NO SPENDJan 4: Â£56.50 - groceriesI also put $852.82 towards my debt, $102.82 more than I had budgeted for. The transfer ended up being more than I anticipated (it all depends on the exchange rate, of course), which helped a bit, but I actually added an extra month's payment onto my LOC. Of course, the bank doesn't see it that way, but I figured I'd try to get a little ahead, after being behind. A $75 MC payment went through today as well.I put $50 into my RRSP from the transfer as well, so that's taken care of.I'm just over halfway into my monthly grocery budget, but did buy a few items that will last me a long time, as well as some food to use as snacks at work, so I'm not starving when I get home. Looking at the amount of food I bought (along with my cousin), I'm certain I would have paid at least three times the amount at home. So many items are just Â£1, veggies are cheap and we actually stuck quite close to the (my) list.If you're interested, I bought:Â£8.34 - 6 x 1L containers of coconut milk (I'm trying to go dairy-free this month)Â£3.00 - 3 x hummousÂ£1.99 - 1 bag of chips (sorry, crisps. Not a necessity, but I was really craving the crunch...)Â£2.87 - 1 x 2kg bag oatmealÂ£1.54 - currantsÂ£6.00 - 2 x 12pkg of Actimel yogurts (the live bacteria ones. My cousin owes me Â£3 for one pkg)Â£1.50 - 3 small pkgs of nuts: walnuts, almonds, cashews. Couldn't find big ones, so settled on these for nowÂ£1.02 - 3 x red grapefruit (these are about $1 each at home!)Â£3.00 - 3 pkgs pineappleÂ£1.00 - 2 parsnipsÂ£0.50 - small bag dried cranberriesÂ£2.00 - bag of orangesÂ£3.50 - 2 bags datesÂ£1.50 - large bag spinachÂ£0.81 - container of cinnamonÂ£0.47 - red onions, I believe there are 4Â£5.00 - 6 tins tunaÂ£0.32 - fresh gingerÂ£4.00 - 8 apples (I can likely find cheaper if I look harder)Â£1.78 - pkg brown riceÂ£1.00 - string beans (green)Â£1.25 - pkg broccoli/cauliflowerThis was at ASDA, which is on the more expensive side. There are other groceries - Lidl & Aldi - that are cheaper, but we were in Southampton to drop off my sister at the train station, and I can't get the coconut milk closer to home. Only the big stores carry it, which is also why I stocked up. Markets are also an option for fresh produce and larger quantities, so that's what we're going to try next weekend (veggies and some straight-from-the-farm meats).So far, so good, I'd say! :) Hope you're all doing just as well."},
{"title": "January No-Low Spending", "date": "Wednesday 1 January 2014", "text": "That Carla's at it again! Making up spending challenges right off the bat to keep us on our financial toes. And thank goodness for it! I'm in on the January No-Low Spend Challenge because, quite frankly, I need it. It's been a ridiculously spendy couple of months.My goals are as follows:1) $750 off my debt2) $50 to my RRSP3) $100 for groceries...er, Â£100, I mean...4) Track my spending daily.5) No unnecessary spending: rent & groceries only!6) Cash onlyRealistically, this is very attainable. I've transferred some funds to my Canadian bank account and should have my first debt payment taken care of in the next few days. I'm finding groceries are, generally, cheaper here than at home, so I can actually do quite well with Â£100 I believe. I have a few changes I want to make to my diet, so I told my cousin I would buy my own groceries from here on in. There are some markets around, but a number of the items I want can be bought and used over a period of time, leaving only perishables to replenish weekly.Looking forward to seeing how we do!It's a blustery, wet, miserable day here in the New Forest, but that's okay. The agenda today is relaxed, as it has been the past week or so. I didn't make it to midnight last night - I haven't in years - but as I was up at 4:30 yesterday morning, I'm using that as my excuse. ;)On the agenda today is a clean sweep of the house. My cousin gets home tomorrow from visiting with her sister, and MY sister and I are going to spend the afternoon making sure the place is tidy, clean and fresh both for her return and for the start of the year. There's a lot of clutter - my cousin has/keeps lots of stuff - but that's not ours to touch. We're just doing general cleaning and tidying - vacuuming, dusting, etc.I've already been fiddling with my goals list, thinking of things to add, adjust, etc., so it appears I'm going to need monthly goals too, but small ones that will ultimately ensure I complete my three big goals. No pressure!Here's to 2014!!"},
{"title": "Goodbye, 2013!", "date": "Tuesday 31 December 2013", "text": "I'd like to say that I remember everything that I did this year, but really only two things stand out for me: graduating college and selling up and moving to England. The first led to the second; I followed that energy and \"let it go\" where it would, and here is where I landed. There were probably some lows in there, but I can't remember them. They were likely blips on the radar of Seamless Transition, so small they weren't even significant enough to notice. That, or I blew blindly past them as I rushed forward.Regardless, here we are again - seriously, where does the time GO?! - on the cusp of yet another new year, 2014 this time. I love this time of year, when the blogging world bursts with resolutions, goals, challenges, etc. It's very exciting, and I always look forward to seeing what people have set up for themselves and their reviews of the previous year.Yesterday, I wrote out my goals for next year. I have three big ones: writing a book, getting debt free (yes, I know. Those who have followed me these past, what, 6 years, know this is something I talk about every year, but never actually do.), and losing 10kg. On top of those ones, there are some smaller ones which need attention as well.Financial1) $500 to my RRSP/TFSA. This is essentially just to keep my Canadian bank account active, plus I need to plump up my retirement funds anyway.2) Make a decision about my 2nd RRSP. Should I keep it where it is, cash it in and use it to help pay off my debt, or simply move it to my bank and add it to my current RRSP?3) Canada Savings Bonds. I have a several options here. I can cash these in as well (they sit at about $2800 thanks to payroll deductions!), leave them sit, or continue adding to them. The minimum monthly deposit is $25. I'm leaning heavily towards the last option right now.4) Stop spending unnecessarily. I only have rent and groceries as expenses, so I have no excuse to keep spending money on ridiculous things. I'm talking to you, Facebook game tokens. Yes. I'm that person.Health1) Drink 2.5L water per day. This is a lot, I know. This was the challenge set to me last summer by the dietitian I saw and I about fell over when she posed it to me. I was in the bathroom a LOT. But I don't think I gave it enough time for my body to adjust, really, so I have to give myself a better shot at it. Work up to it.2) Dairy-free for January. This will be hard, as I love cheese, but I want to see if eliminating food groups will help me feel better. I got some information that cutting dairy from my diet would benefit my kidneys, so I'm willing to give it a shot. I'm also going to be cutting down the amount of refined/processed sugar that I eat as well. I know for sure that will help.3) Do some sort of exercise daily. I already walk to work - I figure 4 miles total for the day, which is not insignificant - but even adding a walk to the end of the road and back after dinner would be beneficial.4) Couch to 5k. This ties into #3. I got as far as week 7 with this program over the summer and then...just stopped. I was doing well, too. The area around here is great for running - there are several ways to vary it - so I really have no excuse.Personal1) Read.Â I currently have 37 (!) books to read, which I've posted on Goodreads. I want to get through these before I beg/borrow/buy more. And besides, I don't have the space to keep them, so as I go through them, I'll be donating them to the library.2) Spend less time on my gadgets.Â The electronic sort. I spend far, far, far too much time on FB, so pulling myself away from that, as well as the TV, will open up more time to accomplish other things I've been neglecting: reading, writing, knitting, exercise... I want to commit to only using the computer if I'm writing emails or letters to friends, or writing my book.3) Be gentle with myself.Â I'm my own worst critic and have very little patience or compassion for myself, so a big part of the new year is to just to start liking and accepting myself (and all my accompanying foibles, faults, quirks, and issues) a whole lot more, be patient with myself, and care about me.4) Be Annie.Â This ties in with #3 and is something I took from Gretchen Rubin's \"The Happiness Project\" (which you all need to read if you haven't, btw).Â Essentially, do whatever makes you happy; there's no room for \"should,\" \"shouldn't,\" or anyone else here (apart from \"you should be kind to animals and children\" of course).I'm quite pleased with my list. I'm pushing ahead with the main three big goals and have printed out a list of everything to keep by my bed, so I can keep track of things as they go. I've been pleasantly surprised by how things \"just happen\" when you push forward but don't try to control the ending.Just let it be..."},
{"title": "2014 Goals", "date": "Monday 30 December 2013", "text": "New Forest pony grazing in the lovely village of Brockenhurst.I'm tinkering with the blog a bit. Overall, I like the template and won't be changing it - at least for now - and I like my name, so have just added a sub-title to it for the time being. This is today, however, and come January 1, I may have a change of heart and start completely fresh.I've also added some tickers (---->) to track my goals this year. Generally speaking they are:1) Lose 10kg. I don't actually weigh as much as I thought, but even this much will give me a healthier feeling, so I think it's a perfectly reasonable, achievable goal.2) Write 100,000 words: a novel. I've had ideas for a mystery series popping out at me since I arrived here, and I want to challenge myself to sit down and write the first one. The word count works out to 8,333 per month, or approx 278 words per day. Again, reasonable and achievable.3) Pay off my debt at last. With Pounds Sterling currently at $1.77 Cdn, it's a much better opportunity to get more for less, which is why the numbers show in both Cdn and Sterling. My goal is the entire amount, however, I will be exceedingly happy with $10,000 (Â£5665). My wage here is on the low side, but so are my expenses, so with - hopefully! - a decent Canadian tax return, I should be able to achieve this.I need to set out some specifics/categories, as well as a budget, which I will post on January 1.Â I've had a cold since I was in London last week and although today it feels marginally better, it's sapping all my energy. It fortunately hasn't morphed into anything nasty, but it's annoying and I know it'll hang on for much longer, never quite willing to relinquish its foothold. My headcolds always do. :P Work starts again on Thursday, so I'm hoping the worst of it is gone by then."},

{"title": "I have arrived!", "date": "Saturday 7 December 2013", "text": "It's beyond time that I updated, I know. I appreciate the notes wondering where I am, so to answer the question:I'm HERE! :)My brother made me this Tiramisu for me as a welcome. It was delicious!The flight over was excellent - I'm glad I paid for the upgraded seat - and we landed without incident at Gatwick at 6a.m. on the morning of October 27th. You may remember that there were big storms predicted for that day, but fortunately we missed them. It was quite windy and rainy, though, and we blew around a little on landing, but otherwise it was a beautiful flight - smooth and comfortable. I caught myself up on a few movies, as I certainly couldn't sleep. Customs took all of 1 minute - thanks early-morning flight & British passport - and because I flew Club Class, my luggage was tagged as \"priority,\" so it was first off the plane! My brother and SIL arrived at the gate about the same time I did, so it was good timing.I spent a week in London with them, settling in a bit, and opening a bank account, and then came to Hampshire, just outside of Southampton, in the New Forest, to stay with my cousin. It's very pretty and quiet where we are, and I'm settling in well. I have a big, bright, cosy room and am adding some personal touches to make it feel more like mine: pieces of art that are arriving in dribs and drabs; small furniture items, etc. It's coming along. I bought a memory foam mattress topper as the mattress was a bit hard, but now I sleep really well, so it was worth it.Â Overall, I'm happy to be here and feel quite at home. The weather has been very mild until just recently, but I am feeling the damp. I'll acclimatise, I know, but it's a bit of an adjustment, because it goes right through you. It's similar to living in BC's Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, so I've adapted before, but I do find it difficult sometimes to get warm.Since I've been here, I've bought my own computer, and a new bike, which is lighter and better fitting than the one I had in Whitehorse, so I'm enjoying it much more. I added mud guards, a pannier rack, and a pannier bag to it, so it's perfect for trekking around the forest. I've got two New Forest maps, and there are apparently over 100 miles of bike trails to explore, so I'm quite excited to get out there and try them. Today I went on my first trek since I got the bike two weeks ago. I cycled down to a town called Lyndhurst, which is the heart of the New Forest, and picked up a few things, including a new purse for my cousin for Christmas. She's been so good to me, letting me stay here (indefinitely at this point), cooking (I clean up!), and driving me around the area. I've spent more than I'd initially intended to, but I feel I'm set up now, so it was worth it.I launched myself into a rather frenzied job search almost the instant I arrived and started feeling frustrated because nothing was happening (as quickly as I wanted it to...ahem). My cousin was great and kept saying not to get so worked up and panicky about things, as it's likely that the jobs I applied for hadn't closed yet, so it would be a little while before I heard anything. This is true. As is the fact that there are tens of thousands of people out of work who have been looking for far, far longer than me. It helped keep things in perspective. So I sent off flurries of resumes two or three days a week, after spending some time restructuring it and paring it down to necessary information only. I'm finding it's different looking for work here than at home - although I understand it's tightened up considerably since 2008, so that's likely the reason for it - and most jobs are applied for either online or through an agency. It feels somewhat anonymous, but I suppose they get so many applications, they have to do something to streamline the whole process.On the weekend of November 23rd, it was my Auntie & Uncle's 50th Wedding Anniversary and 20 family and friends travelled up to the Bristol area (a bit north and west of me) for a surprise tea. The hotel where it was hosted was beautiful, and the surprise went off perfectly! They'd had no idea and when I spoke to my Auntie earlier this week, she said it had taken a few days for the shock to wear off, but they loved it. I saw family I hadn't seen in 20 - 30 years, and met new (to me) family, so it was an excellent weekend all round.Tuesday afternoon (that would be November 26) I got a call from an agency letting me know they'd received my resume - sorry, CV - and had a job for me. A full-time, permanent admin one. With a business IN THE NEXT VILLAGE. Was I interested? Say, what?! I didn't remember sending my resume to this particular agency, but I imagine that I applied for a job they were posting and that's how they got it. Regardless, of course I said \"I absolutely am!\" I registered with the agency in Southampton the next morning, had an information session with the Admin Manager at the company that afternoon, and came home with a shiny, brand new job!!! That was November 27th - exactly a month since I arrived. To say I'm thrilled is an understatement, particularly because the job is a 15-minute walk from home. I come home for lunch! :)And I say \"information session\" rather the the interview it was supposed to be, because the only questions I really got asked were, \"So what brought you to England?,\" \"How does that sound?,\" and \"Do you have days you're unavailable?\" It was mostly learning about what I'd be doing, when I started, what the company does, etc. Apparently my resume - and the agency - sold me and I didn't have to say anything else!Â It's an Admin/reception position with an energy company, and so far, so good. The wage is on the low side, but I'm okay with that for the time being as my expenses are low, too. I'm just happy to have some work to get me out of the house, earning a paycheque, and learning something new. There seems to be some opportunity to move around within the company, but even so, I'm happy to be getting some experience here that I can use as a step up. I'm technically an employee of the agency for the first 13 weeks, which means I get paid weekly. Assuming all goes well during the probationary period, and the company and I still like each other at the end of it, I can be hired on directly by the company. This would be the ideal situation. It's quite old-school and astoundingly inefficient for the most part, but I'm enjoying it.The past week has been a bit of a whirlwind of learning new routines, who people are, what they do, etc. It was my first full week, as I started on the 28th, so I have to say I'm enjoying this weekend.So, that's my update for now. I do have some photos, but they haven't downloaded from my iPod for some reason, so I'll work on that and have some for my next post.Hope you're all well and getting ready for the holidays!"},
{"title": "Tick, tock...", "date": "Tuesday 1 October 2013", "text": "...goes the countdown clock! Less than a week left in the Yukon. I feel a bit panicked, yet I know that if I forget anything, I still have three weeks on the Island to finish things off. But I have to sort out the rest of my life up here - little things like closing a bank account, sorting my clothes (and various assorted...stuff...), packing, re-packing and then doing it again. And the big things like visiting with my friends. I have an extraordinary group up here, diverse and joyful and kind - I sometimes feel they're more than I deserve. I'll shortly be exchanging visits with them with visits with my diverse, fun, kind, and amazing friends down south. Spending time with all of my favourite people before I go is definitely the right thing to do.Despite all these endings, it doesn't feel \"final.\" I'm taking that as a good sign, as I don't believe I won't be back in the Yukon. Its fingers are too tightly wound around my heart to let go for good. I'm taking memories with me - the words and encouragement of my friends, artwork, photos, memories - I won't forget, but it won't quite be the same.I'm just feeling a bit reflective, but funnily enough, despite taking the last few days to take more photos and whatnot, I'm not leaving with any regrets! Not everyone has the privilege of living in this beautiful place (not everyone can or wants to), so I feel extraordinarily lucky to have lived here for as long as I have. It's been good to me in many ways, and while I feel a little envious that others will be staying, I'm also ready to make this leap, wherever it takes me. I can't not follow this urge or I know I'll regret it.And no more regrets! :)The Whitehorse Horse, overlooking the city in the Whitehorse valley below.Beautiful fall colours. It's been a wonderful fall season."},
{"title": "England is a definite GO!", "date": "Saturday 21 September 2013", "text": "Mendenhall Glacier and Nugget Falls, Juneau, Alaska.Well, what can I say? I've been working hard this summer and spending most of my off time sorting, purging, packing, mailing, working and saving for my move (I keep writing \"trip\" like I'm just going on a little holiday).You'll notice I've set a counter on the left side of the page (----->). I started the clock at about 70 days and it's faithfully ticking away my days here. I'm down to 14 more days in the beautiful Yukon and 35 to the UK. I honestly can't believe how fast the time has flown by. I had all these plans to do all these wonderful things during my last summer here and I've done hardly any. But that's okay. I'm feeling a bit unsettled, being in this between place, so not having overmuch to do has been helpful in this transition.I had to let my beautiful Bylaw go to a new home. He was terrorizing my landlady's cat and it was simply unfair to her, although he is a sweet boy generally. Three months in and there was no change in his behaviour, so I put the word out and just 12 hours later we had a response from a wonderful lady and off he went shortly thereafter. I'm acquainted with this lady through some of my past volunteer work and my landlady has known her for years. He's gone to a very loving home, where he's the only cat and will have all the attention. I haven't been thinking about him, so that's a good sign. It means I'm not worried about him. I do miss him at night and when I get home in the evenings after work, but I know he'll be well taken care of and that's all I wanted.You'll notice that my goals (over there ----->) have also been met and exceeded. That goal was achieved today, when I received my pension payout. The rest of the payout is going into a locked in RRSP, which is fantastic. I am thrilled. This whole venture has had piece after piece slip seamlessly into place and I can't believe how much I've achieved in such a relatively short period of time. I started this proverbial ball rolling in March and I have just over a month left until I touch down on English soil for the first time in almost 20 years.I have mixed feelings right now. I'm going to miss the Yukon desperately, but am so excited to be starting off on a new adventure. I'm going to be a big bucket and just stay open to things, see what happens. Everyone I speak with about it is so excited for me, so the enthusiasm is much appreciated. I'm stopping in Victoria for several weeks - I fly out of Whitehorse on October 6 - to visit friends and then on October 26 I board my cozy Club Class flight for a 10.5 hour flight to London Gatwick where I will be met at my early morning arrival by my brother and SIL. After that...well, it'll unfold minute by minute.I had a last doctor's appointment on Wednesday morning and got my records on a disc to take with me - handy! I was also happy to learn that my doctor, unlike some (most?) does not close his patient files, so it means that if (when) I come back, and assuming he's still practicing of course, I will still have a family doctor. Exceptionally good news, when the Territory is so desperately short of doctors and so many have never had a permanent family doctor. See? It's all meant to be.I've had a couple of house/dog sits over the summer which went very well and were good experience. Work has been great for the most part. I've enjoyed it, although I'm finding it difficult to find things to do right now as it's quite slow. I push paper around and flip through things and fuss enough to fill 8 hours. I have no idea how. Anyway, only 6 days left and then I have so much time off I won't know what to do with myself! ;)But I was long, long overdue for an update. It's not overly newsy, but if it were, it would be ridiculously long and I'm not that focused right now. I'll spend some time getting caught up with all your blogs before I head south, too. At least I can take you all with me!"},

They like to lick the salt off the asphalt, so you need to drive with caution because it can mean they're all over the road.Technically, it's not yet Sunday night here, but what the heck? Here's my contribution to the chatter. :)Reading? \"The Christie Curse\" by Victoria Abbott. It's a cosy mystery, very well-written, about the supposed play that Agatha Christie wrote when she disappeared for eleven days.Listening to?Â My landlady in the kitchen upstairs. Birds singing outside. :)Watching?Â It's the two-hour season premiere of \"Long Island Medium\" today and I'm really looking forward to it. I love her. To the point I actually sent her a 'thank you' card last year! Just said she was, essentially, awesome and thank her for sharing her gift with so many people.Cooking/Baking?Â Chicken something today with rice. I'm trying to focus a BIT better on my diet lately. Baby steps. A lot more water and not quite so much sugar.Happy you accomplished this week?Â Graduated yesterday! Hurrah!! Great ceremony and even though I didn't participate, I attended as a guest and enjoyed the proceedings. I also learned that I made the Dean's list, and graduated with honours. So proud of myself! There were six of us in my program who made the list, a great representation, and 23 all together. I also officially resigned from my library job, which made me very happy. I should get a bit of a pay-out from that, which will go directly to my RRSP and sit there until I need it.Looking forward to next week?Â Clearing out some more stuff from my place. I'm losing my momentum, and have recruited a friend next weekend to help me organize and sort stuff out. Once more of the large furniture items have gone, I think it will make it a bit easier. I've already taken some stuff upstairs to my new room and have to keep reminding myself that all my winter gear will be mailed ahead of me, so I don't have to concern myself with that once I have set myself up.Thankful for today?Â Some rain to help clear away the last of the snow; fresh spring air (at last!). Talked to my mum for a bit.*Bonus Question* Do you ever \"gamble\", play the lottery,BINGO, sweepstakes, etc? I used to buy lottery tickets fairly often, but haven't years and have never played bingo. I spend all my money on books! Haha!"},

Wow...That feels like a lifetime ago now.And here we are, in another time and place. Time for Sunday night chit chat, something I haven't participated in in AGES.What am IÂ Reading? \"Cat Trick\" by Sofie Kelly. It's one of my standard cosy mysteries and has two magical cats in it. The first couple of chapters were really awkward and while the murder has just happened, I find I already don't care because we knew absolutely nothing about the victim. Just his name. I at least want some interaction with the victim and a few people so I can get to dislike (or like) him or her. No hearsay bad behaviour, which is what this is, so far at least. I'm hoping it'll pick up.Listening to? My landlady and some friends laughing upstairs. I think they're making dinner together. Fun!Watching? I'm not sure what's on tonight, actually. Probably something on HGTV or one of those channels. May 12 is the season premier of \"Long Island Medium\" and I'm really looking forward to that! I love her.Cooking/baking? Nothing at the moment. I had an early dinner and reheated some chicken and rice. I have turkey breasts for tomorrow and will try to think of something relatively creative for those.Happy I accomplished this week? I finished College!!!!! :) I'm really proud of myself and feel very happy and hugely accomplished. I also got myself a part-time job, and two house-sitting jobs over the summer. That's a lot in a week. Well, at least in my weeks!Looking forward to next week? I have an eye doctor's appointment tomorrow, a doctor's appointment on Friday, I start work full-time on Tuesday and am alone in the office on Saturday (!), I will be doing some work for the p/t job as well as there is a trade show on the weekend that we'll be attending, and hopefully selling and clearing out some more stuff at the house.Thankful for today? Sunshine at least, if not spring temperatures yet! An interesting new job and a relaxing evening ahead of me. :)*Bonus question: What is your preferred method of contacting someone? Definitely email/computer (like FB or something). I'm terrible, however, when it comes to actually sitting down and emailing something long and newsy - I tend to shorter notes, which is why it's actually easier to contact me on FB. I spend far, far, FAR too much time on there and most of my friends send me a note on that."},
{"title": "I can't believe it's over already!!", "date": "Sunday 28 April 2013", "text": "236 days ago, I started College. I remember feeling nervous and awkward the first day, but Â also very excited. Fast forward 8 months and it's all over! Yesterday we had our final exam and, well, that was it.Definitely bittersweet. The ladies I met and shared my time with were amazing and I will miss them. I felt like I was on holiday for 8 months and it's come to a rather sudden stop. It was a bit anticlimactic because instead of celebrating together, we drifted out of the room one by one as we finished writing the exam and dispersed from there...We have one last, short meeting on Monday morning and then that will be it until graduation on May 11. I won't be attending as a graduate (I don't do stages), but will be in the audience with a friend from last semester and we'll be cheering the class on. I think she's getting us pom-poms... :)This term was a bit of a struggle. It was more theoretical, less practical, and I was less motivated. I just couldn't seem to get a rhythm going and it dogged me all term. It was frustrating, but perhaps part of it was knowing we were on the downhill coast to the end and I didn't want to finish. I have to admit, though, that the last month was a real struggle and part of me is very glad to just be done.I start work full-time on Tuesday, and am wondering how I'll adjust back to the \"real\" world. Â I'm going to miss the free time and early days, for sure, but I know it won't take me too long to get back into a routine. It sounds like it's going to be busy and I have a lot to learn, so I'm looking forward to it. I'm very lucky that my friend offered me this job, as it means that I'll be getting paid from the get-go, rather than spending another month without any income. I'm using it as my work experience (practicum) for the last credit of the program, too, so it's a win-win. I can start paying back my debt a month earlier, which is good, because it's very big...As for my England plans, they're rolling right along. I bought my ticket a couple of weeks ago - I'm going Club Class (aka Business Class) on Air Transat. It was a smokin' deal - $1177 o/w, including taxes and fees! Granted, it lands at Gatwick, but what the hell? Bigger seats, our own check-in desk, priority boarding, champagne - yes please! Go on, live a little. It was still over $1000 cheaper than some of the one way economy tickets into Heathrow, so I was happy to pay. Plus, although I'd've liked to go with KLM, I don't happen to have the $17 000 needed for a ticket (you can check that price yourself. I'm not kidding.) Having a ticket makes it very, very real. I leave at the end of October.I've been listing things to sell, and now that I don't have school, I can focus a bit better and start selling more seriously. I've let a lot of things go - my books, oh, my books... - but every cupboard, every drawer, every closet has something in it! How does one person collect so much stuff?! And most of it I never use. It's insane. I'm moving upstairs in June, so I have to be very thorough. Once the bigger furniture is gone, it will be easier to spread things out and see what I've got left. Not sure I want the hassle of a yard sale, so likely I'll be donating a lot of stuff, but we'll see. I made $315 towards my trip last week, so that's pretty impressive. I've updated my sidebar to keep track - I'm almost at $4K already!As for what I want to do when I get to the UK, I'm not sure. I'm not worried and am just opening myself up to the experience. I'm not looking for a career, which I'm hoping will make it easier for me to find work. My skills are quite well-rounded, so I know I'll find something. I've been looking at the job ads around Southampton and there seems to be a lot of work available; of course, I have to remember there's also a far larger pool of competition as well, so I have to make sure my resume looks perfect. I know there's a reason for me to be going, so I just need to focus and it will continue coming together.Now I'll also have time to get caught up with everyone's blogs!Have a great weekend all!"},

School is almost over, I already have a job secured and I'm focusing on getting myself organized......for a move to England!Yes, that's what I said. :) I've been feeling \"homesick\" for a couple of years now and over spring break, I was feeling particularly drawn. I don't know the reason for it, but it was very heart-centred and brought me to the verge of tears several times, which is highly unusual in itself. I'm not an (openly) emotional sort, so this really hit me hard.Anyhoo, I've talked with my brother, a cousin, my sister, my landlady, friends - they're all very supportive and willing to help me. I'll be landing on my brother and SIL in London for a few days, then moving south to Southampton to stay with my cousin for \"a while.\" I don't want to stay forever, but I'll need a fairly permanent address to use for job searches and that will work nicely. From there, who knows?Why the change? I'm not really certain, apart from it being like a harpoon to the heart. It feels more like a NEED, rather than a want, although I'm not sure how permanent it will be. I am a dual citizen, which makes it somewhat easier and more convenient, and it's not like I can't come back if things don't work out. Part of me is simply feeling like a change. I'm not getting any younger and if I don't go, I don't want to spend the next years regretting that I didn't when I had the chance. I'm getting too old for any more regrets. I'm open to a new adventure and to whatever awaits me.Work-wise I don't know what to expect. I've got a wide range of skills, so am not worried about finding something - as long as it's not illegal, morally reprehensible or tests my integrity I'll be happy. :)So the summer will see me working hard to save, start paying down my debt, divesting myself of almost everything (keeping my winter things...and some books I particularly want to keep), renewing my British passport and readying myself for my new adventure. My landlady has already laid claim to my cat, which pleases me no end, so he'll be moving upstairs with her. As much as I'll miss him, it would kill him to move that far. He's about 15 and very shy. Besides which, I have nowhere to take him to, and that's not fair to him. I think this is his way of letting ME go, seeing as I've had to say good-bye to two so recently. He's been through a lot as well, so this works out well for both of us.I've secured a job starting full-time in May, they are aware that I'm leaving and they are okay with that. The position is essentially temporary, so it works out beautifully. My landlady has also offered me a room upstairs for $300 per month so I can save!!!! I'm still thinking about this, but it would make things much easier in the long run, particularly with the amount I'll be able to save. If I'm going to do it, I'm going to have to make up my mind quite quickly, as I'm planning on leaving in about 6 to 8 months time and I'll need to save almost $10K in that time, so I have a fund to land with...So. There you have it. If I could leave now, I would, but it just isn't feasible. Perhaps I'm planning too much, but I don't think so.I. AM. SO. EXCITED!!!!!!!!"},

{"title": "HRDC Breach", "date": "Thursday 21 February 2013", "text": "I was reading My Money Journey's blog a little while ago and she was talking about the fact that she was one of almost 600,000 Canadians affected by the HRDC security breach back in January. I have to admit I had thought briefly about this, but couldn't remember whether or not I had a student loan at the time.Well, of course I did! I was doing my carpentry training at the time and it turns out that I, too, am affected by this. I decided to call, and I spoke with a very nice lady who confirmed that I was affected, what information is \"out there,\" and what they're doing to protect everyone. The Federal Government has arranged a 6-year contract with Equifax to protect those whose information could be at risk. The RCMP has already been given my SIN number for monitoring, but I gladly accepted the extra security. I'm not planning on any loans over the next 6 years, but who knows what will happen even 6 days from now? To prove myself at any time over the next 6 years, I'll need government issued ID (passport, driver's license, etc.) which I'm happy to comply with for my own security. Why would you NOT want to prove who you are after a massive, potential security breach like this? Sure, it could be a hassle, but if it gets too problematic, I probably don't need the loan in the first place, right?I was assured it won't affect my credit rating and can be removed at any time, but like I say, I'm happy to comply. She mentioned that in the letters I'll be getting, there are various phone numbers, including one to call if I want a lawsuit! I'm not at all interested in following anything like that up. What purpose would that serve? It could go on for years and years and how would a monetary payout help anyway?Let this be a reminder to us all to be more cautious about our generally lackadaisical use of personal information - particularly online - as well as that we're all human and mistakes happen."},

I was trying to figure out where I got it and I think I've figured it out. I bought a salad from one of the grocery stores and it just tasted...different. Your body knows instantly, but your brain is slower to catch on. I didn't think much of it until I woke at midnight with my gut boiling. Yikes! I missed a dinner with friends and school, but otherwise was feeling back to normal by Saturday, apart from being dehydrated.I made a cake for a classmate on Monday. I'd planned to make it for my dinner on Friday, so had bought the ingredients, but then because I was sick, I didn't. She'd heard me talking about it and asked if it would be something I'd be interested in making for her - she'd pay me! I told her the first one is free and had fun putting it together on Tuesday. I added sliced strawberries to it (it's a divine cocoa layer cake, so perfect for strawberries) and asked the admin assistants at school to keep an eye on it. One of the students is deathly allergic to strawberries, so I had to keep it away from anywhere that she'd be. I now owe them something for their diligence.

I'm debating about getting another one, but I don't want to push my luck and I'm not certain I want to share my (small) space anymore. I'd really like my office space back and to be honest, a roommate would be more beneficial if I were working full-time and bringing in a regular paycheque. I'll reconsider once I get back to work.I have several things listed on Amazon (and have a few more to list now), and am hoping to pick up some extra work this month through school. That would help, as will any funds I get back at income tax time, although that's a few weeks away yet.I have a final exam the week after next, as well as a big project due on the 25th.

I did return all the new books I bought. Yes - every single one, so I sort of feel like I made some money. Granted, I spent a lot eating out, but I haven't seen my friends in a while, so as long as I keep it to a minimum (and try to order less), I should be okay with any future meals out.So, the month comes to (and keep in mind, this is VARIABLE spending):Total: $1215.30 (...pardon me while I pick myself up off the floor...) O_O- Unnecessary spends: $261.94$953.36Pardon my French, but that's a merde-load of money that I didn't even make!Â I did write a letter to request that my annual bonus be released in March, so that's something to look forward to. It'll be prorated, but should still be about $1K. As well, income tax time looms and I know I'll be getting something back this year, seeing as I've been in school since September. I can claim full-time tuition and my books. I'll also have this to claim next year, so that's a bit of a bonus.In the meantime, I need to pull an Asian Pear and live like I have nothing left in my budget this month. Because I really don't. Apart from more cat food, there really is nothing I HAVE to buy. I have 5 gazillion books, which I shouldn't be reading anyway, because I've not read my school textbooks yet, so I don't need any more of those. Apart from bread for sandwiches and the odd veggie and fruit, I'm good for the whole month.Really! This shall be my challenge to myself - to use what I have in the cupboards (and refresh only perishables and staples) before buying any more food. Let's see how long it will last...**edited to add: It's funny how things work! There's an online site for buying and selling here that I've cleared a lot of things through over the past year or two. My current batch has been rotating for about a month or more. I edited my album about an hour ago and I've already made $60!! Plus, gotten rid of some things that have been sitting around for ages. How about that? :)"},
{"title": "Week Four Spending Update", "date": "Friday 25 January 2013", "text": "My handsome boy, Bylaw.I have a three day weekend this week, which is nice. There are no classes today for my program, so that gives me some extra time to relax and catch up on things around the house.Bylaw had a vet visit today, something he is never happy about. He's in good health, which is great news, although I have no idea how old he is - 14-ish? Somewhere around there. Anyway, I'm very pleased. While I was at the vet, I was going to ask about the cat I rescued a couple of weeks ago, but the vet beat me to it. It turns out she took him home. He didn't even make it to the shelter, so hearing that made my day. She was the vet who did the initial check-up on him, too, so that's wonderful news. She said the kids had decided \"Axel\" was a better name for him. He is apparently very friendly, litter-trained, neutered and he has a nice temperament, so why someone would just walk away and leave him (and a second one) behind is a mystery. But I am SO happy he got a chance - look how it turned out for him!My challenge exam went much better than I expected, too. I wasn't at all confident after I wrote it last Friday - it was quite tricky - and mentioned to a classmate that if I got 79.5%, I hoped the instructor would find the extra .5% to make it a pass. It turns out I got 98%!! I just about fell over, but am so excited and pleased to have one less class. I can use that time for homework in other classes. Goal met! :)As for spending this week, it looks like this:Jan 20Groceries: $16.03Jan 21Tea (Tim's): $1.97Jan 22Tea (Tim's): $1.97Wal-Mart: $11.03 (cat food, frozen chicken & broccoli portions <-- font=\"\">)-->Jan 23Lunch: $19.88 (we had a field trip and went out for lunch afterwards)Groceries: $46.39Yogurt: $7.49 (Iogo - no gelatin, lovely flavours)Gala apples: $6.38 (7 apples, 1.460 kg@$4.73/kg)Bananas: $2.57 (1.325 kg @$1.94 kg)Ginger root: $.18 (.065 kg @$2.82 kg)Green grapes: $7.98 (.910 kg @$8.77 kg - they're delicious and sweet)Red onion: $1.39 (.375 kg @$3.70 kg)Oranges: $3.98 (bag of 6 or 8 \"pink\" navels - 1.36 kg/3 lbs)Potatoes: $2.98 (bag of small white)Green pepper: $1.03 (.235 kg @$4.37 kg)Baking Potatoes: $1.74 (4 potatoes @ 1.640 kg @$1.06 kg)Red peppers: $2.19 (.270 kg @$8.11 kg)2lb strawberries: $4.96Sweet potato: $3.36 (1 potato: 1.190 kg @$2.82 kg)Jan 24Groceries: $12.03Sandwich bags (100): $2.36Almonds (1 kg bag): $9.55Tea/chocolate chip scone (school): $5.25 (OMG, that was good...)Online game tokens: $20.99Jan 25Vet visit: $59.85Total weekly spent: $195.39Unnecessary spends: $57.06Still too Â high, but better than last week, although that included the rescue cat vet visit. I still have lots of places to cut - mostly food, as you can see, and definitely those stupid online game tokens. My intention is to reduce the amount I'm spending at school...obviously by overspending at the grocery store. My problem is that my intentions to eat better are good, but I seem to never follow through and so much of this ends up wasted. Better focus here will reduce wasted food AND wasted money. Seriously, how much can one person eat anyway?Hope you all have a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Week Three Spending Update", "date": "Sunday 20 January 2013", "text": "This week has been spendy. I need to figure out WHY I keep spending money when I don't need to. I'm back to buying lots of food-related things, as well as stupid things like online game tokens (I know...).Jan 13Gas: $62.02 (gas is $129.9 p/L here)Pizza, butter: $12.82 (frozen pizza, on sale for $7.99; butter for baking)Jan 14Tim Horton's: $2.03 (used the last of my gift card, this is what I owed)Cat check up: $121.08 (I rescued a cat from the city pound - this was the cost of his initial vet visit. He was healthy, if not a bit sad and malnourished from being abandoned, so he went into foster care for several days for some well-deserved TLC and then to the Humane Society, where he'll be well taken care of until he finds a better home. I'm a sucker for a pretty cat face. HOWEVER, he'd have had no chance at Bylaw if he was sick - no one would've taken him and he'd have been put down. I had to give him that chance.)Jan 15Tea/scone (school): $5.25Pizza: $3.15Jan 16Groceries: $27.60Jan 17Tea/muffin (school): $4.75Phone bill: $57.88 (I got an unexpected inflow of cash this day: $160 from a friend who owed me from last year. I paid the phone bill in full, as well as putting $25 into my EFund and some onto my VISA card.)Jan 18Groceries (again): $16.42Tea/muffin (school): $4.75Jan 19Online game tokens: $33.57 (ridiculous.)Weekly Total: $355.12Needless spends (not counting the kitty rescue!)Game tokens $33.57Pizza (both): $11.54School tea/muffin/scone: $14.75Total needless: $59.86Total IN this week: $170.00That's six times as much as last week!! Still, this is the reason I'm tracking - so I know where my money (that I don't have) is going. It's still food-centric - and those grocery costs are above and beyond my gift card. So much for 'making do' this month. I did make peanut butter chocolate chip cookies yesterday, so that's something, but honestly. I seriously need to do some soul searching to dig up the problem here.I had my challenge exam on Friday morning and it was...challenging! I'm not overly confident, but hope I passed. There is generally a cost involved ($80), but my instructor spoke with the Registrar and I ended up not having to pay, which was a great surprise! I should know Monday or early Tuesday whether or not I passed. Fingers crossed please!I'm also looking into continuing my education after I'm done with this program. There are two streams that can further your focus - medical coding or legal secretary. They're online courses in partnership with a BC institution. I'm considering the medical coding stream. One of the prerequisites for the course is free (basically a tutorial on how to use the online learning), so I'm looking at doing that during reading week in March. One of my instructors happens to be the program coordinator for that, so I've already touched base with her on that aspect. I'm just waiting for the results of my exam before going ahead and registering for the class. I'm keen to keep learning, although the medical coding can take up to two years, as it depends when you can get into the classes. Some have very limited numbers and you need certain prerequisites, so you have to pay attention and act fast.Have a great week everyone!"},
{"title": "Week Two Update", "date": "Saturday 12 January 2013", "text": "Where does the time go? Three weeks holiday was over \"justlikethat\" and school has begun once again. I'm glad to have the routine back. I got a fair bit done while on holidays, but I did miss my routine of school, studies, classmates...so I am glad to be back.School-wise I hit two goals - one at the end of last year and one starting this semester. One of our courses is keyboarding (essentially typing practice). The goal is 50 wpm as a minimum - after mistakes - to pass the class. Going into the program last year, I already did more than that, somewhere in the 60's. My instructor said I had to do the weekly timings and the official ones in December, but if I did well enough there, then I would be given a pass and not have to take it in the winter (current) semester.Check! :) While practice is always beneficial (show me any professional who doesn't do it), it means one less class to take.My second goal was to take an extra (practical) class this semester. In December we had to pick one of two streams (accounting or administration). I chose administration, but had wavered between them because I've wanted to learn the Simply Accounting program for a number of years. I feel it would be very beneficial to have. The accounting stream includes this particular program.It costs nothing to ask most times, so I did. The class was over-enrolled to start, and there was some concern as to where they were going to put everyone, but it worked out and I'm now attending the Simply Accounting class 4 days a week.So, check! :)Next up is challenging one of my classes. It means reading 9 chapters in less than a week, along with all the other reading I need to do, but I'm confident I can do it. I only get one chance (and could lose $75), so need to make sure I go in prepared on Friday.I've kept a spending log this week and (no surprise) it's heavy on the food related spends. I'm carrying over Carla's first week challenge of \"making do\" for as long as it takes me to eat my way through what I've got in my cupboards. However, that doesn't seem to apply to taking lunches or snacks to school. This is what it looks like:Jan 7Tea - $2.25Muffin - $2.50Salad - $5.25Jan 8Tea - $2.25Jan 9Shoppers - $15.80 (4L milk, bread, 6 US stamps, although I only needed one)Lunch - $6.77Jan 10Advil - $6.29 (monster headache + college bookstore = over priced tablets)Bookstore - $3.14Jan 11Granola/tea - $6.40Tea - $2.25Weekly total: $52.88I have a g/c for Tim Horton's from a friend and have used that this week (Jan 8 & 10), and also took a sandwich for lunch on Jan 10, but otherwise that's still far too much money gone. I've been selling a few things online, though, and have made $30 this week, too, so that's something. I'm putting all extra cash and coins into my piggy bank/sealed jar and will open it at the end of the month to see how much I have. It's probably a fair bit. I'm also still waiting for the payment from Amazon for the book I sold last week.So, along with challenging my class, I'm going to challenge myself to take lunch and a tea every day for at least the rest of the month. I have no excuse not to. Even if it's just a peanut butter sandwich, it's something and it's using up what I have. Once that's complete, I'm going to focus on better eating and getting back to the gym. I haven't been since December 10, when Joey passed, and I need to get back into that routine as well.My new bed arrived last Sunday and I spent two hours putting it together. It's huge! I love it, but haven't been sleeping as soundly as I'd like. For the past couple of weeks I've been waking at 3 a.m., tossing and turning for an hour...two hours...three hours...it's exhausting! I feel like the week has dragged by and I'm feeling sluggish and overly sensitive. Hate that. I think only a small part of it is adjusting to the new mattress, so I can't quite figure out what my subconscious is up to these days and why it feels the need to get me up in the middle of the night. Bylaw is also part of the problem. I get up to use the washroom sometimes, but for a couple of weeks prior to Dinah's passing, I was also feeding her. Bylaw would finish off what she didn't eat, so he's used to getting a 'snack.' He fusses and pats at my face until I get up, so I'm not sure what to do about that. Cats...Have a great weekend everyone!"},
{"title": "Week One Accountability Post (aka Carla's January Challenge, Week #1 Update)", "date": "Saturday 5 January 2013", "text": "I figured I would start off the year right by doing accountability posts. Putting it \"out there\" makes sense, where I and others can see how I'm doing. So while I think about it, instead of leaving it and (conveniently?) forgetting about it, here it is:Jan 1NO SPENDJan 2$351.75 - 3 textbooks for school. I've got the money for these expenses and have already transferred enough to cover the cost of two of them. I may be returning the third.$137.56 - textbook from Amazon. This is a duplicate of one of the three above, but I'll be returning the one I bought from the college on Monday. This book cost me almost $40 LESS!Jan 3$22.12 - lunch with a friend. It's been over a year since we've had lunch together, so I'm okay with this.$16.26 - mailed two parcels. One textbook and one gift. I will make approximately $65 for the textbook.$41.54 - Shoppers Drug Mart. I overspent here by almost $30. Olay has one of those battery operated, handheld facial brushes. It was on sale for $27.99. I got sucked in...but it's fantastic, FYI.Jan 4NO SPENDJan 5$17.04 - bookstore. I had a $50 gift certificate. Why can I always go over??$10.49 - large mixing bowl at Cdn Tire. I already have two medium size bowls. I DID reconsider this and am still not 100% convinced I need it, but the size is perfect for letting bread rise. I'll keep the receipt and give it a week.$15.15 - Wal-Mart. 4 tins of Friskies cat food. Bylaw has decided that the good-quality, healthy food he's had no qualms with to this point is no longer satisfactory on its own. Likely because Dinah was eating different food and he would finish off whatever she left behind. So I bought some cheap crap (0.64 per tin) to mix in with the good stuff. I don't like him eating it, but I want him to eat, so there we are. I also bought a box of envelopes and some sticky tabs for school.Total spent this week:Â $611.91 (!!)Total OVERspent this week:$55.52Total coming back:$233.00 (one confirmed textbook return [$168], one textbook sale [$65])Revised total amount spent:$378.91That seems quite extraordinary. Part of the reason it's so high, of course, is the textbooks. Regardless, I have some cutting to do. But notice that NONE OF IT IS FOOD RELATED, apart from the lunch. This is a big step in the right direction for me. I got a couple of grocery store gift cards from friends for Christmas, so that will really help me out this month.As for decluttering, I had a go at my junk drawer in the kitchen and actually found a whole lot of crap in there: receipts for repairs on my old truck, vet files for the cats, cords, wires, old batteries, little bags with buttons to god-knows-what, old pens, two cell phones - neither of which are activated - and a bunch of other bits and pieces. The paperwork got tossed into the recycling box and the rest of the stuff goes to the freestore. There's an amazing amount of crap out there (as we know) and an amazing number of people who will find treasures within it. They can have it! :)"},
{"title": "What a lovely way to start a new year!", "date": "Wednesday 2 January 2013", "text": "Today started off nicely with a brunch with two co-workers. It was lovely to see them and get caught up on things. Feeling extra special as I was treated to my brunch! How nice is that?I stopped at the college and paid a ridiculous amount of money for textbooks. Outrageous prices! At any rate, I bought three although I only needed two. I'm hoping to add a class to my course load and decided to buy the textbook for it anyway, knowing that I can return it if my request is denied. Fingers crossed I can add it, as it's one that I want very much to do.When I got home, I went to Amazon to compare prices. One of the books I got was a used copy (the only one in the pile - excellent catch!), so I know I got a decent price there. The other one was almost $40 cheaper online!! So I ordered it and will return the other copy to the bookstore at school. I did pay a little extra for priority shipping, so it'll be here on Monday. :) Also, I sold a book! The textbook from my creative writing class would have got me about $23 (I paid $110) during the buy back at the school, and I figured I could do way better selling it online instead. I got notice today that it had sold, so I'll be mailing that off tomorrow. How exciting! After all the costs, I make about $65 on it, which is great.A box of DVDs that I had loaned a friend was waiting for me when I got home, too. I was sorry to have missed her. She's been recovering from surgery for several weeks and this was one of her easy outings, as she lives just around the corner from me. Attached to the DVDs was a thank you card and inside that a $50 gift card to Chapters! Honestly. She's so sweet. She said she hoped it makes me feel better (after losing the cats). I'm a bit overwhelmed, as it's such a lovely gesture and I appreciate it very much.The weather is fantastic - it's warm (-1C, after weeks of temps in the low -30C's), there's a beautiful blue sky, sunshine... I have a warm, purring cat snoozing on my lap, lunch with a friend tomorrow, an armchair leaving the house this afternoon (hurrah! I gave it away. I'm sick of looking at it, never use it and it's too big for the space anyway), and school to look forward to on Monday. I also got Dinah's ashes today, along with a nice card from the vets and staff. Several had actually personalized it, so that meant a lot to me. She's now in a pretty box on my bedroom windowsill.I've pretty much completed my to do list, which I'm pleased about. Several \"more pressing\" things are still outstanding and I know I'll kick myself if I don't get them done before Monday, so I really need to kick it up a notch to scratch everything off the page. I don't feel like I've done much today, but I've actually accomplished more than I thought, which is great."},
{"title": "2013 Goals", "date": "Tuesday 1 January 2013", "text": "My goals aren't too specific this year. Less of some things, more of others. Financially, it's going to be a bit of a mixed bag, because while I can shave costs in some areas, I'm still going into debt each month regardless and will end with a big number at the end of it.But simple ones will help. I wish I were clever like Jolie, and could do cute infographics. I have no idea where to start, so the \"ever popular\" bullet-like list will have to suffice.FinancialSpend less. This should be something I'm doing anyway, but the vet bills over the past few months have been gobbling up much of my (non)existent cash. Bylaw is healthy for the time being (knock on wood), so that means I can concentrate on cutting costs elsewhere, most likely in the food category and the \"random-impulsive-purchases-because-I'm-stressed-out\" category. This will mean no buying food or drinks at school, but I will allow myself a weekly treat, so that I don't feel deprived.Track my spending. Again, something I need to be doing anyway, but am not. If I can do this for the month of January, I think I'll have made it a habit and it will be easier to continue.Keep rolling my change! It adds up fast.Leave my credit cards at home. They add up fast, too... :(Put $500 into my EFund. I believe this is doable, particularly as I *should* be getting a tax refund this year.Pay back my work pension. Because I'm on LWOP until June, I have to buy back the time I've been gone if I don't want it to be a break in service (which I don't, as that will affect the long term pension). Fortunately it's only 9 months and will hopefully not be too expensive. I'm hoping that part of my tax refund this year can go towards buying that time back. It makes sense to cut some debt as soon as I can.FunSay 'yes' more often. Be more open to experiences, rather than hiding from them and winding up with a bunch of \"I wish I had done...'s\" at the end of the year.Try writing a book. Either a romance or a 'cosy' mystery. It doesn't have to be published, just written.Use my camera more often. And I mean my fabulous dSLR, not my pocket digital. The little one is great, and very convenient, but I'm not learning anything from it.Bake. I'm good at it, and I enjoy it, so I will aim to do this weekly. Besides, baking my own treats will save me money, right? And plus it's fun to share.Long weekend in either Atlin or Skagway. Because apart from being fun places, it's nice to get away for a couple of days for a change of scenery. I'm going to aim for my birthday weekend and see if I can get a couple of girlfriends to join me.Read. Read only things I have to and things I enjoy. Don't try reading something simply because it's popular. I made that mistake with \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" and regretted it. :P I'm going to keep track again this year.PracticalGraduate with excellent marks. I'm on my way already, I just need to focus and slow down a little more and I can be a straight A student.Find a new job. It's inevitable that I'll start feeling more and more dread the closer the time comes for me to go back to work. I can balance this by actively searching for new jobs BEFORE I graduate, and before I'm due back at work.Keep the house tidy. The outside reflects what's going on inside. So said a wise lady to me last year (er, 2011), and it makes absolute sense. Chaos in the house means I can't relax, so my goal is to keep things tidy and clean, clear and put away.Cook regularly. I don't like cooking, so it becomes this big chore and I cheat and take the easy way out with pasta and things like that. My schedule is so good that I have no excuses not to eat properly and healthily.Regular gym visits. See \"schedule is so good,\" above. Again, no excuses here.I think I'll try to add a separate page for these to keep them where I can access them. I've also joined Carla's January Challenge (what would we do without her?!) and have to think of something that desperately needs decluttering. I'll have a think and let you know."},
{"title": "Another goodbye", "date": "Saturday 29 December 2012", "text": "December is the time of year when you typically think, \"out with the old, in with the new.\" It's the time of closure, cleaning out, endings, making way for new goals, resolutions and a brand spanking new year, full of possibilities.So, I suppose it is symbolic that I had to say goodbye to another kitty on Thursday. My tiny princess Dinah passed quietly on Thursday afternoon, surrounded by those who loved her. I made the decision that morning, after spending too much time cleaning up around the apartment (she'd taken to peeing outside the litter box). My head and my heart aligned with a 'click,' and I even went to speak with the vet for a few minutes. I hated feeling like I was giving up on her and I hated that money (or lack of) also had to be part of the decision. The harsh reality hurts.I had hit a wall and was frustrated, stressed out, and tired (for both of us). Intellectually I understand that most often the kindest thing for a suffering animal is to let them go, but until your heart is in line with that, you just keep going, hoping for a miracle or an answer to fall out of the sky. It was when I really, truly understood that I was keeping her alive for ME, that it was \"easier\" to realize I needed to let her go.My landlady left work to collect us, drive us to the vet and came in to say goodbye while Dinah passed. Once again, she's amazing and I am so, so thankful to have her around.It was harder to let go of Dinah because I've had her the whole time I've been in the Yukon. I got her a month after I arrived and she's been my one constant thing for 6.5 years. Through everything, I've had Dinah. She was a sweet cat, sociable and joyful, a pretty calico. According to the vet, she was an unusual calico because she loved attention and was so easy to work with. Apparently that's not generally the case, so I'm happy she was so well-liked among the staff.Tiny princess Dinah, 2003 - 2012.As well, coming only 17 days after Joey's passing made it that much more difficult. My tiny girl has left a very big hole behind. I really miss her. Even Bylaw has been looking for her, wandering around and chirping. He's been stuck to me like glue from the moment I got home on Thursday.It's just me and Bylaw now, which is strange. I've never not had a houseful of cats (okay, 2 or 3) and it feels very empty around here without the activity, warm bodies and companionship. I'll adjust, obviously, but won't be getting another one (or two) to fill the space, as much as I'd like to. I'm done for a while.At this point, I have other things I'd like to do, that I feel I need to do, and having an animal will tie me down. I don't consider them a burden, nor do I regret a single penny I spend on them, but I'm feeling a little bit freer to make different choices now. Despite the unconditional love and pleasure that a pet brings you, there are costs involved, sometimes substantial ones, and the money I would be spending on vet bills can now be directed towards debt, costs of living and the future. It's a hard truth, but I am relieved that I have given her peace and myself less stress. I can focus on school without worrying about her.I hope everyone has a safe, happy New Year. Best wishes for a prosperous,Â joyful and dream-filled 2013!"},

{"title": "December 13 - and the end of the first term", "date": "Thursday 13 December 2012", "text": "I had my last exam this morning and am confident I did well in all of them. We only had four, and I was actually quite surprised (pleasantly) at how \"easy\" they seemed to be. Granted, we all have our strengths in particular areas, but even so. Today's Accounting exam was easier than some of our assignments have been! While I was pleased to see that, I was also a little disappointed - I suppose I was wanting a bit more of a challenge. Regardless, I now have three weeks off to do whatever I like. :) HURRAH!I can't believe it's over already. I'm doing very well and am happy with my results thus far. I've stopped competing and am just enjoying the process now, which has made a big difference. My list of things to do includes: reading, relaxing, going to the gym, writing some very, very long overdue letters and making some phone calls to catch up with friends. Basically, just take advantage of the time I have.Tonight and tomorrow night I'm going to the Arts Centre to see this and this. They're supposed to be fantastic, so I invited a couple of friends who are uber-geeks to join me. I get student pricing (on my own tickets, at least) and decided that I would have some fun during my \"time off,\" so definitely want to take advantage of things like that.My week started off sadly, though, as I said goodbye to my cat Joey (aka, Fat Joey). I've had him since May 2010 (some of you may remember when he arrived) and he's been an absolute joy to have around. He was a lovely boy and very laid back. He developed a tumour on a paw last May, which was removed. It grew back, though, faster and bigger, to the point that the vets weren't sure they wanted to do the operation, as by that point he had what was thought to be asthma and it could affect him with respect to going under a general anaesthetic. It turned out to be a tumour on his chest, which was the reason his lungs kept filling with fluid, and affecting his breathing. And it was an inoperable one.I decided to go ahead with the operation with the understanding that he wouldn't last much longer anyway, but knowing that the tumour on his paw was just going to get really messy and nasty if it wasn't removed. They ended up taking most of his paw and leaving him with just a little stump.Joey doing what he loved to do best. RIP Fat One. XXHe basically didn't recover from the surgery and went downhill very quickly. Plus he had a urinary tract infection and his kidneys were shutting down, and trying to force him to take the medications I got for him was super stressful for him. I had him put to sleep on Monday, when I got home from my first exam, and just a week after his surgery. It was a very stressful time for me, and I'm relieved it's over - for him because he was so miserable and for me because now he is at peace, although I miss him terribly. I have a lot to be thankful for though: my landlady drove me to say goodbye to him, the vet was awesome, and it was a beautiful day when he passed.I had him cremated and got a lovely box for him. I love that Â it has feet on it; he hated having his feet touched, so now I can touch them whenever I like. :)I'm actually doing well, considering. There was no coming back for him and the vet had tried everything she knew, but it was time. I miss his presence at night especially, but I have no guilt or second thoughts about it, so I know it was the right time. It's still a painful decision, regardless. It was a bit of a surprise, as up to the surgery he'd been doing well, so to have him deteriorate so quickly was a shock, particularly as it's Dinah I've been worried about until now. She's doing 'okay.' Not great, not awful - basically no change. Hopefully something can be figured out with her, as she's Â now on steroids and a new food, but it's very frustrating. Poor tiny thing.My spending is just...I don't even want to look at it, quite frankly. It's something I need to do for the new year, but right now it's vet costs that are eating up almost every penny I have, and then some. Thankfully, I had my EFund to cover Joey's surgery, but that's essentially gone now. It's going to be a super-tight new year, so I will use some of my free time over the next several weeks to work on goals, a new budget, decluttering and selling a few things, so the New Year feels fresh and positive.I promise to be more faithful with my posting, at least through the rest of the month. I've got lots of reading to catch up with, too, so l'm looking forward to that as well.Have a wonderful weekend from the snowy North!"},
{"title": "It's Friday!", "date": "Friday 2 November 2012", "text": "The end of another week already! I can't believe how quickly the time is passing. It's been six weeks since I started school and we're in the midst of our mid-term exams this week and next, plus still handing in assignments, so it's quite busy around here these days.While it's ended quite nicely, it started off with a bump on Monday as I forgot to email the Word Processing exam to the instructor, along with handing the hard copies in. I lost 20 marks for that (5 points per missed attachment). I was so bummed! We got them back today and the instructor had added a little note to it, possibly to cheer me up (?): \"you would have tied for the highest mark in the class if you hadn't forgotten the email.\"Â Thanks...I think!Ah, well. What can you do? Learn and move on. Needless to say, I was overly paranoid at my Excel exam on Thursday morning and triple checked everything before sending, including counting the number the attachments on the email, the email address and subject line, etc. No WAY am I going to forget that again. I got my mark on my last accounting quiz and did better than I thought, although I made some silly (aren't they all?) mistakes. Our second term test is on Monday, so I have a few things to review and add to my - authorized - cheat sheet prior to that.Overall, things are going well. I'm still motivated and excited to be there, and feeling more relaxed in the classroom now that I know a few more people a bit better. I think we're all getting used to one another, so aren't as shy or aloof or nervous as when we first started. I'm doing better in and enjoying accounting more than I thought, so I'm now waffling about which 'stream' I want to do next semester. Likely I'll stick with the Admin Assistant stream as it's more focused on writing and I like that. I can go back and do the accounting stream next year if I want and, of course, if I'm working in a place where that would be supported.Have I said how much I likeÂ love not working?? :)I had a lovely chat with my friend in Hong Kong last night. She and her husband now have two puppies, who I \"met.\" One is Ella, a lovely little blonde Lab-X, about 5 months old. She has a few funny wrinkles, so there's possibly a little Shar-pei in there somewhere. The second one is Poppy, who is just a week old and was found discarded in a park where my friend her family were walking. They are, more or less, fostering her for the SPCA and have been doing the whole baby thing: getting up for regular feedings during the night. Poppy is now feeding at 3.5 hour intervals. Her eyes won't be open for another couple of weeks yet and she's the sweetest, tiniest little thing. Black and brown like a Rottweiler, although likely another mixed breed. Whether they'll actually be able to let her go after all the work they're putting in is hard to say. They have a few months yet to make a decision.This morning I had a nice, leisurely breakfast with a friend. Although I'm supposed to be cutting out/down on sugar, I opted for the pancakes with a side of maple bacon. And a healthy dollop of maple syrup. I love pancakes, but only eat them when I go out for breakfast, which is very rare. My friend agreed, and it's something we need to do again. She's alone at work for now, so she's got some flexibility with respect to being in the office. She slipped out to meet me and we had a lovely time getting caught up over eggs benny and pancakes.Kitties are okay. Dinah is still weak and very, very thin, but at least I have her eating more regularly now. It's a mix of two different foods, which she inhales and then yells at me for more. I don't know what the options are for her at this point. Just maintain with a diet? There isn't any medication she can take because she's not really sick in that way; it's just her pancreas that needs to heal and I don't know what it takes to do that. Just more questions and visits with the vet to see how she's coming along. I was given a lesson in administering IV fluids, but she won't sit still for that, although it's what she needs to feel better. As for Joey, he's a fat and happy cat, although the tumour is growing like a (slow-growing) weed. They didn't do the operation in October because there was fluid on his lungs that prevented him breathing properly. Instead, they drained that off (almost a cup!) and he's feeling much better. He's still wheezing on occasion, however, and I got a prescription from the vet on Saturday for a bronchial relaxer (like a human inhaler) that would help open the airways a bit. I haven't filled that yet, but it does need to be done soon. And it's a pill, just in case anyone was picturing me trying to get a little pump into his mouth. It's certainly what I pictured when the vet said it! Not that it being a pill makes it any easier.Because I'm not working - full-time at least -, I'm realizing how much three cats actually cost me each month, although to be fair, it has become a lot more costly only recently given all the health issues that have popped up. Yikes! I hate saying it, but I have to be realistic in that I can only do so much. I also know that I would never forgive myself if I made The Decision before everything had been tried. So. Not going there. But just REALLY frustrated.Apart from work on Sunday afternoon, I don't have many plans for the weekend. I have to review for my accounting test on Monday and I made a start on my Christmas cards this morning, too. I have some funds set aside for those. I'm sending several little parcels, but for the most part my Christmas presents are going to be baked. It's cookies all around, I'm afraid! :)Have a great weekend everyone, and don't forget to change your clocks back an hour on Sunday!"},
{"title": "Long weekend update", "date": "Saturday 6 October 2012", "text": "Happy Thanksgiving everyone! It's a 4-day weekend here and I have a long list of things to do, hopefully fairly well-balanced between \"have to's\" and \"want to's.\" Thought I would try to squeeze an update in while I've got some time and while I'm thinking about it. I'm feeling very neglectful of my blog, but I'm really trying to stay focused on the school work, which is getting both more challenging and heavier. Apologies, but I'm going to resort to a bullet post.Dinah was at the vet again on Monday. Dehydrated, listless & lethargic, not really eating. I was worried enough that I called the vet on Sunday and took her in on Monday morning, where they put her on fluids right away and took another blood sample, which went off to the lab for testing. She was there overnight and came back feeling much better. She's okay for a couple of days, then seems to fade again, so I just keep feeding her the required food and watch her to make sure she's drinking water. Until the test results come back, there isn't much else I can do except keep an eye on her.Joey went to the vet yesterday. Back in May he had a tumour removed from one of his paws. The vet managed to remove all of it, but did say to keep an eye on the area in case of regrowth. Well, it's regrown - faster and bigger this time. It's currently just a large, soft and swollen lump on the same foot in the same place, so he's going back for another surgery on Tuesday. This time he might actually lose some toes to it. Plus, when I mentioned he'd been coughing (different than that hairball hack), she listened to his lungs and said it's likely asthma. I had no idea cats could get asthma, but it's apparently quite common.I'm feeling quite overwhelmed by all these pet issues. It's not their fault, and I'm going to ensure they get healthy, but realistically I am limited in what I can do. Joey'sÂ after careÂ is going to be longer and more painful than the first one, and that means more vet visits to ensure everything is healing properly, etc. All of this adds up and that's the part that I'm worried about. I need to let go and trust that it will all work out. It's just...frustrating.I've been a bit melancholy this week. A friend is moving back to France for a year and I took her out for lunch on Thursday. I don't see her often, but she's a lovely woman and is following her heart to be able to spend time with her parents and grandmother. My sister and her husband are in Portugal and have been following their hearts. I'm just tired of working and want to take a year off to do whatever I want. Maybe I'm just working too hard in the wrong direction or something...I have to do some reflection.The schoolwork is starting to pick up, too! I was writing all the assignments and tests and exams into my agenda the other day and they all get closer to each other as we make our way to December. I handed in an assignment the other day which is incomplete (my fault, I put it off and didn't read the instructions) and am feeling stuck in a class because I can't figure out how you figure out subjective, objective and plural possessive cases in a sentence...Any suggestions, all you teachers out there?The creative writing class is a lot of fun and I'm so glad I signed up for it. It's very challenging and just what I need. I did get an odd email from a classmate the other day and when he asked if I got it I just said 'yes' and left it at that. I deleted it (it was for a dance tonight, but he added what I considered an unnecessary and vaguely creepy comment to it), but I'm just not sure what to make of it (or him), so stuck with my tried-and-true passive-aggressive response, which is no specific response. I'm most likely reading far too much into it (and taking it entirely the wrong way), so I'm just going to ignore it.I got a p/t job at the college library! I work Sunday afternoons. It's crazy quiet, which is just fine and it's familiar territory - more or less - so I'm pleased. I'm hoping I'll be able to pick up a few more hours once my yoga class finishes at the end of this month.Yoga rocks! I'd like to take the beginner class again, as there's so much to think about when you're doing it. We'll see. I have other monetary priorities at the moment, although I DO have to have a little time for me to relax and forget about everything, don't I?I've got a Thanksgiving dinner tonight, a walk this afternoon, work tomorrow and yoga Monday evening. I've made a to-do list, so that I can get some schoolwork done in between, as well as an errand or two. I want to work ahead a bit on my assignments, so that what I'm doing around those is review, reading, etc. I realized the other day that I've been doing all my assignments without the required reading. I know, it doesn't make sense, but I'm doing very well despite that! It just means I have some catching up to do.Generally I make a dessert for my potluck meals, but I ordered dessert this time. A woman in town makes the World's Bestest Cupcakes and she's made pumpkin cupcakes with cream cheese buttercream icing this holiday. She's even delivering! $20 and a dozen cupcakes are mine. It's one less thing I have to do, so I hope everyone understands.I've been doing great with my decluttering, too! Been going at it like mad the past few weeks. I sold my x-country skis/boots the other day and made $150, which I'm going to put towards a pair of decent snowpants - something I need to make winter more bearable. A friend is picking up my chair at the end of the month, which will leave more space in the living room. It was part of the set, but just takes up too much space and I've never used it. It's been lovingly broken in by the cats (but not TOO badly) and she's fine with that, so I'm happy to get rid of it.Time for me to get on with some more assignments. Cupcake delivery is at noon and I should probably be out of my pajamas by then.Have a fantastic weekend everyone!"},
{"title": "An update at last!", "date": "Sunday 16 September 2012", "text": "Ideally, this would be me, spending quality time in the library at school, being all studious and keen to learn as much as I can (or more)!The reality:Feeling a little overwhelmed by it all, right now. As I said the other day, I'm NOT complaining - I like the feeling of being a student and doing something I'm actually interested in - but it's taking me some time to get a routine going, particularly as the heavy-duty work starts in earnest this week. One of our instructors said quite frankly on Friday: \"The honeymoon is over.\"I've sat down and made a 'to-do' list for the weekend and for next week, so that I can accomplish some things that aren't school-related. I'm becoming aware that setting out a plan for each day is the best way to do this, and have to realize that it needs to be flexible. I'll need to remember that as long as it's not school-related, it can be postponed.I have my schedules in every binder, on the fridge and beside my computer; I got a locker at school to keep myself organized and have somewhere to leave my coat in the winter; I've got paper, pens, folders, stationery out the yin-yang, textbooks, and I wake up every day happy and excited that I'm not going to \"real\" work. But do I have the motivation? This is my biggest fear, that I'll take advantage of the fact that I'm not working for 9-months and just blow this whole thing. That somehow I won't be able to keep up and it'll end up being a complete waste of time. Or, worse, that I'll be bored stiff.It's a BIG adjustment. I've already sat down with one of my (two) instructors to discuss the keyboarding class. I was relieved to find out that it's not structured like the other courses and that if I do well enough in the official timings (the \"exam\") at the end of December, I won't have to take it next semester. This is my new goal. My first was to pass two assessments that were given to us over the first two days (Business Math & Computer Literacy). Math is not my forte, but once I figured out the structure of the questions, it was no problem. I spent ages reviewing fractions for nothing! Ha ha! And we're all a bunch of computer smarty-pants it seems, as the whole class passed the computer literacy assessment. Fantastic! Insta-credits all 'round! :)Monday is our first quiz (Accounting), plus we have three assignments to hand in! And so, it begins...The creative writing class is going to be a lot of fun. The first writing review went very well. I wasn't overly happy with what I (eventually) submitted, but it got good reviews - and great critiques - and it did work as I'd hoped, with a little twist at the end. Several people read it twice! It took AGES to write something, but now that it's down, I do have something to work with and expand on, so I'm actually feeling much better about it. I've got a bit of a break in the writing arena for the next week, too, but have some reading and critiquing to do. Fortunately, there's no final exam for this course. We have to, instead, hand in revised versions of the work we do over the course of the class.Outside of school, things are going well too. My roommate left yesterday, which is a shame, but I have another one moving in at the end of the week. She seems nice - young, so I hope it won't be a problem - and the money I get from her will cover all of my expenses every month (including gas for the truck)! I'm dipping WAY into my LOC and will be paying rent in advance through June. I'm hoping that I'll be able to put some of the money I get towards a payment each month as I'm going to also use it to pay off my credit cards. Stupid spending again. I miscalculated my final paycheque and it turns out my last full one was September 5, not the 19th as I was expecting. I'll get a couple hundred dollars from an extra shift I did before I left work, but it just means I'll have to use more of the LOC than I was intending, so I have to be careful. I get my first grant cheque this Friday, and that will cover groceries and a tank of gas, hopefully, so I can't forget that by being frugal, I can actually live 9-months without working.This means I also need to tidy, clean and reorganize a few things as this roommate is looking for longer term accommodation. I've been doing great with decluttering and either selling or recycling and donating the stuff. Two big bags of books have made their way to the second-hand store, lots of stuff has disappeared into the free store at the recycling depot and I've managed to make some decent cash from selling some items, too, which is terrific. The place is looking and feeling much better. I think it stems from the fact that I don't want too much clutter and distraction while I'm at school. If I continue to pick away at this, it's going to be fantastic by the end of the year.My poor little princess is back at the vet's this weekend. While I was away in July she was there for several days and that's when they discovered that she was no longer diabetic, but they didn't know what was wrong with her. She was at the vet last week, too, for another glucose test and it turns out she's got acute pancreatitis. It means the digestive enzymes aren't working properly and the pancreas is effectively digesting itself, rather than helping digest food. She's skin & bones, lethargic, vomiting yet increasingly hungry and just so miserable and sick. I went to collect some information from the vet yesterday and mentioned she wasn't doing well, so they kindly took her in and they've had her overnight. It's really the best place she can be. I believe they've run an ultrasound test as well, to see what it actually looks like inside and the vet has already called to say she seems to be doing well. She's on fluids, but hasn't had a bowel movement (stress-related). She should be home later this afternoon.My landlady continues her streak as the Awesomest in the Universe. She bought me (well, technically the suite) a new washer and dryer set! I had a washer in the suite and used drying racks up to now and it worked fine. You just had to time everything better when it came to drying it. The new set is stackable, very water/energy efficient (front load) and is actually going to make a tremendous difference with respect to how much cat hair is around the place. I kept a drying rack because I do think it's better to hang dry some stuff, but otherwise I'm thrilled to bits with my shiny new machines! :) I swear I'm the luckiest tenant in the city.But I need to stop distracting myself and get some things crossed off my to-do list, school-related and not. Hope you all have a great remainder of your weekend!"},
{"title": "A quick hello!", "date": "Thursday 13 September 2012", "text": "Thanks for all your support as I head back to school! It's greatly appreciated. I'm struggling a bit with the time management aspect of things, and have to keep reminding myself that the big 3-hour block between some of my classes isn't \"free\" time, it's time I need to read, do assignments, etc. This first full week hasn't been so bad, but starting next week it's going to be full on and I need to get my head around the fact that I can't just turn it off at the end of the day, there's going to be LOTS of homework and I need to be organized so I can get it all done.EEEEK!I am NOT complaining. I am so happy to be learning - even if some of it, at this point, is stuff I already know. I have little chats with myself to remind me to just breathe...focus and listen...I've worked so hard to be here - am SO EXCITED (!!!) to be here - I can't mess up the experience by getting impatient and losing interest in the first few days. I just have to switch my brain from work mode to school mode. Once routines are established it will become easier. It's a bit clunky right now as I figure out the best place to leave all my textbooks, notebooks, tea mug, what I need for class, etc.I promise I will write a much longer and more detailed post this weekend, but I just wanted to post to say \"THANK YOU!\""},

I've wanted to do a creative writing course forever and I'm scared stiff of it, but I think I need a push like this to be more a) creative and b) get me writing more regularly.

She's away for about two weeks, so I've got the place to myself again. Since I got home I've done the dishes, removed almost an entire shelf of books from one of the bookshelves in my room (aiming for one bookshelf), taken my recycling to the depot and dropped a load of stuff at the free store, taken some photos of items I'm hoping to sell and uploaded them to FB.I made $140 last weekend selling things, so I'm quite pleased. I've got lots more to go and will hopefully clear some of it this weekend. It feels great to get this stuff out of the house!If you notice the widget over there (--->) you'll notice how close school actually is now (Where did I start? Something around 180-odd days, wasn't it?). I'm getting a bit nervous, but am so excited, too! I'm confident everything is in place, so now it's just a matter of \"living\" through the last 4 days of work. FOUR DAYS OF WORK!!!! HOW EXCITING IS THAT?!?!?I've ordered myself some special cupcakes to help celebrate my new adventure: lemon lavender! Mmm. I pick them up next Thursday, MY LAST DAY OF WORK!!!!!!I've registered for a Monday night beginner yoga class starting September 10. I've wanted to do this particular course for two years. A friend is joining me, making it twice as nice.One night a week, starting in September, there's an introductory archery program through the City. I've always wanted to try this, so I'm super excited. This goes all the way through to Christmas and looks to be a drop-in program. I'm going to set the money aside for it from my next paycheque, so I'm not feeling too tight during school.When I applied for my leave, I also applied for funding to help pay for my program. It took several months, but I got a letter on Wednesday letting me know that my request was approved! I will have 35% of my tuition fees reimbursed when I've finished the program. Of course, this means I have to pass, but I'm thrilled! I wasn't really expecting anything, but it costs nothing to ask, so this was fantastic news.I'm on the lookout for a new roomie to help with costs while I'm at school. Having cats will weed out the most undesirables, as well as those who don't like them or are allergic. I'll find the right person because only the right person will put up with three.Â I'm going to miss my roommate when she's gone. I've enjoyed her company over the summer. I'll have to check her bags for one of my cats when she goes, though...they've bonded.My trip to Ontario was lovely. The cottage was on a gorgeous lake and sat on a big shady lot, so there was lots of opportunity to keep cool (I'm not a sun worshipper). We had a fantastic storm on the Tuesday, and managed to get back from bird watching (osprey & chick) just before the rain started. It was crazy hot, but not as hideous as Toronto! My hotel room was air conditioned, but the heat and humidity made me miserable as I had a headache for almost four straight days. Despite feeling overheated, I had an awesome visit with my friend over most of two days. We hadn't seen each other for 10 years, but picked up right where we left off, more or less, which is a sign of a solid friendship. I'm trying to convince her to visit me here; I've pretty much got her boyfriend sold, so it's a matter of getting her 100% behind the idea.I hope everyone has been having a great summer so far. I'm behind on my blog reading and am afraid I shall remain so for the foreseeable future. I'm going to be busy! :) Have a great weekend everyone!"},

I just don't know what that is and my mind doesn't shut up long enough for me to be able to hear what my heart is saying.6) I have too many books on my shelves that I haven't read yet, despite my best intentions. There are always more interesting ones that I bring home from the library! :P7) I love bright colours. They make me happy. The art pieces I buy always have a bright colour in them, to perk up an otherwise bland space (the apartment walls are a light, cream-coloured eggshell; very neutral).*Bonus: 8) I'm hopelessly addicted to \"Angry Birds.\" There. I've said it...Nominate 15 blogs!Â Oh my...this will be difficult (and something I'll have to do later today!)."},
{"title": "Financial questions", "date": "Wednesday 18 July 2012", "text": "I found this over at the lovelyÂ Carla's blog and thought I would answer it too!1. What isyour income? About $43K(pre-deductions), plus whatever I make at the p/t job. That varies as I workmaybe twice a month or so, depending on whether Iâm available or not.2. What areyour (fixed) monthly expenses?Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1. RentÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  2. HydroÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3. Phone/InternetÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  4. RRSP deductionÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  5. EFund deductionÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  6. 3. Whatwould happen if you died tomorrow?It would allend up intestate at this point. I have the will information all filled out, buthave not yet filed it. Itâs hard to get your mind around preparing for yourdeath. Thereâs a little subconscious action going on that prevents immediateaction. But we know that not everything goes according to our plans, accidentshappen, etc.Â  So. Time to move on that,particularly as Iâve had the money saved for that for, oh, two years?4. Wherecould you get $500 in an emergency?My emergencyfund or from various savings accounts.5. Whatwould you do if you got fired from your job?I paniceasily, so that would happen for sure. Then once that was out of my system, I would just have to deal with itand start looking for something else, in the meantime filing for EI.I have too many responsibilities and canât afford to not work for more than aweek or so (NB: a good reason to continue funding the EFund!).**edit: Would not be eligible for EI if I was fired! And working in a unionized environment you have to do something REALLY awful to get fired.6. How willyou live in retirement?ComfortablyI hope. Meaning that all my needs are accounted for, plus I have enough for afew wants as well. Not worrying about where my next meal will come from andthat will allow me to care for animals, although perhaps not my own (Iâm tooafraid of dying before they do at some point and would be overly-concernedabout their welfare after that), so more realistically through a charity ofsome sort or other.7. Whatcould you sell to make extra cash if needed?Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1. Computer & accoutrementsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  2. CarÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3. DVDsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  4. Groovy furnitureÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  5. Books galoreÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  6. Camera & lensÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  7. KitchenAid mixerÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  8. TV & DVD playerÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  9. ArtÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  10. Probably lots of other stuffâ¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  8. Does yourspending align with your values?Hmm. Notentirely. I buy âthingsâ and then feel put out because I donât have any cash todo fun stuff or go places. My priorities need to shift to the experiential,rather than just filling my life with stuff that I really donât need.9. What areyou teaching (or will you teach) your kids about money?No kids!10. Whatsteps can you take today to improve your financial situation?Stopspending mindlessly. Be more mindful of what I want (i.e. listen to my heart,rather than my head) and work harder at being less impulsive. Keep track of what I spend my money on and work harder to shave costs where I can."},
{"title": "Sunny Sunday update", "date": "Sunday 8 July 2012", "text": "The beginning of the Yukon River Quest 2012. The participants are racing to Dawson City (715km/444 miles).I am my own worst enemy when it comes to distracting myself, so I only have myself to blame for the lack of postings! Ah well. This is supposed to be fun, anyway, not an obligation, so I have to keep that in mind, too.What have I been doing?Last Sunday I imposed a \"no refined sugar\" ban on myself, for at least the month of July, to see how I feel at the end of it. I'm allowing items that are sweetened with honey or fruit-juice or that have naturally occurring sugars into the house, but nothing sweetened with any of those extras: -extrins or -oses (maltose, sucrose, dextrose, fructose, glucose, sucralose, maltodextrin, etc - basically all the fake added stuff). Once you start reading labels you see it's absolutely everywhere and in literally almost everything! I have a couple of items that I overlooked, but the amounts are small enough not to even register on the nutrition guide, so I'm okay with that. My roomie is fully on board with this, which is excellent, as she eats extremely well anyway and her version of 'sweet tooth' is very different than mine. I decided to start very, very small and work my way up from there. If it goes well, I'll reassess when I get back from Ontario in August and see what else can go. We've also decided that wheat needs to go, so I will be using up a few things before switching to rice pasta, rye breads, etc.Wednesday I had my first ever acupuncture session! I wasn't certain what to expect, but it went well for the most part. My back and shoulders are so tight on one side that the doctor said it was like pushing on a brick wall! There was no flexibility or give, at least compared the other side. That explains why my back hurts and my shoulders \"seize\" sometimes. The needles went in without a hitch (except for one...OW!) and 20 minutes later they were removed. I went to work afterwards, but that turned out to be a mistake! Not having done this before I had no idea what to expect and I had to go home and lie down for a couple of hours instead. I was a little dopey (light-headed isn't quite the right description), a bit nauseous and quite irritable, which is not what I need at work where people ALREADY irritate me. :P I have another appointment tomorrow and as I am not working, I can come home and rest afterwards if I need to. I'm definitely feeling better, though, so that's the main thing.I'm hoping that this will also help me to sleep better. I sleep through the night maybe once every two weeks. I don't have trouble falling asleep, but I can't stay asleep. Sometimes it's only a brief disruption, but there are times where I wake at 2 or 3 a.m. and simply can't fall back to sleep for hours, then when I do it's very heavy and not at all restful. It's very frustrating.I read a book called \"Midlife Runaway\" by Linda Cronin, which has inspired me to plan vigourously over the next 5 years to allow myself to take a year off to travel in my 50th year. This includes finishing school; getting a new job; signing up for deferred leave; paying off debt and saving up a good EFund; plotting where I want to go, etc. It was a book I had seen before, but \"timing is everything\" and this was obviously the right time to read it and start dreaming. There are different things to take into consideration when you travel at midlife - comfort being one, and being realistic about the fact that you can't do at 50 all that you could at 25. Excellent tips and a good, overall read. I might take it out again and re-read it, just to keep the dream alive, the tips in mind and the process on paper.I'm also reviewing my 101 in 1001 list and am trying to figure out what needs to change. I've accomplished some items - it reads a bit like a household 'to do' list in some respects - and realize I need to challenge myself more. Some things are easily accomplished, some not and some are just unrealistic (at this point, at least), so I need to weed and make sure they're not only achievable, realistic and doable, but FUN!I have 57 \"regular\" days until school starts (I'm a day off on my widget)!! While that sounds great, what sounds even better is the number of work days I have left: 21! WAAHHOOOO!!!!I've just finished the latest \"No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\" book: \"The Limpopo Academy of Private Detection.\" I finished it in less than 3 days and it was as wonderful as all the rest. They were certainly busy in this one! These books always make me happy.Joey's foot has healed nicely and his fur is growing back. It's coming back in lovely and soft. Dinah's adjusted insulin seems to be working well, as does the fact that I've changed the flavour of her food. I've been adding some regular food into her diabetic stuff to encourage her to eat more, but up to this point it wasn't working very well. The new flavour seems to be doing the trick, so hopefully this will help, as she was looking very thin.The RCMP phoned and left a message for me last week and I had all weekend to wonder why! It turns out someone in Â Nova Scotia stole my phone number to sell a car online. I have no clue how exactly that works (that's probably a good thing), but trust me, to say I was surprised was an understatement. I'm glad it was all resolved with just a few questions.Spending hasn't been TOO bad: I had one big car repair expense and, as usual, a lot of food, but the past few days I haven't actually spent anything at all because I've been planning my meals (amazing)! I'm pleased. I also scratched off another item on my 'to do' list: I finally bought tenant insurance: $270 for the year for $40K coverage which, when my inventory was added up, is actually about $10K more than I need, but no big deal.I also got the last textbook I needed for my course - FREE! I was going through the donation bin at work and saw a title for a course I'll be taking in the fall. Underneath that was a second book - the only one I haven't purchased yet!! We don't accept textbooks, so I just said a big old 'Thank You!!' to the universe and took it home with me instead. I'm definitely on the right track with this, considering how well it's all come together. That saved me $120!!It's a puttering day today. I'm feeling a bit restless, but need to get some things done around the house (a good vacuum being one). I'd like to spend some time reading on the sofa, too, if I can, as well as starting to think about my trip to Ontario at the end of the month. So far we've got a balloon trip planned (!!!), some bikes rented, there's both a canoe and kayak at the cottage and I've got my hotels booked. My last day will be spent at a shopping mall. Not a thrill or destination for most, but trust me, a Big Deal when the closest mall is a 21-hour drive. I'm tired of buying clothes that everyone else (here) has and by that time, I hope there will be some sales and I can score some decent duds at decent prices. It's a once-a-year splurge (if that), so there's no guilt.Hope you all have a great weekend - what's left of it at least!"},
{"title": "Saturday update", "date": "Saturday 16 June 2012", "text": "I've updated my sidebars to reflect mostly positive changes this week!EFund: CHECK!!Â I've hit the $1K goal for this already! I was able to add a little extra to get me to the goal a bit sooner, but now that I'm there I'm going to see how much more I can sock away before school starts.RRSPs: No change (yet!). I'm going to leave them as they are through September, as I get two full paycheques then - my last ones this year - and I'd like to put away as much as I can before any changes take effect.VISA: PIF June 13 - $0 balance!M/C: PIF & cut up (card interest was 21.99% + $6 p/mo). I think I'll get my deposit back for this which, if I remember correctly, is $150.(new) M/C: $100 balance, but will be PIF the first paycheque in July. (card interest is 5%)LOC: $1300 (loan interest 6.5%)Total debt: $1400Car: need to make an appointment to get the ball bearing replaced (approx $300). I also need to remember I have to pay the 2nd half of the insurance at the end of July, too, and need $400 for that.Tenant insurance: HAVE to do this Monday a.m. My landlady keeps asking.School: Up a little to $2120. I'm going to see if I can get this to $2500 by the time school starts.I have a roommate for two months which is so far going well. She's very nice, very quiet and we get along well, so I'm not hating it. I'm still adjusting, but it's not as bad as I thought it might be. It does help that she's a PhD student, so is busy and focussed on her work. I said right up front that if there's ever a time where I seem quiet or tetchy or grumpy it's not her, it's me. I'm just not used to sharing my space and I withdraw if I feel crowded or overly social. She totally gets it, but it's always good to say it rather than have people feeling uncomfortable or unwanted. It's a small space, so communication is important.I had an extra shift yesterday, which is great. I don't usually work on Fridays and for some reason it felt like Saturday to me (although I don't work Saturdays, either). I had an early lunch so it made for a really long day, plus I had a thumping headache all day, too, which didn't help. I'm going in for part of the afternoon tomorrow, too, and will ensure that extra pay goes towards debt and savings when it shows up.I've been riding my bike to work all week which has been great. I've enjoyed it and yesterday took the \"long\" way to work around the river trail, adding an extra 2.5km to the ride. It was sunny and quite warm, although a bit breezy, but it was a great way to start the day. I'm not even complaining that I have to ride home in the wind anymore, so I'm obviously getting used to it.I have a dinner with friends tomorrow and lunch on Monday with another, so I'm looking forward to that. It's just a quiet day today, laundry perhaps, dishes, puttering..."},
{"title": "Sunday night chit chat", "date": "Monday 11 June 2012", "text": "I love this tree in Beacon Hill Park in Victoria. Such a wonderful, twisting trunk!What are youâ¦Â  Reading?Â  âSleight ofPawâ by Sofie Kelly. Itâs a cosy mystery featuring a small town librarian withtwo magical cats â one can walk through walls and one can turn invisible. Thisis the second in the series and itâs quite enjoyable. I have to take back a bunchof books to the library and drop some more off at the second-hand bookstore. Ineed another serious weed of my bookshelves, but am not quite ready for thatyet, as I did one only a month or so ago.Watching?Â  Whatevershows up on either OWN, HGTV, DIY or Biography. Usually a mixture of the four.Listening to?Â  Nothingexcept the birds singingâ¦ ïCooking/Baking?Â  Notsure what to have for dinner tonight, but possibly pasta or leftovers.Happy you accomplished this week? Got the apartment tidiedup today to welcome my new roommate. Itâs amazing what can be accomplished in acouple of hours: Iâve rearranged the fridge a bit, got rid of a bunch of frozenstuff that is definitely outdated and needed tossing; cleaned the bathroom;cleaned some plastics that have been destined for the recycling for MONTHS now;I got a double bed from a friend yesterday for the secondbedroom. Thereâs not a lot of room for anything else now, but I know she wantsa desk to work on, so perhaps she can do that once sheâs settled in a bit.Likely will need to take measurements, as itâs pretty cosy right now.Looking forward to next week? Iâve got some extra hours atwork lined up as well as a special order of Lemon Lavender cupcakes from awoman who used to have a cupcake shop here. She left , but had to come back, sois back to doing baking part-time. Thank goodness!!Thankfulfor today?Â  Glorious weather today âsupposed to reach about 19C! At last!! Having enough food to last me a fewdays, as it appears that the washouts â 5 or 6 of them â in the Territory aregoing to cause a lot more trouble before theyâre repaired. Already the grocerystores are low or out of milk, bread, probably various meat. I stocked up alittle on Friday, so Iâm going to be fine for a few days, but I think thetourists arriving over the next few days are going to be in for a BIG shock.Apparently there are about 9 trucks stuck in Watson Lake, which is 5 hours westof us, and I have a feeling thereâs going to be a lot of spoiled food by thetime they actually make it here.Apparently there are flights bringing in some food, but I think the tourists are going to find it hardest over the next few days. There are some panicky locals out there stocking up on whatever they can find...it's not QUITE Armageddon out there, folks..."},

I took myself out for some errands this morning, being fairly strict with how much time I spent out and about the place as I didn't want to come in contact with too many people, nor did I actually feel all that energetic.Groceries (there's that darn FOOD again!):- brown basmati rice: $8.99- 4L 2% milk: $5.97 <-- up $1!- organic black & mahogany rice: $4.39- PC extra old cheddar block: $5.98 <-- good deal! :)- Rye bread: $6.99- Ground turkey: $5.48. There were large holes in the meat section, as there was a washout on the highway and the trucks couldn't get through, apparently. No idea how long that takes to sort out.- 4 Bananas: $1.97 (1.015 kg @ $1.94/kg)- Caesar salad: $2.90- lg container field greens: $5.48Total: $48.30Shoppers Drug Mart:- 2 boxes tea: $5.98 ($2.99 ea, 100 bags per box)- Ben & Jerry's Red Velvet Cake ice cream: $10.00 (2/$10)Total: $16.48Cat food (for the two boys):- 3 tins @$2.25 ea: $6.75- 16lb bag dry: $48.90Total: $58.43Cat litter:- 4 boxes (15kg ea): $23.96 - $5.99 ea, regularly $7.99 ea, so a good buy!

They do go on sale for $1.99 occasionally, however, so I didn't have to get them today.- Caesar salad- Earth Balance. I could easily have bought butter instead, but I'm trying to move away from dairy where possible. And I know this is nice stuff because a friend of mine uses it. Next up, milk. If it continues to be so expensive, I'm going to have to start rationing and cutting back.Otherwise, I'm pleased with the purchases.

{"title": "Thursday thoughts", "date": "Thursday 7 June 2012", "text": "I'm home sick today, as I was yesterday. It's not morphed into anything serious, but is enough to make me feel tired and miserable - stuffy head, sore throat, itchy ears, that sort of thing. I managed to miss the other nasties that were floating around town for a few months, so I'm pleased about that. This is just a normal cold and will hopefully be gone in a couple more days.Yesterday I received notification that my application for a training allowance was approved. That was fast! I dropped off the form on June 1st - with the lady who would be reviewing it - and the approval letter was drafted up on the 4th, the very day I registered for school. I imagine it was so quick because I was one of the first people to apply for it. It will give me $100 p/wk for groceries and I pick up a cheque bi-weekly at the college bookstore.Fantastic! :)I'm hoping that I'll be able to budget well enough to use part of that allowance for gas as well.I also received notification that I've been conditionally approved for a student LOC of $5600. I'd have to send verification of employment and income to release the funds, but I've decided not to do this as I've already got the money I need thanks to the increase in my regular LOC.My VISA has a ZERO balance!!!!! I used my LOC to pay this off, then transferred the funds from my school account to pay the LOC back.I'm sure Gail would have a fit about the money shuffling going on here, but my LOC now stands at $1500, as I put another $2k (from school account) onto it to pay it down. The school account is down to $2,070 - winter term tuition and an extra $400 for anything I may have overlooked to this point. I'm pretty much set for general school supplies, but do need a few more things that I can easily purchase over the summer.I have 1.5 days extra work in June, plus a stat holiday to account for, so that will help boost my savings and pay down my LOC.I can't forget that while I am currently getting out of consumer debt, I am still, technically, in debt. The RRSP needs to be paid back once I start working again, as will any money from the LOC that I use while I'm at school. The training allowance will help defray some costs, and I am planning on getting p/t work as well. There is also the possibility of getting a roommate to Â help with the costs of living (I'd prefer an ESL student in this scenario).Spending wise the past week or so has been good and bad. My biggest expense, of course, was my school registration. I put it on my MC and just transferred the full amount from my school account to cover it. Also: Note how much I spend on FOOD*:Tuesday, May 29*Groceries: $30.32Wed, May 30Tire change: $157.50*Groceries: $6.31Thursday, May 31NO SPEND! :)Friday, June 1*Groceries: $26.19- cucumber: $2.29Â - chocolate bar: $1.59- red pepper: $2.77 (.315 kg @ $8.80/kg) - that's ONE (1) pepper, folks.- green pepper: $1.41 (.230 kg @ $6.15/kg)- milk: $3.99 (2L)- bread: $4.79- carrot: $1.69 (small bag baby carrots)- springmix salad: $3.79 (sm container)- spinach: $3.79 (sm container)Sat June 2Gas: $75.00 (55.188L @ $1.359/L). Currently I can generally get a month's worth of driving out of this amount of gas, but I'm aware that will change once I start school, but hopefully not too drastically. I'm going to focus on riding my bike when/where I can until September.Sunday, June 3NO SPEND! :)Monday, June 4School registration: $1,750 (fall term)*Tim Horton's: $3.85 (tea, maple cinnamon bagel)Tuesday, June 5*Groceries: $28.17Wednesday, June 6Â *Groceries: $34.49 (even while I'm sick!)- cat litter: $14.99 (7kg container - outrageous. I went to the local grocery store, and this is the result. I generally buy a 15kg box for $7.99 elsewhere. But I needed it, so...)- strawberries: $3.79 (1kg)- Realemon juice, lg container: $4.08- honey, 1kg: $10.88You'd think I'm always eating, or actually eat all of this stuff. Unfortunately, neither is true, so I have to start paying some serious attention here, as this is really where the majority of my money goes (and to Tim's, but I do - usually - budget for that). I simply can't afford to shop like this for the next year, or throw out the amount of food that I do. I really don't think about it - consciously at least - so have to start tracking this stuff and really sticking to my lists when I shop.I get my new bed (double, for second bedroom) on Saturday and my new roomie on Sunday. Prior to that I'll be making sure the place is tidy and clean for her.Have a great weekend everyone!"},

She's a friend of a friend and is having some bad luck right now, so this will help her out until she can move into her new place (Aug 1). It's not all together altruistic, as she'll be paying half the costs ($450), which helps me enormously too, but it's also a good test to see if this is something I could do while I'm at school (thinking ESL student).I'm getting a double bed from a friend and her bf for $50. This is what prompted me saying I could probably take a roommate, so perhaps it's all just meant to be! :)I used my LOC to pay off my VISA, so it's currently at $0!! I then transferred $3500k from my school account (the excess after tuition) to pay off the LOC, but I'm having second thoughts about that now. Perhaps just MOST of it, and leave an extra $1k in the school account. Or use the extra $1k to plump up needed savings (vet, car, EFund). Argh!This is why I have trouble making decisions...there are so many options! :PI like to think I'm no longer in debt, but I still have to pay back my RRSP loan, plus anything that gets used from the LOC over the next year. But I've managed to clear the higher interest stuff at least (CC's). Phew! Now to keep it that way.I register for school in about 45 mins!!!!It's raining and cool here today.

{"title": "May is over already!", "date": "Friday 1 June 2012", "text": "Where does the time go?!I've actually managed to complete several things from my lengthy work-in-progress to do list that I posted several weeks ago.Car:Change tires over: CHECK! $157.50. Apparently this has gone up $50, so I'm going to have to look for somewhere cheaper to do this in the fall. Most likely this will be Wally World. I also have a $300 estimate for replace a ball bearing in the right front wheel, which is causing the wheel to \"shudder\" and is a safety concern. This will have to be done before the winter change over. *Le sigh*Oil change: CHECK! $75.06 Again, a little more expensive than anticipated, but only by about $10.Tenant Insurance:Still need to do this!Bank:RRSP #1: Still on auto-deposit. I'll change this at the end of August.RRSP #2: Need to phone and inquire about this.EFund: I've moved around a little bit of money to bump this up a bit (shaved $$ off the gift fund, and put it into my EFund instead. People won't expect big gifts - or possibly any - as long as I can say I'm a poor student). Will have my $1K well before the end of summer.School:Financial aid: Dropped off my form for training allowance today.Payment/registration: MONDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've decided I will use my new M/C (no-fee, 5.99%) to pay for this and then just transfer the funds from my ING savings. This will also save me $6 or more for a bank draft fee.I called the bank today to check up on my Student LOC and it turns out they don't fund certificate programs! I wasn't aware of that, so instead I'm looking into upping the limit on my regular LOC. I've spoken with a couple of people and so far it looks like there aren't any problems - I make enough, my credit is good enough, my account activity is good - so I'm hoping I'll be approved. The rate is 6.99%, which is still reasonable. So I guess that's a CHECK.*Update: it's all a go, so it's a definite check. The best thing for me to do at this point is to pay off my VISA card, then transfer the excess from my ING account to pay most of this off. As this is my \"wage\" through school - for the most part - I will be paying interest only, which is easier to work with than larger sums of money.Bills:Cell phone: CHECK! I've cancelled this and just made the final payment. Will save me $30 p/mo.Internet/landline: Still need to call and chat, but I can do this a little later in the summer.Groceries: I'm watching carefully where I spend my money. My friend who was here last week is excellent at shaving $$ off her budget (she spends $30 a WEEK on food for herself...I'm pretty confident I can't do that up here, but I definitely have a lot of room for improvement) and she helped me by giving me some ideas and tips to try.Heat: This is still too high for my liking (last bill was $90) and although I'm in a decent credit situation, I'd still like to work to keep the cost lower.Gift Fund:Reduced this to $300. Put $125 into my EFund. The other $75 will go towards groceries this week.LOC:Down to just over $3500. Payments are now $66 bi-weekly, which will help lower the interest over the summer. I'm considering using this to pay off my VISA card, then concentrating on just the one debt over the summer. The interest rate is less than half of the CC, so it would make sense to do it that way.Job:I'm going to talk to my boss at my p/t job and see if there's any way I can stay on during my schooling. My hours at school are 8:30 - 3 every day, so there's lots of time for p/t work outside of that, depending on what's going on. They're only open until 5pm every day, so I might have to pick up something else, but we'll see.Will:Still have the cash sitting in my account and still need to finish off the paperwork...Other:I've stocked up on soap (currently have 18 bars); toothpaste (great deal at the grocery store of all places: $1.37 for the 130ml tubes, so I picked up 6. I now have 9 tubes of toothpaste!); and laundry detergent (I got a new bottle for $15 - 210 loads according to the label). The old one is still not finished and it's going on two years. That works out to about 0.72 cents a MONTH for detergent, which is pretty fantastic (if I assume 18 months. I got the original bottle on sale for $12.99).I've got a list of a few items still to stock up on, but there's no rush and I'm keeping my eyes peeled on the flyers that show up at the house. Nothing pressing just yet.I'm feeling pretty good with my progress despite the news that I don't qualify for a Student LOC. I had a moment of panic, but Plan B was to (hopefully!) raise the limit on my regular LOC, so I'm good.Having my friend here was terrific. It was wonderful to see her and she had a great time. We managed to squeeze in quite a bit: the Wildlife Preserve, The Stairs (225 steep stairs up the cliff face to a path that runs around the airport), eagle spotting, a couple of walks and lots of relaxing. She also helped me get rid of a few things that I've been keeping around for far too long. They were all donated to the free store at the recycling centre: a set of plastic bowls, a big mug and saucer set, a couple of frying pans, a spice rack, two votive candle holders, an iron and several other items. It was a good drop off! The rest of the things I still have hanging around I'm going to try and sell. I'd like to make some cash from my DVDs in particular.It was also a very spendy two weeks. I'm not sure of the exact numbers yet, but I'll figure it out and post it on the weekend. Part of it had to do with the fact that I set my kettle on fire (!) and had to replace it, a stove element and the metal thingy that goes under the element on the stove. *Sigh*"},
{"title": "T minus 8 hours...", "date": "Friday 18 May 2012", "text": "...until my friend arrives! I've been awake since 6am - haven't been sleeping well the past week or so, but not quite sure why. It could be the 20 hours of daylight we currently have, although I've done what I can to minimize that. It's no trouble falling asleep, it's staying asleep that I'm having difficulties with. Waking up at 2:30 or 3:30 or 4:30. It's just frustrating because it means I'm yawning and ready for bed by late afternoon!I took Dinah to the vet this morning for an insulin curve. She's diabetic and her blood sugar levels need testing occasionally, like a human's would, to make sure the glucose levels are where they should be. She's been lethargic the past several days, hasn't been eating properly - and has been eating the boys' food instead of her own - and just hasn't been herself. They'll test her blood sugar every hour and let me know if she needs an insulin adjustment. Right now her shot is one unit, twice a day. I'm sure she'll be fine, but I just want to make sure.Apart from that, I'm feeling a bit restless and anxious and have been puttering around the place half-heartedly doing...things. I'm just SO EXCITED about my friend arriving tonight, I can't really focus and concentrate!! I used my new steam mop to clean the floors, did the dishes, and vacuumed the second bedroom. I've done one load of laundry and when Bylaw decides he's had enough snoozing under the duvet, I'm going to do a second load. I've got to clean out the fridge of perishables and put them in the compost and I've been collecting bits & pieces of recycling and trying to organize it. Tomorrow I've got loose plans to take her to visit the SS Klondike Â on its opening dayÂ and then run a couple of errands, including groceries. I know! I sure know how to show my visitors a good time...This week's spending looks like this:Monday, May 14Cat food (x 6 tins): $22.05Canadian Tire: cat litter (4x15 kg @ 7.99 ea) & Shark steam mop, on sale $99.99: $138.55Dropped my recycling off as well.Tues, May 15Groceries: $17.82- sourdough: $3.49- poppy seeds (for baking): $4.88- lemon yogurt: $6.79- bananas (.870kg @ $3.06 kg): $2.66Wed, May 16Gas: $80.55Groceries: $17.56- 2 x box mac & cheese: $3.49 ea- 2 x bags frozen potato wedges: $4.49 eaTim Horton's (tea & bagel): $3.85Thurs, May 17Oil change: $75.06 (advised to go by the kms (5k) rather than the date, as the oil was still very, very clean). I can now check this off my 'to do' list!Groceries: $6.65- milk: 2L $3.99- oat bran: $2.66 (for baking)I spend altogether far too much money on food and I waste far too much to justify spending so much on it. This is something I have to start paying serious attention to, as I want to try to keep my grocery spending to $60 p/wk once I start school, and use the extra $40 for gas (from my $100 weekly training allowance).I'm looking at my sidebars and my remaining debt ($4600) and my wheels are whirring. Jane posted last week about emptying her savings accounts to pay off her debt and while, at this point at least, I'm not entirely comfortable with doing that, I AM thinking of an option that will considerably lower my debt while plumping up a couple of savings accounts at the same time. I'm less than $200 from my EFund goal of $1k and I'd like to cut the $30 auto-deposit sooner rather than later, so will make some adjustments that will make me happier.We're supposed to finally get double digits as of Sunday, so welcome spring! At last! Have a great long weekend everyone!"},

Â Join us!What are youâ¦Reading?Â  âOld Hauntsâ byE. J. Cooperman. The third in a series about a haunted guest house on the NewJersey shore. I read the âHunger Gamesâ last Sunday afternoon, which was reallyenjoyable â both the afternoon spent reading and the book itself! JWatching? Â Itâs gettinginto re-run season, but thereâs generally something I can find to watch. Istarted watching âMy Ghost Storyâ on the Biography network last night, but hadto turn it off because it got too spooky! I love that stuff, but I have mylimits.Listening to?Â Nothing much. The furnace (still!) switching on and off. I've had my windows open for a couple of days and slept like a log last night because of the fresh air. :)Cooking/Baking?Â  Notreally anything, although I was looking through cookbooks the other day to seewhat I could bake as snacks for work. I found a good, low fat lemon poppyseedloaf recipe I used to make often, but still need a couple of things for it.Happy you accomplished this week? Pet care for Joey. Heâs doingwell so far and barring any complications, his sutures should be dissolved in afew more days. I have lovely soaps on the way and I got some extra hours atwork, along with a few hours at my p/t job.Looking forward to next week? My friend arrives Fridayevening!!! Will also get tires changed on the car and an oil/fluid change, pluswork on crossing off items from my âto doâ list.Thankful for today? Â Plentyof cups of tea, working on my finances and organization for school, my cats, myawesome home, friends, family and MOMS!!**********************************Today I made a couple of inroads on my lengthy âto doâ listI posted yesterday. Iâve adjusted my sidebars to reflect more reasonable goalsin most of my accounts. I maxed out my gift fund using some of the money I got frommy RRSP and cancelled the $16 bi-weekly auto-payment. I then readjusted my LOC $50 bi-weekly auto-payment to $66 bi-weekly ($50 + $16 = $66), so that I wouldbe able to knock a little more off by the time fall rolls around. The finalauto-payment at that amount will be September 5, my last full paycheque fromwork. Iâll adjust the payment amount after that, but need to stay focussed andbring it down as much as I can before that, so the monthly payments will be aslow as possible.I also cancelled my cellphone. The contract was actually up in March,so Iâve been paying on a month to month basis since then, but as I saidyesterday, I so rarely use it, even for texting, itâs not worth it for me. It takes 30 days for the change to take effect, but will save me $30 amonth in the long run, so Iâm pleased. I can always call and reactivate it when(if!) I feel the need to. My final bill will be May 24 and I will get a bill inJune that should read $0 and reflect the cancellation.I realize Iâve got all summer to focus on this stuff, butthe sooner I get things crossed off, the better. The summer will be gone beforeI know it and if I have unfinished items hanging around, Iâm liable to panicand thatâs what Iâm trying to avoid."},
{"title": "Saturday update", "date": "Saturday 12 May 2012", "text": "Overcast, cool and breezy here today - it's been a cool spring so far, but I'm hopeful that the temperatures will creep up and the sun will soon be out more often. My friend arrives for her visit on Friday and the last thing I want is for it to be raining the whole time she's here. But I can't control the weather (yet!), and the time I spend with her is more important than what we do anyway, although I'd like to take a day trip somewhere and at least get out for a couple of walks around the neighbourhood, if not further afield.I'm feeling very good about where my debt-load currently stands (although I've just made a $100 donation) and am confident that I will be able to bring it down even further before school starts in September. This month is a three-paycheque month, which will help now. I'm currently making a list of things I need to do - some of which will cost me money and some of which won't - over the next few months, but hopefully not more than I anticipate.Need to's:Car:Change tires to summer ones: $100Oil change: $65 (approx.)Car account: only $10 in it right now, but will need to boost that substantially before September. I'll Â need a winter oil change, plus another 2 tire changes and, of course, a lot of gas to get to school. I'm hoping there will be several people from my neighbourhood in the class and that we can perhaps car-pool, saving us each some gas, wear and tear and driving. I will forgo another oil change, however, until I'm finished classes next spring. I'll have to monitor my own fluids and hope that no serious issues arise (but that's also why I want to get my Efund up, too).Tenant Insurance:1 year: $250? (I really have no idea what it'll cost for a year - depends what I want for coverage I imagine). I'll be looking into this on Monday. My landlady wants a copy of it, so I have to get it done.Bank:RRSP: $100 auto-pymt every month. I have to halve this amount ($50 is the min to keep it open)RRSP #2: $60 auto-pymt every month. I'm not sure what the minimum is on this, or if I have to have one. All it will take is a phone call and a short meeting to figure this out. If I can put a temporary hold on it, that would be ideal, but the next best thing would be to lower the monthly deposit to the absolute minimum.EFund: $30 auto-pymt every month. I want to get this to $1k+ before the end of summer and then cancel while I'm at school. I add over and above that amount each paycheque anyway, so I think I have a good chance of reaching my goal. I did add to it when I got my RRSP payout, too, so need less than $400 to achieve this.School:Financial aid: filled out a form for a training allowance - $100 p/wk for food - and will drop that off on Monday on the way to work, along with a copy of my official acceptance letter.Payment/registration: starts Monday, June 4. Need to call and find out if a bank draft will suffice as payment (would be hugely surprised if it doesn't, but you never know. Best to check).I've also sent off a form for a student line of credit ($10k) for the year. The rate is prime + 2% (5%?) for any monies borrowed. Paying down my debt through the summer will go a long way to needing a lot less of this.Bills:Internet: not many options, but will call the service provider and discuss options for lowering the cost of my monthly bills (currently $125-ish a month) while I'm at school.Heat: increase monthly payments through September, to keep credit balance high, which will help keep costs lower during the winterGroceries: this cost will be covered by the financial aid above. I will likely have a more regular schedule so can cook/bake more often and won't need to buy food at the college. I'd like to keep this as low as I can, so I can direct some of that cash towards other things.Cell phone: currently $30 p/mo. I use it so rarely it's just not worth it. I'll look into cancelling it, but I'm pretty sure the contract is up this month anyway.Cats:Cat/vet account: ensure there is a cushion in here to cover food, litter, vet visits. This will be the area where there could be the most unexpected expenses. Best to cushion it as best I can now. $1k should suffice.Gift fund:Monthly auto-deposits: $32. This will also have to go on hold while I'm at school, but again, will continue while I'm working.LOC:Payments: $50 bi-weekly. Continue this through summer, then drop it to the absolute minimum I can. By that time, the interest payments will be lower and I can probably get away with about $30-$40 p/month.Job:Part-time: I'm hoping my current p/t job will continue through the rest of the year. The wage is good, I enjoy it and even if I only do a couple of days a month, that will help to keep costs down while I'm off. If not, then there are possibilities at the college itself (library, bookstore, etc).Will:I have the money already set aside for this - for almost 2 years! - and need to just sit down, focus and get the forms complete. I need to get out of the way.Other:Stocking up (reasonably) on little things like laundry detergent, dish soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc while I'm still working. This will save some $$ over the year. I'm currently nearing the end of some laundry detergent that I bought nearly two years ago, so it's time I picked up a new jug anyway.So that's my list so far. It will fluctuate as I find add and remove things, but I'd like to check off a number of them before the end of August, so that I have a little breathing space before classes begin.I do have to remember that I added an \"overage\" to my school account (approx $3000) as a cushion for any supplies I will need, any unexpected costs or even to continue my education afterwards. This money could also go towards cost of living if it gets really tight, so I don't have to set my panic meter ready to go just yet. I don't want to touch it, but it is there if I run into troubles.My weekly spending isn't too bad, considering the vet visit for Joey.Monday, May 14No spend! :)Tuesday, May 15Tim's (tea & bagel): $3.85 <-- also something I need to knock off this summer.Vet: $523.85Wednesday, May 16Soap: $97.40 (my friend will bring this with her; I've sent the cash for payment)Thursday, May 17Shoppers: $28.57- milk: $4.59- magazine: $3.99 (yes, splurge)- rubber gloves (2 pair): $3.89- clearasil: $6.99- toothpaste (2 x 130ml): $2.29 ea- frozen entrees (2 x $1.99): $3.98Groceries: $19.36- cheese (x 2): $14.38 ($7.19 ea - cheese is so outrageously expensive, but so GOOOOOOOD!)- salad: $3.30- apples (x 2): $1.46Friday, May 18Shoppers: $14.69- ice cream (Ben & Jerry's \"Red Velvet Cake\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!): $10.00, sale price 2 for $10- magazine: $3.99 (for a friend)Groceries: $26.63- sausages: $3.44- sausages: $4.03- Krema Lemon yogurt (greek, no gelatin, 500ml): $6.79- broccoli florets (frozen, organic): $4.59- supersweet corn (frozen, organic): $3.99- sourdough bread: $3.49It seems kind of outrageous to spend so Â much on frozen veggies, but they're equal to the cost of fresh up here (and sometimes in much better shape!). A variety will last me much longer, too, as I won't eat them all at once, or I can use them in a tuna casserole or something.Today is a putter day, although I haven't done much so far. I'm looking into the value of a steam mop (Cdn Tire has one on sale for $99.99), and am organizing laundry, cleaning the bathroom, dusting and what to do with all the things on my dining room table that need to be cleared out..."},
{"title": "Only Wednesday?", "date": "Wednesday 9 May 2012", "text": "It feels like it should be later in the week for some reason. It started off awkwardly enough when I got asked for coffee by a patron on Monday. I was handed a paper with the question and simply handed it back without responding after reading it. It felt that weird. And weirder that I've had a feeling for a while that it would happen.Anyhoo...I made some decisions and took some action today about my debt and my cash. I have a little less to work with as I had a rather unexpectedly expensive vet visit yesterday ($523.85), but there we are. Joey had surgery on his paw to remove \"something\" from it that was causing the problem. The infection had cleared up for the most part, but the vet didn't quite know what it was that she removed, although she got all of it out. It's going to a lab Outside for testing. I'm curious to know and want to ensure it's not something serious. Poor Joey! Now I have to give him medication every 8 hours for a couple of days, but it's liquid, which is much easier to dose him with. He's doing pretty well for the most part and slept well last night after his traumatic day yesterday.My debt looked like this:M/C: $255Visa: $2504.19LOC: $4000And now looks like this (or will, once the payments clear):M/C: $0Visa: $1000LOC: $3750I'm hoping to completely pay off the Visa by the time school starts and knock another $500 from the LOC. I'm going to adjust some auto-payments (RRSP, EFund, LOC) starting in September, so that I'm not leaking cash unnecessarily. I can easily put these things on hold, and even saving $80 a month will go a long way towards paying my rent and bills while I'm studying. In the meantime, I'm aiming for $1k in my EFund, and will look into switching over my Internet to cable (get more GB for the same price I'm paying now) or changing to a lighter/less expensive package temporarily.I also have several things I need to do in the next couple of weeks. I need to change my winter tires over ($100) and get an oil change ($65), as well as pay a friend for some lovely stained glass she made for me last year ($150). She's been very good about this, but I'd like to get it paid and not worry about it anymore - I'm forgetting about it more often than I like as it is!I splurged on some soap today and called Victoria to buy it. My friend will bring it up for me when she comes next week, so I'm saving on shipping, got 10% off my purchase because I bought so much, and actually got a new \"flavour\" to try - Vanilla Coconut! My cost for 17 bars of Salt Spring Island Soap is $97.40 (including tax). I adore this stuff, and it's so dry up here that having soaps that are made with coconut/palm/olive oils make a huge - and noticeable - difference for my skin.It's time I was off to work..."},
{"title": "Saturday Sidebars", "date": "Saturday 5 May 2012", "text": "Yes, another horse photo! That's Monaco being interested in my friend. She was lovely - she's not really a horse person, has never been around them, but accompanied me on my Oregon volunteer weekend from Vancouver. She really enjoyed herself, learned a lot and we had an awesome time travelling together. So much fun!I've updated my sidebars to reflect my current state of affairs and while I'm happy to see some of the numbers go up, it's a bit of a shock to see the big drop in others (namely, my RRSP). The fact that I'm using my retirement funds for school is a bit of a balm, but it's still scary, particularly because there's no guarantee that I'll find something better. But at least I'll have a job to return to when I'm finished, which is a very big deal in this economy.I'm still pondering the debt aspect of things.Â It would make sense to get rid of what I can, while I'm able to. My MC debt is actually less than HALF of what I posted yesterday (I set up an account online this morning, so I can monitor it), so that will definitely get paid off. A big THANK YOU to Reyna and Karen for their thoughts and input. Much appreciated! I will be spending this weekend thinking and considering, writing out pros and cons, as well as filling out financial aid forms, and searching - again - for bursaries, grants and loans. I'm also going to call my MC company and see about switching cards. I got this particular card probably 10 years ago, when I was drowning in terrible credit and debt, to try to recover my credit rating (it's a secured card). While I was online this morning, I took a little quiz and found several other cards that could work better for me: much lower interest, no fees plus a little reward action. I'm going to call them today to see if I can \"exchange\" my current card, which has outrageous interest PLUS a $6 per month fee. 21.99% to 9.99% or 5.99%? Yes, please! I have a great credit rating now, and because it costs nothing to ask, I might as well try.I went for a short bike ride this morning, just one loop of the riverside trail, but the wind made it more difficult. I was going to try for two, but figured I added at least another 1.5km to the ride by taking the long way round to get on the trail, so I headed home again. Tomorrow I'm going to head out earlier and then go to the gym afterwards. It should be quiet early in the morning.Dinner last night was a lot of fun. It was just me and four Germans, so we spent some time on YouTube afterwards and watched East German, Russian, Czech and German \"filler\" cartoons, short, two minute ones that filled the spaces in between commercials in the former Soviet bloc. It's all reminiscing for them, but all new to me. All I could share with them was the Friendly Giant! And Jerome! And Rusty! ;)Have a great weekend everyone!**Update: I called my MC company and got approved for a new card. I can't \"exchange,\" but I could apply for a new card (5.99% p/a, no annual fee, no rewards), then once I have it, I call and cancel the old card. I'm sure the credit rating will take a bit of a hit, but that's okay. Plus I'll save myself $72 a year in fees. Every little bit helps!I got my RRSP funds on Wednesday ($10K) and immediately transferred the entire amount to an account I can only access online. I then transferred $7K of that to my ING school account. It's about twice what I need for tuition, but I thought it would make a good cushion in case I need extra supplies, or want to pursue another stream when I've finished the program next May, which is a real possibility.This leaves $3K in my account. I really don't want to touch it, but am trying to decide whether I should just slap it onto my debt and take a big bite out of it. I'm hesitating simply because that's not the intended purpose of that money and to use it that way feels...wrong. It's \"free\" money in the sense that I'm not paying taxes on the withdrawal, and by paying down some debt with it, I'm saving on higher interest costs. Plus I have to pay it back anyway. Â Part of me says I'd be silly not to, but the more practical side says \"don't do it!\" Then there's the part of me that wants to buy a few nice things to pamper myself with: soaps, some new duds, a nice bar of chocolate...LOC = $4000.VISA = $2400MC = $700 (?)Total debt: $7100There's no rush one way or the other. I've made payments on my cards and LOC, and the money can sit while I think, but the longer I leave it, the more tempting it is, too.I got a paycheque from my second job today! Hurrah! Just shy of $300, which is great and more than I anticipated. I hope the fact they mailed it doesn't mean I won't be going back... :P This will be going into my chequing account so I can do some grocery shopping tomorrow. I also have to take Joey to the vet again. I took him on Wednesday morning as he had a sore toe and it was starting to look ugly. The vet said it was a puncture, between his toes, and she cleaned it out and wrapped it up. She wasn't confident that he wouldn't get it off, but he hasn't touched it. He shakes his foot a lot trying to get it off, but otherwise it's fine. I have to give him antibiotics to fight the infection (pills, for all you cat people out there...), so I have no idea what it will look like when it comes off on Saturday. Much better I hope! I imagine they'll clean the wound again and rewrap it. He looks like a real gimp with his shaved body and bandaged leg, but seems to be doing fine otherwise. A bit sulky, but that's pretty typical anyway.I had a busy day today and feel very productive! I rode over to the Ministry of Education this morning and picked up some forms for financial aid, then rode most of the way around the Millenium Trail. The total distance of that is 5km, and I probably did 3. After that I headed to the gym for 45 minutes, which was great! There were two other people besides me there, which is just how I like it. Mind you, it was 11:00 in the morning, so I shouldn't be surprised, but it is nice to have the space to move around and figure out what you're doing. Once I know my routines and the machines better, it won't be such a big deal, but as I'm just starting out, the fewer distractions the better. I went to visit with a friend for a couple of hours and I have a potluck tonight! YUM! I'm bringing apple pie and vanilla coconut ice cream. I'd like to claim the honours for the pie, but it's actually a frozen one I've had for some time (one of those M&M Meats promotions; buy this or that and get a free pie!). This is the perfect opportunity to use it up."},
{"title": "A horse lecture of sorts...and an update.", "date": "Saturday 28 April 2012", "text": "Photo just because horses are Awesome and still my most favouritist animal ever (despite having cats. Cats just live more comfortably in apartments)! This is Jamaica, another of the horses I saw when I was visiting southern Oregon last May. She's a draft-x and a very big girl. All the 185 horses at the Sanctuary have been rescued from neglect, abuse, abandonment, etc and now have a safe place to live for the rest of their days, doing nothing but grazing, playing, rolling in grass and being with their friends and families. The majority of the horses are ex-PMU mares and their final babies. PMU stands for Pregnant Mare Urine, which is used in the making of Premarin (PREgnant MARe urINe). Premarin is a hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescribed for women going through menopause.These beautiful animals are housed in barns, with no access to the outside and no room to turn around or lie down, for 6 - 8 months a year, every year. Year after year after year. There is a particular hormone in the mares' urine - but only while they are pregnant - that is collected for use in Premarin. So these animals stand in the dark, constantly pregnant, with urine collection bags strapped to them the entire time, unable to move until they have their foals. The foals only last a few months before they are separated from their mothers and sent to slaughter. Some of the fillies are kept to replace the older mares in the production line, and the older, used up horses are sent to slaughter as well.Â It's an ugly, inhumane business. Premarin has declined sharply in popularity over the past few years because of side effects on humans (it's HORSE PEE, of course, there's side effects) including a connection to breast cancer. Many people are unaware of this, and when I learned about it, I made the decision then and there that once I reach that point in my life, my doctor will not be prescribing anything but natural hormone replacement for me. I'm aware that sometimes it really is the only thing that works, but I believe people should at least know where it comes from, the possible side effects and what actually happens to these horses when their usefulness is considered at an end.The Belgian on the ground has the brand of her barn on her rump: it's her number and a $ sign. That's all she meant to the people who owned her.The photo posted on Sunday is also of Premarin foals, now all grown up. The Duchess Sanctuary is in a little town called Oakland, Oregon, about an hour south of Eugene. It's a beautiful 1120 acre property and all the horses are cared for by three devoted staff members. I was only there for a couple of days, but they were two of the best days I had last year. Wonderful.You can see how big these beauties are in this picture. The lady with the bucket was the Director of the Sanctuary at the time, and (l-r) Donegal, Shilo and Monaco are all fighting over the remains of some alfalfa, carrot and apple \"cake\" that was made for another horse's birthday that day. These four had all been separated temporarily from their herd due to the need for some medications or minor health issues. I think they were back with their herd within a week.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  ****************************************I had a great session at the gym yesterday evening with my trainer, and slept like a log last night! I told him that I wanted to meet up with him again in two weeks' time because I'm not doing the workouts in between our sessions. I'm not certain I was explaining myself or my reasoning very well until the point where I said I need the accountability and wanted him to set a couple of goals for me, so that in two weeks time we can actually see some improvement and proof that I've actually been going to the gym. I'm paying for it + the sessions with him and it's getting a bit pricey, although I like having a trainer to keep me going, show me proper form and keep pushing me to do just a little more.My week's spending looks like this:Mon, April 23: $3.85 Tim Horton's (tea & bagel)Tues, April 24: $5.22 Tim Horton's (tea & breakfast sandwich)Wed, April 25: Groceries (milk & eggs) $12.27; I also returned an item to Amazon, which cost $22.80, but the refund will be $65.99.Thurs, April 26: $25.15 (toilet paper - I know, who the heck spends $20 on TP? I bought a pkg of 24 double rolls, which I'm hoping will last me a long, long time) and two bags of PC chocolate peanut butter cups (1 for work, 1 for home...). Trust me. I'm worth it! ;)Fri, April 27: No spend! I spend the afternoon with a friend, and then had my training in the early evening. It was a lovely day, actually, as the afternoon was also spent with three dogs...dogs are awesome. That's all I can say.On Thursday, I also dropped off another bag of books at the second hand store. I managed to weed my bookcases yet again and was surprised that it seemed easier this time around. I'm certain there are more I could donate, but will leave it for the time being. While I was there, I asked what my current credit was: $164!! Wow. And that's before they added in the new bunch. Amazing!Next week I have to organize my grant information for school and send off the request for a student line of credit. School registration begins on June 4th and I want to have everything in place before that, so I can head up there at 8:30 that morning and pay. Is it normal to not have a waiting list these days? I got my formal acceptance which said 'welcome to the program,' but the caveat is that there are only 20 spots available and that it's a first come, first served registration. I thought they would have had 20 reserved places, then set up a waiting list for numbers 21 on for any reserved spots that didn't get taken by a certain date.There's also only 20 days left until my friend gets here for a week's visit... :)"},

Otherwise, itâs quite quiet around here. Just the wayI like it!Cooking/Baking?Â  Planningon butter chicken (with turkey) for dinner. One of my favourites! It means, along with last night's pasta, that I'll have lunches for about two or three days as well.Happy you accomplished this week? Met a friend for coffee onWednesday evening. We took it to go and sat by the river for an hour. Lots ofactivity and even some early kayakers! Thereâs still snow & ice on theriver, so theyâre keen. Looking forward to next week? Finishing up my English course: final exam is Tuesday! Getting to the gym more regularly (now that I know I can use my trainer's notes as guidelines for starting routines), riding my newly tuned-up bike to work.Thankful for today? Â A10km bike ride before 9am this morning. An amazing accomplishment considering it's been two years since I was last on it. I wasn't huffing and puffing either (thanks, I'm sure, to riding the 10 on a relatively flat surface), but was warm and a bit sweaty when I finished. Just what I wanted. A beautiful sunny day. Getting somelight housework done and a little decluttering of the bookshelves - again!Before I went out this morning on my ride, I checked my window well. Yesterday there was a little vole trying to get out, but every time I went to try to catch him he, of course, disappeared into his nest under the window - this is apparently where he'd spent the winter. This morning I saw several new holes partially dug and saw the little guy lying dead in the leaves. I covered him in leaves and Mother Nature can take care of him in her own way. Not sure what happened to him. He survived the winter, so it wasn't necessarily the cold, and if it had been a neighbouring cat, surely the cat would have taken him away? Regardless, it was quite sad. RIP little fella.I've added a widget to the top of my sidebars, too. SFT is counting down the days until their trip to Africa, Jane is using it to count down the days to her retirement and I got it from Jane to count down the days until school starts. It's wonderful to have a way to remind me of something I'm looking forward to so much! Why didn't I think of it before?"},

She's one of my favourite people: positive, supportive, fun, outgoing. It's always such an inspiration - and so uplifting - being around her.I also got my new driver's license. Up until November 2010, Yukoners had licenses that looked home-made. Seriously, you could watch the photos go through the laminator and walk away with a still-warm license 5 minutes later. Because this caused so many problems Outside, the government has brought in the new enhanced licenses - they are in line with what the provinces now have - and that should cut out any issues. I never had any, but there are stories out there.Cost: $50 (for 5 years)I got a box of Russian Gypsy Fortune Telling cards, too, which are quite lovely. This was a gift from a co-worker and entirely unexpected. I'm very pleased with them and am flattered by the gesture. I'll have to give myself a proper reading today.I've had a couple of extra shifts at work and \"collected\" a couple more through the end of the month. This will help my school funding and my debt repayments.Joey went to the vet and had his shave ($105). Here he is before:And after:I laughed for about 15 minutes, but he stopped talking to me for two days. He's finally yelling at me again, so he's back to normal, but as I keep the apartment quite cool, he's finding it hard to stay warm. He apparently doesn't like to be under blankets, so I've turned the heat up in a couple of rooms for his comfort. It's all about the cats...Long, lovely Easter weekend... :) I've had one session with my trainer, a brunch date with a friend, a pot-luck vegetarian dinner with friends yesterday and I have another training session today. I also have to make a big dent in my final essay, which is due on Sunday. I haven't started yet, but have my references and information. I just have to write it all down and then review & revise.I made a Lemon Lust cake yesterday for dessert. I was a bit disappointed as it wasn't as lemony as I would have liked and the cake not as thick, but overall it was quite delicious. The buttercream icing was very, um, buttery, which I think was the issue I had with it. One of my friends had three pieces, though, so overall it was a hit. Always great company and great food. I love the holiday get-togethers we have.The weather has been superb this weekend! Just gorgeous.I finally took my bike in to get tuned-up so I can ride to work. It will be ready this week. Hurrah!I signed back on to Facebook yesterday after over three months away from it (mixed feelings about this), but was very quiet about it and didn't say 'hi' to anyone. I spent some time \"unliking\" some things and hiding and removing other things so that I'm not inclined to spend a lot of time on it anymore. I found that I didn't miss it at all. I'm quite proud of myself for having been able to (hopefully) beat the obsession, although I will have to monitor myself very, very carefully now that I'm back on.Now if I could only break my obsession with Angry Birds...Hope you all had a wonderful weekend and got some time to relax! I've been neglecting my blog readings, but look forward to spending an hour or so catching up."},

An hour at the gym and I feel like I own the world. That's a good thing, considering how I woke up this morning: unrested and terribly disturbed. I had the strangest dream ever, involving a murderer who would pretend to be a corpse and then when people stopped to chick on him, he'd kill them.I know, right? PLUS he looked - in his corpse guise - like one of those anatomy drawings that shows all the muscles and how they flow over the skeleton...I got my high school transcript yesterday, which means a copy ALSO landed at the college. I am hoping this will be the final hurdle to being formally accepted and I'm going to be on pins & needles for the next couple of weeks until that letter arrives in my mailbox. There was no mention of how well I had to do in Math 10, just that I needed it: 56%. I'm going to assume that's sufficient (although I hope it's not going to be a problem that it's general level, not advanced or \"regular\" or whatever).I did very poorly in the basic skills (math, english, science...visual arts!), but fared (a bit) better in history - surprising - geography, spanish and...gym. HAHAHAHA! The last one is uber-ironic because I am the least sporty person E.V.E.R.High school was at least marginally more enjoyable than junior high. Jr high was a nightmare, made worse by the fact that my dad died during that time.It's a beautiful day in Whitehorse today, at +4C. Snow flurriesÂ are forecast for tonight. It's only springtime, for crying out loud. We had snow in July in '09, so I don't know why I'm always surprised by what the weather gods throw at us up here.Going to the gym by myself is a Big Deal, so this, along with getting healthier and fitter, is going to be a huge challenge. I'm easily intimidated - ridiculously so - and it doesn't take much to set my \"fight or flight\" switch to permanent \"flight.\" This particular trait has made me bail on many occasions because of (perceived) fears of one sort or another. This gym is 5-minutes walk from my house, pretty small and basic, and remarkably empty most of the time, all of which will help me - I hope - overcome this issue. This is a good challenge for me, as this sort of thing is definitely outside my comfort zone.156 days until school starts. :)"},

Apparently they are all sugar hounds, so my friend told me to bring cookies...I joined the gym yesterday. I met with the personal trainer for a chat about what I'm looking for and I ended up purchasing a 4-month membership. Cost: $178.61 (I got a 10% discount for being a gov employee - lots of us around, so applies as a \"group\" discount). I can use the gym without a membership, but only if accompanied by the trainer, which defeats my purpose and would end up being outrageously expensive. This was the (far) cheaper option. This will take me through to the beginning of August. The gym is less than 5-minutes walk from my house, was pretty quiet (standard, apparently, which is fantastic) and has everything I need.This is one of my challenges for my 45th year - to take better care of myself. I can't NOT afford to do this, so I'm looking at it as an investment in my health, rather than taking on more debt.Have already received most of my textbooks for school! They've arrived over the past couple of days. :)Fat Joey has a vet appointment today. Several claws on his front feet don't retract and end up curling over and growing into the pads. Not sure it hurts necessarily, but it is very uncomfortable for him. I take him to the vet as he gets very agitated when I touch his feet for any reason.Currently 0C and supposed to get to +8 today!!

Iâm also reading Martha Beckâs âFinding Your Own North Star.âIâve just started it, but sheâs very funny and Iâm enjoying the process. Itâs aboutlistening to your âessentialâ self (your heart/soul, whatever it is that speaksto you honestly about, well, everything: your job, people, situations, etc) andhow to let it guide you to what you are supposed to be doing in life, your âNorthStar,â and figure out what it is that these uncomfortable, awkward and justplain âwrongâ situations are supposed to teach you, so that you can find yourNorth Star faster and more clearly.Watching?

You use a book for 4 months and can pay $100 (min) for even a simple one. And it just keeps going up from there. I've just spent a couple of hours searching the 'net again for reduced price textbooks for my program, and was initially excited to find a site that even has RENTAL options for books (I had no idea)!Â There's only one problem...They don't sell, rent or ship Internationally. As a Canadian, I'm considered International. Poop. They have such a great racketÂ set-up, too. You can buy new or used books and when you're finished with them, you send them back and get up to half the cost reimbursed, making it stupidly cheap to buy your textbooks.I was feeling pretty deflated, as it doesn't leave many options for me. Several of these textbooks have inserts (CDs, access codes, etc) that I will likely need for the course, so it would be more sensible to buy them new as used doesn't guarantee those things will be included or, if they are, still accessible.So, I perused the Amazon.com website instead and actually found some good deals on new books there. Because the dollars aren't that far apart right now, I'm still saving money and they're new items to boot. I bought 4 textbooks:Amazon.ca price: $391.57 (free shipping)Amazon.com price: $346.37 (incl. $20.95 shipping & $15.50 import fee)I also bought two textbooks from Amazon.ca for $159.61 (free shipping) because they didn't have them on the US site. That leaves three, which I've made a note of. I'm hoping that by the time the books arrive, I'll have my income tax return. That, plus the money I've already set aside to cover school expenses, will cover the whole cost so far. :)I'm still feeling overall that this is the right thing for me to do, but my friends (mostly Europeans who don't quite get this whole \"quit-your-job-and-go-back-to-school\" thing) have barely managed a blip of excitement for me. It just hurts a little, that's all, and has me questioning if it really IS the best thing to do.

Getting rid of 1.5 bags of books at the secondhand store and returning with three ânewâ ones. Have one more bag to unload asthey only take one bag per person at a time, but because my second bag countedmore as a half, thatâs why she took it.Had a call from my brother in the UK. He was concerned thatI might be taking on overwhelming debt to go back to school, but when I gavehim the details of what I was doing with respect to finding the means to do it,he stopped panicking. He and his partner are off to Sri Lanka for 10 days overEaster and it sounds like a marvelous trip they have planned: beaches,snorkeling and scuba diving, a national park overnight to see leopards, traintrips, highlandsâ¦Iâm very much looking forward to seeing them in July, when Igo to Ontario."},
{"title": "Taxes done at last", "date": "Saturday 10 March 2012", "text": "I just sent off my income tax return - one less thing to do! After waiting for any final papers, it seems I have everything I need. My last T4 arrived last week and brought my $1000 return down to $689.50, but I'm not complaining. That's terrific and will be split between school, debt & travel once it arrives in several weeks.I did a bit more online research with respect to textbook buying this morning and have found a couple of sites that will save me some cash on the ones I need. Great news for my budget! I've also had another suggestion of where I could find some money to support my education, so I'm going to look into that on Monday. Asking costs nothing and I won't know until I try.It's a beautiful day in Whitehorse today, -1C and slightly cloudy. I just got back from a walk with a friend along the river. Her partner made cranberry oatmeal cookies, so I was gifted a few to enjoy later! :)Â I can officially mark today off as another no spend, too.All in all a great weekend and I still have brunch to look forward to tomorrow, as well as getting rid of books from last month's declutter."},
{"title": "Friday update (...long post...)", "date": "Friday 9 March 2012", "text": "I'm a little late to the March challenges game, but to be fair my Internet was down for three days this week, so I was unable to get up to date with blogs and whatnot. Fortunately, it's Reading Week from school this week, so there was nothing pressing that needed doing. The tech was here for about 3 hours on Wednesday afternoon and did manage to fix it, but not without some real frustration and convincing me to switch to cable from ADSL. Same price, more megabytes and now more reliable. It shouldn't cost me anything, either, so I will set up an appointment to do that. This was the first time I've ever had an issue with the ADSL, so was quite surprised it was as complicated as it turned out to be. I still have no idea what the actual problem was, but as I say, it's fixed and working fine now.The Arctic Winter Games (U18 yrs) and Dene Games are in town this week. Thousands of visitors from all over the world are here: Greenland, Yamal (Russia), Sami (Finland), Northern Alberta and Nunavik Quebec, and Alaska. There was a big cultural festival on Wednesday night with food, songs, dancing, etc. The First Nations are from Nunavut, NWT and Yukon and competing in all kinds of traditional games. It's quite exciting really. I'm not attending any of the activities, but did see part of the snowshoe races from the windows at work. Those kids were working hard! They're winding up today and tomorrow and will likely be heading home Sunday after a week of competitions. Yukon is in 2nd place behind Alaska.I am SO excited about school that I've already started pricing textbooks (via Amazon) and thinking of ways to get them at a cheaper cost - used is likely the most cost effective. Today I took my list of school supplies and went to Wal-Mart and Staples, initially just to compare costs, but I ended up buying some little things like paperclips, paper, pencils, pens and a couple of rulers, scotch tape, etc. The prices were excellent and I'm keen to stay proactive and continue to focus like everything has already fallen into place. I already have several of the items on the list, so that saves me a few $$ (calculator, USB stick & stapler).I bought (so far):2 x paperclips (regular and bulldog clips in one container): $1 each. I'm considering returning these as I don't need the bulldog clips, just the regular ones, but because they were on clearance, I'm not sure that I can. Will check.25 letter size file folders: $7.421 box black fine ball point pens: $2.341 12\" acrylic ruler: $1.321 clear metric ruler: 0.48 (it says 'clear ruler' on my list, and wasn't sure exactly what that meant, so bought two, just to overkill things)2 binders: $7.82 ($3.91 ea; will look into cheaper/free ways of collecting these instead)3x5 index cards (100/pk): $1.97Scotch tape (3/pk): $4.83Pencils (20/pk): $1.67400 sheets paper: $4.40Total: $36.23Likely a lot of this stuff will have to be refilled at least once over the course of the program, but some will not. The cost estimate I received for supplies was $400, but I honestly think that's way too high. I guess we'll see. All this went onto my MC, but because I have the money set aside for that, I'll be making a transfer to cover the card expenditure.Then I went to the bookstore to look for a book that I needed for school, the only one I can buy outside the college. I had a gift card for Coles, so that was the perfect opportunity to buy something I needed and not spend anything to do it.I'm a sucker.Buy 4 books (ANY BOOKS!) for the price of 3??! Wow. Great deal, right? Let's see:Collins Gage Canadian Paperback Dictionary (my intended purchase): $14.95It's Your Money (Gail V-O): $21.99 w/20% offWealthy Barber Returns: $19.95 w/20% offOprah's Best Advice Ever (I know...): $32.95Total: $44.83I suppose that's a pretty good \"savings.\" I intentionally got two books that were 20% off (the irony that they are both financial books does not escape me, btw), so that helped bring the cost down a bit, too. Original price $89.84, so I \"saved\" $45.01.Then it was on to grocery shopping.2 cans cream of mushroom soup (for tuna casseroles): $3.982 pkgs egg noodles: $3.76Butter chicken sauce: $3.69Korma sauce: $3.69Brick extra-old cheddar: $7.19 (this reminds me why I'm trying not to buy this anymore)3 pkgs Jasmine rice: $11.97 ($3.99 ea)2 L organic 1% milk: $5.692 containers garlic hummous: $11.18 ($5.59 ea)Filet of salmon: $15.50Ground turkey: $5.50Mild Italian sausages: $3.98Gala apples: $5.94 (1.360 kg @$4.37/kg)Berry bowl: $5.87Green grapes: $3.42 (.520 kg @$6.57/kg)Total: $91.76I'm set for at least another couple of weeks with this haul. Yum!I got my annual bonus on Wednesday plus my annual increment, so I had a nice big paycheque to play with! I've updated my side bars as a lot of it went into my school and my travel accounts ($425 each). I put $75 into other savings, plus 10% of the bonus amount into my RRSP and my EFund. This makes me very happy.I actually also did a return today, which I'm quite proud of. I've walked to work several times this week (approx 40 mins each way) and yesterday I dropped into the bookstore downtown and walked away after spending over $45! I was halfway home when the guilt got to me, so I returned half the items today, getting back $28.32. I'm feeling better about that.My March challenges list:Personal1) Review/redo my resume and look for p/t jobs, preferably ones that don't have a heavy customer service oriented focus(<-- a challenge!)2) Start looking into book prices and collecting items on supplies list3) Walk to work at least three times a week; walk 35 - 45 mins on days offFinancial1) Make appointment at the bank to discuss options for attending school (loan, RRSP, etc)2) Set up savings account;Â aim for $3K by September3) Look into bursaries, loans, grants, etc for funds for schoolDeclutter1) Take books to used book store and \"stuff\" to the free store2) Pantry (tidy and discard out of date items)3) Tidy away school suppliesPhew! So there we are. I'm off to make chocolate cupcakes for a dinner tonight. Hope you all have a great weekend. I'll be spending some time tomorrow catching up on your blogs."},
{"title": "Oh my...", "date": "Thursday 1 March 2012", "text": "I just spoke with someone at the college admissions office as I had thought of a couple more questions with respect to the program.Turns out she has processed me as a FULL-TIME STUDENT instead of the part-time I had anticipated. So I'm actually IN THE PROGRAM. I just need to complete the first part of the assessment, which she assured me doesn't include algebra (hallelujah!!!!), so I'll save myself $22 and just do that instead.Well...Wow.YAHOO!!! The decision has been made for me, so I need to start saving."},
{"title": "Decision time", "date": "Thursday 1 March 2012", "text": "I had a conversation with a co-worker yesterday about...things...school and my back and the fact that I'm unhappy at work and that's partially what's contributing to my back problems. She's a lovely woman and I really value any input or insight that she gives me. She's also unhappy at work - to the point that she and I both look forward to holidays, not because we're on holiday and have lots of fun things to do, BUT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT AT WORK. That's not what a holiday should be.So. What came of this conversation is that I'm seriously thinking about going back to school full-time and just getting the program done, rather than fumbling through it part-time as and when I can. I'm mailing my transcript request in today - god knows when the college will receive it - but of course this leads to thoughts of financing this gig and supporting myself while doing it, which would be approximately 10 months. A phone call to the college this morning also indicated that if I'm going to apply full-time I need to do it NOW, as the program fills quickly. So, essentially, I have to make a decision by tomorrow.Let's make a list.Pros:1) I can take a leave from work (unpaid) and still have my job to go back to when I'm finished (if needed).2) I can use my RRSPs to fund the education (LLP program). It's non-taxable and I have to pay them back, but it's definitely an option if I enrol full-time. I also have some CSBs I could cash in.3) I would get it DONE, instead of dragging it out, leaving me in the position to find a new job sooner, rather than later.4) I can get a $97 per week grant to cover my food costs from the government (it will help).5) This opportunity excites me and at this moment feels like the right thing to do.6) I'd be away from work for 9. Whole. Months.Cons:1) I'm not working, so would have to find some way of paying rent, etc. I would have to discuss this carefully with my landlady. She's a doll, but there are limits.2) I'd have to save every single penny I make between now and September if I want to have some money to live on while I'm studying. Not sure if I can also get Student Loans if I use my RRSPs. Will have to look into that. I'd rather have the student loans than cash my RRSPs, to be honest.3) Um...Well...a rather unbalanced list in favour of the pros for sure. Any thoughts? Arguments? Points in favour or not?Either way, I'll be doing the progam, as if I don't do the full-time, I'll be registered for the part-time.Argh."},
{"title": "Random Tuesday thoughts", "date": "Tuesday 28 February 2012", "text": "My back is still out, so I took today off work as well. However, I'm pretty sure I'm into LWOP now, so have to go back tomorrow, regardless of how I'm feeling. I saw the chiro yesterday and had a small adjustment, although I'm not sure how much good it did. It is inflamed, so ice and rest are the best things for it.I'm going to take myself out for a walk today and make a stop at the local gym on my way home ('uh-oh!' I hear you say). It's literally 5 minutes away from me. These problems with my back have really concerned me, not least because I'm too young to feel so, so crappy. I've N.E.V.E.R. (!!) been sporty or active and that's the likely cause of most of the issue. I'm going to inquire about rates & if there's a group discount. The other two gyms in town offer discounts for government workers (or any group over 10 people), so these guys might too. It costs nothing to ask.I also want to inquire about personal trainers. I need someone to keep me accountable for my progress. I realize that can be pricey, so this is simply a fact-finding mission at this point.I'm aware that part of the problem is that I'm unhappy in my job. The fact that I'm taking time off simply because I can is not a good sign. I don't want it to degenerate to the point that it's affecting my co-workers or their feelings about me or my work, but I know that it will come to that point if something doesn't change (my attitude being one thing). I'm anxious and stressed out at work, I don't enjoy what I'm doing any more and the job search is very, very frustrating. I hate feeling stuck. There's obviously something(s) I'm NOT doing that's keeping me stuck, however, so I have to work on that. I'm great at self-sabotage, so there are plenty of things I NEED to do that I don't, because it's easier to keep going in the same direction than make changes that are hard or will hurt. Human nature, eh?I already got my refund cheque for my dental appointment last week! Hurrah!I'm having a hard time with my second English essay. I had trouble choosing between two topics and sent in an outline even though I wasn't \"feeling\" it. I've since decided to do an entirely different topic, but that's feeling only marginally better. The format is challenging me, but I was, for the most part, pleased with my mark on my first essay - B+. The instructor has said that we can revise and try for a higher mark, though, so I might just do that.I'm reading some cosy mysteries by Mary Jane Maffini, a Canadian author. The character is a professional organizer and unfortunately I'm not loving them. Mostly because the dialogue is a bit...strange...(there are a lot of non-sequiturs and instances when I'm thinking \"what a weird conversation\") and in the second book I got entirely lost in the first chapter. One of the (main) characters is utterly flat and there are little details that don't necessarily need to be included, as they aren't contributing to the story in any way. I'm finding that incidents seem to happen a bit randomly, rather than in some sort of logical order. Does that make sense? I realize you have to throw red herrings and whatnot into mysteries to keep the reader guessing and throw them off track, but...I don't know. It's a bit hard to explain, but obviously I'm enjoying them enough that I keep reading. They're just disappointing, that's all, after reading such great ones over the past few weeks.I'm thinking of what goals I can set for March: financially, personally, physically, all that good stuff. I need to do better than I did in February, which wasn't entirely a bust, but was quite eye-opening upon review...ahem! Less stringent with the savings and a stronger focus on debt busting is definitely up there. And carry on reading the blogs regularly - it's very inspiring to read others' goals and be able to share the joy when they're met."},
{"title": "PS", "date": "Friday 24 February 2012", "text": "What's with all the random words in the blogs that are somehow automatically linked to weird ads all of a sudden? Is anyone else getting these?Well, it's essentially the last week of Carla's February Challenge. I'm not overly proud of how I've done (or, rather, not done), but I have succeeded to a point. I'm happy with anything being done this month, quite frankly, seeing as almost two weeks were spent hosting a visitor.I got my letter from the college today, letting me know that my application won't be complete until they have proof I can do Grade 10 math. Instead of making a total ass of myself (isn't this where algebra and fractions originated?) and sitting down to try and do something I don't remember doing 30 years ago, I've got a call into my high school for a transcript. I already called the college where I did my carpentry program, but they only have on file that I did the trades math route (shorter and differently focused than the regular Grade 11 stream) and my Grade 12 English, so there's no point asking for a transcript for that. I had to go back and upgrade the math portion before I got accepted into the carpentry program, anyway. Math and I were never friends. Still aren't, actually. But isn't that why god invented calculators? ;)I'm a little disappointed, but will do what I need to do because I'm determined to get into this program and start as soon as I can. All the courses I want to take appear to be full, so I'm thinking I might lean towards the medical ones as there are spaces available in those. It seems that all I need to ensure is that I have the prerequisites for each one and I can (sort of) take the Office Administration and the Medical stream concurrently. Not certain how efficient that will be, but if it keeps me moving ahead instead of frustrated and stuck in one place, it's a good option.My week this week, thanks to being at home with a bad back, has been pretty good with respect to no spend days.Feb 20: Dentist - $242 (will be fully reimbursed, so kind of a no spend day)Feb 21: no-spend!Feb 22: no-spend!Feb 23: Diabetic cat food (dry & tins) $56.32Feb 24: Groceries $166.15, gas $70.06I was up and out of the house by 7:30 this morning to go to grocery shopping. I went to Superstore because I knew there wouldn't be a lot of people there at this time in the morning. It was still more crowded than I anticipated, but I was in and out within about 45 mins, so that's pretty good. I did take a list but I'm worse than shopping with kids or a husband, I bet. All kinds of things jumped into my basket, although I'm pleased to say that I DID put several back after thinking about them. This is what I bought (keep in mind, Superstore is the cheapest place in town to shop):GroceryMinced garlic: $6.49 (1 kg container)PC Butter Chicken sauce: $5.27PC Pasta Sauce: $3.69PC Organic Fusilli (rice): (2 @ $2.99 ea) $5.98Unsweetened almond milk x 4: $9.08 ($2.27 ea, 965 mL)NN FT 6x136: $5.27 (for the life of me, I can't remember what this is! I just went back to check my shelves & fridge...anyone?? No name something...argh...)DeliYves Ground Round x 4: $15.88 ($3.97 ea <-- great price so I stocked up a bit!)Garlic Hummous: $5.59Soya Mozzarella x 2:$ 9.56 ($4.78 ea <--also a very good price)SeafoodSalmon: $16.63Salmon fillet: $8.36(I love salmon and these two pieces will give me over a week's worth of meals)MeatChicken breast (8 pieces, family pack): $27.35 <-- a reasonable price, considering this will give me up to 8 meals.Italian sausages: $4.49ProduceFuji apples: $6.45 (1.475 Â kg @ $4.37/kg)Broccoli: $2.48Carrots: $2.24 (0.600 kg @ $3.73/kg)Cucumbers: $3.76 (2 @ $1.88 ea - anyone else notice the English ones are getting scrawny?Green onion: .89Navel oranges (lg): $2.05 (1.190 kg @ $1.72/kg, or .78/lb)Green pepper: $1.46 (0.335 kg @ $4.37/kg) that's one pepperWhite potatoes: $4.86 (1.490 kg @ $3.26/kg) I bought a bag of larger ones, as the prebagged ones - the baby whites - were kind of soft and not very appealing.Red peppers: $4.47 (0.510 kg @ $8.77/kg) three! That's an amazing price for red peppers, considering I've spent that much on ONE before.Romaine hearts (3 in a bag): $3.48Sweet potatoes x 3: $7.19 (2.350 kg @ $3.06/kg)FM CRT MN 2LB: $3.88 - another mystery item! :PThe produce selection wasn't great, so I think we were between trucks - deliveries generally arrive on Fridays if I remember correctly - but I'm happy with my selection regardless. Some of the produce wasn't looking very good, so pardon me if I seem fussy, but I don't want to spend a lot of money on things that may not last even a day or two, never mind a week.I have an essay to start this weekend and tea with a friend tomorrow afternoon.

{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday 22 February 2012", "text": "I just finished my mid-term English exam, so am taking a break to write up another post. I've been off work for three days with a sore back. It's migrated from my shoulder area and settled for now in my lower back/hip area. I think it's a combination of things: different mattress (from the weekend), dog wash, exercise (I know...but snowshoeing!) and period cramps, which I don't normally get. Anyhoo, it's making me pretty unhappy as standing or sitting for too long just simply hurts. I have a chiro appointment for Monday morning, so hopefully that will help. I suppose I should take a Tylenol as well, although I hate bandaid solutions. (Regular) exercise would help immensely, too, right? :PAs you recall, these were the challenges for the month. Let's see how I've done on the financial end of it:Choose a financial goal for the month!Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $200 - $300 to VISA card -Â FAIL + PASS. I DID put $341 onto the VISA, but I also racked up about $500 in expenses on it, pretty much at the same time.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $100 into my travel fund, $50 to vet, $50 to car, $50 to EFund -Â I've put $40 into each, and $60 into my EFund.How will you achieve your goal this month?Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Similar to last month: take lunches to work; use my calendar, debit and notebook to track my spending; and use more cash. This is also so I can have more coins to roll, to put back onto the VISA card -Â I'm going to take a PASS for this; I didn't do it right away and still have to update my spreadsheet, but I DID keep my receipts so I wouldn't miss anything and added the expenses to my calendarÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Shave some off the grocery bill where I can: $50 - $60 week for food - work in progressÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Shave the gas money to one fill per month - $80. This means *gasp*Â walkingÂ if itâs getting low. Easier now that itâs slightly warmer and staying light a bit later.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Can I get away with putting $70 onto the hydro bill, rather than $90? -Â I've put $80 on the hydro bill each month, rather than risk it being too low. I can adjust as necessary.How will you allot your spending this month?Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Cats. Theyâre continually hungry (imagine!), plus Dinahâs specialty diabetic food. Iâve upped my budget for them from $80 to $100 per month. -Â so far, so good.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As above, cut the gas budget from $150 p/month â which Iâm not sure Iâve ever hit anyway â to $80. I have a friend visiting for a few days and will likely use a bit more than normal, but hopefully Iâll be able to keep it to just one fill regardless. -Â $69Â this month and I've done a LOT of driving this month, comparatively. Hoping I can make it to March.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Be diligent about making lunches and breakfast daily. Itâs working well so far, so I think lowering the grocery budget is feasible. Besides, how much food can one person eat anyway? (Answer: youâd be surprised!) -Â Pass. My friend made several meals, plus she very generously paid for the whole weekend away, which included most meals! I bought one Subway sandwich for dinner.4.Â Track your purchases!Doing well with this, so it shouldnât be hard to carry on. I now have a little notebook to mark my purchases in. It was an old one hanging around at work, so I asked if I could have it. -Â PASS, although I'm not doing it daily. It IS being done.5.Â Are there any âexemptionsâ for the monthÂ I have a $150 payment I need to make, plus at least two dinners out with friends. I go out for dinner very rarely, so this will be a treat for me. I still have to make sure I donât go overboard with the meal, though, so I'll budget $20 for each of those. -Â no dinners out (other than with my friend who was visiting), so those are a fail, or a pass depending on how you look at it. The $150 payment was made, however.Â Chiropractic appointment(s). I will get 80% back for these, so that money can get rolled back into a budget at some point. -Â two of these for the month. $80 out = $65 (approx) back. PLUS I had a dentist appointment, which, it turns out, will be fully covered by insurance ($242). Hurrah!The decluttering is more of a challenge. I haven't done anything since my initial round at the beginning of the month, but do have a long weekend ahead of me, so I will hopefully at least clear out my kitchen pantry if nothing else. As for when this stuff will get moved out of here, that's anyone's guess. I'd like to sell some of it, but the most convenient way to do that is to log back onto Facebook, and I'm almost two months into my FB ban and quite enjoying it, so I don't want to do that unless I have to.Otherwise, I've just got my essay thesis to post today - have to think of the thesis statement first - and will take a down day. Likely I'll just drink lots of tea and watch HGTV. In my pajamas."},

Once by the lovely Jane and again by our favourite prairie teacher, Jolie. Is this still going on? Is it worth it to tag anyone two weeks after the fact?These are my answers to the questions, for what it's worth, however.Jane's tag:1. Describe yourselfin seven words. Funny, smart, lazy, undisciplined, easy-going, aloof,loving.2. Why did you decideto start a blog? The first one was because I thought I had somethinginteresting to say. This one because I wanted to keep myself accountable, learnsome things and get serious about my financial future. Plus itâs way more funand I met all of you, which is a tremendous bonus!3. What is yourfavorite kind of cheese? Extra aged cheddar. Can. Not. Get. Enough.4. What keeps youawake at night? Songs (various), thoughts and images of horse slaughter (Ihave not watched and will not watch YouTube videos detailing this, but nonethelessI imagine it), wishing I had a different job, one of the cats vomitingsomewhere, the cats arguing, the cats lying on my chest, a sore neck, what Iâddo with the money if I won the next Lotto Max jackpotâ¦5. If you couldchange one thing about yourself what would it be? That I had much morediscipline to do what I need to do (work, school, health, finance, etc).6. Here's a questionfrom Michael that he likes to ask me on the phone: \"What are you wearingright now?\" A pair of purple, snowflake decorated pajamas. SLA (StandardLazing Apparel) of my evenings and weekends. Thatâs EXACTLY how often I go outin the eveningsâ¦hahaha!7. Tell us somethingabout the person who tagged you! Jane lives in London, ON, and has a lovely daughter, Kazi,and a (really hot!) boyfriend, Michael. Sheâs a teacher and is cycling toPhiladelphia â I think on a stationary bike. She has a marvelous sense ofhumour, a heck of a lot of fun and seems like the kind of person you can sitdown with and have an easy conversation.8. Stretch out yourarm and tell us what is the closest thing to you right now? My little calicocat, Dinah. Sheâs tucked up into a loaf on the corner of the desk.9. What's yourfavorite flavour of ice cream?Â  Do youlick your ice cream or bite right into it? Really anything with chocolate âthere was an amazing flavour called âMoose Tracksâ that I used to buy. Lovely creamyvanilla ice cream with a ribbon of fudge and mini peanut butter cups throughout.I also found an amazing coconut ice cream that I havenât been able to findagain. Coconutâs one of those funny things â you love it or hate it. I love it.Lately itâs a dark chocolate coconut ice cream. YUM!! I bite right into the icecream. Why wait?10. Do you prefer thetruth or a white lie that doesn't hurt your feelings? Truth please! Give itto me straight â itâs not always what I want to hear, but itâs what I alwaysNEED to hear.11. Do you like yourlife right now? Why or why not?Yes, because over the past couple of years Iâve opened up toso much awareness about myself and why I am the way I am (and what needs to betaken care of). I am truly fortunate and lucky to have a good job, a warm,comfortable home, three loving and entertaining furry companions, friends,family and a beautiful place to call home. And no, because I could be doing somuch more with my life, but Iâve let fear take hold and thatâs tripping me upbadly. My creativity has become dormant to the point of non-existence, so Ineed to work on that badly and just let myself play, make mistakes, not beâperfect.âJolie's tag:1) What is one small difference you do to make money changesin your world? Pay attention to how Iâm feeling. That seems to have a hugeimpact on whether I spend money or not and on what.2) What piece of advice would you tell 22 year old you? Go to school and get a degree â it doesnât matter in what. Thenget a certificate to Teach English as a Second Language so you can travel theworld and for godâs sake, set some personal boundaries and start standing upfor yourself! 3) What free entertainment makes you smile? Walking,photography, reading, my cats, spending time with my friends.4) If you had the choice of $1000 a week for 10 weeks or $10000 all at once, which would you take, and why? The $1000 weekly. It feels like more, although it obviouslyisnât, and Iâd be less afraid that Iâd spend it all at once and all randomlythan if I got a lump sum. It just âfeelsâ like the lump sum would have to beall put towards one thing, whereas the weekly payments âfeelâ more flexible andlike I can apply them to more things. Doesnât really make much sense, but thereyou are.5) What is one thing you purchased in the past that you wishyou hadn't? A business instead of a house. I got caught up in the enthusiasmand excitement of two others and still kick myself.6) What one piece of advice would you give someone headinginto their first adult job/career? Pay off your student debt asap and startsaving 10% of your income. Make sure you love your work, and arenât just doingit for the money.7) What book would you take with you if you were stranded ona desert island? âWar & Peaceâ so I would finally find the time to read it.8) If you could go back to the past and have coffee/tea with1 person, who would it be? My dad.9) What is your favourite season and why? Spring! Partly because itâs when my birthday falls andpartly because everything is new and fresh and clean. A close second is autumn.Actually it's close enough to be a tie.10) Cat lover or dog lover? Both actually, but I have cats right now.11) If your life were a movie, who should play you? Sandra Bullock, because sheâs awesome. Her or Betty White,just because I would love to meet Betty.I'm afraid I haven't really followed through on the February challenges as I had hoped to, but I've been busy otherwise! I had a friend visiting for 11 days (she left this morning), and so haven't had much computer time since shortly before she arrived on the 10th. So, to hopefully keep things short(er) & sweet, I'll do a bullet point update.No change in the clutter situation. I haven't removed anything I've collected, but neither have I brought anything in. My friend did bring me a couple of gifts, but other than that, I've managed to refrain from refilling any empty spaces on my shelves and in my closets.Actually, that's not true. I did buy Season 2 of \"Hot in Cleveland.\"And I have spent a lot. Every day since my friend arrived, actually.But it was fun!Â Having my friend here was great, although I am glad to have the place to myself again. I've known her a number of years, but not well, and you learn a lot about a person by spending time with them, you know? She calls herself a night owl, but I would lean more towards insomniac. Up at all hours of the night on the computer. Lights on. Lights off. Lights on again. It's a small space and sharing with someone who puts stuff everywhere pushes a few buttons. She had a great time, however, and I think really needed the time away, so I'm pleased she managed to relax and have some time to herself. Here's some photos of what we did:Bundle up for a day of dog mushing! I got a gift certificate for Christmas and it was a perfect day for it. Temperature was only about -2C - a bit warm for the dogs - but the sun was out, the sky was blue...Beautiful!Ginger (l) and Strider (r), our lead dogs.The dogs spent a lot of time cooling off in the snowbanks when we stopped. It's hot work for them on such warm days.Away down the Takhini River we go. I'm driving and my friend is in the basket.Resting dog in his harness.I think this one's name is Bear. He was on a different team. Isn't he gorgeous?Penny (l) and Boober (r). These two were our wheel dogs (closest to the sled).Getting ready to return after our lunch break.Lovely day for it!The return journey.The beautiful Strider (l) and lovely little Ginger (r). Lead dogs. Check out Ginger's booties!Puppies!! They attacked anything that moved - and didn't. Adorable.We also spent a couple of nights at the Hotsprings Valley Retreat. There was a Japanese fellow who'd come all the way to see the Aurora and when we got there hadn't had any luck so far. The day after we arrived, there was quite a beautiful display, so we were all very happy for him. It was my first attempt at taking photos of them - it's a bit of a challenge - so apologies for the blurry outcome!The cabins. Electricity, but no washrooms or kitchens. You have to go the main building for those.Tracks in the snow. Small, so perhaps a weasel.Snowshoed up to this point - my first time in snowshoes! What a view.I think I might get myself a pair of these. It was a lot of fun.My first attempts at capturing the aurora borealis (aka Northern Lights). I gave up after a while and just enjoyed watching them dance. They are amazing - far better than anything man made.Ice crystals on the trees.Elk at the Yukon Wildlife Preserve.Short horned sheep.Stone sheep.Musk ox. We were hoping she would turn to look at us, but she was too busy scratching an itch with the stick to pay any attention to us.Mountain goats in their natural(ish) habitat.One of three lynx in their new enclosure.More goats coming down to investigate a little closer.One of two Arctic Foxes in their new enclosure. They're tiny things and turn brown in the summer.Caribou.Wood bison (male). He was simply enjoying the sunshine.These are photos from the area where the warm river (which heats the hotsprings pools) flows into the lake. This accounts for the lovely ice crystals on the trees in the above photo as well as the steam and ice crystals around the area below.Â It was a lovely weekend!I've decided that I want out of my job desperately enough to enrol in the office administration program at the college. I'll be taking it online and can take up to two years to complete it, but am hoping I can be finished in less time than that. There are two new streams that have been added recently - legal and medical - so once I'm finished the main program, I'm going to take the Medical Coding stream so that I can get out of the public domain and work from home instead! I'm still waiting to hear whether or not I've been accepted into the program, but I'm very excited and it feels right. I took it as a sign when I was screened out of yet another job application because I don't have the education (although I do have the experience). I decided that being proactive about things would smooth the road better than moping about it and getting depressed.I'm already halfway through my English course. I have my mid-term exam tomorrow and a second essay due on March 2. I'm fairly happy with my first mark (B+), but I know I can do much better, so need to organize and review more thoroughly for the next one.I booked a flight for another friend to come and visit me for a few days in May. I can't really afford it, but I can afford it much better than she can and much better than if the airfare was at the regular price. I am so excited to have her here.I've already booked my holidays for the year and they're spread out quite nicely. My birthday weekend; a few days in May; a week in July for a trip to Ontario; and over Christmas. I took 4 days holiday at Christmas and because of regular closures and time off, I get 16 days in total!This will be a busy weekend as I get caught up from the last two weeks! Including reading all your updates and blog posts. Looking forward to it!"},
{"title": "Slacker Saturday", "date": "Saturday 4 February 2012", "text": "I had grand plans for today - sort of. I was going to declutter the kitchen, but that hasn't happened yet. I was going to get to those long, long, long, etc. overdue emails that I owe people. That hasn't happened either. Where HAS my morning gone?Â Well, I've been reading all the updates on your blogs...um....okay, so I need a little motivation...I DID however, do something I've never done before - write a letter to someone as the result of a TV show. I've discovered \"Undercover Boss\" (anyone?) and love it. The inaugural Canadian one was on the other night - the CEO of the Toronto Zoo, John Taragno, got to go undercover and clean gorilla poo! And penguin poo! And human poo! What a trooper. Anyhow, I was so moved by the custodian he worked with that I wrote a letter to Mr. Taragno. I hope he doesn't think I'm a total wingnut.I have very fond memories of visiting the Zoo when I was growing up, and the show aired almost exactly 31 years to the date of my dad's death, in 1981. Mr. Taragno had recently lost his own dad and I must have got something in my eyes because they were tearing up at one point. The utterly, utterly lovely custodian had lost one of her daughters and she and her husband wrote letters to her to help them deal with their grief. She had written a beautiful letter to Mr. Taragno's undercover persona \"Jim\" to suggest that he do the same to help him with his grief about his dad. I have been struggling for a way to connect with my dad and as soon as she explained what she did, I knew that was what I had to do, too. She was Amazing.I don't believe in coincidences, so I made up my mind right then and there that I would write a letter to let him know how much the show meant to me. My goal is to now spend a day at the Zoo when I'm there in July, and I will do what I can to make that happen. I have loose plans to spend my only full day in Toronto with a friend I haven't seen in 15 years and I'm going to suggest that she & I spend a day at the Zoo. I think she'd be okay with this.Now I just don't really feel like doing anything else. I'll make a point of going through my kitchen and putting some things on the table where I'm collecting my items for sale/donation/disposal, but I feel a little bit drained to be honest. Coming to terms with the fact that I have feelings and it's okay to actually FEEL them (bad, sad, happy, angry, whatever) after 44 years of repressing them is a big deal. And a lot harder than I thought. I've only just made the connection, for example, that the reason I'm not a happy person is the fact that Â I haven't completely dealt with my dad's death so long ago. I was a happy kid, but then my dad died and we were left with my mum, who really couldn't cope and fun literally disappeared from my life, replaced with shame, guilt and condemnation. It's embarrassing and a bit shameful when people ask what I do for fun, and I don't really have an answer. Because I don't have fun. The depression I've been in and out of for the past 30 years stems from the fact that I wasn't allowed to grieve for my dad when I was a kid - everything else has just built it up, obscuring that fact and adding layers of untruths, repressed feelings and beliefs to it.I'm just so afraid that if I start grieving (aka, crying) I won't be able to stop. I just don't know what to do with all that rage and sadness and grief that would well up and overflow. But holding onto it is just making me sick, depressed, unhappy, cold...Wow...this post turned out much differently than I expected. That letter was obviously very cathartic at some level.Thank you all for being so awesome that you'd listen to this, too.There was no decluttering going on today, unless you count a lot of recycling. I don't really as that's generally par for the course, although it did feel good to finally get rid of it. I have a corner in my office that's my Recycling Collection Point and it tends to build up for longer than it should. Once it reaches the point that the door won't open all the way, I transfer some to the truck...ahem...Out of sight, out of mind, right? Ha!I had a list of things to do and get today and I'm happy to say that I completed most of them. Costs associated with each are included.Chiropractic appointment: check! $40 (actually I only had $38, so owe $2)Groceries: check!4L 1% milk: $4.69Salmon: $18.22 (family size, will last me about a week!)Ground turkey: $5.37Bananas: $2.11 (1.090 kg @$1.94/kg)Berry bowl: $5.65 (mixed fruit salad of strawberries, blackberries and blueberries)6 Ambrosia apples: $4.94 (1.505 kg @$3.28/kg)Officially adopting Fat Joey by FINALLY filling out the paperwork: check! $0 :)Cat food: check! 12 tins @$1.56 ea = $18.77Recycling: check!And my naughty purchase (and the reason I owe $2 to the chiropractor): 3 books $22.02. There goes most of my allowance for the month, but really. I know...it was the 25% off signs that dazzled me, I'm afraid.I went to the bank with all my rolled coin and US$. I deposited the US$ and now have $101.00 in that account.Â My rolled coin amounted to $205! I put $50 onto my LOC as an extra payment and the rest, $155, onto my VISA. This is technically an extra payment, but because I bought my plane ticket I'm not really counting it as extra, because it doesn't fully clear the ticket cost. Regardless, it's snowflake money and every little bit helps.I have just sent off my first English essay thesis to my instructor and over the next few days have to sketch out my ideas for the completed essay which is due next Friday. I've also spoken with an instructor at the college in a certificate program I've decided to register for. I'll be attending part-time and it appears most of the course is online, so I can do it as and when I can. I'm quite excited as I think this is the right program for me. It \"feels\" right and I can get started before the end of February, so that's even more motivating."},
{"title": "It's begun...", "date": "Friday 3 February 2012", "text": "Well, as I stated yesterday, I have fairly little to purge compared to some (oh my!), however, I *STILL* managed to find a load of things that can be sold, donated or tossed. Amazing. I really don't have that much space, so where it all comes from, I have no idea.First up: the TV/DVD stand. I don't even particularly like this stand, but it was basically free and keeps things tidy for the most part. Look at all the DVDs I've got! Ridiculous really.Note the green flat thing on top of the DVD player. This is a green version of the little blue storage container in the top photo. So, after some \"hard\" work, I got this:MUCH better! (Sorry about the glare). Most of the DVDs went into the green container on the right. I sorted a bunch of them out and removed them for selling or donating. And, er, yes, the stand does still need to be cleaned.Next up were the bookshelves in my bedroom.Bookshelf one. This actually looks almost identical after I tidied, except for the pile of books on the top left side. It was actually a pile of letters - half of which were unopened! - from 2006 - 2008. Wow. So the top is much neater now.Bookshelf #2 before the purge. And after:Again, not a big difference, but I actually pulled a surprising number of books off it. The little pile on the top right will be going to the library. They're German books (kids' books) that I got last year when we were decluttering our multi-lingual collection. I won't be reading them and they're just taking up space, so back they go.This is the pile of books I got from the bookshelf:There are a few cookbooks there, too, because who am I kidding? I don't cook, so there's no point keeping them around. I have a few left, plus a binder full of recipes I've collected. More than enough to use should I ever feel the urge to make something creative for dinner. So my cookbook cupboard is quite a bit tidier now, too! Yay! I also put a couple of crossword puzzle books in the purge file because I like to think I'm much smarter than I actually am. Those are NY Times Sunday crosswords - hard! I kept a couple of books, so these are going to be donated. I don't imagine I can get anything for these at the used bookstore. Everything else, however, will be taken in for evaluation and whatever is left will be donated to the library.I'm not even sure it's worth showing you a picture of my bedroom closet before and after. In the 2nd bookshelf photo, there's a pile of stuff on the left hand side. That's what came out of my closet. I also threw out an old belt that was worn, torn and not worth keeping. I added a cooling rack (I have 3) to the pile and a pair of shoes I don't like, too.Â I also did a declutter of my computer. This isn't something I can prove, but I cleared out some big files (photos) and some unused and unwanted documents and it just feels better to have cleaned out a little bit of space from that. Whether it makes any difference to the performance or not, I don't know. It just feels a little better for having done it.My kitchen is tiny, so space is at a premium. I purged this spice rack because I literally have nowhere to keep it. This is the extent of my counter space - one of the reasons I don't like to cook. I have very little space to move around in. When the dishes are drying, as below, I literally have zero counter space.Â Saturday I will be working on my kitchen. I have found a number of things I can get rid of, leaving me with more cupboard space at least. As well, the living room will be getting a very tiny purge - there really isn't much to do in there, but I can at least tidy a little and clear away a few things that just gather dust.And this one is just because:Fat Joey is still with me. Here he is, exhausted and resting on his blanket, from overexerting himself doing nothing today. Good Joey!It doesn't look like I did much, but I was a busy bee for almost three hours!"},
{"title": "Confession...", "date": "Thursday 2 February 2012", "text": "Look at me. Day One of the February challenge isn't even over yet and already I've blown my budget and goals! I got an e-flyer from Air North in my inbox this afternoon and bought a ticket to Vancouver - for LESS THAN $300 RETURN! That's $99 o/w. I just about fell over. Never, ever, ever, EVER (!!!) have I seen a price that low before - it totals HALF of what it usually costs, so I'm helping my brother out a little bit and that's going towards my Ontario trip in July. Next step, Vancouver - Toronto.Wow. I'm not even upset that I blew it. Not even a little bit. I'm still shaking my head. Plus I entered to win a return flight anywhere Air North flies, so who knows?"},
{"title": "February challenges. Bring it on!", "date": "Wednesday 1 February 2012", "text": "Okay, Carla - here are my February goals:Choose a financial goal     for the month!Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $200 - $300 to VISA cardÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $100 into my travel fund, $50 to vet, $50 tocar, $50 to EFundHow will you achieve your     goal this month?Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Similar to last month: take lunches to work; usemy calendar, debit and notebook to track my spending; and use more cash. Thisis also so I can have more coins to roll, to put back onto the VISA cardÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Shave some off the grocery bill where I can: $50- $60 week for foodÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Shave the gas money to one fill per month - $80.This means *gasp* walking if itâs gettinglow. Easier now that itâs slightly warmer and staying light a bit later.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Can I get away with putting $70 onto the hydrobill, rather than $90?How will you allot your     spending this month?Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Cats. Theyâre continually hungry (imagine!),plus Dinahâs specialty diabetic food. Iâve upped my budget for them from $80 to$100 per month.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As above, cut the gas budget from $150 p/month âwhich Iâm not sure Iâve ever hit anyway â to $80. I have a friend visiting fora few days and will likely use a bit more than normal, but hopefully Iâll beable to keep it to just one fill regardless.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Be diligent about making lunches and breakfast daily.Itâs working well so far, so I think lowering the grocery budget is feasible.Besides, how much food can one person eat anyway? (Answer: youâd be surprised!)4. Track your purchases!Doing well with this, so it shouldnât be hard tocarry on. I now have a little notebook to mark my purchases in. It was an oldone hanging around at work, so I asked if I could have it. FREE! J5. Are there any âexemptionsâ for the monthÂ I have a $150 payment I need to make, plus atleast two dinners out with friends. I go out for dinner very rarely, so thiswill be a treat for me. I still have to make sure I donât go overboard with themeal, though, so I'll budget $20 for each of those.Â Chiropractic appointment(s). I will get 80% backfor these, so that money can get rolled back into a budget at some point.Hereâs how the Decluttering challenge will work:1. There will be 4 main challenges for the month. I pick thetheme, you pick the challenge!Week One: Personal Space ChallengeItâs all my personal space, but I will concentrate on the 2ndbedroom as thatâs where I spend a lot of time. Itâs my office and thereâs stillâstuffâ I can finally let go of cluttering a corner. Can probably also findmore stuff on the computer to delete.Week Two: Family Space ChallengeAs above, itâs all my personal space, but the living roomcould still use a declutter, although thereâs not much left to get rid of. Oldmagazines, a board game Iâve never used, DVDs Iâve never watchedâ¦Week Three: Productivity ChallengeWhat? The above isnât enough?! Iâm not really sure yet.I can improve productivity in many (most!) areas of my life, so perhaps it will show upon its own as Iâm purging, cleaning, decluttering, etc. What Iâd LIKE to see ismore time spent doing creative things: drawing, writing, knitting, etc., ratherthan sitting down in front of the computer or TV to unwind. Spend time withhorses?Week Four: The âDreadedâ ChallengeHmm. Kitchen? I have lots of stuff in the pantry andcupboards that I donât use or need, so will count that.2. Bonus Challenges!Looking forward to these!3. Purging!!Iâve already started collecting a bag of things, plus a pileof books. This is a work in progress. I will be taking the books to the secondhand store for either credit or cash (or both â I donât know what the optionsare). The âthingsâ vary and I could probably sell at least some of them online, but is it worththe cost of mailing them. I may have to sign back on to Facebook and use thebuy, sell, trade site that has worked well for me in the past. This is not theideal option, so I may end up just donating it all instead. Weâll see.4. The Proof is in the pudding!Comparatively, I donât have a lot of clutter, so not sure photoswould be all that useful as the only one who would really notice is me. But Iwill anyway, to stick with the spirit of the challenge.So. I guess we're rolling... :)"},
{"title": "February challenge, January update AND Sunday chit-chat", "date": "Sunday 29 January 2012", "text": "I've committed to both of Carla's challenges in February because, why not? Why not challenge myself to another low/no-spend month PLUS a good old declutter? The biggest challenge for me will be to figure out what I want to tackle, savings-wise: do I want to bump up my EFund or continue to pay down my debt? Plump up the vet or travel accounts or focus on the VISA card?The final week of January hasn't been a great no-spend, but it wasn't frivolous - at least, not for the most part!Jan 25: Robbie Burns day! :)$5.38 for tea & a cocoa macaroon$3.85 tea & bagel at Tim Horton's$10 co-worker for 5 tickets for fund-raising draw$5 co-worker for another co-worker's good-bye giftJan 26:$11.86, bag of nuts (organic and very delicious, but yes, very expensive.

Still can't quite get my head around the fact it's almost $70 worth and that's IT. Even with 30% off the meat. I have two packages of cheese there which is $13, so perhaps that's part of it. I love this PC extra-aged cheddar! Let's see what the damage actually was:1 kg NN hone - $8.982 pkgs cheese @ 6.79 ea: $13.58 (regularly $7.99)Brown sugar: $2.99Roasted red pepper hummus (400 g): $5.79Sandwich bags: $2.9850' aluminum foil: $3.792 pkgs rice cakes: $2.48 ea (I generally buy organic, so these are a couple of dollars cheaper)chicken 1: $10.98 (less 30%)chicken 2: $10.72 (less 30%)So. I can definitely do better in some respects. And I'm sure there are those of you out there who are asking, \"What? No fruit or veggies?\" Well...I have a bunch of apples already at home, and I'm currently trying to eat my frozen veggies, but I'm really (!!) bad at actually eating what produce I buy, so I limit it. Comparatively it's cheaper, but sometimes not by much.Sunday chit-chat.What are youâ¦Reading?Â  Finishedreading âThe Girls Who Went Awayâ last night, so I have to figure out what Iwant to read tonight. I borrowed âEnough Alreadyâ by Peter Walsh from the library,so I think I might start that to get me in the right frame of mind for CarlaâsFebruary declutter challenge. Iâve read a previous book of his and liked it âalthough parts werenât applicable, like the chapters on kids - so I thought Iwould probably enjoy this one, too. I gave up on the âMoney Drunk, Money Soberâ one and took itback to the library.Watching? Â The usual âDIY/HGTV. JListening to?Â  Nothing specialthis week.Cooking/Baking?Â  Iâmalready trying to decide what Iâm going to have for dinner and havenât hadbreakfast yet! :PHappy you accomplished this week?Â  The final exam for my writing course. Â I lost motivation about halfway through. It wasnâtawful, just not quite what I was hoping for. A good clean of the apartment. Looking forward to next week?Â The start of the February challenges and figuring out what I want tostrive for! J Returninga book to the college and getting a $45 refund (need to find my registrationform for this).Thankful for today?Â  Dinah(my diabetic cat) is doing very well. I took her to the vet yesterday afternoonto get her glucose levels checked. Theyâve fallen back into the normal range(13.5 as of yesterday, from a high of 20.8 last week), which Iâm very pleasedabout. So two injections a day, plus her diabetic diet, is working well. Whoo!! Finally - updatesfor âAngry Birds!â And free, so even better. JAfter coming back from the vet, I spent most of yesterdayafternoon rearranging my living room. Itâs a small space and my furniture is abit too big for it. It wasnât an awful initial arrangement, but it seems youhave to live with something for a while before you see how it might workbetter. I moved a bookshelf, switched the sofa & loveseat locations, etvoila! Itâs actually cosier than it was PLUS I can finally use the electricfireplace that came with the suite. Â Itworks great and I can hopefully keep the electric bill down a little by usingthat instead of the baseboard heating.While I was at it, I swept and mopped the floors, vacuumedthe rug and the bedrooms and dusted (almost) everything. I still have to cleanthe bathroom, but that will get done another time. I was too pooped to do itall in one day!I had a phone call from my brother in the UK, too. Itâs mymother âs 80th birthday this July and my brother and his partnerwant to make it special for her and her twin sister, who lives out east. I washaving a bit of an issue with this mostly because I feel obligated to attendfor obvious reasons, but was thinking itâs either this or the UK trip.Realistically I canât do both in the short time Iâve allotted for travel. Mybrother - being the swell guy that he is - offered to pay for my flight toOntario so that I could attend the birthday and not jeopardize my UK trip nextyear in the process. I didnât say yes right away, but Iâm definitely consideringit. It would mean I could get Outside for a trip â perhaps spend a few extradays in and around Toronto visiting a friend or tagging along with him and hispartner to Montreal (I heart Montreal). If I do it, I can just add in the costof the ticket to my overall costs next year. Hmm. Really, it would be silly notto take him up on this wouldnât it?Iâm looking into the deferred leave program through work andbrought home a couple of paystubs to play with to see if it would be a worthwhileundertaking. Then I had the brilliant idea of just trying this on my own to seeif I could do it for several months before I make the decision to officially signup. You can take a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of one year off and mostpeople take 3 years or so to put the money aside. Iâm just not sure I can waitthat long, but itâs all a matter of priorities isnât it? Iâm playing with thepercentages (up to 10%) to see what would be comfortable for me. I have to alsotake into consideration my debt payments as well as my RRSP & EFundcontributions, so I have to take the maximum I can without leaving myself strugglingand âdestitute.â If I start on my own, I can adjust as I go, save more or lessas the mood strikes, but once I make a decision with the work program, Iâmstuck with the amount I choose, so a trial run, so to speak, might be a goodidea.This might be my February challenge, actually..."},
{"title": "One of those days...It's going around!", "date": "Wednesday 25 January 2012", "text": "Well, it appears several of us have had rather trying days today. Is it a full moon by chance? My day was a rather high-anxiety one and this bothers me because I never used to have anxiety.I'm the focus of an unwelcome crush at work. The fellow in question is a homeless alcoholic and is more often than not drunk when he comes in. He never touches, never makes inappropriate gestures, but always has makes a point of asking me if the clocks are right and what the time is. This doesn't seem like a big deal, but it started last summer sometime. He'd been AWOL for months and one day lurched in, loaded to the gills, and proceeded to hover and harass and not leave me alone. Once bitten, twice shy, as the saying goes and just his presence now is enough to get my anxiety working overtime. Plus, because of the redesign, I have nowhere to hide - we're wide open to the public now. I mentioned this to my supervisor, but it's difficult to know what to do. It's a public building and anyone can come and go as they please. Banning people is next to impossible. I said I would really like an off-desk job, but it's not like you can schedule that around these visits because you just never know when he's going to be in. What can you do? I dislike having my heart race every time I hear the front door open and spending my whole day wondering when he'll arrive, leaving me anxious and tetchy with everyone else.Perhaps my energy is focused on the wrong thing or the wrong way?Anyway, that kept my heart rate at a high rate for most of the day, even though he was only in for a few minutes this morning. Â Like I said, I've never had anxiety before, but I don't like this feeling one bit. The feeling of having to look over my shoulder all the time (so to speak) does nothing to make me enjoy my time at work. This is part of the reason I'm continuing to look for something else.It doesn't help that I've not been sleeping well for the past couple of months, either. Two or three solid nights sleep in the past 6 or 7 weeks. I'm just feeling exhausted and we all know that game, right?Then when I stopped for milk this evening on my way home I saw my ex (I don't think he saw me; if he did, he didn't say anything). *Sigh* Rush of anxiety. Why? I don't know. It's been two years for crying out loud. He's moved on, blah blah blah...There's something(s) I'm resisting or not doing.But what good happened today?bananas for my oatmeal for the next few days! $3.72did the dishes when I got home. I'm doing well with getting them done quickly instead of leaving them for days...back to one of my regular tasks at last! I've been desperate for something to do since we reopened and I'm so glad to have my main task backthe weather is at a balmy -17C. Lovely after a frigid week!I'm going to enter a writing contest that could win me a trip to Frankfurt, Germany! :)I guess it's all in how you look at it. I'm going to change into my pajamas now and watch \"Consumed\" on HGTV. Terrific show and I'm learning good lessons from it.Have a good evening all."},
{"title": "Sunday night chit-chat", "date": "Sunday 22 January 2012", "text": "What are youâ¦Â  Reading?Â  âMoney Drunk,Money Soberâ by Julia Cameron and Mark Bryan. A 90-Day program to get youâsoberâ about your money. You first identify your particular money addictionand acknowledge it, then work through the program day by day to repair theissues. I picked it up (at the library) because I thought it could help mefocus a bit better, but itâs just okay. Iâm going to read the whole thing, seehow I feel about it, and then see if doing the program will actually help memore than I think.Â âThe Girls Who WentAwayâ by Ann Fessler. This was a book that came through the library as arequest from another library. It looked interesting, so I bought it from Amazonwith a gift card I got for Christmas. Itâs about girls in the years before âRoevs Wade,â who were made to give up their babies for adoption and the shame,guilt and societal backlash they got in exchange â as well as well-meaning but misplacedadvice like âmove on and forget about it.â The author is herself one of thosebabies and it was a conversation with another woman â once one of âthose girlsââ that got her thinking that no one had ever asked these women how they felt about this. The focus hasalways been on the children who were given up. This book is Annâs way of comingto terms with her adoption, the reasons behind it and meeting her birth mom forthe first time.âA Beautiful Blue Deathâ by Charles Finch. A Victorianmystery set in London concerning a servant who dies after ingesting a veryunusual, but particularly deadly, poison. The (unofficial) detective is anupper-class gentleman who uses his connections to help solve the case. Iâm onlyabout a third of the way in, but itâs beautifully written and very engaging.Watching? DIY/HGTV. I love most things that concernconstruction (which, yes, includes cute tradesmenâ¦*ahem*â¦sue me). I still havethe Jackie Chan movie to watch as well as âBridesmaids.â I bought the latteroff Amazon for $10 with the gift card I got for Christmas.Listening to?Â  My usualâTop 25.â I am not brave when it comes to music, however, Iâm glad I made thechoice to purchase Adeleâs â21â from iTunes last year. Sheâs simply amazing andhugely talented. I havenât heard a voice that beautiful for many years.Cooking/Baking?Â  I madeapple cinnamon bran muffins (a mix), so I will have a snack at work for thenext week or so. Otherwise, Iâm trying to attack whatever is in the fridge andempty some containers and shelves. Not leftovers, per se, but stuff that needsto be eaten and done with so that I can refresh a few things after payday.Happy you accomplished this week?Â  My first English assignment (which wasnâtdifficult) plus I was one of a few to get an extra mark because the instructorhad posted to wrong assignment on the wrong week. J Despite quite a spendyweek, it was all â apart from my visit to Timmyâs â necessary stuff. I amfinding I spend a HUGE amount of money on food, so I need to look at that. Ihave, however, been shopping (mostly) to my lists, so thatâs an improvement.Menu planning would help, but Iâm hampered by the fact that I have a small fridge freezer (already stuffed) and itâs just me. A small, separate freezer would help, though,as it means I could cook less, which would be great because I donât like tocook anyway.Iâve started looking at things to declutter again. Thereâs alittle murmur out there about this right now, and I figured Iâd add my voice toit. I did really well on this during the late summer/early fall last year, butbit by bit, Iâve started âcollectingâ stuff again and I can really use themotivation to get myself going again. I started with my fridge and got rid of afew things, but thereâs still much to do there. This morning I cleaned anddeleted a few things off my computer that were cluttering that up. At thebeginning of the month I went through my emails and unsubscribed to quite a fewthings, helping keep that much tidier as well. That felt great!Looking forward to next week?Â More of the same. Paying more attention to where Iâm falling down withmy intentions as well (eating better, spending, making time for things I enjoy,etc).Thankful for today?Â  Thatmy diabetic cat seems to be doing a bit better. After her vet visit on Fridayafternoon, sheâs up to 2 insulin injections per day to see if that helps theglucose levels balance better. Also, the other diabetic food that she was on â whichwas making her vomit (TMI?) â has been switched back to the original stuff andthere have been no problems so far. Sheâs even eating her proper diabetictinned food again, which is a real relief. So while it was an additionalexpense I wasnât anticipating, Iâm thankful for the skilled and caring vets andstaff at the clinic I take her to. Thereâs a reason theyâre quickly becomingthe âgo toâ clinic in town.That I met a good friend for coffee this afternoon. Itreated myself to a tea and a breakfast Panini (which was disappointing) andspent an hour or so in excellent company. Sheâs a lovely woman and I value thetime she takes to spend with me; sheâs very inspiring and full of great advice.I passed along an item of mine that I thought her 5-yr old son would like. WhenI was down south last year I went to IKEA (DANGER! DANGER!) and picked up manythings, among them this item,which I thought would be really fun on my wall. Only itâs a ceiling light (theyhad it up on a wall at the showroom, hence my confusion). At any rate, itâsbeen sitting in my living room ever since, so I passed it along to my friend whosaid her son will love it."},
{"title": "A memory of Cornwall", "date": "Saturday 21 January 2012", "text": "(photo courtesy of Cornwall Online Holidays)This is a photo of Praa (pronounced 'pray') Sands, Cornwall, just outside of Helston, and about a half hour walkÂ from where my grandparents used to live;Â down the lane, past farms and across the moors and finally past an old, collapsed tin mine. SFTÂ has that beautiful photo of the Cornish coast on her page and it's just got me wistful and somewhat homesick the past few days.My grandparents raised my dad and his brother here after moving from Portsmouth just before the war. My uncle remembers days when the two of them would be gone from home for hours, and a time when they discovered a fridge washed ashore and full of butter! A real coup at the time when everyone was restricted to rations.After spending the war in the Mediterranean, my grandpa was the Reverend at Breage for thirty years - I remember going to church once when we were visiting - but the majority of my memories centre around this beautiful stretch of sand. As a family we'd spend hours and hours there, my grandma having baked goodies and made sandwiches for all of us. There was a shop just off the beach at the far end, where we'd buy ice cream on occasion (the \"P\" for parking at the far left of the map below), but we were happy to just swim, poke around the rock pools and play with abandon.Breage Parish Church.My grandparents are both buried here, but not together. :( As grandpas was a vicar, he was interred in a special area with the previous vicars. Grandma, apparently, was \"just\" his wife. I find this sad. Grandpa knew when he was 14 & grandma was 12 that he would marry her and they almost 70 years together. Not many can say that these days.The last time I was here was 1993 and then only briefly with my sister. When I'm in the UK next year, I am going to make sure I visit and stir up some memories.This is a map area:We would walk down Rinsey Lane (they lived just south of Rinsey village) to the coast path (red line) and across the moors to the beach from there. Grandpa always insisted we stick to the path because the area is riddled with mine shafts from the old tin mines that dot the region and the earth is very unstable. There is actually an old tin mine at Rinsey Head.(thank you cornwall365.co.uk)The name of this mine - I've just learned - is Wheal Prosper. There are all kinds of photos of it on the web, some very lovely. From the looks of it, there are now paths down to the mine and around it, but grandpa never let us stray far.I have been very homesick for the UK for several years now. I wasn't born there, but I have citizenship and am only one generation removed. Perhaps it's because all my memories of time spent there as a kid were happy ones with grandparents (except for grumpy grandpa Wallace...) and cousins and aunts and uncles, visiting the farm in Hertfordshire where my mum grew up, this beautiful area my dad called home...This has nothing to do with finances, but it just struck me that I needed to keep focused on my goal for next year and this has helped with that. I hope you enjoyed the visit..."},

{"title": "This 'n that", "date": "Thursday 19 January 2012", "text": "I'm at home for a second day today with a sore back. This particular issue comes and goes and hasn't been a problem for quite some time, but it reared its ugly head yesterday just before I went to work. My back - \"seizes\" is the best word - from time to time between my shoulders, just at the base of my neck. I can't turn my head or lift my arms above my shoulders; particular movements seem to make it worse, like driving. It used to last for days regardless of what I'd do, but the past couple of times has only been a day or two, which is...better.I took an Extra-Strength Tylenol but it didn't help, so I came home instead. Sitting, standing and doing lots of things that would just exacerbate the problem didn't seem like the best way to spend my day. I've been sitting on a ball at my desk at home for about a month and apparently it's been great for my back. It has helped my posture (which is poor) to the point that switching back to a chair the other day was, I believe, the root cause of my back problem yesterday. I'm back on the ball and it's helping immensely. I have a chiropractic appointment lined up for Saturday morning, and that should help as well. An unexpected cost, but not outrageous at $40, so I'm okay with that extra expense this month.I'm certain a new bed would also help, so I'm going to start looking at prices for a mattress set. The Brick had an excellent Boxing Day Sale, but I don't want to finance anything unless I can put a dent in it right away, regardless of the length of the \"Don't Pay\" incentive. My bed is okay for now, but is already third-hand and its best years are long behind it.The temperatures are doing some fancy footwork over the next couple of weeks. Environment Canada is generally more accurate, but the Weather Network has longer term forecasts posted - just to make us miserable ahead of time! And we've actually just gone DOWN a degree to -39C this morning...Because we use more gas at this time of year, it's important to always have a full tank. I was down to a quarter tank by Monday and even though I don't venture out of town during the winter, you never want to get stuck without enough gas, just in case, particularly with frigid temperatures. I'm glad I got an oil change last week, too, and the fluids checked.My spending since the 14th looks like this:Jan 15: No spend!Jan 16: Gas $62.69 (49.749L @ 125.9L). It generally costs me about $75 to fill from empty and I try to fill only once a month. Because I'm lazy, my \"commute\" to work is all of 7 minutes (= 40 mins walk). Once the temperatures go up and the light stays a bit later, I'll be walking. My goal is to drive as little as possible during the summer. I'll have to get my bike tuned up for that challenge, so will budget for that accordingly.Jan 17: $6.96 4L milk (I was surprised, too. I generally pay about $4.59) and $3.80 for a bagel and tea for breakfast at Tim Horton's. My first visit this year! I decided I needed a treat.Jan 18/19: No spend!Tomorrow I have to take my cat to the vet for a glucose test to check her levels and see if an adjustment is needed for her insulin shot. She's doing \"okay,\" but not great. She's still thin and listless, although her appetite has moderated, which is positive. She's vomiting a lot, though, which is not, although this may have something to do with her change in food...One of my favourite book genres out there these days is the memoirs of those who have undertaken a year-long challenge of one sort or another. There's a particular name for it, but I can't remember what it is. Gretchen Rubin mentions it towards the end of her wonderful \"Happiness Project,\" which I loved. \"A Year Without Made in China\" and \"Not Buying It\" were a couple of the first ones I read, several years ago, and there are a number of them devoted to not spending. This is something I would really like to do, so I'm going to have a think and see what I can come up with. Stay warm out there!We're all doing so well on our January challenge! I'm enjoying following everyone's progress, it's really motivating.Looking forward to the same in February... ;)"},

I got my wish, because this is what our week looks like:http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/CAYT0019It's supposed to go up a smidge and then right back down next week, too. What it doesn't mention for today is the heavy ice fog that's obliterating the valley. Most times it burns off by early afternoon, but sometimes it hangs over town all day. Terrible stuff for vehicles - and people! About midway down the page are some photos of what ice fog looks like - it's essentially just 'regular' fog, but frozen. Brrrr!Stay warm everyone!My first \"Sunday Night Chit-Chat\" posting. What a great idea to wrap up the week! Thanks Carla. :)What are youâ¦Â Reading?Â âLove WillTear Us Apartâ by Sarah Rainone. A Nick Hornby-esque book about a group of 4twenty-somethings reconnecting at a wedding for two high school friends. The collective dislike of the bride & groom â and their reasons behind it - comes out as youfollow each personâs story. Each chapter is a different character and \"named\" for a song.Watching?Â âThe Return of Sherlock Holmesâ on DVD (although not as enthusiastically as I thought I would, despite Jeremy Brett as Holmes) &almost anything on the HGTV & DIY networks. Since my new landlady got satellite installed when she arrived in October, I'm afraid I've been a slave to the remote...Friday night I watched âCloudy with aChance of Meatballs.â I love animated movies and hadn't yet seen this one. I have âNice Guyâ starringJackie Chan lined up for some time this week, too. I [heart] Jackie! Adorable AND a kung fu master.Listening to?Â Â âTop25â on my iTunes playlist. Not very interesting, as this is what I *always*listen to.Cooking/Baking?Â Â Butterchicken with rice (although this is technically leftovers). Plotting the best way to use up a bunch of overripeÂ bananas.Â My last creative effort was a raspberry lemonmousse cake for New Yearâs Day. It's a fussy and slightly frustrating recipe, but well worth the effort once it's completed. I switched the gelatin for agar agar, the vegetarian/vegan alternative, as I'm trying to avoid anything that has to do with (dead) horses in that respect. That also means most yogurts are out, as many of them contain gelatin. This is ongoing, although how I would replace glue is a bit of a conundrum...Happy you accomplished this week?Â Â No un-necessaryspending, and a big dent in my VISA debt: almost $500 this month - already!Looking forward to next week?Â Â Much of the same: more no-spend days;continue making breakfast and lunch daily; keeping my âeyes on the prizeâ asthe saying goes and aiming for my base 2013 travel fund by the end of the year.Thankful for today?Â Â Itâs -36C outside. I am thankful my cats and I have a warm, safe andcomfortable place to live. That I have the best landlady E.V.E.R. And that you guys have welcomed me back sowarmly after a lengthy silence.

{"title": "Spend/no-spend update, week 2", "date": "Sunday 15 January 2012", "text": "Time for an update to stay accountable to this challenge! So far I believe I'm doing very well. I actually cancelled my attendance at a workshop I was going to take tomorrow because I thought the \"suggested donation\" of $30 would be better spent elsewhere - or not spent at all!It's a chilly -23C here today (-34C with windchill, but let's not count that...), but the sky is clear and blue, and the wind has tapered off somewhat. The temperatures have dropped 20 degrees in two days and the next week or so look to be much the same. Our real winter has arrived at last. While warmer temperatures are nice, it's just not right. The North needs to freeze. Beaches appeal to some, but not to me. Call me crazy, but I prefer the snow and cold of the North, which is why I went up instead of down! At least for now, but I will never willingly go to a beach. That's just not my idea of a good time.Anyway, what does my week look like this week? Let's see:Jan 6: No spend!Jan 7: Brunch with a friend (at her house), which was a lovely two hours spent in excellent company. I stopped while I was out and bought cat food (3 tins) and one box of cat litter for a total of $15.74. I also bought a package of rice cakes for $4.92.Jan 8: I worked today, but have NOT bought lunch during the week so far. I'veÂ been making my own. It helps that there isn't anywhere particularly close-by to buy lunch. You essentially need to bring along lunch and snacks, so it's unintentionally helpful in that respect. On the way home I bought a bunch of bananas: $3.50. Yes,Â that's correct. It is a lot to pay for bananas. :(Jan 9: No spend!Jan 10: No spend!Jan 11: Pay day!Bills paid:Hydro: $90 (I'm on equal payment plan and this, apparently, is my equal monthly payment. I could likely just pay about $60 p/month and still be in a credit over the winter, but I'll revisit this in the spring)Internet/phone: $119.29 (Internet has gone up to $62.95 p/mth; phone is about $35. My internet is ADSL, cable is the same price and no, there's no other supplier)Cell phone: $28.33 (I'm on the bare minimum plan)Oil change: $75.60 (it was time)Groceries: $47.75 (because I was smart and stocked up on dry goods!) What did I buy?4L milk $4.592 loaves bread: $5.98 (for the two; separately $4.99 ea)Pre-made salad: $3.731 english cucumber: $1.98Baby spinach (lg container): $4.482 bunches green onions: $1.78 (0.89 ea)Two yogurt parfaits: $5.986 Ambrosia apples (which are fabulous, btw): $5.71 (1.740 kg @ $3.28 kg)6 Pears: $4.92 (1.330 kg @ $2.82 kg)3 Baking potatoes: $3.33 (1.180 kg @ $2.82 kg)2 red peppers: $4.78 (.545 kg @ $8.77 kg <-- not a typo if you can believe it! Outrageous.)Plus I put $100 into savings!Jan 12: Groceries: $17.51 (dark chocolate coconut ice-cream, frozen peas & corn)Insulin needles: $39.95. I have a diabetic cat and decided that stocking up makes more sense. I bought a box of 100 needles, although it's not really a discount as the individual bags of 10 are $4 apiece. I also queried a charge for the sharps container ($7.25) and it was refunded to me. I have always been under the impression that you just exchange a full one for an empty one; I don't ever recall having to pay for these before, so I'm glad I asked. I put the $7.25 back into my jars and coin containers.Jan 13: No spend!Jan 14: Cat food (diabetic kibble, 8.5lb bag): $46.204 boxes cat litter (15kg ea): $31.96 (I get this from Cdn Tire, as it's the best deal out there, so I stock up when I buy. It's $7.99 for the box, and sometimes it goes on sale at $5.99)8 tins cat food: $29.40 (Holistic Select, 13 oz cans @ $3.50 ea. This is a lot to spend on cat food, but they all eat the same stuff and this is the only type my fussy little Princess will eat anymore. The boys aren't quite so spectacularly fussy...each tin lasts 3-4 days)Paper towels: 8 rolls for $4.97, which is actually a great deal! I'll have paper towel for months now.My new VISA arrived with less fanfare than anticipated, as I forgot it was coming. The number is only 3 digits different than my last one, but I've put it in my wallet anyway. The urge to use it has not struck once since the beginning of the month, so I have hope that I'll be able to continue this no/low-spend challenge through February as well. That would be a huge accomplishment!I've also adjusted the auto-payment on my LOC from $85 bi-weekly to $50, which is just over the minimum. This is so I can focus on paying off the VISA first and fast. I'm comfortable with this and will keep it low for as long as it takes to pay off the CC. Last night I rolled the coins in my piggy-bank and came away with $100! I still have lots of coin to roll and I plan to put it all on my VISA (except $80 US, which will go into my US account in case I visit Alaska again this year).All in all, I'm pleased with my progress thus far. My frame of mind has adjusted itself from \"lack/deprivation\" to \"nurture/plenty\" and it's amazing what a difference it makes. I just have to stay organized and continue making breakfast and lunch a daily habit, as well as having snacks available so that I'm not starving by the end of the day. So simple, yet it's taken me so long to \"get it.\" :)English class starts on Monday; writing course finishes Friday. My sister has given me 2-weeks' homework as well (we're doing coaching sessions on Skype; it's something she's looking at getting into and I thought it would help keep me on track, structured and accountable for whatever I take on this year) and my brother is taking the first step of one of his challenges this year. While I was in Victoria over Christmas, we gave each other challenges to be completed by the end of the year, and we are accountable to each other for their success (or lack of). Mine are to save $1500 - 2K towards a trip to the UK next year and to write and send a book to a publisher in 6 months! My brother's are to take more initiative within his relationship and to audition/play music with people 3 times. We chose to give my sister a challenge to volunteer somewhere that rings true for her, but doing something she wouldn't ordinarily do. These have to be finished by the end of the year, so there's room for some flexibility, but the intent is to do things that are a bit scary because without that, you don't get the same feeling of growth or accomplishment.Â Doing things because you can is fine, but to really push yourself to do better, you need a little bit of scary!"},
{"title": "Update on no-spend January (+ more)", "date": "Friday 6 January 2012", "text": "I'm doing well actually. I've set up a simple calendar on the computer - one of those \"fancy\" downloadable templates - and am marking in whether I spend or not as well as keeping general stuff on it as reminders, etc.When I got back from Victoria in December, and prior to reading Carla's blog entry about her challenge, I stocked up on groceries. I spent slightly over $250. This includes purchases like a giant bottle each of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, 3 bags of rice, 4 tins of beans, some frozen items, a selection of meats (a family size salmon & some ground chicken) and various other non-perishables that will carry me through, and hopefully over, a month. There's a lot of veggies in there, too, but those will obviously have to be replaced regularly.My intention is to not eat out this month, or at least not as often. I whine about how I have no time for breakfast in the morning, but I actually have plenty. I distract myself and choose NOT to make it or lunch. I have no excuses now that I've suspended Facebook for a month. It's a huge time suck and I need to break my addiction. I'm hoping that by the end of the month I'll feel like continuing for another month...then another. I don't want to deactivate it permanently because most of my friends are Outside and overseas and it's nice to be able to drop a little 'hello' here and there to them. It's my own obsession with it that's become the problem, not Facebook itself.So how have I done since January 1?Jan 1: $6.99 for a bottle of Tylenol. I'm not supposed to take Ibuprofen - kidney-related - so bought a bottle of Extra-Strength at one of the only places open New Year's Day. Overpriced for a bottle of 24 tablets.Jan 2: No-spend day. A visit and tea with a friend for a couple of hours.Jan 3: No-spend day #2! I called Visa to claim I had lost my Visa card. This is patently untrue, but is a step to save me from myself. I had the Visa number on Amazon and on FB (I know...) and giving the card to my friend to look after was pointless as I had memorized the number long ago. This way I get a brand new card and once I activate it, I will give it to my friend ASAP to keep hold of. A bit drastic perhaps, but 2011 was a terribly spendy year - although I am very, very happy with everything I got, which includes the long coveted KitchenAid mixer...Jan 4: My dad's birthday. He would have been 81. Another no-spend day.Jan 5: $2.16 mailing a late Christmas present & $26.03 on groceries. This was a bit of a bust in the sense that I left the groceries in the truck while I was at work and the temperature dropped to -12C or so...the milk is fine, the strawberries too, the eggs? Not sure. I put them out on the counter this morning for about an hour, so hoping they're not (still) frozen. I'll find out eventually! The bananas, however, have turned a lovely shade of dark green/black, so instead of going in my porridge, they'll be made into loaves or muffins or something. Oops. Still, I'm happy with the costs as it wasn't outrageous (at least not for here) and the strawberries actually look edible.Today I'm going nowhere and doing nothing but catching up on some things around the house: laundry, dishes, tidying, and completing a lesson in my writing course. Tomorrow morning I'm going for brunch at a friend's house. I need cat food and cat litter, however, so it won't be a no-spend day, and while I'm out I'll take care of the recycling.I mailed off a reimbursement form for some physio sessions I've had through October & November and will be getting approximately $280 back. In October 2010, shortly after my last post, my back went out and I was off work for two weeks. That was about a month after I had my little meltdown at work. So my body was making me do what my mind was only telling me to do - you. need. to. stop.I had some physio sessions but because of how my symptoms presented then, the actual problem didn't get figured out until THIS year when I went back FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. It turns out it's the L2 area of my spine - the nerves had pinched somewhat and the symptoms that took me back this year were different than the last ones. The reason? We moved the library in October & November and had over 3000 boxes to fill, stack, move and unpack; shelves to unload and reload; kitchens to clean, tidy and refill; items to be discarded, deleted and catalogued (and repacked). It was a HUGE job and it took 7 weeks from start to end. All the heavy lifting and twisting I did exacerbated the problem area again and caused me enough problems that I took time off to recuperate about once every 10 days or so. It's getting better, thankfully, in part to daily and multiple trips up and down the stairs at work. As long as the weather stays warm (nice, but definitely oh-so-wrong for this little corner of the world) I'm going to start walking to work by the end of the month, which will help both my overall health and my bank account. This blog did wonders to keep me accountable for things and I've missed a lot by not keeping up to date on your lives & posts. I'm happy to be back.PS: This is the link to the article that I got published last year. It's about my trip to the horse sanctuary in Oregon.

{"title": "Happy New Year!", "date": "Sunday 1 January 2012", "text": "Happy New Year everyone! Here we are on the other side. Hope you all had a great new year's eve, doing what you wanted to do.This is what I did:It's my vision board. I did one back in June that's far more detailed, but that took me ages to finish. I gave myself half an hour on this one, using images from the ones I started collecting at the beginning of the year. There are similar images on the first one, but I thought this was a good time to do another one. I've just hung it up in my office, as I spend a lot of time in here. A perfect place to see it frequently, which is the idea.These are fun to do and there's no recipe for them. Pictures, images and/or words from magazines or any other place that \"speak\" to you, bristelboard or foamboard or even a piece of construction paper, glue, scissors and about an hour of time. The first one I made took me months, literally, as I pondered and thought and finally gave up on it. After my clarifying road trip in May, I finished it quickly and it's hanging over my bed. The intent is to put some daily energy into looking at your vision board and really feeling these things that you want (e.g., money, a fancy car, a holiday, better health, love, etc), so your subconscious takes over and your wants come to be. Basically it's the law of attraction, visually. I ground mine with gratitude - \"thank you\" is in there somewhere.Some times of the year are stronger energetically than others - the soltices, for instance. New Year's is a good time, perhaps your birthday or another significant date that means something to you. Give yourself an hour or two, or really challenge yourself with a 10- or even 15-minute run and see what shows up, but don't think too much on the pieces you're putting down. If it doesn't speak to you, put it back and try another one.Don't think, just do, as the saying goes.Health, happiness, joy, success and abundance to everyone in 2012!"},
{"title": "2012 is here already!", "date": "Saturday 31 December 2011", "text": "Where does the time go? Seriously? Here I was in October, 2010, minding my own business, and all of a sudden 2011 is over. Scary!Anyway, this year was financially awful. Truly. Right from the get-go I was spending like...well, like I had a lot of money to spend. I was about $3K from being completely out of debt and I'm now more than $7500K in debt again. 2012 is going to be a challenge for sure. Where did I spend it all? Let's see...Two courses, one each in Jan & Feb. Another in October.A month-long, 8800 km road trip in May (although this was, mentally & emotionally, priceless). Best thing I E.V.E.R. did for myself. Also did a 4-day course during this time. But spend, spend, spend...oh my...Books...generally. And many.I'm currently registered for two more classes at the college, and although education is never a waste, it IS expensive initally.Backed into a fence and had a $1400 bodywork repair bill to the truck, plus had to replace the taillight assemblies (one got broken on my trip in May, so they replaced that one for me too. The other got busted in the Fence Meets Car moment). *Sigh*Joined, then cancelled, eHarmony (total waste of $) after less than a month.One of my cats is diabetic and was at the vet 4 times in two weeks before I went away for Christmas. *Sigh* Poor little princess.Physio sessions, And likely a whole lot of other stuff, including a trip to Victoria for Christmas, which was mostly covered by a flight credit, so wasn't QUITE as bad as it could have been, but didn't account for all the other spending I did while I was there. Ahem.Despite all this spending madness, I am feeling quite accomplished this year, actually. I've worked hard at decluttering the apartment and while that's still ongoing, I've made much progress. I had a wonderful visit from a friend I haven't seen in 13 years and a trip to lovely Juneau, Alaska with her. I've taken some really interesting courses: Reiki, BodyTalk, photography, am currently doing a writing course and taking an English class starting in January. I made my first Vision Board. Volunteered for a couple of days at a horse sanctuary and drove up the breathtaking Oregon coast with a friend. Spent a month driving from Whitehorse to Vernon to Victoria and Vancouver and Oregon and back. Reconnected with old friends and made several new ones. Got another cat. Stepped off the Humane Society Board. Was published. Moved an entire library. Read a lot. Learned a LOT. (Not kidding).I've had \"awareness\" bells going off like mad all year, so the work I've been doing since the beginning of the year is paying off (reading, energy work, paying more attention to things). Last January I gave myself a year to see what I could accomplish, like taking on New Year's resolutions. People do it because it's a significant time in the year and one that can be counted. By the end of March, I was once again feeling low, so instead decided that my birthday was going to be the start of this plan. It's a significant date - probably more so than New Year's - and so I have another 4 months ahead of me to accomplish things and be within my goal.Goals for 2012 include:Saving $1500 - $2K towards a trip to the UK in 2013Paying off my credit card in full (again...did this once already this year...*blush*)Paying my line of credit down to $2500 and capping it at this amountEFund at $1000Couch to 5KWriting a book and sending it to a publisher within 6 months (this is a challenge my brother set for me)Spending more time with my friends instead of alonePracticing BodyTalkChoosing 4 or 5 charities and contributing monthly to their work (PlanCanada, WSPA, WWF, that sort of thing)Exercise more. But start slow.Oh, yeah. I'm going to suspend my Facebook account, too. Starting tonight. It's a huge time suck and I need to break that addiction.There are more, but I've got them scattered in several lists. They're all pretty good - I think - and some are ones that can be used as a springboard for next year (e.g. EFund can go to $2K or $2500 next year). I'm going to follow Carla's no-spend 2012 in January and see what sort of jumpstart that gives me on the year: http://halfdozendaily.blog.com/no-spend-2012/. Good luck to all those following along! :)Anyway, that's a nutshell update for this year. Wishing you all a safe, happy, healthy and fun 2012 from the North! See you on the other side! :)"},

Two places I've got my eye on are STILL for sale! One for going on four months, the other at least two. Both are now the same price. They're also in the same trailer park (court?), so are comparable properties, size-wise and cost-wise. I'm already thinking what I would offer: $10K less than current asking price which, according to the on-line mortgage calculator, would give me a monthly mortgage of between $250 & $420 (depending on amortization). I'd have to add in pad rent, plus utilities, plus maintenance costs, plus heating, so it wouldn't necessarily be that much cheaper than what my current costs are, but it would be MINE. Until I'm out of debt, however, I can't take the risk to look. I'm a super-impulsive person (although not as bad as I used to be!) and I have a sneaking suspicion I'd walk away a new home owner if I went to look. So I'm going to stay away and just keep my eyes open. I need to have more money for a down payment, plus a more substantial EFund in place before I rush into something like that."},
{"title": "This & that", "date": "Saturday 2 October 2010", "text": "I have a list of things to do today, my day off. This isn't technically one of them, but it's been a while since I've updated, so I thought I'd write up a quick post and update.Got a steal of a deal at work yesterday! I saw a carpet that was destined for \"scrap\" (i.e. trash) and asked about it. It was a return for one reason or another (possibly defective?) and at first glance it looked in perfect shape, so I asked the GM about it. He asked if I was sure I wanted it, not (really) knowing what could be wrong with it. I said 'yes.' So he gave it to me for $10!! These sell for $125 - $150, so I'm thrilled. And it will go very nicely with the new furniture set. Perhaps all the reasons it was returned will show up once I get it unrolled, but it just seemed like such an enormous waste of goods.Put the snow tires on the truck, too. We had 12cm of snow last weekend (!!) and although it all melted in a day or so, I decided to not press my luck this year and put the tires on early. It's going to be a cold one this year. It's been a gorgeous autumn, though, and the lovely weather is continuing, but you can definitely feel the chill in the air, particularly in the mornings.The new position at the 2nd job is going well. I'm finally beginning to feel like I understand what I'm doing. Lots of details (and I'm not really a detail person), so it's been a quite exhausting few weeks while I get myself up to speed on all this. I like it, however, and being off the floor is a definite plus.The new vehicle is on hold for the time being. I sent them the money to cover the truck cost last week and then heard from my friend yesterday that their son was in a car accident here and had to be airlifted to Vancouver. He had surgery for a broken neck on Tuesday. So, I sent them a note hoping things went well for him. The truck will be here when it's here. It's not important right now. I don't want to hear anything about it, actually, until their son is in the clear. Awful news!My German class officially started yesterday, so I have to make sure I make & take the time to review, study and learn. At least I have the opportunity to practice, too. There are two others at work who speak German, so we said that next time we're all working together, we'll have a German night.There's a knitting group that meets at the library - I think once a month - that I might look into joining. It's quite casual, but could be quite motivating.Currently watching \"All Creatures Great & Small\" S4. Enjoyed the first three seasons, although it's a bit slow (comparatively at least), but now the actress who played his wife in the first three seasons has changed and it brings a totally different feel to it, as do the two children who have suddenly appeared. The last season ended with him going off to London to join the war.Am going for a craniosacral adjustment on Tuesday afternoon. I slammed my hip against the service counter at work a couple of weeks ago and I must have hit it harder than I thought because last week I could barely sit, stand for long periods of time or lift things. I suppose it bruised the pelvis, or knocked it out of line or something. Anyhow, the craniosacral adjustment is supposed to help bring everything back in line. It's similar, I suppose, to chiropractic in that it's a physical adjustment, but it's far less...physical. Just subtle realignment using energy and gentle turns and realignments. It's more expensive, but I love trying new alternative medicine, so thought I would give it a shot.I've been working too much and had a bit of a meltdown at work last weekend. I do have some time off coming up which will really help, but it confirmed that lack of sleep, poor eating, early starts, new jobs and not using my downtime properly does have a negative affect on the body. I need to take much better care of myself and get out of debt sooner rather than later, so that I can go back to one job.The debt, however, IS coming down! I owe $625 for the furniture (down from $1500 in August) and am down to $3650 on my LOC. I stopped my auto-savings for the time being, allowing me to put an extra $240 towards the debt each month, so that's really helping. This month is a 5-paycheque month for me, so I will be able to make more big dents. It's very motivating to see the amounts drop so much each week.I have to stop my procrastinating now and get this place tidied up, re-organized and cleaned. It's looking a bit thrown together and I need to get it organized, as well as do a vacuum, the dishes, some German, and a laundry. It's a lot to do in a day, but needs to be done. Grocery shopping will wait until tomorrow after work. I also need to try and get a little caught up with everyone's blogs...Have a great weekend everyone!"},
{"title": "New debt and old debt", "date": "Saturday 18 September 2010", "text": "Today was payday from the p/t job. I got over $500!! I thought it was a mistake at first, but then remembered how much extra I've been working while I've been learning a new position.Last month I was offered the chance to be a cash balancer and I jumped at the opportunity to learn something new and move off the floor. I'll still be a cashier, but the majority of my time will be spent balancing cash, entering invoices, getting change for the cashiers, etc. I am happy that I was asked about this, and happier that I can have some time away from the floor. It can get pretty overstimulating out there.Anyway. Today's big cash infusion allowed me to bring down my debt by another $500! PLUS I deposited $176 the other day, which was also earmarked for debt. So definitely some good progress there! My furniture debt now stands at $750 and my LOC at $3650.The new debt comes in the form of a loan from my mother. While she was visiting she was quite adamant that I get a new(er) vehicle. I was reluctant because a) that means more insurance, b) higher gas costs, and c) I love my wee truck! 30-yrs old and still running. That's impressive!However, with winter looming - and it's likely to be a harsh one this year - I admit that safety and reliability are necessities, particularly when our temperatures sink into the -40s. My mother and I agreed that she would loan me the money for a new vehicle and that I would pay her back for it. There's no interest on the loan and I can start paying her back whenever I'm able. She wants me to focus on the interest-bearing loans first, so this is also motivation for me to get those gone as quickly as possible. I want to start paying her back as soon as I can.Today I heard from Prince George, where I'm in contact with a car broker. They've found a 2003 Kia Sorento (135K km) for $8200. The amount of the loan covers this, delivery, registration, new winter tires (I'm hoping), and a chunk towards insurance. I believe the broker gets the car winterized and does a safety inspection. That would cost me about $500 if I did those once I got the car.So, while I shouldn't really be celebrating going deeper into debt, it's not all bad. I can still pay down what I owe, and my mother will rest easier knowing I'm driving a safe vehicle around, instead of one whose heater might not even be working anymore. And I've been noticing that people are turning their heads more often lately - and believe me, it's not because she's some tricked out, sweet looking ride. No, I think the front grill is a bit loose and it \"buzzes\" while she drives. The brakes sound like nails on a chalkboard at every red light, stop sign and pedestrian crosswalk in town. There's an adorable 'rattle' in the engine, and she has the quaint habit of shuddering to a stop when stopped when the temperature dips too low. I need a new headlight; one of the rear light covers is broken; I can only get AM radio; I've had to replace the fuel pump, water pump, battery, a couple of hoses and the hosepipe. There aren't even cupholders!But I really love that truck. She owes me nothing, but I couldn't bear to see her sent for scrap, so I'm going to ask around to see if someone will be able to care for her until I get property and need a little runabout for hauling stuff around.But I'm sure there'll be things about the new truck that I'll come to appreciate, too. :)Magandang gabi!

It started off a bit slowly, but I only have 3 left that I had offered for sale, so I might have to do some weeding again and try to let go of some other ones.

{"title": "Decision made", "date": "Thursday 9 September 2010", "text": "I spent a little time thinking about my financial decision on Monday. On Tuesday I acted on it. I moved $1400 from my EFund (aka Savings) and paid off my Visa and 1/3 of my furniture purchase. The financing is 0% for 8 months, but why wait? I have a comfortable $1K left in the EFund which is sufficient for now - I have an auto transfer of $30 a month anyway, so I'll be building it back up anyway. I'm just very, very sick of debt.I still have a couple of hundred dollars to figure out what to do with and I'm thinking I'll put in on my LOC and knock that down a bit. I don't want to leave myself entirely without savings - just in case - but I am really keen to get this debt gone now. I have a monthly payment that comes off the Visa, so once I've finished typing this, I will be calling to have that cancelled.I've also finished my first afghan strip, so feel quite accomplished. :)It's amazing what several nights of decent sleep will do for you!"},
{"title": "Labour Day weekend...and decisons.", "date": "Sunday 5 September 2010", "text": "A long weekend at last! For what it's worth at least. I'm working most of it, but I'm resigned to that now as I keep digging myself back into debt and it feels like I'm going to be doing it forever. Again. But no, I need to make some decisions this weekend (financial) that will hopefully force me to sit up and take more serious notice of my debt and its constant presence in my life.Last month I bought new furniture. Did I NEED new furniture? Not necessarily and I most definitely didn't need to finance it. But I did that, too. I don't regret it, as I am far more comfortable and relaxed at home. But it took me a definite step backwards with respect to getting myself out of debt.My sister is currently on her way to Edinburgh for school. She arrived in London today and is staying with my brother before she heads north. I am immensely homesick for the UK and this is just making it worse. Although \"homesick\" isn't necessarily the proper word, it feels like that, even though it's been almost 20 years since I've set foot in the UK. Way too long, but it's been very, very strong this year, this pull and now I'm more determined than ever to visit before much longer.I'm just feeling very mixed up and frustrated with respect to what I want and what I need. Monday is my first day off in just over two weeks, so I have a lot of things to do. Some housework, some school work and lots of thinking. I know this has to do with the fact that I'm just tired from working 7 days a week, but I'm still going to do it because it needs to be done.On a more positive note, I got my German class last week and have been looking it over all ready. It's going to be a challenge for sure, but I'm really looking forward to it and my friends are willing to help, too, so that's a huge bonus for me. I need to do well on this, as I've paid for it and if I pass, two-thirds of the course will be paid back to me through work! That's a huge incentive, too.My mother was here for a visit, too, and while it rained the whole time she was here, she did accomplish something I never thought possible: she taught me to knit! We got some really lovely wool and needles from the knitting shop in town and after a few tries, I got the hang of it and am slowly working on getting my first ever creation underway. She & I are knitting an afghan, which is a simple project and one that will keep me warm during the winter to boot! I haven't knitted since I was a Girl Guide, and then only for a badge. My sister and I were terrible tomboys and I refused to learn anything remotely \"girly\" for years. However, since the knitting has taken hold - albeit a loose one - I am planning on learning to can next year! I know - whoa, Nelly! But canning time is basically past this year and I have a lot on my plate, so one thing at a time.While my mother was here she also mentioned that she wanted me to get a new(er) car. I love my old truck, however, I realize that it is also not the safest nor the most reliable vehicle on the road. Plus I'm not sure the heater works anymore. Long story short, my mother offered me $10K - a loan! - and I would get myself a new(er) car BEFORE THIS WINTER. Eee! There are a couple at one of the dealerships here that I'm looking at, plus a friend's BIL is a car broker and may have something for me to consider shortly. Anyhow, the pressure is on, a bit, but I can't say I'm entirely unhappy about it.I WILL PAY MY MOTHER BACK. That was the agreement.And I have managed to save enough to pay for a proper will! :) Now I just have to find a lawyer to get it written up properly. I'm really pleased! It seemed to take forever, but I guess it was only about 6 months or so. I can at least cross that off my 2010 goals list! :PI'm rambling now, but hopefully will have a moment to update after the weekend and let you know what I've decided to do. I hope you all have a relaxing, enjoyable weekend!"},

We're taking recipes until the end of the month (possibly a bit longer, depending on how many we have collected to this point) and I would love to have more. I know there were a couple of people who were interested, so I just wanted to send a gentle nudge in their direction.If it helps at all, I've got two recipes from Greta Podleski - one half of the \"Loony Spoons\" and \"Eat, Shrink & Be Merry\" girls - sending me two as well!

It's not a terribly new or original idea, but it will hopefully bring in much needed funds. I've added my contact information on the sidebar, so would love for everyone (and your friends and family, and their friends and family, etc.) to send a recipe or two...or three...for inclusion. Your name in print! :) Advertisers and sponsers are being recruited to pay the production costs and it will hopefully be available for sale by the end of the summer. That's the plan, but as we know, plans do change.Please note \"HSY recipe\" in the subject line, so I know what it's for and I'm not sending lovely legitimate recipes to the trash bin. Thanks so much!! :)In other news, I'm finally feeling like I have a little bit of a routine going. I've been so exhausted the past couple of weeks that I've been going to bed long before 9pm. Although the second job is only 2 days a week, it's still a big adjustment to make from having so much time off (which was, ironically, a big adjustment from working 6 days a week! Funny how that works). On the financial side of things, 3 days a week would be better, but on the life side, it would suck, so I'm actually okay with the two days. I can pick up extra shifts here and there, too. It helps, too, that it's actually not an awful job.The point of this, I have to keep reminding myself, is to PAY OFF THE DEBT. So I can buy a house. I've got myself trained to the point that not dividing up the paycheques into my savings accounts feels wrong - which in itself is not a bad thing - but the PURPOSE is to PAY OFF THE DEBT and I must see that through or I'll just end up in a quagmire of frustration again because it's still hanging around.I did get a cheque for $97.68 from my old insurer, which went into the bank last night, so that's a positive thing. I'll probably put about $50 onto my CC, which is currently over its limit - BOO! -because I registered for a class at the college in the fall - YAY! The 'overlimit' aspect of it is once again making me question whether I should just pay it off in full with my EFund (which sits at a comfortable $2K). I'm not going to worry about it for now, but will make a final decision by the end of the month when I can see how much is left. If I don't have to use a full $1K, so much the better. I have 5 (!) paycheques this month, so I'm sure with proper planning I can reduce it a fair bit.My spending hasn't been too bad lately, to be honest. I've been living (mostly) on my jar cash and only bought lunch once in the past couple of weeks. I do stop at Tim's for tea on most days, but it's once a day and I enjoy it, so consider it part of my bi-weekly allowance spending. I made a monster tuna casserole, too, which covered almost a week's worth of lunches. Having something that's hearty, (relatively) healthy and quick to reheat is particularly important when you only have a half hour lunch. I was having fruit smoothies for breakfast every day, but I've stopped as the influx of sugar (natural or otherwise) has made me break out like mad! Not fun...But I've accomplished some things today and need to accomplish some more before I feel like I've done enough for the day. I met a friend this morning at the grocery store and if the weather holds we're going to go for a walk later on. It's been a bit iffy lately, cool and very windy, unable to make up its mind whether it wants to rain or not.I'm also wanting to put up a photo post of my trip to Dawson two weeks ago. We saw a mama black bear and THREE tiny cubs! Awesome. Also managed to get to Tombstone Park, which is about an hour or two up the Dempster Highway - although 'highway' is a bit of a stretch for what it actually is. Regardless, it was wonderful and I had a great time, despite some awkwardness which had nothing to do with me. Weather: HOT! Company: Excellent. Drive: Loooooonnnngggg...And, for Dawn, here are some random kitty photos:Joey, current foster kitty, lounging in one of his favourite places.One of my previous foster cats, the Utterly Fabulous Hank. You have never met a mellower cat.The lovely Dinah, Princess. Elmo, the most loving cat E-V-E-R. He died last January.And my wonderful Bylaw.Have a great weekend everyone! :)"},
{"title": "A HOUSE!!", "date": "Friday 28 May 2010", "text": "Well...almost. Sort of. I made an appointment at my bank yesterday to go over my investments and whatnot with my account manager, who's a lovely lady. I made a small downward adjustment to my auto-deposit to my TFSA (EFund), inquired about laddering within my RRSP - she said it was a good idea, but not right now with the really low GIC rates, so stick with the mutual funds for the moment - and wanted her opinion on the chances of me getting a mortgage.By myself. Alone. Solo.Apparently, the chances are excellent. 100% to be exact. Now, I did post this over at Facebook yesterday and need to amend that a little bit. I had said \"I can afford\" a house. Not quite. I QUALIFY for a mortgage, which is entirely different. It's not a substantial one ($160K), but it's still a significant amount of money for one person to tackle. What would that get me here? Currently: a small one-bedroom condo or a comfortable 3-bedroom mobile. The mobile is perfect for one person, but most of the mobile homes here cost extra: up to $350 a month extra. That's the pad fee rent, which to me is kind of ridiculous, but there you are. I'm not sure I want to pay for the \"privilege\" of -technically - being able to pick up my house and move whenever I like. Most of the mobile homes these days aren't mobile. But the potential is there and that's what they're charging for. Anyhoo, I'm just keeping my eyes peeled for something that looks worthy of attention although I've already started dreaming and wishing! I might even call up an agent. They are paid to help, but don't get any cash until you actually BUY something, so that's a bit of a bonus. Information is power, after all, and the more information I can get, the better decisions I can make when I'm finally ready.Then of course there are all the maintenance costs, taxes, utilities, etc., to take into consideration, which would be challenging on a part-time salary, no matter how decent the wage happens to be. As it happened, however, that morning I had stopped at Cdn Tire to drop off a resume. They must be desperate for staff because I hadn't even had a chance to finish filling out the application form I was given before I was taken Upstairs for a chat. Ten minutes later, I was back in the parking lot with a new job (you can tell, although they said they would confirm by the end of the day), so things are looking up.I spent $63 on a pair of black pants today, which I need as part of the Cdn Tire uniform (they supply the lovely red shirts) and have already put in a number which I think I should be able to earn every month. I need to use this money properly - to pay down my debt - and start saving for \"house\" stuff, whatever they may be; closing costs, legal fees, furniture, maintenance, etc. I start tomorrow with a few hours training and if I give myself a year, I should be well on the way to meeting my savings goals and, hopefully, a home of my own.MOTIVATION!!!! :)"},
{"title": "YUM! Grocery day", "date": "Friday 14 May 2010", "text": "Since Tuesday I've been on a bit of a smoothie kick, blending up all kinds of fruit and pretty much living on them, for at least the mornings. I make a lot and I have a glass for breakfast, then whatever is left accompanies me to work and I drink it over the course of the day until my break. Why since Tuesday? I'm not sure. I had a wonderful dinner with friends on Friday night (BBQ salmon, rosemary roast potatoes, potato salad, veggies & lemon lavender loaf for dessert) and one mentioned that she was having smoothies in the morning.I have a blender. I have big glasses. I also had some fruit that needed eating, so Tuesday morning I decided to blend one up and take it with me to Day 2 of a course I was taking. I was surprised that it lasted me through the morning and filled me up quite as much as it did. So today I went grocery shopping to replenish my fruit and I really stocked up! I took a $100 bill with me and here's what I got:Shoppers Drug Mart (I love that Shoppers has such an awesome grocery section now)Europe's Best: Frozen peaches 2 x $4.99 (sale): $9.98Sugar (2kg): $2.69Soy Milk x 4: $2.69 ea, $10.76 totalTotal: $23.43Extra FoodsBlackberries: $2.98Raspberries x 2: $5.96Cottage cheese (500ml): $3.79Baking potatoes: $3.06 (1.560 kg @$1.96 kg)Mango chunks (frozen, PC, 600ml) x 2: $10.96Blueberries x 2: $5.96Vanilla parfait (vanilla yogurt, berries) x 2: $6.58Green grapes: $8.40 (1.125kg @ $7.47kg)Ginger root: .23Strawberries (2lb): $3.48Yves veggie groundround (1 reg, 1 Italian, 1 Mexican): $11.97Stevia: $5.69Total: $69.78OtherDish soap (Eco-Max orange): $7.02All total: $100.23I'm very pleased with the total, as the fruit prices are actually reasonable, apart from the grapes, but grapes are always ridiculously expensive. I've paid over $5 for the same sized container of raspberries on most other occasions, so this is great. Here's hoping the prices will remain on the low side for a while yet! It's difficult to find produce throughout the summer when the RVers are here, though. They swoop in, scoop up most of the perishables and staples and disappear and leave us Whitehorsers cursing them as we stare at near empty dairy, bread and produce shelves.Well, I guess they have to eat too, right? RV holidays are pretty tough...ahem...The mail today didn't hold a cheque, but almost as good as one was the news from my old insurer that I'd be getting a refund of $97.38 and to expect a cheque shortly. Hurrah! That will go straight on the VISA card, as it's still hovering too high for my liking (albeit through no fault of its own).Monday & Tuesday I spent at a course about pensions & retirement. Although I'm not close to either one yet (my retirement date, according to my paperwork, is \"N/A\" at this time), it was a very interesting and worthwhile course. It was offered through work. I was surprised, and pleased, to know that our pensions are phenomenal. Not one word of a lie, we have one of the best in the country; some aspects of it just don't exist in other places, so we are very, very lucky. The trainer, a CFP from Toronto, touched on taxes, financial planning and budgeting very briefly as well, which I was pleased about and I came away with some good notes in my book and some questions to discuss with my account manager at the bank.Did you know that if you work you are entitled to claim $232 (2010 amount) to offset employment expenses? I had no idea. There's a line for it on the income tax forms - I don't know which one - so I will definitely be utilizing that next year!When I got back to work on Wednesday I had a bunch of books waiting for me: 11 to be exact! How long it will take me to read them is anyone's guess, but I've managed to complete one already, so that's a good start. They're mostly \"cosy\" mysteries, which I find quite easy and quick to read.Have a good weekend everyone!"},
{"title": "April goes out with a bang!", "date": "Saturday 1 May 2010", "text": "It must be contagious in the blogosphere this month - spending, I mean. Take a look at what I spent just yesterday!$100.56 - Wal-Mart (my principles sell for $20, apparently)$12.59 - Canadian Tire$7.10 - cat milk$9.00 - movie (and a BAD one at that!)$16.00 - dinner (Chinese - lemon chicken)I would like to state for the record, however, that it was all in cash. After a morning of finding various cat stuff around the place (vomit, butt-cleaning marks on the carpet), I decided that what I needed (wanted?) was a mini-steam cleaner, so I went online and checked out a couple of places. I decided on this particular model. Sears - $109.99Can Tire - $99.99Wal-Mart - $79.99Have I mentioned how much I hate Wally World? I was totally prepared to buy the machine at Can Tire, but went to Wally World, just to see. A $20 difference is significant and I wouldn't have changed my mind for $10, so I picked it up. Along with two packages of new undies, which I desperately need (all my favourite ones are full of holes or rips and the elastic is coming through). *Sigh* I did make myself feel better by buying the detergent for the cleaner at Can Tire because IT WAS CHEAPER. So there.The dinner and movie was with friends. We went to see \"Gunless,\" as a friend of mine L-O-V-E-S Paul Gross. It was opening night for it and there were perhaps a dozen of us in the theatre. Not promising. And while I loved \"Due South,\" this was...bad. Really bad. And not in the good way - the bad way.However, on the flip side, I have managed to save myself money in other areas, which I'm quite pleased about:New cell phone plan! I cut my current package in half, so will now be paying only $30 a month instead of $60. This will start May 22. Savings: $360 p/yr!I got an RRSP form from the investment group I have a plan with, but didn't get it until well after I had already filed & paid my income tax. I forgot to change my address with them. Anyway, with this added to my income tax, it means I actually get some money back for a change! Only $63 or so, but hurrah! :) Adjustment form filled out and mailed on Thursday.I switched my car insurance over to a cheaper insurer on Thursday and will save myself $150 a year! I had to pay $54 for a safety inspection and $10 for a copy of my driving abstract from the DMV, but it's worth it to pay $337 a year for insurance. I could even save an extra $24 a year if I chose to remove \"fire, theft, vandalism\" from the policy. I will think about it for next year.Despite the good news, I am once again very frustrated with myself for this spending spree. To the point that I am close to paying off the CC in full with part of my emergency fund as well as putting some of it onto my LOC. I'd leave $1K in the Efund as I auto-save $50 per month, so it would build up again without a problem. I can also move some money from my car account, my planned spends and empty my gift fund to cover some of the CC balance, so it's likely I won't need to use as much as I think from the Efund. This would leave me with a comfortable cushion in case something does come up, a clear CC, and a slightly lower LOC.I like this scenario better than completely emptying my Efund and leaving myself vulnerable. Has anyone else done this?**UPDATE: I've just listed 11 items on Amazon.ca! Wish me luck selling them!!**"},
{"title": "Mid-April Update", "date": "Sunday 18 April 2010", "text": "Blog-neglect. It happens for various reasons. Mine? I've got myself addicted to Facebook. Stupid Facebook! For whatever reason, I'm finding it ridiculously hard to simply pull myself away from it. From checking it once or twice a week, I'm now on it ALL. DAY.It's insane. I know I have an addictive nature, so this doesn't surprise me, but I need to stop because not only is it eating up my days, it's very unhealthy - in more ways than one.So, as I've needed to update this for a while, now is the time!The weather is gorgeous! It reached 12C on Wednesday and is hovering around 9C today. Walking to work will be so wonderful from here on in.Sunrise:6:32Sunset:21:27 = 15 hrs of daylight!Joey is settling in well. The other two have accepted him, although there is still a bit of territorial posturing going on - at least on Joey's part. He's such a big guy that he can intimidate quite easily, but otherwise he's a doll.I saw \"How to Train a Dragon\" last night & loved it! I saw \"Clash of the Titans\" two weeks ago and didn't love it. It was fun and Sam Worthington is very easy on the eyes (sorry, Harry. You just don't measure up), but not amazing. Excellent special effects, though!I got a quote on car insurance from a different company and can save $150 a year if I switch! I had to collect a few things, including a safety inspection because the truck is over 15 yrs old. That cost me $54.00 (comes out of the car account) and she passed everything! I figure it's worth it to get my yearly insurance below $350.I'm looking for some p/t work and have dropped off half a dozen or so resumes. I've not heard anything yet, but there's still time. If I don't hear anything, then nothing changes, but it would be nice to get something at least once a week, just for some extra $$ to put towards the debt.I had a meeting with my FA last week and made a couple of changes to my current investments. I'm auto-saving $60 p/mth as of May (up $10), and have put half my savings into something a bit more aggressive. She also said to expect a rise in interest rates, so GET RID OF DEBT sooner rather than later. I am taking this to heart, and need to work harder to get that gone.Debating about getting rid of my cell, which would save me $60 a month. It would mean someone taking over the contract to do that, so I'm going to ask around. If not, I can always cancel, but that's a very expensive way to do it, although far, far less than they'll get from me just with basic monthly payments for the course of the contract.Three weeks holiday was lovely! I went back to work for 2 days and then got sick! :( I am feeling much better now, but it sort of snuck up on me and knocked me flat for a couple of days. Very strange, but glad it wasn't longer or more serious. I'm actually looking forward to being back at work!Decided I need to start a detox May 1. I did this several years ago and it was amazing! Mainly fruits and veggies (raw for the most part), not too much sugar (the uber-refined kind at least) and one cup of tea a day. I was feeling like a new woman after just three weeks! I loved it once I got into the routine of it. I went off the pill after I split with D in Feb and my hormones just went berserk - I had cravings for chips & coke like you wouldn't believe. Literally every time I looked at a bag of chips I bought it and ate it all! Fortunately (!) those have tapered off now, but I'm still eating very badly. I suppose this is part of my learning too - why do I eat so poorly? There must be a psychological aspect to it like \"I feel I'm not loveable / worthy / deserving, so why bother doing good things for myself because what's the point anyway?\"But I AM loveable and worthy and deserving. If you don't love you, no one else will either. This is my basic lesson.DVDs borrowed from friends: Quantum Leap, Gilmore Girls, Eureka, McGyver, Veronica Mars & Due South. I am loving Quantum Leap (wasn't one I watched with any regularity when it was on) and am looking forward to watching McGyver (was a regular). Eureka was a lot of fun, but my friend doesn't have S2, just S3 and I don't want to skip any of it.A specialist appointment on the 22nd to touch base about my kidneys. Last blood test showed an improvement, which I hope will reflect in the latest one as well.I've also read three more books this week (no kids & sick, remember!), all by Charlaine Harris: \"The Julius House,\" \"Dead Over Heels,\" and \"Real Murders.\" That finishes off the Aurora Teagarden mystery series. I loved it! I didn't read it in order, but it didn't matter much. But Ms. Harris is a wonderful writer, and she is one of my favourite authors these days. This series was, I believe, her first.And it's already almost 2:30. I've just decided what I'm going to make for dinner, so I think I'll actually sit back and read some more between then and now. It's quiet and I've got another good book on the go, and it's much better than being on the computer!Hope you all had a great weekend!"},

He obviously gets nervous when he can't find it. Bylaw and Dinah are less than pleased with this whole situation (they have both vomited twice!), but I really am hoping things will settle down over the next couple of days. It will take some getting used to, as he's quite a presence and has already made himself at home. He just loves everyone so much; he starts purring the instant you touch him. Apart from being hugely overweight, he was well taken care of and obviously quite loved at his previous home.Joey can actually jump onto the sofa, which is a good thing, because I wasn't sure he'd even be able to do that. I have to lift him into the cat tree, so was happy that I won't be spending all my time trying to get him onto or into everything (i.e. litter box)."},

I cannot wait to taste it tomorrow! To tide me over, I got a pineapple coconut - seeing a theme? - cupcake, which was divine and lasted all of 10 seconds. This cake will see me through tomorrow's birthday potluck and also Sunday's birthday potluck (for a friend), plus, I'm sure, leaving me a little (a lot?) to just savour on my own. It's big, but resting beside it in the cooler was a 12\", 3-layer raspberry ginger cake...OMG...The owner/baker has said she's going to make chocolate coconut cupcakes now, which is great!This cost me $50 - she threw in the cupcake for free (!) which was initially going to come from the cheque my mum sent me, but because I bought art with that instead, I rolled some coin and voila! I had $50 exactly! I thought that was pretty cool (I exchanged the coin at the bank for a bill).I also went to the shelter to fill out a fostering application for a cat called Joey. I sent an email to my landlords yesterday to ask permission for this and I got a very quick, positive response all the way from NZ! I'll be picking him up Monday or Tuesday, as I still have a week off and that will give us all a chance to at least get used to each other for a few days before I go back to work on the 12th. He's a monster! He weighs a whopping 24lbs and just needs somewhere to work it off and have his food intake monitored. I've been told the vet would weigh him weekly or bi-weekly for free so I can keep track of how he's doing. He currently has an appointment sometime in the next week or so to get checked out with respect to his kidneys and his inverted nipples (from the weight). Poor guy. He's a lovely, sweet boy who got overfed and needs some tough food love. You can see him here. He's the 5th one down.Hope everyone has a lovely Easter weekend! :)"},

{"title": "Can I extend this holiday into forever?", "date": "Sunday 28 March 2010", "text": "I am so relaxed right now. It's such a great feeling and I don't want it to end! The best part of a holiday is just not being at work, as far as I'm concerned. I like my job, but it's always nice to step away from it for a bit and just do things that you want to do; sometimes you need a holiday just to get things done around the house!I don't make time for stuff like purging, big cleans, tidying, etc. when I'm working because the last thing I want to do when I get home from work is clean or purge or whatever. Part of my motivation last week was knowing I had a friend arriving and god forbid the house should be messy! :PAnyway, I did a big old purge of closets, cupboards, shelves...most of it went to the Sally Anne, some to the free store at the recycling depot. I've cleaned the bathroom, dusted, tidied, vacuumed, laundered, sorted, washed the floors, organized...! Phew! It feels great but I dare say I can probably find loads more stuff to get rid of if I really took the time to sort more thoroughly, but I did amazingly well for short bursts. Sometimes that's the best way - then you can't really think about it and decide that you want to keep it after all.My friend arrived on Thursday and it was SO great to see her!! We've actually been quite busy since she arrived and we have two more days to relax and poke around the city before she goes home. She's here for a knitting weekend, but it's been very busy for them. There are 11 attendees from Edmonton, Calgary & Vancouver and they're knitting gloves with a wool called Qiviuq - musk ox wool. It's frighteningly expensive ($90 a ball!) but she's very excited as it's a lovely wool to work with.It's actually really nice to have someone around to talk to, too! I love living alone, but it's only when someone is here that I realize how much I miss having company. It's so convenient having the second bedroom, too, as she has her privacy & her own space to spread out in. She likes the cats, but if you're not used to pets, it can be very disturbing to have them wandering in and out of your room all night.I got a birthday card and a cheque from my mum, too, which was a nice surprise. I'm having people over for a potluck on Friday and have ordered a chocolate coconut cake to share. Part of the money is going to pay for the cake, part is going to pay for a haircut and the rest is going into the bank so I can ponder the best thing to do with it! I was thinking I'd split it up amongst my savings accounts, but I'm not entirely sure yet.Anyway, I have two more weeks of holiday ahead of me and I have lots of things yet to do. My list of 'to do' has only begun to be checked off! :)Hope you're all having a great weekend!"},

I distinctly remember a conversation about upgrading to Windows 7 when I bought it, but perhaps I misunderstood the entire thing. Well, not perhaps; obviously.I went to Staples yesterday and spoke with someone about the \"missing\" Windows 7 CDs (with respect to the crash) and was told they should be in the box, in a thin CD case. I had doubts about this as I had been through said box twice already to make sure I had everything I needed. Anyway, I searched again when I got home, but the discs are definitely not there. I returned today with my receipt and spoke with the same employee who said that it wasn't actually included in the package that I got although I feel pretty sure that's part of WHY I bought that particular package.What conversation was I having then?? I ended up buying Windows 7, but now I'm not sure I want to load it up, so will sit on it for a couple of days before making the final decision. Once it's opened, after all, I can't return it and that would be $140 wasted. Argh!!"},

The whole touch screen aspect of it still hasn't got old and it's uber-efficient (with 640GB what else could it be?). It was a definite want and a rather impulsive purchase, but the timing turned out to be pretty good, as my laptop simply up & died in December. Off to hard drive heaven. It would have cost me approximately $300 to fix a computer worth maybe $100, so I donated it. Hopefully they'll be able to salvage parts from it to repair other laptops. Good-bye faithful friend!But apparently even monsters aren't without their problems as I've found out the past couple of days. There I was, blithely playing a game yesterday morning, killing some time before work when C.R.A.S.H. Machine dies.Nuts.After it rebooted, I chose the 'safe mode' just to be, er, safe, but something had completely frazzled the poor thing (what do the experts call it? Corrupted). I imagine it was the game I was playing, although I was assured by the game people that it is absolutely virus free, etc. etc. Whatever the problem, I've noticed that since I've had this computer that the games aren't playing quite as they should be, mostly sound issues and they seem to 'drag' a bit when I'm playing.I was on the phone for an hour with the HP helpline and what I ended up doing was using the recovery disks to return everything to normal. This is where I'm extremely grateful I forked out for an external hard drive! Everything I needed to keep safe was and everything else was wiped clean (I can recover iTunes). It took about half an hour to get everything back to normal, but I'm feeling slightly put out by the whole experience. I have to reload Windows 7, too, but as the discs weren't included in my package (just the installation of them), I'm considering purchasing the upgrade. To take it back to Staples would mean an automatic $40 \"diagnostic fee,\" not to mention the fact they would probably have it at least a couple of days. It would be worth it to have it on-hand in case this happens again. The cost of the program is about $130, but I'll call them first to find out if they can reload it for me for free if I brought it in one afternoon. A phone call doesn't cost anything and I DID buy the two-year extended warrenty with them, so hopefully that sort of thing would be included under that.But here I am at the end of my day, no worse off and thankful that someone knew what they were doing. The woman I spoke with did seem a bit surprised that the game I was playing (she even knew the one it was) could have caused this, as there shouldn't be any problems. The computer is more than capable of handling \"little\" things like that. Regardless, it's fixed for now and that's all that matters. The recovery disks did what they were supposed to do. It's just a pain to have try and remember what I had listed in my favourites bar.Holiday day 1 of 24 is almost over and while I wasn't at all productive, I am quite pleased that it didn't end in tears, either! :)"},

I got dinged $20 extra dollars lst month because the minimum payment amount wasn't met, and I don't want that happening again! It's spring break up here - two weeks! - and it's been pretty busy at work. It's quite a stimulating job anyway, but adding more kids, parents and activity in the library makes it worse. Plus we have several new staff who are still learning. Two are doing very well. The third is a lovely woman but one who needs constant supervision, which is draining just on its own.

I plan to do not a lot except visit with a friend who's visiting me for 5 days, LOTS of spring cleaning and purging, walking, photography, reading, DVD watching, maybe some writing...I don't think the hoped for Vancouver trip will happen. I don't have the funds. We can go later in the year, maybe closer to Christmas to shop for presents or something. The airline packages are always on. I'll just take my friend out for a nice meal instead.Hope you all have a great weekend! :)"},
{"title": "The real update!", "date": "Saturday 6 March 2010", "text": "After yesterdayâs debacle, in which I took about an hour to write a post, then lost it to some sort of error in Blogspot, I am going to try and recreate it using the sensible suggestion (thanks, TâPol!) of Word and then cutting and pasting it instead. Part of the problem is that I get distracted easily and spent some time switching back & forth between windows, so it signed itself out, but then all it asked was that I sign in again. I got some kind of strange error message but didnât worry that I couldnât find it again because it was auto-saved as I wrote it up, but when I went to the Edit option to retrieve it, all that was saved was the first line. ARGH! :(Anyhoo...I am going to my favourite format to update: point!I did my taxes (thanks to Studio Tax!) on Thursday and sent them off. I collected my last T4 and that took me from a return of just over $1000 to owing $221.91. Iâm not complaining as thatâs $2K less than last year and Iâll be able to pay it off in one go, so YAY!I got a (govât) cheque for $150 in the mail yesterday, which was a nice surprise! I have no idea what itâs for, however. The description reads âSubsidy,â and Iâm wondering if this has something to do with electricity or energy or something. Regardless, itâs a nice snowflake.Iâm going to update my resume. Iâve decided to at least think about getting a p/t job, hopefully just for the summer. I feel I still owe too much so an extra $300 - $400 per month would really help get rid of that, as well as plump up my savings.Iâm on âset 8â of âMidsomer Murders.â Already. Iâm addicted!I went to a birthday party here last Saturday. The company was excellent, the food delicious, and it was a terrific idea all round.The main emotion about the whole thing with D that I have right now is relief. Like a huge burden has been lifted off me. I donât hate him; I canât. Not only is that a terrific waste of time and energy, but I have these wonderful lessons to learn from it all: about anger & its expression, about self-respect & integrity, about understanding that the way Iâve been treating myself (very poorly) is the way other people are going to treat me. Books that are filled with circumstantially appropriate content & titles finding their way into my handsJoining a meditation group through a new co-workerI thought I would try a version of âmeal plan Mondayâ on my day off, which happens to be Friday. Iâm thinking of calling it âFix-It Fridaysâ or âFood Fixinâ Fridayâ or some such thing. Yesterdayâs âFood Fixâ was Hawaiian chicken in the crockpot. It was delicious!My crockpot lid broke today as I was washing it!Good thing I have a second crockpot! :)I get my bonus next week! It should be approximately $1600, so thatâs where my income tax payment is coming from. The rest will be split between debt repayment and savings accounts.I have a friend visiting me from Vancouver for several days at the end of the month, then am hoping for a long Easter weekend break down there, as Iâve taken two weeks off around my birthday. Iâm really looking forward to the break.Iâm 93% complete on my 2009 RRSP! Thatâs a great feat, really. 2010 starts with this next paycheque, so weâll see what happens from there.Canadian Saver has posted an update of her 2010 goals to this point, which Iâm going to shamelessly copy and do as well (thanks for letting me steal the idea, CS!). ;-)RRSP 2010: This will officially begin on March 10. I auto-save $100 a month right now and the plan is to increase that as my debt goes down. My goal here is $5000.Pay off existing debt. I wanted to be free of debt by the end of June, but Iâm not sure this is doable. It would be really, really tight, so Iâm modifying it to be debt free by the end of the year, which is less stressful.I will pay off the computer by the end of January. DONE! PIF: Jan 15!!Next up: VISA, then my LOC.EFund. Iâm aiming for $3000 by end December 2010. Bonus! $3500.Iâm just over halfway to this goal already. I auto-save $50 a month.US account. I would like $500 US in here by end December 2010. I currently have $308. Itâs just for fun and day trips to Skagway, so it doesnât need serious attention. Because itâs just for fun, nothing has changed with this. I will try mooching USD at the hotel starting in April or May, when the tourists start trickling in.Track spending. I still find money running through my fingers far more than it should. So Iâm going to continue with this. Write it down, meal plan, make shopping lists, etc. Find an extra $50 a month to put toward debt until itâs paid off. Well, I have actually been doing this (apart from the meal planning part), with the colourful and particularly fabulous âBudget & Analysis Toolâ that I got from Fabulously Broke. It is, quite simply, amazing!Credit card spending. None, unless I can pay it off in full when due. Um...not doing that great with this, but neither is it ridiculous. I will be able to pay this off by the end of April, although Iâve started a monthly recurring purchase through my naturopath. That, however, is an amount that I am perfectly able to pay off in full each month.Cash only. January. And Iâll take it month to month from there depending on how I do. This means leaving my debit & credit card at home, so the temptation isnât there to use them. This should curb my spending, generally and otherwise. Hmmm...No. But I have been using my jars pretty consistently, and therefore working with cash a lot more, which is a definite start.Make a will. This could also fall under âfinancial,â as it costs money to do this, but Iâll aim to have this done by my birthday this year. I plan to have the funds for it by the end of April, which will be a month later than I stated (my birthday is at the start of the month), but still aim to cross this off my list this year. Itâs not worth it to keep putting it off.Photography. I have an awesome camera that Iâm not using. I will use it. Iâm actually doing okay with this. Iâm making sure that I take it on my walks with me because even if I go to the same place every day to walk, thereâs always something to see. School. Iâm looking into several online options for this. The college here is great, but the classes I need either arenât being offered this semester or the times conflict with my work schedule, so I think online is the way for me to go. Iâm aiming for a minimum of three classes this year. Iâm still thinking about what I need to do and how I will pay for it. I have a list of several classes that I want to take, though, so could perhaps work on those while I figure out what I need.Read. My goal is 100 books this year. 14 so far! And they are: (*recommended)Field of Blood - Denise MinaThe Guinea Pig Diaries - AJ JacobsRescue Ink - w/Denise Flaim (also see: RescueInk.com)*Debt Free Forever - Gail Vaz-Oxlade*Dogtown - Stefan Bechtel (Best Friends Animal Sanctuary)*The Return of the Dancing Master - Henning MankellTales From a Dog Catcher - Lisa Duffy-KorpicsUnder the Paw: Confessions of a Cat Man - Tom Cox*The Riesling Retribution - Ellen CrosbyWhy Good People do Bad Things - Debbie FordThe Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society - Mary Ann Shaffer & Annie Barrows***Fun Home - Alison BechdelA Bone to Pick - Charlaine Harris*Three Bedrooms, One Corpse - Charlaine Harris*So there we have it. Pretty much the same as yesterday's lost post, but of course I don't remember everything that I lost. I'm off for a walk with a friend in an hour and I'm looking forward to that. It's cold and bright here today; we have almost 11 hours of daylight now! It's quite wonderful.Hope you all have a great weekend!"},

It appears I'm not the only one having (ex)boyfriend issues and I think she's doing a wonderful thing for herself by spending the next 40 days and 40 nights doing nothing but what she wants, taking care of her needs first. Arual is doing something very similar (only without male impetus, I believe). This is awesome.I have decided that I need this time with NO CONTACT between D & me: no texting, no emails, no FB, nothing. It was getting a bit over the top before he left for the mine on Thursday and he was sitting on the plane when he told me he got me a kitten!! \"You wanted one,\" he texts. Sure I want a kitten. I'd love 100 kittens, but THIS IS NOT THE TIME. I don't want a kitten on a whim or as a tool of emotional blackmail. I want a kitten because I love cats, but there's just not room in my life for a little one right now.So, I am going to send him a note to say that I am cutting off all communication until after Easter. I don't want to block him (not yet, anyway). I don't hate him, but I need time to work on myself because this has been a HUGE wake up & shake up for me. This is going to be my uber-selfish time where I do nothing but focus on what I want and what I need to work on so I can move forward. Overall, I feel good. I really do (at least for now. I'm certain there's a surge of emotions just waiting to rise to the surface and blow).

He says he's done a lot of thinking and, truly, the past several days he's tried hard, but I can't put myself through it anymore. I was literally making myself sick - not eating, not sleeping, clenching my teeth all the time, my emotions all over the map, having to get blood tests, etc.I thought I could maybe work it out, but the more I tried, the more smacks upside the head I'd get from the Universe. I've had signs coming at me all over the place for over a week now! I can forgive (we're all human and have our flaws and faults), but I can't forget and that's the problem. I've already been more gracious and way nicer than 99.9% of other women would have been. Far more than he deserves.With the decision made, I feel better. He's already sent me long, heart-felt texts claiming the 'other woman' kept crying when he tried to break it off with her (this is not something I can imagine her doing, to be quite honest). If this is the relationship that's meant to be, then I'll be back. If it's not, then I won't. I'm a big believer in things happening for a reason, particularly bad things. Maybe I'm not supposed to give up? I don't know. What I really hope is that he'll honest-to-god THINK about this, regardless. If I was that important to him in the first place, he wouldn't have done it, so all this is too little, too late.So, I'm taking my lessons and will learn from them. I have my own thinking to do, quite a lot of it, as a matter of fact. My big girl panties go back in the cupboard and so I know where they are if I need them in future.I'm lucky in the respect that I have no kids or mortgage with him, no ties - that would infinitely complicate things.

{"title": "Haiti", "date": "Wednesday 20 January 2010", "text": "I admit that I didn't even know that an earthquake had hit this little Caribbean country until two or three days after it happened (I don't have TV and I don't really read the papers anymore), but even then I felt no real inclination to help, although from what I've read over the past couple of days it appears that even those who have mobilized to help are having difficulties getting in because the US controls the airport and, well, they're holding things up considerably.However.I read on Saver Queen's blog yesterday and Frugal Dreamer's blog this morning about donations. Saver Queen has a link to CIDA, the governmental agency that assists internationally. They have promised to match any donation made through a registered charity (Red Cross, Salvation Army, etc.) up to $50 million. This caught my attention and then I read FD's blog a few minutes ago and she makes excellent points about the fact that we have more than enough and Haiti has nothing - and less now that a second earthquake has hit the region.So I went straight to the Red Cross site and donated. I then went to WSPA and donated there, as well.The reason I was hesitating? I just cleared most of my credit card and didn't want to rack it up again. Don't be (a ridiculous, selfish SOB) like me. Donate to Haiti. Give whatever you can, whatever you feel comfortable with. The Canadian government is matching donations. This doesn't happen often and makes your contribution that much greater.I am safe, warm, employed, loved. I need to be grateful for these 'simple' things that are so taken for granted. I'm responsible for me being in debt (for buying 'stuff'), but the people of Haiti are not responsible for the earthquake that has levelled their country and devastated them.I have to admit I'm not sure where this donation money will come from. I'll work it off I imagine. I have a secure job that pays me well and that I enjoy. That, for now, is enough."},

It was quite good, but I think it needs a bit less balsamic vinegar. Still, loads left over for lunch tomorrow (hurrah!) and I cleaned out my fridge today, too, so lots of room to store stuff.I've updated my sidebars to reflect that I paid off my computer with the money in my planned spending and freezer accounts and changed the freezer to Will, because I really need to make one. I've no idea how much this will cost me, so I figure $500 is a safe number to work with.It's been a great weekend, despite not getting to the hotsprings. Work again tomorrow and then Vancouver on Thursday. It's my biopsy on Friday and I'll be staying with friends of mine while I'm there. My sister and BIL will be coming over, too, which'll be great. Lynn Canyon was mentioned as a destination for a hike on Thursday and I would like to get to Chapters or Indigo, but that's pretty much it as far as shopping goes. I'm taking a small case and books will be it, if I buy anything at all.

We had tried on Tuesday night, but found them closed (they're a half hour drive from town). Today we decided to try again, but got there really early. The sign at the intersection states that they open at 4 - 10. We had about a 20-min wait until 4, and then they didn't open. We waited another 10 mins and then left. According to a tour guide who had also arrived, the sign by the door says \"open 6 pm,\" but he had called earlier and was told 4 would be fine.

{"title": "Shaving savings", "date": "Tuesday 12 January 2010", "text": "Sometimes this is how I feel paying off debt. It's hard to train yourself into new habits so it doesn't get away from you. I would love to see that big dollar sign as representing my savings, but it currently represents the debt. Although not nearly as big as some, it's still that proverbial monkey and needs to be removed from my back.To accomplish clearing the debt this year, I've shaved my current savings as a first step. I'm planning on this only being temporary, and then boosting the savings back up to try and meet my savings goals.My savings were (monthly):RRSP 1: $250TFSA: $100CSBs: $70RRSP 2: $50ING: $162 (5 accounts)Total: $632That's actually 29% of my monthly income, so no wonder I was feeling a bit squeezed! I should be concentrating on ridding myself of debt, then focus on my savings.So I did some online fiddling over the past couple of days and phoned my bank today to get my auto-deposits adjusted. This is what my savings will look like from here on in (monthly):RRSP 1: $100 ($50 is min bi-weekly deposit amount)TFSA: $50CSBs: $70RRSP 2: $50ING: $70 (3 accounts)Total: $340Extra toward debt (monthly): $292!$330 is 15% of my monthly pay, so this is much more in line with what I should be saving anyway. The CSBs come off my paycheque bi-weekly and I can't change the amount until next year at this point. RRSP #2 is growing slowly but surely and I think it's doing just fine as it is for the moment. ING was taking more money than I thought, so I've shaved it down by continuing to save only in my vet, travel and car funds. The planned spending and the new freezer account (was computer) will be emptied to put extra funds on the computer, so it'll be paid off by the end of the month. I couldn't bear to cut it out entirely and even this is making me a bit nervous, but I have $1600 in my EFund, and I'll be just fine.Money should be THIS fun!"},

I have a bonus coming near the end of February, most, if not all, of which will go into my RRSP (for tax deferral), plus I get an incremental increase in my pay (think it's 1.2% or something) around March. April is tax-time and this year I'm actually hoping for a refund. So the next few months look promising with respect to \"extra\" income this year.I'm also hoping to use the next few weeks to tidy, organize and clear clutter. 15 or 20 minutes a day really does work wonders; I need to stop being such a horrid procrastinator. I did quite well over the holidays, but I swear every time I open a cupboard or a drawer there's something in there I simply don't use/want/need/wear. Our recycling depot has a 'free store,' where you can drop off/pick up items, and I've taken advantage of that before. I'll most likely take a bag of clothes to the Sally Anne, and use the free store for household items. I'm also going to see if I can get anything for some of my DVD box sets.

This could also fall under âfinancial,â as it costs money to do this, but Iâll aim to have this done by my birthday this year.Photography. I have an awesome camera that Iâm not using. I will use it.School. Iâm looking into several online options for this. The college here is great, but the classes I need either arenât being offered this semester or the times conflict with my work schedule, so I think online is the way for me to go. Iâm aiming for a minimum of three classes this year.Read. My goal is 100 books this year.These are the focus this year, along with smaller goals that I've got. I had an epic fail on last year's goals, but they were pretty ambitious and I'm pretty lazy...I'm not surprised, as I do this every year, but I think this time my goals are a little more focused, and I that most are also achieveable. I have no particular order for these, apart from perhaps my will, so that helps too."},
{"title": "New Year Spending", "date": "Saturday 2 January 2010", "text": "I was out shortly after 8am this morning, having decided not to procrastinate. My goal: Canadian Tire. I spotted an item that I've had my eye on for probably two years in the latest flyer. It's a little wheeled kitchen cart that will give me a bit of extra storage room and counter space. The regular price is $190 (actually $20 more than when I first saw it two years ago), the sale price $114. A considerable savings.Another item I was considering was this microwave stand. Nothing fancy, but again, extra storage as well as making space on my counter by holding the microwave. The regular price is $100. The sale price $60.The dilemma this morning, even as I was standing in front of them, was which one do I choose? I got a $100 Canadian Tire gift certificate from my mum for Christmas (I asked) and had already spent $25 of it. I could spend an extra $40 (out of my snowflake jar) and get the item I've been eyeing for two years, or I could spend $60 and walk away with $15 still in my pocket. I ultimately decided to go with my first choice, the one I've wanted for so long and to pay the $40 difference. I think it's a great deal, despite the little voice in my head saying \"but if you hadn't've spent that $25 earlier, you'd only be paying $15 for this!\"Yes, but I still saved $150 and that's substantial, particularly when I'm not sure this item is actually worth that much anyway! :) And technically, because I'd snowflaked the $40, my jars are still intact.My spends look like this today:Gas: $47.77 (96.9 ltr)I had a coupon for double the superbucks at the Superstore gas station, so I filled up there before I went in to pick up a few things.Groceries @ SuperStoreFrozen peas x 2: $4 ($2 ea)Frozen corn x 2: $4 ($2 ea)Bulk quinoa (1.305 kg $9.80 kg): $12.79Hummous: $5.49Total: $26.28coupon: $-2.69Total paid: $23.32Groceries (elsewhere):Kashi Organic Cinnamon cereal x 2: $12.98Christmas cards x 2 pkgs: $9.98Rice milk, original x 3: $8.97Rice milk, vanilla x 3: $8.97Lottery tickets (1st time in 3 1/2 yrs!!): $11.00Total: $52.40Potatoes: (2.860 kg @ $1.96 kg): $5.61Pasta sauce x 2: $7.58Veggie ground round x 2: $8.78Tropical green tea: $3.69Total: $25.71Total groceries: $101.43So my (bi) weekly gas jar is empty, as is my grocery jar for the most part, but I'm pleased with the spends as it was all cash. The coins went straight into my coin box to await rolling.I'm still working on my goals for posting and hope to have them complete in the next day or so. I'm trying to keep \"baby steps\" in mind and not get wrought up worrying that my goals may be too ambitious."},

{"title": "Banana Loaf!", "date": "Monday 28 December 2009", "text": "Being on this semi-restrictive diet means I can't eat any of what I love: sweets! Cakes, cookies, anything with chocolate, etc. etc.But I've really been craving something sweet the past couple of weeks; something to snack on between meals and I don't mean veggies (I can't even have fruit on this diet). Baked goods of some sort, that feel like a cheat, but aren't. So I perused the web. Why I continue to be surprised by what you can find on the web (I guess I should start asking 'what CAN'T you find?'), I don't know, but I found this recipe for banana loaf.Recipe for dairy/sugar/yeast-free Banana Bread2 eggs2 bananas1/3 c milk (I used soy)2/3 c applesauce1 tsp vanilla1 tsp cinnamon1/2 tsp nutmeg2 1/4 c whole wheat flour1 tsp stevia (plant-derived, natural sweetener: 4x's stronger than reg sugar, so need WAY less)1 tsp baking sodapinch saltPreheat oven to 350C.Mix dry ingredients together. Mix wet ingredients together. Combine the two.Pour into 9x5 loaf pan and bake for 1 hour (I found that 50 mins was quite sufficient).That's it. Super easy and boy, does it taste good! My breaks at work will be much nicer now. It's not that I really dislike rice cakes, you understand, but banana bread is banana bread and, well, made of slightly sterner stuff.I also had a cup of 'regular' tea the other day, with Stevia and soy milk to replace the regular stuff. Not bad, but still not the relaxing, calming cup that I've been craving so bad. Soon, I hope, I can once again indulge my Tim addiction for my morning tea. Another week until I see the naturopath for another assessment. I'm hoping I can drop some of the supplements I'm taking, as they're damned expensive, but can't until I've seen her. But I just keep reminding myself that this isn't a bad thing to do, and I have been enjoying my meals more, too.I'm coming to the end of my Christmas break. I go back to work tomorrow after a lovely 4-day \"weekend.\" I've been surprisingly productive, which I'm pleased about and have to decide what I'm going to do today.Friday I did some baking and then went for dinner with my friend and three of her kids. It was delicious, but teenagers are pretty excitable. Her place is always noisy - the TV is always going, the boys are wrestling or fighting or arguing and whatever else boys do to bond with each other. I've heard that once you become a parent, \"kid noise\" just becomes something you can't hear anymore. But they're great kids, so I don't mind visiting now and again, although it WAS nice to get home to peace and quiet. :)Saturday I decided to get things done that I've not done in months: clean my oven (always fun), the bathroom and then start tidying the place up. There's paper and assorted other crap everywhere. I've learned that EasyOff oven cleaner works best when the oven has been warmed first - it's really fast. I don't like to use the nasty stuff, but sometimes you need the toxic, chemically-charged power of such things to get the really old crap cleaned up properly. My oven looks fabulous now. And I have a large bag of books to take to the library for donation tomorrow, too.Yesterday I vacuumed, did a laundry, tidied up a little bit more and today...well, I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll drive over to the recycling centre and (finally!) get rid of my stuff, although that can eat up more time than I plan for sometimes as I get distracted by people putting stuff where it's not supposed to go and following them around, removing the offending objects from the wrong bin and putting them in the proper one. Those I can reach anyway...Ahem...I also finished my Jo Nebo book and two others this weekend, watched all my episodes of \"Midsomer Murder,\" and am counting down the days until D gets back to town. He's due back Jan 5; 7 more sleeps. He called Christmas Day and is regretting staying; he's a real homebody and doesn't like the isolation of the mine, I think. I'm going to try and talk him out of leaving the mine so soon, but I'll get a newspaper for him as well, so he can keep his eyes open for job possibilities back in town.CanadianSaver posts her list of \"books read\" a couple of times a year, and I'm going to do that as well, if anyone's interested. But I have to get my recycling done now that it's stuck in my head."},
{"title": "Boxing Day plans", "date": "Saturday 26 December 2009", "text": "I assume there's a bizillion things \"on sale\" right now around town, for those who didn't get what they wanted for Christmas. I'll also assume that that's where a lot of town will be headed.Not me. I got a couple of phone calls, a nice visit with my friend and her family for dinner, baked some cookies and brownies, slept in...otherwise, I did not receive a single \"thing\" for Christmas. This makes me quite pleased, although I know there are a couple of items yet to arrive. I logged on to the computer this morning, as usual, and then remembered that it's Boxing Day! Our \"Sale of Sales\" Day, like Black Friday in the States.I'd just like to ask: what sales? Apple sent me an email reminding me that I can still buy what I want if I didn't get what I want, but I see no knock-down, drag-em-out prices. Same with Amazon. Sure, I'd LOVE a KitchenAid mixer, but not at $340 (still too pricey for me). Canadian Tire has them on sale for $199 (!!), but where would I put it? Seriously. I just don't have the space for it anywhere. :( Maybe next year...Anyhoo, I'm not motivated to peruse a lot of sites, nor do I have the money to purchase anything. Besides, I don't NEED anything. I'm determined in the coming year to stop playing \"ostrich\" games with my money and just get the damn debt paid off! I have a list of three debts, each of which will be paid off at a certain time next year, to be completed by end of June. I am working on my goals list and will probably post it some time next week.But as for today, I'm planning a trip to the local grocery store to pick up some steel wool and some oven cleaner. I've got some environmentally friendly stuff which works fairly well for light touch ups, but it needs a good old scrub and sometimes only the nasty stuff can get it done. Then some vacuuming, bathroom cleaning and that's that. I've got some DVDs from the library to watch, too. We've recently got the ENTIRE \"Midsomer Murders\" collection in, so I'm starting at #1 with that series. I love English mysteries!Have a great day everyone!"},

This is very nice, and I was assured that it's okay and they're not short, which is important.I thought about what I wanted to do with it (it came from my planned spending account), but then thought a bit more. Instead of doling it out to plump up my various accounts, I'd going to use it to pay down my computer. Every last penny. Plus the $300 I've already saved towards it.I went over to Staples after work and tried to pay: I'd forgotten it won't clear for several days yet, so once again I'm going to have a late payment on the card, but it'll be big enough that it really won't matter. This is the one debt I'd like to clear up ASAP. It was a dumb move to finance it, but it appears it will be paid off a lot sooner than I'd hoped - once I've paid what I plan to, there will only be about $300 owing! I can easily get rid of that before March if I'm conscientious enough."},
{"title": "Spending, sending and receiving", "date": "Tuesday 22 December 2009", "text": "I spent the weekend in a mad bake-athon of my own making. It was fun, but kind of exhausting, but I did manage to bake quite a number of (hopefully) tasty things. Apart from the Raspberry Cream Cheese Brownies, which was my sole creation on Saturday, I spent Sunday making these recipes:Lemon Buttermilk CookiesWhite Chocolate Cranberry CookiesGingerbreadI wanted to make about two or three more items, but I ran out of time, motivation and butter, which is apparently the cornerstone ingredient in every single baking recipe. Ever. Anyway, nothing else can fit in the box I'm sending to D, so he gets what he gets.I took the truck in for repairs today, fearing the worst, but it wasn't as bad as I expected. The fuel pump needed replacing (and the oil light is still going on because...?). I dropped it off at about 9am and it was finished and ready to go before 11:00. Total damage: $289.98. A bit steep, but what can you do? You pay what you have to. These guys are downtown, so it's walking distance from work, which is one of the reasons I go to them. I'm glad to have her back, and she's plugged in for the night.I got home to find my Amazon order waiting for me. I bought Gail Vaz-Oxlade's new book \"Debt-Free Forever,\" and am looking forward to reading it (I have to finish my Jo Nesbo mystery first, however...sorry, Gail!). I also purchased \"30 Rock\" S2 and a book I read a couple of years ago called \"The Writer's Mentor,\" which is a thoughtful book on encouraging and motivating you to write. I need a gentle shove.My biopsy has been arranged for January 22 in Vancouver. The flight is covered by health care, I would just have to arrange a hotel, but will most likely stay with a friend who has offered me her spare bedroom, as well as to drive me to and from the hospital! How lovely. And the bonus, of course, is that I would have lots of time to spend with her.Time for bed and for at least two more chapters in my book: if you like mysteries, but haven't yet discovered Jo Nesbo (Norwegian author), I very much recommend him. Excellent!"},
{"title": "Groceries and baked goodness", "date": "Sunday 20 December 2009", "text": "I went to see a naturopath just over a week ago, and she's put me on a diet which excludes sugar, dairy and yeast. Three items which make up most of my favourite foods: anything sweet, cheese, breads & bagels, milk...What bad timing! I didn't feel I could say \"is there anyway I could start this after Christmas?\" because the reason I went to see her in the first place is because I'm not feeling healthy. So really I only have myself to blame. It's a modified candida diet and fortunately there were no reactions to wheat and/or gluten, so it means I don't have to cut out pasta, soy products (like Yves Veggie Ground Round) or stuff like that which makes shopping a bit easier. I still have to read the labels, though, because it can't contain any yeast.Prior to this, I had decided that I was going to do a little baking for Christmas, so I bought like $200 worth of stuff (flour, sugar, butter - SO MUCH BUTTER! - etc.). So I'm baking because I don't want this stuff to go to waste. It's absolute torture because I can't taste anything before I put it in the over or when it comes out. I'm following the recipes word for word and just trusting people to let me know if they like it. So far, I've had two thumbs up, which is a relief as my counter space is very limited which makes a lot of prep work a bit un-motivating.However, my first official grocery shop was today - I had enough stuff, for the most part, in my fridge and cupboards to be able to get through just over a week of dietary requirements which, quite frankly, surprised me, but there you are.First, the photo of my glorious haul:Meats:Chicken breast: (family pack) $10.73Bison sirloin: $2.84Bison sirloin: $2.77Eye of round: $1.63Eye of round: $1.36Pork chops (4 pack): $8.45VeggiesCarrots: (.385 kg @ $3.73 kg, 4 carrots) $1.44Broccoli: (.345 kg @ $6.15 kg, crowns) $2.12Ginger root: (.145 kg @ $15.41 kg) $2.23Green onions (2 bunches): $1.58Snap peas: $2.49GroceriesFalafel mix: $4.29Linguine: $3.90Spaghetti sauce x 2: $11.80Indian \"fast food\" (Jyoti tins x 2): $8.98Yves Veggie ground round x 2: $8.58Hummous: $4.19Soya mozzarella (melts great, not nearly as bad as it sounds & a great price): $9.98Wraps (tomato, spinach): $6.98Simply Egg Egg whites: $3.49Eggs, 1 doz lrg: $3.38OtherCat food x 6 tins @ .79 ea: $4.74Total: $108.19Surprisingly good, considering I walked to the local grocery store instead of driving across town, where I would most likely have saved money, but been in line forever. At this time of year, and this last weekend before Christmas I prefer the convenience, empty aisles and slightly higher prices of my local. SuperStore would be absolutely unbearable.And aside from that, my truck is going to the mechanic on Monday morning. When I was driving her around yesterday, both the oil light AND the charge lights came on, always when I was pulling to a stop, which is very frustrating. When I got home, I opened the hood and saw dirty black oil sprayed over most of the front of the engine, so something is torn or loose or broken there. I'm reluctant to drive her more than I have to now, so as I was going out last night, I asked a friend who was also going if she would be kind enough to pick me up and drop me home.I added half a litre of oil this morning and that will hopefully get me to town without the engine siezing. Not sure how much it will cost to fix it, but it's necessary, so I'll pay what I need to. The gas pump in the engine is also leaking, so that needs to be fixed, too. My poor old girl. I really need to look at a newer vehicle...My baking attempt today was Raspberry-Cream Cheese Brownies. They look a bit gruesome, but they smell delicious!They're going out to Desmond at the mine, along with some cookies I'll make tomorrow. I'm going to attempt these and make these again, as they've been well-recieved over the past several days. Friday morning I was up relatively early and baked one of these for our Christmas pot-luck at work. Mine didn't look light and fluffy like the one in the photo, it was a fair bit denser, but people seemed to like it; very lemon-y, I was told.These are my new dishes. Fields is going out of business and everything is on sale 10 - 50% off! Not bad. I'm disappointed as it's my go-to bargain store in lieu of Wal-Mart, but what can you do? Of course, it's busier now than it's ever been. I also picked up some baking sheets and loaf pans and may well go back for another look sometime next week. Although I don't need anything..."},
{"title": "Where things stand", "date": "Sunday 6 December 2009", "text": "An update on what my debt looks like at the end of November:LOC: $4489.36Computer: $1600.00Total: $6,089.36The LOC is high because I keep using it to pay off my Visa. I need to stop doing this - just because the interest rate is half of what the Visa rate is, doesn't mean I can just keep adding to the debt. Proof: I'd been auto-paying $80 a month up until now, but the minimum payment went up to $90! So I've upped it to $55 bi-weekly. That should help for now. I'd like to say I'll stop putting money into my EFund and add it to the debt repayment, but that just makes me far too uncomfortable.The computer, well, we all know what happened there! The minimum payment appears to be approximately $51 a month, so I paid $102. I had this as snowflake money in my rolled coin jar, so figured that would be the perfect thing to put it towards. I will have over $400 saved by the time the next bill comes due, so that will pay it down nicely. I'm going to find $100 a month to pay it off with.Otherwise, I've updated my sidebars to reflect what's going on in my savings accounts. The planned spending is looking exceptionally depleted because that's where the money I loaned my sister came from. Plus, I used that for shopping in Vancouver. I'm expecting about half of my loan to come back sometime in the very forseeable future, so I'll be plumping up all of the accounts accordingly (including to my RRSP & EFund). I'm feeling quite comfortable with all my savings right now, and that includes my $35 bi-weekly CSB deduction from my paycheque. The rate isn't great, certainly, but it's one more place to save that I can't get my sticky fingers onto easily. By the end of next year, I should have about $1200 in CSBs - not too shabby!I've decided that Christmas cookies will be my gifts to people this year and there won't even be that many! I used to do a lot of baking, but haven't in recent years. I do love it, and thought that Christmas is a good time for practicing that sort of thing. Some paper plates from the Dollar Store, a little plastic wrap and they're good to go. D will get a camera as I priced out the coveralls he had his eye on and they cost over $300! Well out of my price range, unfortunately, although they would be an excellent purchase because they'd actually get used and keep him really, really warm. Despite that, I just...can't.Anyhoo...I'm thinking now of my end of year \"resolutions,\" as I didn't do at all well with last year's. I will carry some over, but need to think carefully about others, particularly about my savings. I might be a bit aggressive with some of these things, or it could just be that I'm (still) too careless with my spending. Perhaps a little of both. Regardless, I have to just calm down and realize I can't do everything at once; I need to prioritize things, cut back a little here and there and just NOT PANIC!!!I'm looking forward to everyone's postings! Last years were very inspiring and I've no doubt that this year's will be just as well thought out and enjoyable to read."},
{"title": "Purse pics", "date": "Saturday 28 November 2009", "text": "This has been going around the blogs for a few days now, but I have to say outright that I've never used a purse.That's right. Never as in EVER. Kinda letting the team down, I know, but there you have it. I do own one, quite a lovely one as a matter of fact, but I never use it. I could probably carry a bandaid in it, but it's just so impractical. It was a gift several Christmas's ago from my brother's girlfriend. She bought both my sister and I one - they're handmade - when they visited Africa (she's South African herself), and my mother seemed horrified when I announced that it was my first purse ever. You'd think she'd know this, but apparently someone hasn't been paying attention for, oh, 40 or so years, eh?Anyway, I can't really bring myself to get rid of it, even though I know someone out there would truly love such a unique bag. This is the bag. See how happy it is to be out of the junk box it's kept in?I use a messenger bag or, more frequently these days, a backpack. What do I carry in them? Let's see:Hairbrush, for those unruly hair days.Notebook, ostensibly to keep track of my spending habits (MEC messenger bag: $20, backpack from sister: free!)Wallet, with all the usual wallet stuff in it.Notebook, for thoughts, ideas, etc.Daytimer, used very irregularly these days.Burt's Bees lip moisturizer! I love Burt and his bee products :)Cell phonePrescriptionAccount book for my US $ accountPens (to use with notebook, of course!)Thumb drive. Not actually sure what this is doing in there, to be honest...Cheques to bank account on Van Isl I no longer use.(Cat optional)Oh, and there's a little packet of Kleenex and my house keys in the front pocket of the backpack.

{"title": "Mmmm...Food!", "date": "Wednesday 25 November 2009", "text": "I think part of the reason I don't like cooking is that it can be so fussy: chop, chop, chop, cut, cut, cut, timing things, boiling things, pot here, pan there, etc. etc. I don't like details and I don't like fussy (possibly a reason I've never owned a purse. That's EVER), so now that I'm actually starting to cook, I'm doing my best to also look at exactly how much time it takes to make something.The recipe I made the other day states 20 minutes. I think it took me a bit longer than that, but I'm pretty sure that's just because I don't organize myself that well before I start and also due to the fact that I have about a half foot of prep area - my kitchen is SMALL and barely has any counter space. And possibly because I need to put my dishes away a lot sooner after I clean them, but regardless, it's a small area to work in.But it proves that I can cook and that good food doesn't have to take long to make.Lemon-Tarragon Chicken TossI substituted oregano for tarragon as I thought I had some, but didn't. Still, it was quite delicious and lasted for three meals: my dinner and two lunches. Last night I polished off my macaroni and cheese and finished the ice-cream (I don't really do small portions...), so have to think of something to make tomorrow. It's awkward to plan meals when you work 1 - 9 on some days. I think something with steak - I think it was going to be a ginger-beef stir fry. Fresh ginger, steak, onions, broccoli...Works for me!"},
{"title": "Feeling better & the first grocery shop this month", "date": "Friday 20 November 2009", "text": "I love to food shop. Honestly, it's one of my favourite things to do, although I know plenty of people who find it a huge chore. I imagine it's not so much the shopping as finding the time to do it when you have a family, but I love wandering the aisles and can spend quite a bit of time lost in my own little food world. I'm better now than I used to be, but still love to discover all the foods (and, I suppose, \"food\") that we North Americans have to choose from.We are ridiculously, undeniably, utterly spoiled here, even here in the North where we sometimes don't get fresh produce because the trucks can't get through in winter and with some scary prices hovering around simple veggies. I remember a good friend of mine coming to visit me when I lived in Victoria. She was born and grew up in East Germany and I believe that her visit to me was the first time she'd been in a \"normal\" grocery store. She simply couldn't get over how much choice there was - of everything! Anything and everything you could possibly want and/or need under one roof and we weren't even in that large of a grocery store (relatively speaking, of course). And daily deliveries of produce, meat, flowers, baked goods, deli goods...It can boggle the mind if you let it. I choose to not let it and am just trying now to live within my means for food, instead of just randomly buying stuff and then tossing it away because it doesn't get eaten. That still happens, unfortunately, but when it does it at least goes into the compost (which, I'm aware, is only marginally better than the garbage). A goal of mine is to cut this waste down even further.Part of this goal is to start making menues for my meals (Hey! Great idea, Annie! How'd you come up with that one?), so that's what I did today before I went out shopping. I took my jar money ($140 bi-weekly), made a list from several cookbooks and wrote down everything that I needed. I spent $115.61 of my budget and should have enough meals to last me through to next payday.That's what I bought at the top and this is how it breaks down:ProduceCarrots: 2 - 0.62 (.260 kg @ $2.40kg)Gala apples: $5.33 (1.215 kg @ $4.39kg) - not on my listLemons: 4 - $3.56 (.89 ea)Red grapefruit: 4 - $7.16 ($1.79 ea) - not on my listRed onion: $1.72 (.465 kg @ $3.70 kg)Green onions: 3 - $2.17 (.79 ea)Snow peas: $2.59Broccoli: $2.29Ginger root: .34 (.130 kg @ $2.62kg)Yam: $1.50 (.625 kg @ $2.40 kg)GroceryBow tie pasta (x2) - $3.36Linguine: $1.99Orzo: $1.99Eggs: $4.99 (PC large, free-run)PC Macaroni & Cheese: (x2) $2.38 - not on my listFeta cheese: $5.49Macaroni & cheese (side dish): $4.29 - not on my listHalf & half: $1.48Chicken broth: $1.18Beef broth: $1.18MeatsSteak: $5.39Chicken: (x2) $10.73Salmon: $15.76 (family size...and why is it Atlantic??!)OtherPC \"Loads of\" Peanut butter/chocolate ice cream: $5.99 (actually a very good price, although it's not on my list)Toilet paper: $16.99 (30 dbl rolls)Freezer bags: $3.99Total: $115.61Items not on list total: $25.15! Ouch...That's not an inconsiderable \"overbuy.\" I also bought stamps ($15.30), two bars of soap and some more Christmas cards ($14.14) at Shoppers Drug Mart, but that's the last of my Christmas card necessities. Now I just have to get them written up and sent off in the next week or so.Despite the overspend on my grocery bill, I am pleased with what I bought. I don't buy ice cream every single time (think it's been a couple of months since I last had some), the grapefruit and apples looked very nice - and they're nice to have for snacks at work - and the mac 'n cheese...well, I just happen to REALLYREALLYREALLYREALLY like it. Again, not something I always buy, but easy and quick if you're home and feeling a bit rushed, cold and not wanting to break out all the pots and pans.My flu seems to have moved on, which I'm eternally grateful for. It doesn't appear to have as been nearly as bad as some, but was certainly miserable enough. The last vestiges are on their way out and I'm back to sleeping through the night, which I'm pleased about. Now that I'm feeling better, I can concentrate on getting organized for Christmas - few presents again this year, but D has requested a camera so he can take and post photos of the mine. He doesn't want it fancy, but can you get anything that isn't even a little fancy these days? I'll set a limit for it and stick to it. It shouldn't be difficult. I asked for an iPod Nano, so I have something to listen to on my way to and from work. I currently have a Walkman MP3 player that I can't unload, so I've been listening to the same 100 songs for 3 1/2 years..."},

I was quite excited to have this time off as I was going to putter around the house, get things done, read, relax...you know, all that good stuff.Instead? I got the flu. Not swine flu, but a nasty case of 'regular' flu, so I've been stuck here on the sofa all week (apart from daily forays to care for my boss's cats) feeling utterly crappy. I'm finally on the mend, but it will be at least tomorrow when I'm able to venture further afield and into public. I didn't sleep at all the first two nights as my BONES ached and everytime I rolled over I woke myself up because it hurt so much! I've never had such an awful sensation in my life and here's to not having to go through that again. I've finally been able to sleep the past couple of nights and that's helped to shift this immensely. I don't normally get so sick, but I hope this is the last of it. I'm really astounded at the sheer number of people dropping from flu symptoms this year; is it just me or does it seem ridiculously prevalent?I suppose the silver lining to this is that I've driven only one day and have only spent $23 at the grocery store on orange juice and chicken noodle soup (which was actually kind of gross...). Here's to health and if anyone out there has the flu, take good care of yourself and get better soon."},

Technically I DID spend at the dentist, but I'll be reimbursed for that, so it doesn't really count. Right? I spent $3.84 on two teas for my friend and myself at Tim's (darn you Tim's tea! Why are you so good?), but otherwise it was a pretty good day.I got my tire repaired at Wally World for FREE! As I bought the tires there originally, they are still under warrenty, so hurrah! It was a rusty rim and a broken bead, so didn't even take that long to fix. I didn't have to part with a penny at my nemesis, but I spent too long wandering the aisles and saw many nice things...DAMN YOU WALLY WORLD AND YOUR RIDICULOUSLY LOW PRICES!! But I restrained myself and reminded myself that I don't spend $$ at Wally World.Today, though...Oh My God. Insane! I went out to exchange a video game (turns out I didn't need to, I'm just blind) and ended up at CD Plus downtown. Uh Oh. I parted with $45 for 4 DVDs:- Castle (a detective show which looks good)- Arrested Development S3 (best show ever, no longer on TV)- 2 (for $10) DVDs of \"Thunderbirds.\" Does anyone remember them? (ran through the late 50's, early 60's)Then when I got home I went to my beloved Amazon and bought:- The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency S1 (hurrah!!)- 30 Rock S1Ouch.I think I'm feeling a bit \"off\" because of my news yesterday, so I'm filling in my fear with buying. That's the only rational explanation I can think of.Anyhow, I'm going to work on my \"expression of interest\" for the training opportunity over the next few days and that should keep my mind off things until I hear the results of the tests.Hope everyone has a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Things & stuff", "date": "Friday 23 October 2009", "text": "Well, I got some good news today surrounding a job opportunity - rather, a training opportunity - that I'd wanted to apply for. I found this opportunity at work in my email (along with everyone else in government) about two days ago. It's a chance to train as a Communications Officer for a year. You learn to write news releases, arrange media conferences & interviews, prepare Ministerial speaking notes...all that good stuff. You are mentored and guided by a current CO, so that you're trained as they need/want you to be and can compete for further opportunities as a CO!Because this is a temporary assignment, you need approval from your supervisor, so I asked (never hurts to ask!). She took it to her supervisor, who took it to the Director who said 'yes.' So I now have to write up a strong letter of interest and send it in by November 2nd.I am happy in my current job. I know I'm VERY lucky to have it and all the benefits and perks that go along with it, however, I don't want to be there for 20 years. One of the reasons I like to work for government is because of all the opportunities like this that crop up. You don't have to take them, but they're there. I want to challenge myself more and gain some skills I can use anywhere: organization, prioritizing, researching - these are all things I could learn with this training. Carry that over to my current job and it applies; carry it through to teaching (which is where I'd like to end up) and it's even more relevant.But first things first. Write the letter.My excitement about this opportunity (I'm sure I'd learn how to use a thesaurus properly, too, to find alternate words) was tempered a bit by a visit to the hospital to visit a nephrologist (specializes in kidneys). I've had some health issues the past several years (7 bladder infections in a year to start) and my kidneys have \"suddenly\" become a concern. They're currently operating - if the numbers are to be believed - at about 50%. No one is sure why. After ruling many things out, I have more tests tomorrow. Then more waiting. It's very possible that I might have to go to Vancouver for a biopsy (which sounded pretty awful when the dr was describing it...ick), but again, first things first. Tests. Results. Decisions.Despite talking with my sister about it, I'm still a bit freaked out by this news. And I can't eat anything because I have to fast for the blood test tomorrow, so it's just water all night. So I think I'll just watch S6 of \"Corner Gas\" and call it a night. On top of blood tests tomorrow morning, I've got a dentist appointment right after that, then have to take my truck in to get the tire fixed (just a broken bead I hope). I'm hoping Wally-World won't charge me for that, because I bought my tires there. It's been over two years since I spent money at Wally-World and I'd hate to break my streak.Argh."},

{"title": "Less than $100 on groceries!", "date": "Thursday 15 October 2009", "text": "AND I got everything I needed for 5 days worth of meals to boot!Believe me, this is a BIG deal. I budget $120 bi-weekly for food, and generally do manage to stay within in, but it's more than frustrating to come home with just a bag or two of food worth $40 - $50 and eat for three days out of it then have to go again. I found a 4 week meal plan in a magazine at work the other week and decided that because they looked simple (not a lot of ingredients, no more than 20 mins to fix, etc) that I would try this out.This is week 1 and this is my $80.06 shopping trip:Ricotta cheese: $3.79Shredded parmesan: $5.49 (compared to slabs of parmeson for well over $10 each)Dried apricots (.670 kg @ $8.60 kg): $5.76Coke x 2: $3.38Yams x 2 (1.060 kg @ $2.62 kg): $2.78Bananas (1.150 kg @ $1.94 kg): $2.23Lime: .75Bok choy (.840 kg @ $2.16 kg): $1.81Green beans (.335 kg @ $4.17 kg): $1.40Ginger root (.100 kg @ $1.94 kg): .19Cajun trail mix (.335 kg @ $9.80 kg): $3.28Red peppers x 2 (.515 kg @ $7.25 kg): $3.28Marmalade: $2.79Spaghetti (organic, brown rice, PC): $2.49Pork chops: $3.99Outside round steak: $2.94Chicken breast: $8.48Halibut fillet: $10.63Tinned cat food (Pres Choice) x 24: 10.98Sourdough bread: $2.19TOTAL: $80.06!!!This probably looks like a lot to a lot of people (in fact, I know it does and probably is), but these are the prices at SuperStore in Whitehorse. You tend to pay more at the even the cheapest place in town, and even at the bulk bin (see: apricots), but you have to eat, right? I'm hoping these meals will last me a lot longer than 5 days, actually, because there should be leftovers for my lunches as well (all recipes, apparently, make enough for 4 servings).If this works out well, then I will continue with the rest of the meal plans. I see no reason that it shouldn't, so as this will also test my culinary skills (and D is still willing to be my guinea pig), I need to focus and start cooking! You'd think that a person who loves to eat would also enjoy the process of cooking, but I don't, mostly because there's finicky stuff involved: cutting, slicing, dicing, etc. When I'm able to, I'm hiring a chef. ;-)Post (and pics) on Vancouver trip to follow!"},
{"title": "Indulge yourself!", "date": "Monday 5 October 2009", "text": "Well. After some hemming and hawing and debate about whether or not I could afford it, I booked myself an indulgent three-day weekend in Vancouver. The time it took to book this little adventure? About 4 minutes. The cost? $657.81.I know, I know - what the heck kind of (cheap) weekend is that? It looks scary, but this is actually an awesome deal through Air North (for those of you contemplating a trip North, this is the airline to take) that they have a couple of times a year. The posted price includes return airfare + 2 nights accommodation. I just added an extra night - and, of course, got dinged the single supplement because it's all based on double occupancy. Ahem. Anyway...I have the money for this trip, but I guess I'm finding it a bit difficult to get my head around the fact I'm only going to be there 3 days. It does seem like a lot of money to spend just to get somewhere. But the total price is way cheaper than flight and hotel separately, so it's a good incentive. I have started a list of needs & wants, so hopefully this will keep any shopping insanity to a minimum (MMMM! Cupcakes on Denman...). I will, however, be visiting with friends I missed seeing on my trip Outside last year and I'm really looking forward to that.This is something D & I had wanted/planned to do after our road trip was cancelled, so there's some guilt about going on my own, but he's just got himself a new job away at a new mine - 3 weeks out, 2 weeks in - and can't go right now. He'll be gaining a huge amount of experience out of this (he'll be doing heavy duty mechanics), so I'm not in a position to say 'don't go'. That would be entirely counter productive and extremely selfish (although I want to...). He officially starts tomorrow, but has actually been working since Thursday packing supply trucks. I know he's a bit uncertain about being away from home for such a long period of time; he's a homebody. But you gotta do what you gotta do and this is a genuine golden opportunity for him.I am home today mostly because I've had an average of about 4 hours sleep for nearly a week. I have no idea why. There's obviously anxiety somewhere; my body is exhausted, but my mind is going at about 300 mph when it wakes me up and keeps me up most of the night. I spend time thinking about things that I have no control over, can be somewhat disturbing and that literally just do not stop. I've been able to function pretty well the past few days, but today it's catching up with me and I came home after being at work for only an hour. I don't want to make any big mistakes or snap at people or sigh or complain or bitch over the little things, which are the things that irritate me most right now. I can recognize this sense of anxiety starting up the week before my job became permanent, so I have a feeling that has something to do with it, although I couldn't tell you why I'd be anxious about having a permanent job with government. Anyhoo. I have a meeting to attend tonight, otherwise I'd be heading to bed about dinnertime!Sorry for the rambling post..."},

It's part of living in the North, where it's winter 8 months out of every year. You just deal with it and do what you have to do.I did, however, change the auto-savings amount for my Canada Savings Bonds yesterday. I happened to arrive at the same time as the representative from CSB was there! Ha! He said I made his day, which is always nice to hear. I upped my bi-weekly amount from $10 to $35. Not for any particular reason, but just because it's that much more I'm not spending. I still have to look at my auto-debit for my EF fund, too.

Hurrah! It's 60 hrs bi-weekly and is the absolute minimum I need to live on (and I can no doubt do more shaving with my expenses). I'm really pleased, as it means I don't have to think about the end of March, when the original term position was up. Whether I can afford a new(er) car or not is still up in the air at this point, but anything is possible and I am starting to look. :) I was talking to a co-worker yesterday about the changes (perm job, quitting the hotel, more time on my hands) and we agreed that any changes take some time to stick: whether it's a new job, new boss, or more free time! I'm finding myself still a bit antsy on my days off, but only because I don't have any fixed routines yet. I'll find my feet slowly, although I'm NOT complaining. My extra time will also hopefully allow me to take two classes at the college instead of just one, starting in January. It's still a bit early to see what's available, but I'll be registering as soon as I know.I talked to my sister this morning who asked me for a big favour. She was supposed to go to Edinburgh for her PhD studies starting this month, but the funding fell through and they've now postponed it until next year. Because they were supposed to be gone by now (and also because their landlord is very forgetful, forgot they were moving and so didn't rent out their apartment!) they are short on rent. So I've loaned them $1K to see them through. It hurt to take the money out of my Planned Spending fund, but as I'm going to get my new winter tires on Monday anyway, I transferred everything all at the same time. Poor fund! A solid beating in 5 minutes for sure, but I can't refuse to help my sister. I also couldn't say I don't want it back, because I do, so I did. But I'm glad all the same that I have the means to help (and that it wasn't much more than that!).Trip options for October (or November): 1 week in Victoria, staying with my sister & BIL and visiting/shopping. Cost: rtn air fare/ferry approx. $700.OR1 long weekend in Vancouver (rtn flight AND 2 nights hotel accom): $475.It should be a no brainer because these package deals are stupidly cheap, but I'm undecided.

Granted, it wasn't tens of thousands (or even hundreds of thousands) of dollars that I owed, but it was enough to be a weight around my neck and I am SO happy to have them paid off (and 5 years early). I'm awaiting the letter from Revenue Canada to let me know that I'm clear there, too.  I was also one of \"those\" people today; you know the ones. They put miniscule amounts on their credit cards. I had to sign some legal paperwork for my mother's lawyer in Victoria and paid $5.25 for the notary to sign & witness. Okay. I had the cash for that. What I DIDN'T have the cash for was the envelope and stamp to mail it! $2.91. I was 7 cents short! The debit limit at the post office is $5. ARGH! Can you believe it? I think this is payback for my smugness about NOT being one of \"those people.\" I registered for curling yesterday, too, which set me back $174.20 more than I had anticipated, however, it was a LOT of fun and I need to have some social time with my friends on a regular basis. I've joined a team with three Germans and a girl from France; she was determined to think of a name for us, so we called ourselves the \"Crazy Europeans.\" I have a British passport and while the Brits don't actually think of themselves as Europeans (although everyone else does...), it's close enough, as I'm only one generation removed. I'm surprisingly not too sore today - it was tougher than it looks. The balancing is the hardest part, but once you have a rock in hand, it's a bit easier. The rest is just lots of practice."},

I like having ONE debt payment each month, and a flexible one at that. I'm certainly not stressing out about things like I was before and because I got a larger paycheque today, I slapped down an extra $100 on my LOC, which makes me feel good.Canada Savings Bonds go on sale soon. I currently pay $10 per paycheque (indefinitely) through work and am considering upping that to about $25. It's after-tax deduction and is a really painless way to save, although admittedly the interest rates are pretty awful right now. I started looking at the website today and didn't realize there were two different kinds: \"C\" bonds and \"P\" bonds. The first are compounding, so although the interest rate is a little bit lower, the rate compounds and they can grow a little faster. They're redeemable at any time. The latter are premium bonds. The initial interest rate is a bit higher and the interest is paid annually, on the bonds' \"birthday\", so to speak. Both have a ten-year maturity term. But they're redeemable only once per year; a good idea for anyone who finds it difficult to save.My paycheque was $1302.48 this week. I think it's because the extra hours I worked are reflected on it, but that's okay. It goes a lot further these days anyway. I disbursed it as follows:Rent: $700Jars/allowance: $300 (Jars $260, Allowance $40)LOC: $150RRSP: $125TFSA: $50ING: $60Total in: $1302.48Total spent: $1385.00I had a couple of hundred left over from my last paycheque, so still have a bit of a cushion in the bank at the moment. I'm also writing up a list of wants & needs, as I've made some changes to my sidebars. I've realized I already had a house downpayment bar, as I'm saving $50 a month to an RSP which I can use for that. It'll be a while yet, but why save twice? So I moved the funds from that (ING) fund to my new computer fund, which I think is more reasonable.I'm going to use one of my TFSA's as my \"planned spending\" fund, as this year I need new winter tires. I've found a place (Fountain Tire) where I can get 4 for $500 (studded will cost me another $100) and this includes install and balancing, so is the best deal by far around these here parts! That will get done before Thanksgiving, as I don't want to wait until the snow falls before getting them done. I also need a decent parka; one of these, please! They're costly, but will last forever, so are well worth it, particularly on those nasty below 40C mornings.My \"rent\" TFSA is now my EF fund, as I get auto deposits in there and I'm comfortable leaving that exactly as it is.So. One more hotel paycheque tomorrow and that's it. I can't say I miss working 6 or 7 days a week, that's for sure, and already I'm getting into a routine that takes me dreamily through 3 days off each week. Curling starts on Sunday and tomorrow a friend and I are trying out an Aikido class. The curling will definitely stick, the Aikido I'm not so sure about, although it IS something that I feel I need to pursue (the self-defence aspect of it if nothing else). We'll see."},
{"title": "WANTWANTWANTWANTWANT", "date": "Sunday 13 September 2009", "text": "Jolie posted a similar post several days ago, although with a much more practical and less manic-sounding title. It's all about computers.My HP laptop is coming up to three years old. The part of this that is hardest for me to take in is the fact that it's considered outdated and essentially a very old piece of hard-working machinery. But, as in all things \"old(er),\" it's started to slow down a bit, think longer and harder about things, hang more than it should and just not allow me to work as efficiently as I know I could. So, I'm realistic in thinking that it's days are coming to an end. For me at least. I plan to donate it once I've got a new one, so it remains to be seen exactly how soon that will be.I've just discovered (last week, in fact) touch screens. This is the HP TouchSmart IQ526. It comes with everything: Vista, cable (to hook watch TV - it's already bigger than the one I currently own!), DVD/CD player/burner, 640GB, and and and. There's no tower. Everything is loaded right onto that 22\" wide, 2.5\" thick box. There's even a light. So you can type at night (it's the little things, right?).Nosing around on the Internet comes up with quite a variety of prices ranging from HP's own website which prices it at $1799, to Amazon.ca where you can pick it up for $1688. I found it at Staples - already on clearance! - for $1274 (+ 5%= $1337.70). So. If I asked D to go with me to see this, I know exactly what he'd say: \"I'd buy it.\" This is what I'm trying to avoid, as this is the second time I've gone by to see it and I very nearly slapped down the old, currently paid off, credit card and said \"I'll take it!\" But I didn't because my card limit isn't high enough to buy it. Ahem. Then there's the famous \"buy now, pay later\" which rang bells in my head as I remembered what Gail does to people who do that. Last time I saw TDDUP, she had all the items that weren't paid for taken out of the house!I know that if I buy it now, the price will drop further and I'll be wishing I'd waited. I also know that if I buy it now, I'll be back to square one with my debt payments. I guess I just needed to get it out there. It's a surprisingly good deal (considering what/where it is and that this is Whitehorse), but if it's meant to be, it will be. This is why I have this blog; so I can talk it out without judgement or guilt and get balanced, practical advice.(And I'm kinda hoping someone will say \"Ah, go ahead and get it!\")"},

Raise your hands if you can believe it's already (the middle of) September? No. Me neither!But it's my favourite time of the year, so I'm happy it's here, despite the fact that it means summer really is over - for the most part - and we're starting to get a lot of rain. It's definitely cooler and our days are noticeably shorter, too. At least the mornings seem to stay clear and it means I can walk to work.My last day at the hotel was on Monday. There were two of us working and I actually left an hour early because it was so quiet! No point paying two people to do a whole lot of nothing. Regardless, I feel it's somewhere I can return to if I wanted or needed to in the future, but right now I really want the time. I don't remember the last time my house got cleaned or I spent any part of a day just reading a book and now I can. I am also keen to be getting a lot more use out of my camera, which sits idle most days, simply because I'm not around to use it.One of the first things I did after leaving the hotel was to play around with my budget (muchas gracias to Fabulously Broke in the City for her amazing Excel budget! And so pretty....) and actually punch numbers into it to get an idea of whether I can live on one job. It turns out - with a few 'aha!' moments, some 'oops!' moments and some tweaking - that, yes, I most definitely can. I just have to be smarter with my money. This month I'm fine. Even after quitting the hotel, I still get one more paycheque from them at the end of the month, which will help. I AM going to carry over some cash in my account this month, because October and November are going to be tight and I want a little bit of a cushion.My auto-transfer to my LOC is all set up (I decided on $100 a month for now, instead of $150, just because it's tight some months), and I've also adjusted the monthly amount that gets transferred to my ING savings accounts. I've decreased it to $120 from $150. I'd rather save something than nothing at all, so $10 per account keeps me happy and also allows for a little flexibility when I have a month where I'm making more (or spending less!) and can add extra.So, my paycheques this week were dispursed as follows:Phone/Internet: $141TFSA (rent): $100 ($50 extra)RRSP: $150 ($25 extra)Hydro: $50 (I'm actually in a credit balance this month, and wanted to be next month, too)Savings: $135 ($75 extra)Gift: $50Jars: $260Allowance: $40Groceries: $37.04Total income: $1429.73Total spent: $963.04Total remaining: $466.69So...that, apparently, is that! It took me until today to figure out why there weren't more bills: I'VE PAID THEM. My student loan and my Rev Canada debt are GONE!! I also paid off my Visa card, but have since registered to have a monthly donation of $10 charged to it for the Humane Society. I'm fine with this, as that's something I can easily set up to have autopaid. It's for my charity of choice and right now is the best I can do, money wise at least, for them. When my LOC is paid off, then I will increase my monthly donation.I was invited to D's naming ceremony tomorrow (where he'll be receiving his Tlingit name), and I said I would go, but he heard the hesitation in my voice and told me I really didn't have to if I would be uncomfortable. There are going to be around 300 people there - this is just his dad's side of the family! - and he has duties to take care of (there's a potlatch and also the placing of his grandma's headstone), so I'd be left alone for a lot of the time. Okay, so I'm a big girl, right? This isn't about me, but is still hugely intimidating, although it would be a wonderful experience. So he instead suggested we go to his parents' house on Sunday for dinner, so I could (finally) meet them. I'm wondering now which event is less intimidating!"},
{"title": "A decision", "date": "Friday 4 September 2009", "text": "I went to the bank today to chat with my account manager. I've boosted my RRSP & TFSA contributions slightly, switched the type of chequing account I have (fixed fee of $9.95 p/month!) and asked her advice on something I actually had just thought of on my walk over.This, of course, could be something that a banker would agree to, so before I get too excited about it, I thought I would pass it by all my favourite PF bloggers for an opinion. I'm comfortable with the idea of doing this, however.Because my debt is now quite manageable (under $4K) I thought I would pay off my other debts - student loan, credit card & Revenue Canada - with my LOC, leaving me with one debt to pay down, instead of three. This also means I have just one interest rate to deal with (5.75%) instead of 3 or 4 different ones, and I can set up an automatic withdrawal twice a month to make a payment towards it. This will, I believe, work better for me now that I'll be down to one job and there will be months that I might need a little more cash flow than others.Other reasons that I've decided to do this now are because I have some specific things I need in the very near future: namely new winter tires/insurance for the car and I can put chunks of my paycheque towards those instead. As well, there is good news surrounding my job, which I will be for certain in about two weeks (and share, of course!). The government also has an annual bonus for its employees which is a travel allowance of $2042 per year. It takes two years initially to get this, and it's annually after that. February will be my first allowance, and the timing is such that I should be able to apply it to my RRSP, and apply my income tax refund to the LOC.It's basically a mini-consolidation loan without the high interest rate. I'm going to set a fixed monthly repayment amount of $150 and add more when & if I can. I am okay with this and the fact that it will take me a little bit longer to get completely out of debt.I hope everyone has a wonderful long weekend!"},

{"title": "Travel plans...OFF!", "date": "Saturday 29 August 2009", "text": "Travel plans for September have been, essentially, cancelled. D was called for jury duty - starting September 14, the day after we were supposed to have left for the trip. He tried to explain this, but short of mental/physical incapacity, he's got to show up. Whether this is for jury selection or for the start of the trial, I'm not sure, but regardless, it messes up the travel. So, my disappointment was profound, to say the least, but I've moved on. Obviously we just aren't meant to go right now, so this means that I can save up a little longer and have a little extra money to spend when we get there (wherever it happens to be).This also leaves me with more holidays to play around with and have taken some time in October & November. My schedule works in such a way that the Thanksgiving and Remembrance Day stats fall into a week where if I take only two days holiday, I get nine straight days off. So I've done that. Air North always has deals for long weekends Outside, so I'm keeping my eyes peeled for some around that time. It's not the same as the much anticipated road trip, but we can do that next year.My side bars have been updated and I'm really pleased with my saving progress, although I do admit to spending a lot, too. I just really have a hard time keeping my fingers off my debit card (so maybe I should take it out of my wallet??). I've bought a lot of stuff this month, including sending my sister some money to pay for shipping some pieces of furniture to me (I bought this from her and my BIL last year when I was visiting. Now that they're heading to Edinburgh, it's time for them to start clearing out). And as there are still several more pieces to come, I'll be out of pocket for that over the next few weeks, too. But that was part of the agreement I made with them - I got an outrageous deal on the actual furniture, and I would pay to have it shipped. I'm still keen for it to arrive, so I can arrange it and take photos. It's really lovely stuff!I've made an appointment to see my account manager at the bank, too, as my fees this month were nearly $40, which is outrageous! I realize I will still have to pay a fee for debiting and banking on my own account, but it will be a very small, fixed amount compared to this. I do my banking online and each time money is taken out of my account, whether to pay a bill, add to my savings, etc. I get charged (I think it's .65 - .85 per transaction) and I do approximately 25 - 30 transactions a month. I am okay with paying a fixed fee, as long as it's reasonable (less than $10 p/month), and this is what I'm aiming for with my account manager next week, as well as boosting my RSP auto-savings a little bit.So, this is how I used my last two paycheques in August:Rent: $700Gift Fund: $50LOC: $50Rev Can: $110Student Loan: $85Rent (svgs) account: $50ING: $150USD: $98 (bought at par from hotel)VISA: $67.96 (from travel a/c & planned spending a/c)Brakes: $40 (D is going to fix these for me and that's my share for parts)Jars: $260Allowance: $40Total spent: $1700.96Total pay: $2044.12 (both jobs)Total remaining: $343.16Total debt remaining: $3977.89Total debt paid: $312.96!It was a good pay day, as my overtime came through. I'm pleased to have so much left over, too. Although I realize it could be applied to my debt, I don't like having nothing in the bank. As well, my job at the hotel is winding up and I won't be working there after the Labour Day weekend (I put in my notice. I don't want to get up at 5:30am on -40C mornings anymore!), so I'll be losing $400 extra a month after that. If that hurts too much, I will go back to a second job, but right now I am learning to value my free time a lot more. It means that it will take me a little longer to get out of debt than I had wanted, but at least I'll be out of Rev Can's thrall by the end of December - with my extra $10 bi-weekly, it's really bringing the total down faster! Yahoo!I hope everyone has a lovely weekend! I've been enjoying reading your blogs, even though I haven't been around much. Always motivating and inspiring! :)"},
{"title": "Long Overdue", "date": "Wednesday 12 August 2009", "text": "It's been a crazy week trying to catch up on regular stuff, never mind the blog, so I'm going to try to do this now, so it's up to date and I can get on with a couple of other things I need to do today (also involving lots of email...).The weekend with the fire crews went, for the most  part, well, but was the cause of two meetings with my supervisors to explain what exactly happened and how I got there. I thought everyone was aware of this (I was told \"the email has gone out\"), so was sort of taken aback when even HR was wondering what the hell was going on. The weekend, being my own time, wasn't so much the issue as my taking the Monday as well. Mondays being what they are simply by virtue of being Monday, there were a couple of people off sick, and the communication wasn't as clear as it should or could have been and it left those working scrambling to fill slots. All I wanted to do was help, but one of my flaws is that very often I do, then think about what I do-d. In this instance, there should have been paperwork filed, approvals gathered, signatures signed and THEN I would have been allowed to go - it's technically a temporary assignment in another department, so there's a lot more involved than simply saying 'yes' to a phone call.Sigh. I really can (and have) put myself in a mess sometimes by thinking about stuff AFTER the fact, so I really have to tread more carefully. You know those habits or traits that are such a part of you that you just don't see them until someone points them out? Everyone has one. This is one of mine. And this is particularly relevant right now as the position I'm in just might become permanent very soon (we're not certain how exactly, but it's now 'out there') and apparently I've been \"pissing everyone off\"...Anyhow...live and learn, it's all we can do, right?I've updated my sidebars as today was the first payday in August. I didn't have as many bills as I normally do today, so managed to put a little extra to savings and am still waiting to see how much extra I can throw at my debt.I disbursed it as follows:LOC: 108.89Visa: 56.74 ($100 left)Rev Can: $110 (this should bring me down to approx. $900!!)Gift fund: $25Phone/Internet: $113.81 (ridiculous...)ING: $150 (extra $75 today)RRSP: $100TFSA: $50 (extra $20)Student loan: $25Total pay: $1070.84Total paid: $739.44Remaining: $331.40Total debt remaining: $4222.85Total debt paid (since July 29): $645.63!!I would love to bring this down even further by the time I leave for holidays in mid-September. I made a LOT of overtime last weekend and this will really help both bring down the debt and plump up the savings. I must also use my last hotel pay cheques wisely, as I've just put my notice in. My last day is Sept 7 (Labour Day) and will be heading down south on holiday after that for two weeks, but I want to be looking at, hopefully, less than $3K by the time I go. My TFSA will be used for my rent payment for October (this is exactly the purpose I'm saving it for), leaving my September paycheques solely for debt/saving/travel.The Revenue Canada payment is falling quickly enough that in the next couple of months, I might just throw money from savings (or LOC) at it to get rid of it. The extra $10 I'm adding each payday really does help, even a little, and according to my budget, it'll be gone by the end of the year if I keep this up, but if I can get rid of it sooner, why not? The student loan has fallen to $1712, and the LOC now stands at $1500. Both very reasonable, and doable, amounts. The travel plans are going well enough. I've booked hotels in Tofino & Vancouver and cancelled the one in Victoria, as we're now going to be staying with my brother-in-law, which is very kind of him. This is also much easier on the budget, as it means we can also eat most of our meals in and I can make sandwiches to bring with us during our days out.It's only a month away now! :)"},
{"title": "What a weekend!", "date": "Sunday 2 August 2009", "text": "I'm behind in my postings but catching-up is going to have to wait just a bit longer!I worked at the hotel on Friday (7-3), got home at shortly past 5 and made the \"mistake\" of picking up the phone when it rang moments after I got in. I'm now staying in the small community (pop. 400) of Teslin, about 2 hours south of Whitehorse and I'll be here until tomorrow morning, unless something changes in the next 12 hours.The phone call I got was from a branch of government I worked with a couple of summers ago and really enjoyed. They take care of the wildfires of the Yukon during the summer months and they are severely short staffed this summer and have lots of fires to contend with. So they put a call out for reinforcements and that's how I ended up out here. There are 5 fires around the area, creating lots of smoke, but fortunately contained on the far side of the lake, where there are fewer properties and other values. They are keeping a close eye on the movement and were up in the helicopters at least a dozen times yesterday tracking the spread.I arrived here at 11pm on Friday night and won't be going home until Monday morning sometime. I've had to inform my boss (who very kindly took on last minute cat-sitting for me!) that there's a chance I won't make the start of my shift tomorrow, what with briefing the secretary who's normally here (for something else entirely!), travelling back to the city, unloading my stuff/dropping off the vehicle I was given to use (a monster!), heading home to shower and then getting to work just won't happen for 1pm.Regardless, it's been great to be back among the crews and familiar faces, despite the fact it's all over tomorrow. I miss D and my cats and my nice cool bedroom back home and I was rushing to get organized so quickly I didn't bring a jacket with me (it's drizzling and cool today, but that's good for fires), a crossword puzzle book or even anything to read!! ARGH!! So I'm stuck watching satellite TV instead and there are not many channel choices, leaving me happy that I no longer have even cable to fuss over! When you've been away from it for so long, you really do realize that you're not missing a damn thing.  But...unfortunately, I am taking in the \"best\" that NBC has to offer in the evenings, although I wish the Knowledge network was available for those English mysteries I love.  Ah well.  My own fault for rushing, really.I have lists of spends to post at some point, but as I say, that will have to wait.  As it is, I'm sneaking in time to post this.  I will admit, however, that I spent $$ on three DVD boxsets the other day: S4 \"Weeds,\" S1 \"Saving Grace,\" (don't know much about it, but it's gotten good reviews and intrigues me) and S1 \"Trueblood,\" the Charlaine Harris Book-to-TV series which I'm VERY excited about as I love the books.Have yourselves a great weekend!"},
{"title": "Debt down! :)", "date": "Sunday 19 July 2009", "text": "Payday #4 allowed me to bring down my debt by another $110.  Not huge, but I have to keep \"baby steps\" in mind.  A little at a time is the only way the debt is going to go away.  Funny how that works, eh? You can rack up a fortune of stuff in a single day, and pay for your impulse for years.  Too bad I didn't learn that years ago, but ah well.  Here I am.  I regret that, but it would be far worse if I hadn't a) recognized my stupidity or b) done anything about it.  Compared to the old me, I'm a paragon of frugality these days.  With some debt and out-of-control-spending maintenance to go...My paycheque was $394.63 and disbursement of funds on Friday was as follows:LOC: $50Visa: $60ING: $75Gift fund: $15.00Spent: $200Debt paid: $110Savings: $90My paycheque is 6 hours short for the Canada Day stat, so I'm going to expect the difference on my next one.  Normally I have no complaints or problems (I only work one day a week), but for some reason I got the 8 hours at time & a half, but it shows only 2 hours of regular time when I was definitely here all day.I've managed to save an extra $90 so far this month, too, which is nice.  I'm going to modify my EF fund and cap it at $1750 for the time being, so that I can funnel another few dollars a month towards my debt.  I am also debating about taking some courses through Athabasca U in the fall which would require me to take out a student loan (if I'm eligible).  This is sort of a sore point because I've worked hard to bring my current student debt to a manageable level ($1800 - whoo!) and am loathe to bring it back up again.  Still...I'm thinking hard about this.The travel plans have changed a little bit, but not.  We've pushed our start date back a week, as D now has a ceremony to attend.  His grandmother died last year and the ceremony is to place her headstone.  I think all the grandkids are getting their Native names, too.  D is the eldest grandchild and his Native dress has already been made for him.  I told him that is not something he can miss.  No way.  I have no problem leaving a week later so he can attend this.  He was a little hesitant to tell me about it, but it made his mum really happy as well as the great-aunt & uncle who will be giving him his name.  I might have been resistant had this been, say, 5 days before our return date, but again, the point is not really when we go, just that we do.We saw \"Harry Potter 6\" last night in a very hot theatre.  I didn't actually notice the heat until about the last 45 minutes when it became oppressivly obvious.  The two theatres here are old and have no air conditioning, so they did what they could with two fans, which wasn't much.  What can you do? The movie was entertaining, but it's been so long since I've read the book, I barely remembered anything that happens, apart from the key points.  Still, it's as true to the story as it can be and I enjoyed it.  A good addition to the HP movie series!"},

My favourite days...well, okay, not really, but I DO like playing with my money a lot now that I understand it better and big dents have appeared in my debt over the past year.But first: Yesterday I celebrated three years in the Yukon! Already!! Perhaps \"celebrate\" is the wrong word. I acknowledged three years because it was too busy for me to do anything else! Ha! Still, I can't believe the time has gone SO quickly and I'm as happy now as I was when I arrived.Anyhoo...My pay today was $1169.44 (nothing apart from CSBs ($10) taken off, so a bit of a bonus) and I designated it as follows:TFSA: $55.00 ($30 auto, $25 extra)RSP: $100RevCan: $110 (+$10)LOC: $50 (min)Student Loan: $25ING: $75 ($12.50 to each of 6 accounts)Investor's Group (RSP): $50VISA: $148.80 (this has had a work out, but there's a reason for it)Gift Fund: $43.44Jars: $260 (this is my bi-weekly amount, but I might not need it all this time)Rent: $220Total spent: $1137.27Total remaining: $32.17I get paid from the hotel on Friday, too. Not much, but if I can bring down the debt by even another $50, I'll be happy with that.My debt stands as follows:LOC: $1800Student Loan: $1816.46Revenue Canada: $1130 (after this payment goes through)Total debt: $4746.46Total paid (since June 17): $451!!Hurrah (again!)!! I'm not counting my Visa debt at this point because the majority of the debt can be paid outright from my travel account. I've booked a hotel in Victoria already and have yet to look at Vancouver and Tofino accommodations, although I know which ones I'd like. Granted, paying for a hotel isn't like staying with friends (i.e. FREE), however, considering the time of year we're going, the prices are not outrageous either. The hotel in Victoria costs more than, say, the local Super 8, but it's downtown and within walking distance of literally almost everything we (i?) want to do, minus one or two things. There's free parking, too, so I figure we're saving a little bit on gas money by paying a little bit extra for the perfect location. Not that I don't know the streets of Victoria well, but just that I'd rather not drive them if I don't have to.Beachfront cabin in Ucluelet or Tofino? Why not? It's a holiday and sometimes it's worth it to spend a little more to have the waves lap at your toes first thing in the morning... :) And whale watching, too, as Sept/Oct is the best time to see the migration. I haven't done it for almost 10 years and it's a great experience.The little hotel in Vancouver that I'm looking at is self-catering and downtown on Robson St. It's the same price as the Victoria hotel, again, in the perfect location for walking everywhere.After that, I don't really have any idea where we'll be or stay. Edmonton one night, Jasper perhaps? I'd love to see the Columbia Icefields and drive the Icefield Highway.  I'm just thinking ahead...I'd really like to go NOW, but there are six weeks of work to face before we leave. *Sigh* But having to work allows me to do what I want, so I have to look at it like that.  I'm just so excited!!! :)"},

But I was relaxed, rested and happy during the time off because I didn't have to go to work.  It's SO nice to have paid holidays: I visited our local Wildlife Preserve, went riding & canoeing, did some much needed housework, saw about 3 movies, slept in...spent more money than I intended, but I was on holiday and that, unfortunately, tends to happen when you're on holiday...ahem....My first payday this month was July 1st.  My pay was $1083.38 and I distributed it as follows:Internet/Phone: $96.41MasterCard: $13.89Visa: $85.00Hydro: $44.03 (1/2 of what I was expecting!)Cell Phone: $54.63LOC: $115Rev Can: $100ING: $75 ($12.50 each to 6 accounts)TFSA: $30RRSP: $100Spending: $40Gift Fund: $10Jars: $260Other spends on that day:Tea @ Tim's: $1.92Hot dogs @ Bingo: $6.00 (hadn't eaten since the a.m.!

Except, of course, what's a day if you don't spend, too? I bought tickets for the (horse)world-famous Lippizzaner Stallions, who are coming for two shows on July 22! I saw them once before in Victoria - I've wanted to see them since I was a child of about 10 - and loved them, so when I heard they were coming here, of course I had to take the opportunity.  Very rarely do shows like this and of this calibre come up here, so it's well worth it to see.  The tickets are very reasonably priced at $27.50 each and I bought 5 for me and 4 friends.  I'm very excited to see these gorgeous horses again!D & I are also planning a two-week road trip at the beginning of September.  It's a bit last minute-ish, but we're going to Vancouver Island and coming back through Alberta.  I'm uncertain at this point what vehicle we'll be taking: if my sister still has some furniture for me then it would be better to take my truck, and if not, then we'll take D's car, which should be road ready by then.  This will be paid for, of course, with my travel fund, which I'm aiming to plump up to about $1500 by the time we leave if I can.  D is going to give me $250 from each of his paycheques to hold onto so he doesn't spend it beforehand.  I was actually going to suggest this to him, so was surprised when he called to tell me.  Hurrah! Not that I'm fantastic with money, but I'm better than he is, so this is a good thing.  I'm going to deposit it into my bank (interest bearing account not necessary at this point) and that way it's accessible at any time.Part of the trip is going to be through Alberta (the return portion) and we want to go to the West Edmonton Mall (I know, why?).  The themed rooms at the hotel are sufficiently tacky that we want to spend a night having some fun, although they are a bit pricey.  Still, it's a long drive home, so why not? :PI also bought my brother a birthday present.  For a very long time I've not been able to afford to send him anything (he currently lives in London with his very awesome girlfriend), so tend to go a little overboard these days now that I'm a little more 'flush.'  I know they have a small garden at their home, so I ordered a hammock & stand online for him through a UK company.  The conversion came to about $240, which I figure would have been cost + postage from here, so I'm fine with that.  After a mixup with the address, he should be getting it very, very soon!Today's spends are:Dry Cat Food (Eagle Pack Brand) 16kg: $50.14 (will last about 8-10 weeks)Drugstore: $17.39 (goat's milk soap, shampoo & conditioner)Groceries:Sourdough Bread $2.39(Family Pack) Chicken Breast $21.11Microfibre cloths x 2 $5.98Beef Stroganoff Sauce $2.69Cinnamon Brown Rice chips $3.19 (definitely a want, but YUM!!!

Granted, it was only $5, but still I was very pleased.  The prices really are pretty ridiculous, but you've got to eat, so what can you do? I could go to SuperStore, but the crowds turn me off, and the prices aren't THAT much better these days anyway.  But I've been looking for basil pesto and two places I've tried are totally sold out or didn't get any in.  Weird as it doesn't strike me as one of those items that everyone in Whitehorse would need all of a sudden, unless I missed something on TV...?I picked up an extra day - and stat pay to boot! - at the hotel, so I will make an extra couple of hundred dollars this month, which is a bit of a bonus.Have a great weekend everyone!"},

{"title": "Seven Things", "date": "Sunday 21 June 2009", "text": "I've been tagged by Frugal Dreamer to tell seven facts about myself.  I'm pretty sure I've done this before, but what the heck? Here are 7 more things...1) I loathe Tom Cruise (but I do like the word \"loathe,\" so having the opportunity to use it in the same sentence as \"Tom Cruise\" is great!).  Always have.  I've probably missed out on some good movies simply because he's in them (like \"Valkyrie\").  I just cannot watch him, look at photos of him, or anything! I also don't particularly like Julia Roberts.  Nothing specific, just...meh...2) I have a carpentry certificate.  I spent 6 months at trade school earning it.  It was great, but I couldn't keep up with the pace or the physical aspect of it, so I've left it behind.  It doesn't mean I can't/won't do this stuff in future, just that I'll never earn a living at it and I'm okay with that (I'm not a real weather fan, either: too hot, too wet, too cold, etc).  Plus I suck at math and carpentry is nothing if not math-centric! I honestly had to relearn the math every single day that I was there.3) I want to buy and live on a canal boat in England.  This is one of my long-term goals (5+ yrs) and I have idyllic images in my head of puttering around the canals of England with a couple of cats and a dog (or two) and teaching English as a Second Language as I go...4) I used to spend a lot of my time writing.  I've always written (not necessarily great, life-changing epics by any stretch) but lately haven't done anything.  When I moved up here, I wanted to spend more of my time actually experiencing things, rather than making stuff up for pretend people to do.  But now I have a lot of good stuff that I can put on paper for story-people to experience!5) I am a grammar & spelling snob.  I have tried to quell my \"auto-response\" to spelling & grammar errors, but it's so deeply ingrained that I simply can't do it anymore (I don't [always] do it out loud!).  I also auto-edit EVERYTHING, so much so that I never finish any writing and I've got about a gazillion \"bits\" of stories laying about everywhere, some of which are for the same story but which I simply can't connect.6) I bite my nails.  A nasty habit, but one I've had for as long as I can remember.  I've given up trying to stop because nothing works.  Long nails are impractical anyway, right?? Pretty, but impractical.7) I am inherently lazy.  With everything from work to eating to cleaning.  This is sometimes the reason for the gaps in my blog postings, too... :)So, there you have it! 7 new things about me.  Like Asian Pear and Arual, I'm opening this up to the floor and whoever wants to do it, can!"},
{"title": "Pay day!", "date": "Wednesday 17 June 2009", "text": "I've allocated today's paycheque as follows (I had some extra, so spread the wealth around a bit more than I would have otherwise):Total pay: $1309.30 (usual biweekly take home is $1023)RRSP: $100 - (will up it to 18% once I'm debt free)TFSA (rent account): $50LOC: $115Student Loan: $25Revenue Canada: $100 (as agreed)ING: $75 - $25 each to vet, travel & EF accountsVISA: $83.41Total paid: $548.41Remaining: $760.86I still have to take out $700 for rent, plus $40 for my allowance and $180 for the jars, so it doesn't really work out, but fortunately I get a paycheque from the hotel on Friday ($300), so I'm going to go ahead and take what I need from this for my jars & allowance. I've updated my sidebars to reflect my savings.After these payments go through, my debt totals will look something like this (Rev Can approximate):VISA: $200Student loan: $1869.76 LOC: $1985Rev Can: $1340Total debt: $5419.76Total paid (since May): $480.76!! (if I could make this flash, I would! Ha!)Wahoo!! AND there are 3 paycheques in July - 6 counting the hotel cheques (albeit smaller ones) - so I expect a bigger drop next month. The VISA will be paid off in full by the time it's due next month, as I have the money in my car account at ING and am waiting to transfer it.I have started a snowflake jar as well and already have about $80 in it. I'm going to use this for debt repayment, most likely the LOC, as that's the one I'm most annoyed about. I put the remainder of whatever I have left in my jars in there and it's surprising how quickly it adds up (I KNOW!).But I still have to stop spending so much money. It's just all over the place and I'm not keeping track as carefully as I was, so that has to change, too. Still, the numbers are a lot more positive, so that's definitely motivating!Yay me! ;)"},
{"title": "Update, having rethought my thinks", "date": "Saturday 23 May 2009", "text": "On the rails to the Summit - the US/Canadian border - from Skagway, AK, May 16.So. I am not as frustrated with myself these days, having read all the wonderful, level-headed suggestions from my last post and stepping back from it to try to relax a little. There's still some frustration present, but it's (currently) at a very manageable level, and I think as long as I keep talking myself around, I will be fine.I've just collected my updated debt totals and they look like this (Rev Canada still being a guess at this point):LOC: $2200.00Student Loan: $2073.52 (!)Rev Can: $1627.00This month's total debt: $5900.52(ish)Start of May total debt: $6275.00Difference: $375!So, progress! More than I thought, but not as much as I'd like. Regardless, I am pleased. I've managed to pick up several extra shifts at the hotel over the next few weeks, too, so that will help immensely, as will the three paycheques I get in July! I have also decided that I must put myself on an allowance. From my reading, it seems that $40 a week is a typical amount allocated with the understanding that you can spend it however you like, but once it's gone, there is no more.My spending over the past two weeks - from a quick review of my Gail Planner - appears to be 99% food related. Whether it's grocery spends or eating out spends, I'm spending an extraordinary amount of money to feed myself.Let's review, shall we?Dentist $140.00 (my bennies kick in Aug 1)Groceries/eating out $315.40 (since May 8)Ticket for train in Skagway $30.00 (reg pice $103)Gas $41.17 (should, hopefully, last me a month or more as I can now ride my bike every day)I paid for my friend's dinner in Skagway, as she supplied the car & gas and did all the driving, so I thought that was only fair ($50 US from my US account, the rest of which has been redeposited). I've also asked D to be a guinea pig for me as I attempt to learn how to cook, which he was quite happy to do. I CAN cook, it's just very unmotivational to cook for just me, so I just \"make stuff\" for me. It's actually kinda fun (I know!) and I've copied many dozens of recipes of simple, tasty meals for us to try out. The spicy chicken pizza I made the other night was a definite hit and the blue cheese stuffed hamburgers I tried out at a friend's BBQ last night were pretty good, but need a few minor adjustments (not least to use a different cheese, the mould thing is a bit disconcerting...).I've also been out enjoying myself and relaxing. This is a rare week in my new schedule where I had 3 days of work (one at the hotel, 2 at the library) and 4 off. It's been great! A day trip to Skagway, a trip to D's cabin south of town, \"Star Trek\" (WOW), meeting a friend for lunch yesterday PLUS a BBQ in the evening, sleeping in, reading...it's been wonderful. I've not felt this relaxed in a long time.I'm supposed to be meeting a friend for dinner & a movie (\"Star Trek\" again) tonight, but although she determined not to change plans this time, it seems to happen anyway. She has three kids and is a single mum, so her plans get changed without any notice. It happens. It doesn't bother me, because I know it's not intentional. She wants to get out as much, if not more, than I do, so I just have to call and confirm.I've also adjusted my side bars to reflect some changes; some positive, some not so much. I emptied my mad money & house accounts to pay part of my Visa bill and pay down my debt. I'm okay with this because that's what the mad money is for (spending \"madly\" on something(s) I want) and the house account is not really getting anywhere at this point, so once I've paid down my debt, I will focus more intently on this.As for making changes...I decided NOT to touch any other accounts to pay down the debt. At least right now. I feel more comfortable having my cushions in place than I would having to put it all on my credit card, then having to worry how to pay it off. Again. My friend's suggestion was to keep saving, but halve the amount I save each month and put the rest toward the debt. I was saving $300 a month and have halved that to $150. On top of that, I halved that, so that I'm saving $75 bi-weekly ($150 a month);$25 each to three different accounts each time. So once a month, each account gets $25. It grows more slowly, but still grows. I'm going to implement the allowance I mentioned above, and get seriously disciplined with my jars, using any leftover money to throw at debt instead of splurging at Tim's..."},

{"title": "Frustrated", "date": "Friday 8 May 2009", "text": "I am very frustrated with myself these past few days/weeks.  I have all the tools (and more!) that I could possibly need to get my spending under control and my debt paid off (before the year is out), but I seem to be lacking the one thing that I need most of all: self-control!My spending just goes on and on and on and on...so much at this point that I have no cash left in my jars (two weeks' worth gone 2 days after pay day - a record!) and just enough in my chequing account to cover my auto-withdrawals, but that's it.  The thought of 'no cash' makes me nervous.  I get antsy and then just feel the urge to spend MORE to compensate for my \"lack\" of being able to buy.I make new plans and change them.  I then change those plans and determine that I won't change them again...but only after I adjust this number or that amount.  Part of it is wanting to do too much all at once: I want to get out of debt, save for a house, buy a new(er) car, continue my studies.  I get too excited and end up failing at all of my goals instead of just plodding along with baby steps.  I've never been particularly patient in that respect.  I'm not alone, I'm sure.So I'm really struggling to stay focused at all right now and I think that's part of the problem.  I spend too much time \"thinking,\" instead of just \"doing\" and letting the proverbial cards fall where they will.  I have to be a lot easier on myself, too, and remember that it's not as easy getting out of debt as it is getting INTO it! My current savings (vet, travel, house, etc.) would clear my Canada Revenue bill or most of my LOC, so it's tempting to take that and apply it to my debt.  But then I think, I've worked hard to save that much to my accounts, so why should I? (Sense of entitlement, anyone?).  Never mind that I see the conflict in that while I'm saving, but still owe someone else, I'm not really ahead anyway, despite what I tell myself.If I add in my current EF savings towards repayment of my debt, I could get rid of two debts, minus about $100, leaving me with just one to tackle.  I'm not entirely comfortable with this as I don't really like the thought of not having an EF on standby, but I know that without debt, my savings will grow faster and better than they currently are (on trickle).Essentially this is what my debt/savings look like (not counting my RRSP as there's no way I'm touching that):Debt Total: $6275Savings Total: $3554 (incl EF)Debt Total if full amount applied: $2721.My mother has also said she'd give me some money towards a car: approx. $2500.  Assuming I applied that to the debt, instead of a car right now (sorry, mum!), then I would owe only $221! I could clear that in one paycheque.  I could, in a sense, be debt free by the end of May or June.I know you all understand my ramblings, so I'm asking for suggestions, guidance, thoughts.  What would you do? What have you done in the past? I know I posted a similar ramble a few months ago, but I this time I really need to make a black & white decision with respect to this because it's making me crazy."},
{"title": "Days 2 & 3 - Towards Health", "date": "Tuesday 28 April 2009", "text": "Days 2 & 3 of my goal opened much the same as they did on Day 1 - granola (apple cinnamon or apple strawberry) with either yogurt or milk.  I had a late working day yesterday (1 - 9pm), but walked to and from work because it's fabulous weather right now - it reached 17C today!!! - and it's light out until 10:00 p.m.  I also managed to lock myself out of the house when I changed to a lighter jacket, and cleverly left all my keys in my other coat pockets: house, car, work...argh! Fortunately the other tenant was home when I got back and he let me in!So I got in an hour's walk over the course of the day yesterday.  Today I walked to work and then walked with a friend after work, so got at least an hour in.  She called me up during the afternoon and asked if I wanted to go and I was glad she did.  We walked along the river and then had a coffee at Starbucks (sort of defeating the initial purpose, but it was a very nice visit and a beautiful evening) and have decided to do the same thing tomorrow evening as well.  She and I are similar in that if we don't do it without stopping at home first, we won't do it.  I think tomorrow I'm going to take my camera to work, so that I can get some photos of wherever it is we decide to walk.Spending hasn't been great, however.  Yesterday I bought two books ($49.30).  One is the German textbook that the German instructors at the college were using, and as I've decided not to take the distance education course at this point, I thought this was a suitable alternative (plus it's $685 cheaper than the Uni course) as I can work my way through it over the summer and be a little bit ahead of the game when classes start again in the fall.  This way I can practice with my friends and get some help with pronounciation and whatnot.  Obviously it won't be the same as with an instructor (homework and comprehensiveness-wise), but as I already have the basics down pretty well, it's a matter of just working my way through it and getting some clarification when/where I need it.The other book is one that I'm hoping will help me simply and set goals.  It was 50% off and so far I'm enjoying it.  It feels very timely (fitness, food, fashion, friends, family & finances: the author's six f's of simplicity) and there's a lot of good stuff in it (recipes, worksheets, etc.).Otherwise, some bad spending and stuff that I really need to pay attention to.  Stupid stuff like buying snacks and/or lunch at the cafeteria, when I could have spent some time during my days off to do a little baking.  I have to be more prepared and organized next week and make some things that I can freeze: muffins or mini-loaves, healthier snacks and make stuff for my lunches for the week.  I know this is where I fall flat (this and DVD box sets...) as I don't like cooking.  It's more unmotivating to cook for just yourself and my storage space is limited, which makes keeping large quantities of anything a challenge.  I still have loads of food in my pantry from my gigantic shop at the start of the year, so will start opening tins and making things like tacos, which...yum!"},
{"title": "Day 1 - Towards Health", "date": "Sunday 26 April 2009", "text": "Breakfast was Red Mill Apple Strawberry granola with a teaspoon of honey mixed with plain yogurt.Lunch was organic roasted red pepper hummus on sunflower seed bread. YUM! I'm also going to try to increase how much water I drink during this time, too. Basically from zero to, say, 5 or 6 glasses to start. I know I need to drink more, particularly at work where I get dehydrated very quickly.I went out for dinner with a friend for her son's 11th birthday and ordered a big old salad: a citrus chicken salad, so I'm feeling good about my choices. She even paid for it, which was nice as I hadn't anticipated that.I've decided to participate in Frugal Trenches \"10 Days Towards Health\" challenge because I feel I need to get motivated. I need to get out from under this inertia that set in over the winter. The idea is to watch what you eat and get some exercise each day and post your results (to keep you motivated because everyone's watching!).I didn't really do any typical exercise today: walking or biking or running, that sort of thing. I instead did some housework, vacuuming and scrubbing of the bathroom for an hour or so. I even cleaned the floor! I left one room un-vacuumed because the cats were sleeping/hiding in there, and I didn't want to disturb them more than necessary. So now I have one lovely clean bathroom and a freshly vacuumed carpet in one bedroom. Assuming it's nice tomorrow, too, I'll be walking to and from work as it's light out now until almost 10pm!"},
{"title": "Twice the pay, twice the paydown!", "date": "Thursday 23 April 2009", "text": "I get my pay stubs electronically and I had two waiting in my in-box at work on Tuesday, which initially confused me.  But I realized that instead of one paycheque, I was getting TWO! My previous position was two weeks behind; my current one auto-paid on the pay date for the dates worked.  This meant over $1400 EXTRA to use for savings and debt repayment.  Wow.I designated the pays as follows:RRSP (18%) - $446.86TFSA (rent) - $270Income Tax - $200 (owe $1770.00)Student Loan - $200 (owe $2425.25)LOC - $198.85 (owe $2600)Money Market a/c - $120Visa - $134.41 (zero balance)Rent - $300Jars - $280 (2 wks)Savings - $300I've updated my sidebars to reflect the changes and added my savings goals for my RRSP and my Rent account.  I started this at Big Bank to save money specifically for rent payments while I'm travelling next year (that's still the plan for now).  This is outside my EFund as I wanted to make sure I didn't fall short while I was gone.  The auto payment is set up for $30 bi-weekly, but I thought I'd get a head start and sock some money away while I had the chance.  This won't happen again, so it's best to take advantage of it.My income has fallen considerably more than I anticipated with this new position.  My take home pay for 60 hrs bi-weekly is $1043.  This includes benefits now, but still was a bit of a shock.  There are definitely areas I can still (and will have to!) shave in my budget, so I'm going to have to be careful from here on in.  I'm always willing to take on extra shifts, and while I still have the hotel job, it's only once a week and so isn't a great source of income.  I have asked about an extra shift here & there, but there's no guarantee, although not hiring new staff for the summer is taking a risk and is making the assumption that no one will quit, get sick or be generally unavailable straight through to October.I managed to get an awful lot of errands done today and I still have two days off ahead of me! This is actually really nice, although I do need to get used to having so much time to myself.  I ran around today so I can have some down time the next couple of days.  Just go for walks, visit with friends...D and I are planning a visit to Braeburn Lodge tomorrow evening for dinner.  It's about an hour and a half north and a nice drive.  We go on occasion and the food portions are ENORMOUS! I can eat exactly half of their grilled ham & cheese sandwich - barely.  It's all comfort food, grilled or fried, so not something you'd want to indulge in on a regular basis!And of course, I have to admit I splurged a little and bought some more DVD box sets.  What made it better, though, was that a) I went for the used sets instead of the new ones and b) that the used sets are on SALE! $5.99 per disc, so for 4 box sets I've spent $100.73.  After taxes it's a savings of over $40, so I think that's pretty good.  I could save even more and go to Wal-Mart, but I'm into my second year of boycotting Wal-Mart, so I won't.  Alternately, I could just NOT buy the box sets at all and save myself even more, right? I know the library has the entire collection of \"Midsomer Murders\" being prepared for use, so I have that to look forward to, as well.I learned today that at least two of the grocery stores in town are now charging for bags - 5 cents per bag! This is an (extra) incentive for me to remember to keep some reusable ones in the truck.  Even when I plan to go grocery shopping, as I did today, I never remember to bring them with me.  I've put 4 outside my door, so that next time I get into the truck, I will remember to put them there.Now that I have more free time, I also need to start thinking about some fundamental changes I need to make with respect to my eating habits, spending habits, general health and well-being and just letting go of a lot of stuff.  Spring cleaning everything - my physical house, my emotional house, and my home.  Part of the reason I work so much is that I don't want to take care of these important things (keeps me busy and away from too much time to just sit & think), but now I really need to start paying attention to what my body is trying to tell me - apart from that which I already know: I'm not 20 anymore, so trying to keep working like I am isn't doing me any good!"},
{"title": "So tired today... :(", "date": "Sunday 19 April 2009", "text": "Yesterday I was at the monthly dog wash at the Humane Society. Itâs a fund raiser for the shelter and is held every third Saturday. We usually have 8 - 10 dogs. Yesterday we had 16!! There was a line up of about 7 already when I arrived at 11:45 and they kept coming. We generally finish at 3 pm, but because people were still waiting, we kept going and finished up instead at about 4:15. Phew! Exhausting work, but we had a total of $310 at the end of it, so it was well worth it. There were a few of our regulars, too, which is always nice to see: Trixie, Scooter, D.O.G.This morning, however, I am still exhausted. I got three hours sleep last night! I went to bed really early (8:30), read for an hour and was asleep before 10:00. Next thing I know, itâs 1:30 and Iâm awake and Iâve been awake since! Needless to say, Iâm moving pretty slowly right now. Fortunately, itâs VERY quiet at the hotel today - there are only 5 check-outs left to do today, so I can take it easy, but I canât for the life of me figure out what woke me up and why I couldnât get back to sleep.Iâm supposed to be going to a dinner party with friends (a 20-min drive from downtown) that starts later this afternoon, but I doubt I will make it unless I get a really strong second wind at some point. It feels lame to make the excuse âIâm really tiredâ but I AM! Iâll see how I feel around noon and whether I think Iâll be able to make it or not. Iâm more concerned about the actual drive than whether or not Iâll be able to stay awake once Iâm there. And if I get a ride with someone else, Iâm dependent on them and when they want to leave. Itâs a shame as I was looking forward to it. I have let one of the other ladies know that I might not make it, though, so sheâll pass along the message.I bought some lovely organic bread and hummus, yesterday, ostensibly for the party. Now it seems Iâll have to eat it all on my own! We have a wonderful organic bakery in town that I need to start frequenting more. Itâs pricier, but some things are worth it. The owner is always phoning the library with various reference questions about nutrition, so he takes his baking very seriously. You can also sign up to receive organic fruits on a monthly basis (I think itâs around $65). Itâs all about sustainability, environmental concern and health.I also picked up lots of plain yogurt, as my breakfast of choice these days is plain yogurt, Red Mill Apple Strawberry granola and a teaspoon of honey! YUM! The Red Mill stuff is comparatively expensive, but itâs delicious! I particularly like the Apple Cinnamon Granola.I had my final exam on Thursday night and Iâm so relieved my class is over! I didnât realize how stressed I was until I got home and slept 9 solid hours! The exam was fairly straightforward, although I didnât finish it. That will hurt my final mark, obviously, but I did well enough throughout the class that I know I passed. I need to learn to summarize better; I think I just write too much. But I admit that at 9:25, with just over a half hour left, my brain shut down, I essentially lost interest and knew that anything else that I wrote would be utter garbage, so I took the hit and handed it in. The final essay that I struggled so much with and thought was going to be my worst, was actually my BEST yet (!) and boosted my average nicely. J Yay!I had considered taking a German class over the summer, but itâs too far out of my price range right now, so instead Iâm going to buy the workbook for the class at the college and use that to study with. Then I can sign up in the fall for the college course."},

Stepped away from the blog for a \"couple of days\" and a month later, I'm back.  I've been fairly busy, so will use the \"point form\" update method!I ended up buying new battery charger for my camera off EBay.  It was $67 including exchange (US$), shipping and purchase, which is $20 - $60 cheaper than I could find it anywhere else!My student loan sits at $2520, my LOC at $2960 and my RevCan at $1971.  Definitely feeling more motivated to get those debts gone ASAP and start rolling more money into my savings.I set up a new savings account at my bank and started transferring 18% of my pay into my RSP/Mutual Funds.  I have a lot of room to play catch up with that this year, so I might as well take advantage of it.One of my cats visited the vet; fortunately, he's fine, but the bill was $264! My vet account took a hit, but as I always say, at least I have it available to me!Ditto my truck.  The battery simply died one day and it cost me $284 to have it fixed.  Again, it's why I have my car fund! And it's particularly worth it because my truck is so old it's a constant battle to keep things running as they should.I had a final essay to write for class.  This one really threw me! It was on \"Saturday,\" the novel by Ian McEwan.  I don't normally read literature, so found it quite a struggle.  After changing my mind on the topic a couple of times, I FINALLY got it done and handed in on time.  I'm not overly pleased with it, but it's over!My cold is gone, for the most part at least.  It's still hanging around in my head a little bit, but I am very happy to have it gone! I could have had it a lot worse, I know, so I'm glad that when I get sick, it never seems to keep me in bed for days.  Two days on the sofa feeling miserable was enough for me!D and I went to Skagway, AK, for a day trip.  He had never been before, although has snowmobiled at the summit plenty of times! Skagway has a permanent population of approx. 842 and essentially shuts for the winter.  It's a port town, and the cruise ships jam in during the summer.  I've been when there are two ships in, but I dread the thought of more than that.  The streets are tiny and unpaved, the shops are mostly geared to tourism (even Starbucks was closed!) and although we had a fabulous lunch, that was about it.  We drove around a little bit, but then headed home.  Fortunately, it's only a couple of hours and the day was GORGEOUS.  We're planning a return trip for next month, after it officially opens, but before June 1, because neither of us has a passport!I received a piece of my furniture from Victoria.  A bedside table that I've had for a few years.  I think the next piece shipping is a shelf.I won the job I wanted at the library!! I'm really pleased.  The pace is slower at the front desk (it feels that way right now, at least!), and I'm learning how to fill my time.  I don't have any specific tasks to do yet, or a regular schedule, but I'm not in a hurry.  Everything's being worked out and I'll have a routine in no time.  This new job cuts my hours by 7.5 per week and my wage by $150 a paycheque.  While that does add up, I'm not worried as it still gives me plenty to pay the necessities as well as continuing to save regularly.  I'll have to adjust my savings amounts once I've recieved my first \"real\" paycheque and know how much I'm making.  I'm far happier with the fact that I now have a three-day weekend EVERY weekend! :)Our final exam is on Thursday night! Already! I have some study time planned with a classmate for tomorrow evening.  Just an overview and quick review.  The readings and memorizations I'll have to do on my own.  Wish me luck!!And that's pretty much it in a nutshell.  Apart from winning the job, which is the biggest news, I have to make a decision about taking a course from Athabasca, too.  I'm considering German, as I have lots of people to practice with (there are a lot of Germans in the Yukon and I know 4 or 5 of them), and I want to take a language other than French.  But the courses are very expensive, so I'm still trying to decide.Anyway, I hope you all had a wonderful Easter weekend.  Enjoy the last of it! :)"},

Granted, the Blackberry Pearl was cute, but the keyboard was so tiny I'd end up frustrated before I even had it a day. There was also a Sony and some other one, neither of which had the \"deer in the headlights\" appeal of this purple LG Reveal. Once I saw this one, nothing else stood a chance! I had earned, over the course of my three year contract with Bell, a $250 credit which I put towards the cost of the phone ($349), and by switching around my contract, I saved another $30. I forked over $52.45 (inc. tax) for it. I didn't actually save anything overall, as I then dropped my original plan to $25 p/mth (+$8.95 service fee and .75 911 fee). I then added a $20 \"fun bundle\" which includes almost everything but the kitchen sink! I can download music, use it as an MP3 player, have unlimited texting, 2.0 megapixel camera, blah, blah, blah.So, I've actually just increased the amount I pay per month by $10, when my original plan was to cut it back by at least that much. Hmm. I can change the \"fun bundle\" (decrease it to $10), but will try out my new over-the-top contract for a month and see how it goes from there.But my phone is pretty...I've driven only one day this week, and will manage not to drive tomorrow or Saturday either, which is great. It has, however, been a VERY spendy week:MondayBook $10.50Cat food $6.35 (12 tins, using Superstore \"Superbucks\") + free bag of dry!TuesdayChinese delivery $63.09 (for me & D, who says he'll pay for the trip to Skagway on Tues in return)WednesdayVisa payment $99.49 (up to date)Tim's $3.48 (tea & danish. I heard today that someone in Yellowknife won a car yesterday...)Stamps $5.67ThursdaySandwich $6.95 (lunch...some sort of Greek wrap. Ick. Olives...)New phone $52.45Tim's $1.92 (tea)AND I'm also going out for an Indian food dinner tonight (some of my favourite, although I've not tried the restaurant here yet). It's a friend's birthday tomorrow, so there are four of us going. One has never had Indian food before, so this will be fun. I took out all my jar money this morning, so have to divvy it up when I get home. I'll be a bit short in a couple of categories as I used cash to pay for the phone, but it'll be fine overall.I have an interview tomorrow morning (oral component and Part 2 of the one last week), so fingers crossed. I need a good sleep tonight, so it'll be an early one for me."},
{"title": "Moving money", "date": "Saturday 7 March 2009", "text": "Since I decided that I was going to pay just the minimums + 15% on each of my debts, I've adjusted my auto-savings accordingly.  I currently have six accounts at ING: EF, vet, travel, car, house & mad money that get auto-paid every two weeks.  I've messed with these before (and I probably do it too often, actually), but today, with the help of the handy dandy on-line \"goal getter,\" I have set actual goal limits on my accounts.  This increases my savings to $1200 a month from the current $550.Emergency Fund - $1500 (goal reached: March 25)Mad Money - $750 (goal reached: May 4, 2009)Travel - $1000 (goal reached: Nov 30, 2009)Car - $1000 (goal reached: June 29, 2009)House - $1000 (goal reached July 27, 2009)Vet - $1000 (goal reached: June 29, 2009)My plan at the end of March is to stop saving to the Emerg Fund.  I really think that $1500, for me, is sufficient for now.  Once that $200 is available, I can leave the rest of the accounts as they are, add a little to each pot to reach my goals faster OR (and this is probably the best idea) attack my debt, as it's just gone up by $2,121.21 which I now owe in taxes. **Sigh**Hmm.  I also REALLY need to get a self-managed RRSP, so I can transfer 10% to that as well.  I've not contributed anything since I moved my RRSP at the end of January and I need to get on top of that again...that would explain the 'extra' cash in my bank account each payday.  Ahem...This means the Magic Jars are even more important and necessary to these plans.  Now that I actually understand the way they work (this took watching of several seasons of TDDUP to, if you will pardon the pun, have the penny drop) and we have our own mini-version of the Budget Binder in the Gail Planner, this shouldn be relatively painless to keep on top of.  I have decided to take out two weeks worth of jar money at once (saves me dumb bank fees).  It's surprising how quickly the funds in the jars build up! I'm doing my best to take lunches to work everyday, not use my debit card (1x since March 1), use my gift card at Tim Horton's (won a donut and another coffee! Woot!!) and have spent very little cash in general, which I'm really pleased about.I spoke with my mum today, too, and as it's my birthday shortly she was asking if there was anything in particular I'd like.  Like Christmas, I couldn't think of anything specific, so once again she's going to give me some money, which...yay!Now I'm off to make muffins so I have snacks for work and another pot of the yummy oatmeal I made last week."},
{"title": "Que sera, sera!", "date": "Sunday 1 March 2009", "text": "If it can make Doris happy, then surely it can work for me, too!I was messing around with my taxes last night and it seems that this year I owe.  And owe a fairly substantial amount.  Even with the Northern Living Allowance deduction and my RRSP contributions itâs still over $2K! :(This is because of all the overtime I earned last year.  When I first saw my T4 I was like âWTF?â My second thought was, as Gail would ask, âWhere did it all go?!â Two steady jobs last year, a grand total of almost $65K and I STILL HAVE DEBT.  *Shakes head in despair*.  Obviously my finances need major work.  But thatâs also why I started to blog last year; to track my spending and find out where it all goes.  I find my inspiration and motivation through YOU guys!Still, despite this news, I am not in the same position I was last year, either.  I now have savings accounts; RRSPs; some mutual funds; plans.  Having to pay taxes is definitely a big step backwards, however, as I was hoping for a refund to apply to my debt.  Now Iâll have to tighten my budget even more.What can you do, eh?The Gail-ism for the beginning of March is: âCrap happens. Thatâs life.  Itâs how you handle it that separates the winners from the losers.  An Emergency Fund is the best tool for dealing with crap.âWould this qualify as crap? If I took the money out of my emergency fund it would be $1350 less debt Iâd have to sit on over the year.  But that would also mean I have nothing left in my EF fund for any other emergencies that might crop up.  Hmm.  Thoughts? Should I dip into my EF to erase half the income tax debt? Iâm certainly tempted.Otherwise, I thought Iâd best post some goals for March.  I need some motivation and focus outside of work and school.March goals:1.  Walk more (this shouldnât be a problem)2.  Starting this month pay the minimum + 10% on my student loan and LOC (plump up vet, travel, car & EF fund, if I donât drain it for income tax) for seven months3.  Continue saving & rolling change; put in gift fund or towards debt4.  Change my banking.  I still have an account on Vancouver Island and it just grows ever more inconvenient (never mind that Iâm not allowed access to it in PERSONâ¦), so I am going to close it and move everything to my current Big Bank.  This will include setting up an auto-deposit to my RRSP or one that I can manage myself.  Or both.5.  Keep looking for my battery charger!!6.  Clean, tidy and de-clutter my apartment.  Itâs surprisingly tidy, but thereâs still a ton of crap laying about that I can get rid of.7.  Keep an eye on this website for a reasonably priced car.  This way I could get a visit in as well as a new vehicle.  But this won't be for a few months yet.  I've sent some questions, though, and I know they're on the up and up, so it's an option.  But I want to see if I can save a decent amount in the meantime.I also made a nice oatmeal in the crockpot overnight.  I decided to keep my small one as well, and this was a recipe I got from my new book.  It was actually very tasty (it includes cranberry juice & apples), albeit a bit runny as I added a little more water than was required.  Still, crockpotting apparently takes a bit of trial & error, and this was definitely a new thing for me.  But it saved me buying my breakfast this morning!"},

I just haven't really felt like it...I'll use the \"point-form\" technique that Frugal Trenches used several posts ago.Had my mid-term at school last week; not sure how I did, but I wasn't overly happy with it. I have to find out exactly what a \"critical commentary\" is and work on learning how to do one. Having said that, however, the instructor said he was being a bit lenient because there were \"a lot of people\" who didn't quite get it. So, I may have done better than I think.I can't for the life of me find my camera battery & charger. I bought a new battery, but it doesn't do me any good if I can't find my charger. The batteries cost $130 each. I remember taking the set off the wall at the old place and putting it...where...AGH!!The US travel is off, at least for this year. We are not allowed to take holidays at the hotel from May through September, which...okay, it's high season and fair enough. I'm not as disappointed as I could be or as much as my friend is, though. This means I won't have to save for a new car, 3 months worth of rent or the trip - all in 5 months! I am, instead, going to take at least one, and hopefully two, classes starting in the fall.It's \"Roll up the Rim\" time at Tim Horton's again! I've already won 2 teas! Granted, my visits increase by at least one extra a day, so it's not like I'm saving money here, but it's FUN and Tim Horton's is my one splurge I won't give up for frugaldom.I'm not missing cable at all! In fact, I sometimes forget I hav a TV. I've been so busy working on school projects or reading or playing computer games, I barely notice it anymore. I'm glad I cancelled the cable!I've managed to put an extra $300 on my student loan this month and an extra $250 on the LOC!I got an A+ on my play review at school! :) And an 'A' on my first essay!!I have started the Magic Jars again and am using them (as of today, but still...)I'm still keeping and rolling my changeI will review my personal and financial goals at the end of March and see how I'm doing with my New Year's resolutionsI am considering going down to minimum payments on my student loan and LOC for 6 months, so that I can plump up my travel, car, vet and EF funds instead. It will mean a bit longer to get out of debt, but I will be happier if I have slightly healthier accounts, too.I love being able to walk to work! I have 3 or 4 drive days a week, sometimes less. Once it's light from 6am - 9pm, I'll be walking everywhere. It's still a bit chilly once it gets dark out, although I do have to say that walking to work in -30C is...bracing.I made a $50 donation to GreaterGood.org to support the care of animals affected by the bushfires in AustraliaI have to start doing my taxes, as I finally have all my paperworkI have another job interview this week - fingers crossed for me!I broke down and bought a printer for home (it was on my Wish List)I'm going to post some goals for March tomorrow I hope. I need to focus again. February was a bit strange, as I didn't feel at all goal-oriented or particularly motivated to get anything done. But the weather is finally warming up and we have almost 10 hours of sunlight a day now (sun rises at about 8, sets about 6:30). While the river won't start thawing for at least another two months, at least it's more pleasant to walk and be outside.It's been nice to keep up with all of you, though, over the past month. So many great goals out there!"},

I know I, for one, am glad January is over and I can be a bit more focused and relaxed about things. I need to spend time and organize my finances much better, putter about the new apartment and re-arrange and clear a few things out, and re-organize my life in general.I was still sick on Tuesday but went to work for a half a day and despite thatI managed to get everything moved into my new place by Friday afternoon and was unpacked and had it all in place (apart from two boxes) by later that night! I sure surprised myself, but that left me ALL weekend to do not a lot, which was a real treat. My Internet didnât get hooked up, so I played a game, watched some DVDs, did a little reading, a laundry and a GIGANTIC grocery shop.I put my name down for GMBMFBâs February grocery challenge, but totally blew it (before the month even started!). I spent almost twice what I wanted to spend!

I reckon I have 3 â 6 months worth of stuff here if I use it appropriately. Produce will be bought and used as necessary.You have no idea how I envy all of you who have so many options for cheap grocery shopping, Grocery Liquidators or whatever. The prices up here KILL me. SuperStore is probably the cheapest option and even that can be depressingly pricey at times. Despite that, I can do much better, I know it.The money from my down payment fund has been applied to my LOC and Iâve paid off my VISA â again â as I used it last week when I was paying for Elmoâs vet charges and euthanizing. Grief doesnât necessarily allow for the best decisions sometimesâ¦Iâve updated my side bars to reflect the changes, but despite this, Iâm still ahead in my net worth (a very little bit, but a little bit is better than nothing!) for the month. My debt now stands at $6,465.00 which is reasonable but still needs focus to get rid of. Itâs time to focus on âThe Jarsâ again and get myself out of debt asap.I spoke with the Internet service provider again last night because my Internet still isnât hooked up at home. I also requested that it be pro-rated for the time itâs not been active because Iâm paying for the service and someone on their end has dropped the ball (since last Friday actually). Ah, that there was a competitor to switch to, but there isnât. We now have ONE company that offers two sorts of Internet service (cable and DSL) but for the same price, so switching would be pointless. Itâs a little frustrating to say the least!I just found out that I didnât get the job I applied for. I had the interview last Wednesday morning and am going to see the HR advisor about it Friday morning. I came in second and she assured me that I did really well, but that someone who has worked in the position before got it. I am going for a post-interview to find out where I went wrong, but she wasnât sure how much information she could give me to improve (I did that well, which is very encouraging!). Iâm okay with how this turned out, actually, because I still donât know what I would have said if I had got it!"},

{"title": "Updating", "date": "Saturday 24 January 2009", "text": "I've spent the past days getting caught up things and thinking about the always excellent and thought provoking advice and ideas re: paying down my debt.I've decided - after reading all your advice several times - that I will take my house down payment amount and put it on my debt. My financial advisor said the same thing, and paradigmshifted made a good point in that once the debt is gone, savings build up incredibly fast. I'm going to save it until early Feb, after my interest and auto deposit go in, then transfer it and put it on my LOC.I moved some more things over to my new place today with the help of a friend and we went for a coffee afterwards. I bought D a Quizno's sub for lunch and dropped it off for him at work. His truck broke down in the road this morning, so I had to drive him. His brakes had locked on him, so he had it in the shop by the time we got there and was working on it. It was a slow day for them, so fortunately he has the know how and the tools at the shop to be able to fix this sort of stuff.It's been a pretty spendy week, and I've just finished the $200 I took out at the beginning of the month. Not bad - it lasted me about three weeks! However, because I'm in a bit of a state of flux with the move, my routine is a way off as far as making food goes and this, I hope, explains why it didn't last the whole month. I've kept only the bare essentials here and that has meant I've bought breakfast every day, although I have made lunch: a pb & jelly sandwich almost every day for two weeks, but I'm okay with that. Once I'm moved in, I can pick up my routine - or perhaps a better one! - and start making sure I've got plans and food for EVERY meal...and not just pb & jelly which let's face it, while tasty, is not exactly the best sort of meal I could be giving myself! :POne of our grocery stores is shutting down (after 37 yrs in business!) because, ironically, it can't compete up here. We only have 5! But SuperStore is the biggest competition and it's simply not viable anymore. It's a shame as they have great produce, but admittedly I haven't shopped there as frequently as I could have. Starting on Feb 1, they will be discounting their prices, so I'm going to go and stock up on tins, bread, cat food/litter, that sort of thing. Along with many other people, I'm sure...I do feel somewhat guilty about taking advantage of another's misfortune, but why not get a deal where you can, right?I have an interview on Wednesday morning for a new job, and there is a competition on the go at the library that I'll be applying for, too. In the meantime, my current position will most likely be extended to the end of February at this point. I'm actually ready for it to be over, to be honest, but I'm not going to turn down a few more weeks of full-time work, either. It's a little frustrating to be in a position that, on paper, looks great, but that can actually be quite exhausting. The interview on Wed is another supervisory position in a different department. I'm trying not to think too far ahead (i.e. what if I get it?) and look at the interview in and of itself as experience.But I have an essay to start. My instructor told me not to panic about this first essay and to see how I do when I get it back, but there's a little part of me that is grateful he's given me this chance to \"step up\" and that I have to prove something to him. I think I need to just keep the gratitude and put the need to prove aside as it's getting in my way. The fact that I'm feeling motivated and enjoying the class should be what fuels my drive; plus a little of that \"need to prove\" which I need to internalize and use it to prove to myself that I can do this. Because ultimately, I'm the only one who'll be let down if I don't."},

My student loan is $2982, my LOC $4602.  Both have the exact same interest rate - 6%.  I have just over $1K sitting in my house down payment account and I'm debating whether or not it's worth it to pay off some of that nagging debt.  The student loan is a fixed loan, the LOC a revolving loan.

{"title": "Frankenstein", "date": "Monday 19 January 2009", "text": "I'm definitely feeling better today, although I wouldn't say 100% yet, but at least I'm more mobile, my fever and achiness has gone and my head is a bit clearer.  I'm lucky in that I generally get really sick for about a day and then it seems to move on.  I think the Ibuprofen I took when I got up helped, too.I've been prompted to write a review on \"Frankenstein\" by Arual, who is currently reading the book.  I have to admit here - like I did at the show - that I've never read it, so don't really have a good insight to any comparisons! Having seen the show, though, I think the book is going on my \"to do\" list.  That's just to keep in mind as I don't know how Mary Shelley originally wrote the characters.The basic review:The production was put on by the Catalyst Theatre, from Edmonton.  There were 8 actors who played a total of about 40 characters in total.  It could have been very confusing, but it was beautifully done and we were able to follow along with no trouble at all.The sets and costumes were very minimal, organic and Seuss-like in nature.  The costumes and sets were mostly white - only a few characters had any colour to them - and seemed to be made of paper (the odd bit would fall off and they rustled slightly), which allowed the lighting to create quite dramatic effects.  The first set consisted of the players and one very simple representation of a chateau.  Lighting was kept to a miminum as well, so you had no choice but to pay attention to the actors and the story as it played out.  The accompanying music was a beautiful mix of classical and modern and the story played out as part poem and part opera.  By all accounts it was a really unique and modern take on a classic gothic story, almost balletic in parts.The second set was my favourite.  This was the graveyard where the trees and grave markers were very Suess-like, again, all white.  The trees were tall, curly and slender and this is also where you met the monster for the first time, albeit briefly.  The lighting and the accompanying music were what really set the mood for the darkening theme, which I really liked.  While some shows rely a lot on background sets, this was simple and very effective with the \"less is more\" theme.  One scene towards the end has the cast carrying umbrellas; old umbrellas where most of the material has been removed and there are \"pom poms\" on the end of the metal arms.  It's a sombre scene, made a little lighter with the fun props.One of the final sets was simple gauzy material strung up to represent mountains, forest and the memory of a town square.  In between, when there were no sets, per se, simple props filled in the blanks: a metal table and a light acted as a laboratory, for example.I'm not sure about everyone else in the audience, but I was mesmerized from the beginning.  The characters, apart from being \"real\" were also quirky and fun.  It was a unique take on a classic \"horror\" film/story, but you really got the idea behind the story.  Who was the real monster? The creator or the created? All the monster wanted was love (from his creator, his \"father\", at least), yet people hated him because of how he looked.  It's a statement of something people have always done - judged others based on how they appear.They deserved every moment of the standing ovation they got.Not the greatest review (I need some practice, I know!), but honestly it was a simply amazing play, wonderfully acted and truly unique and if you ever get the chance to see it, I highly recommend it. I was at work, but I'm home now.  I woke up feeling awful, but had committed myself to go to work today, however, I only lasted about 2 hours.I had to buy some Neo-Citran on the way home (the only GOOD thing about being sick - I wish I could drink that stuff anytime!), and will be spending the evening curled up with cats, DVDs and hot drinks.I will also have tomorrow to sleep, curl, watch, drink, sleep...Sometimes you just have to take the time to get better, and not worry about missing a few hours work.Blah..."},
{"title": "Another week gone!", "date": "Sunday 18 January 2009", "text": "The cold I was dreading hit me full on yesterday evening, but I gamely dragged myself to the play with my friend (SORRY EVERYONE!). I was running on Dayquil, which I realize is just a bandaid solution at the best of times, but it served its purpose and my sniffling and nose blowing was minimal. Too bad it does nothing for a foggy head! :(Anyhow, the play was simply wonderful! Although it was too dark to take notes during the course of the show, I did manage a few during intermission, but I will really have to think and work on the notes to create a worthy review. My friend and I - actually the whole audience - were mesmerised by the performance. It was balletic, poetic, operatic, original, funny...The sets were relatively simple and they let the words and the performers tell the story instead. There is a review in Friday's paper, which I am going to ignore for the present, as I don't want to be influenced by someone else's view of the same play. I will, however, find a few other play reviews and read them so I get an idea of what I need to create.I spent yesterday packing up most of my food (dry goods) and taking it over to the new apartment. I did my recycling and also stopped to pick up several items that I needed (they're in my Gail Planner on my wish list, so they're legit! :P ) A 16' cord for the plug-ins when the temperature drops again (and it will). My 6' cord isn't nearly long enough for the new place. Two drying racks, cat litter and a filtered water jug (like the Brita). My budget for all of these was $100.00. It went on my debit card, however, but I like the fact that I was dead-on, so I'm not going to beat myself up over my slip.CostsTwo drying racks @8.49 ea: $17.00 (original budget: $40)16' cord: $24.99 (original budget: $20.00)Water pitcher/3 filters: $51.98 (original budget $40)Cat litter: $6.49Total spent: $100.73Granted, the cat litter wasn't on my list, but as it's always a necessity, I picked up a container because it was cheap.I also watched a few TDDUP episodes online (Season 6) and decided that I need to seriously re-commit to the Magic Jars. To that end, I am going to work on budget over the next two weeks. Until I move and get myself settled, there are going to be a couple of estimated costs, but my plan is to start with a $500 p/mth budget and trim it from there. That should be more than sufficient for a single person to live on.According to the \"What You Owe\" spreadsheet on Gail's website, I need to dedicate $670.02 to my debt to be clear in a year. That will clear my full debt of $7585.16. One option is to pay the minimum on the LOC and throw the $670.02 at the student loan. And if I did that, according to MY calculations, that would make me student loan free in just under 4.5 months! That's not counting the fact that tax time falls in there and if my tax return is anything like last year's, then I'll actually be able to apply some extra $$ to those debts and get them paid down sooner.Hmmm. I may need to get that 3rd job I've been contemplating after all..."},
{"title": "Tired, but better", "date": "Friday 16 January 2009", "text": "Thank you everyone for your kind thought for my sick kitty! He appears to be feeling a bit better the past couple of days and is more himself, but we're still awaiting the test results, which should be here next week. This week has gone very slowly - I can't believe it's \"only\" Friday!I'm trying some alternative healing for Elmo as well. The Bodytalk practitioner I saw in Victoria is doing a couple of long distance sessions for him and I'm hopeful they'll at least make him a bit more comfortable. The evening of his first session his ears were very warm to the touch; hot almost. Bylaw's ears by comparison were cool. He's also eating and drinking again - not much, but it's something. I sat with him this morning for a few minutes, but only wish I could spend more time with him.But I'm definitely making progress in other areas, which I'm very excited about!I had my first English class last night and am happy to report that I REALLY enjoyed it. This was a pleasant surprise as I've always hated English, but I am a different person than I was in high-school (hopefully, aren't we all?), the instructor was great and because I'm more interested in writing and am reading a far more varied \"diet\" than I was at 17, and have more of a purpose to be there, it made a huge difference in how I participated in the class and what I got out of it. There are only 13 of us and I was happy to see I wasn't the oldest person in the class after all! :P I'm floundering a bit simply because most of the students have the experience of the pre-requisite course where all the building blocks to writing essays, critical thinking and analysis are set in place, but I'll be fine now that I understand a bit more of what I'm supposed to be doing.One of the requirements is a play review, which should be fun. A friend and I are going to see a production of \"Frankenstein\" tomorrow night, which already has some excellent reviews. I have to take my notebook with me and hand in my review by the end of the term. Doing this early and getting it over with is part of my motivation, but it's also nice to just get out once in a while and also to spend time with a friend. She's actually treating me to the play because Elmo is ill, which is sweet and very much appreciated. :)Today I also cancelled my cable for February 1, and adjusted my Internet service a bit as well. The biggest reason for cancelling the cable is that I watch far too much of it. I can't not watch it, and I've tried! The second is the cost: $60 a month and I watch - mostly - one channel, so it's simply not worth it. There's also the fact that I need fewer distractions while I'm doing my studies (shiny things and, well, really just about anything distracts me like you wouldn't believe) and that HGTV - my one channel of choice - now streams full episodes ONLINE. :)I've saved another $1K towards a down payment on a house, put an extra $100 onto my student loan, paid my VISA in full as of today (!!!) and have modified one of my financial goals with respect to that. I will only incur any debt on the VISA card if it's school related or it's for my charitable donations that I want to make on a monthly basis.I have a lot going on this month and am feeling quite tired; moving, starting school, Elmo and now I feel a cold or something coming on. :( I'm using my Gail Planner and have several lists of things that I am slowly checking off (mostly to do with my move, but still!) and that feels like an accomplishment in itself right now. :)So:SavingsCancelled cable: $60 p/mthDowngraded Internet: $20 mthHalved auto savings: $150 p/mthPaidVISA: PIFStudent loan: $100 extraRemaining: $2982.38Have a great weekend, everyone! :)"},
{"title": "A good/bad spend day", "date": "Wednesday 14 January 2009", "text": "I'm a bit exhausted today.  Yesterday was a bit of a crazy day and it's carried over to today.On Sunday evening the tow truck showed up to get my truck.  I had a call from the driver about 4:30 who was on his way out of town for another pick up and would get my truck on the way back, as he was dropping that pick up off elsewhere.  I left the key on the seat for him and he showed up about 6:30 and off she went.My friend picked me up yesterday morning and took me and Elmo to the vet for our appointment.  The vet was concerned enough about Elmo to keep him for the day.  I found a nasty looking ulcer/tumour looking thing in his mouth last week - the reason for his visit - and she wanted to get a sample for a biopsy.  While I was waiting for my friend to pick me up, the shop called to let me know that my truck was ready - for the grand total of $125.12!I was really pleased that it was so fast (I had called them at 9:00 to let them know what the problem was, and they called me at 10:30 to say it was ready!) as I had to go to the college for my meeting with the English instructor.I registered for my course (my first class is Thursday night! Exciting!!) and bought my books, so I'm all set to go.  I haven't missed anything, so I don't have to scramble to get caught up at least! I'm actually in a course higher than I should be in, but I have to go back and do the 100 level courses when I can because I can't move forward without them.  The course times just aren't very conducive to those of us who work full-time, as they're morning classes... :(Anyhow.  The day took a decided turn for the worse when I got a call from the vet informing me that Elmo most likely has a tumour, oral cancer.  Speaking with her later when I went to collect him, there wasn't much better news.  Oral cancer is very aggressive and neither surgery nor chemo are worth it.  I wouldn't subject him to chemo anyway.  So really there's nothing that can be done for him.  I forced some sandwich meat into him earlier and he's finally sleeping quietly after 24 hours of being wide awake.  He's just not eating much at all.  It's basically a matter of time and the biopsy is mainly for my peace of mind at this point, as it's 80% certain it's a tumour.  It just means I'll have to make \"The Decision\" sooner rather than later, although knowing it doesn't make it any easier.Regardless, it's a 10-day wait for the results (it had to go Outside for biopsy) and I just have to find ways to make him as comfortable as possible until then.  He's 13 this year, so not a young cat, but I've had him since he was 8 months old and he's going to be desperately missed.Spends for yesterday are crazy:Car $125.12Class $200.00Books $103.72Vet $367.12Total: $795.96EEEE! But these are all needs, not wants.  I need my truck, I need my course (one less thing to do on my list for 2009!) and my books, and I need care for my cat.  My debit & VISA cards took a hit, but will be repaid from the car & vet accounts.I'm distracted enough right now, though, that I'm just not concerned about that.  Poor sick Elmo... :("},
{"title": "Unexpected expenses", "date": "Sunday 11 January 2009", "text": "After my outing yesterday doing some moving, I went home and relaxed, had a shower and puttered around for a bit, before getting ready at about 8:00 to go back out briefly.  A friend of mine has asked me to let her dog back in each evening for the next couple of days, so she's not out all night (my friend works until 11:00 pm at the hotel).I noticed when I went out to the parking lot that I hadn't plugged my truck in, which is unusual (she's been plugged in almost 24/7 for about 3 weeks!).  Anyhow, as it hadn't been that long since I'd arrived back, I started my usual routine of nudging the gas pedal for ease of starting, but noticed that the gas pedal was solid.  Not a good sign.  I tried turning the truck on without the gas and it made a couple of ugly noises, so I decided to push the gas pedal anyway.Big mistake.The throttle stuck wide open and the engine started racing at the highest RPM, making an awful screaming noise, so I shut it off immediately.  I remember this from last year and made the expensive mistake of letting it RUN then, blowing out my water pump and causing about $500 worth of damage.  I'm not touching the truck again and am calling a towtruck when I get home this afternoon.  I'm very thankful right now that I renewed my BCAA membership in the fall! One tow ($125) is almost double what I paid for a year membership!I'm hopeful that it won't be as expensive to repair this year because I stopped the engine as quickly as I did.  The shop that will do the repairs semi-prioritizes BCAA members and gives a 10% discount if you pay with cash, which is something.My friend is very kindly going to loan me her car for the day as I have both my vet appointment and college appointment in the morning and then have work until 9pm.  At some point, I'll also have to go and pick up my truck somehow.  But...*argh*Strange that it's been almost a year to the day that this happened.  It was January 19 last year.  I remember because I had to get to a course the next morning and ended up taking the bus (my first and, so far, only experience on Whitehorse transit)  Weird!"},
{"title": "Weekend Round Up", "date": "Saturday 10 January 2009", "text": "It's so nice to have an empty apartment to move into! What a difference to your stress level when you're able to move things a little bit at a time instead of having to do it all in half a day.  But I just want to know one thing:WHO MOVED ALL THAT JUNK INTO MY PLACE?? Seriously.  How on earth did I accumulate so much crap? A giant purge looms, one which I think will be better done at the unpacking stage.  I'm down to almost bare necessesities, however I keep opening cupboards and finding stuff I'll have to pack...I moved a truck-load of stuff today with a friend's help and the place is feeling a little bare.  But that's okay, as it'll be easier to keep it clean and tidy now.I've already made a bit of a dent in my goals, albeit a little one.  I've been using cash only for the past week - after a bit of a bumpy start - and am keeping track of everything I'm spending.  It really is amazing how you stop and actually think about things differently when you're using cash.  It's far more \"real\" than debit and credit cards.How about that? :PMy list of to-do's done this week is as follows:1) Call the vet for an app't for Elmo - CHECK!2) Call the bank to make an app't to discuss transferring RRSP - CHECK!3) Call Superstore re: carpet cleaner - no phone #??4) Return my book - CHECK!5) Roll and deposit change - CHECK!6) Book off 29th & 30th to move/clean - CHECK!7) Call the college to inquire about English class I want to take - CHECK!8) Call Athabasca Univeristy to ask about LPI results.  Are they equivalent to Alberta test? - Not Done YetI met with an account manager at my bank and my RRSP transfer is now in progress.  I just have to decide which mutual fund I want to move it to once it arrives.  I have a Prospectus, but there are so many questions to take into consideration: Do I want to use it to go back to school? Do I want to use it for a house downpayment? Do I want to just let it grow? How much do I want to auto-save? How aggressive do I want to be? How long do I want to keep it in the fund?The woman I spoke with recommended two, both of which are moderate risk and reinvest the interest & dividends monthly.  I'm also debating the option of splitting the RRSP funds into two - or possibly three - mutual fund options, with the two balanced funds, plus one slightly more aggressive option.  Any thoughts or suggestions on this?I spoke with an instructor at the college about an English course as well, and am going to see him on Monday morning to (I hope!) register for the class.  It's actually not the one I'm supposed to take, because those classes are during the daytime and I'm unable to attend.  The instructor is willing to let me take the higher class as long as I promise to go back and take the introductory classe(s) when I'm able to.  YAY!!This week is payday, and I should see the overtime from my work at the liquor store in December, too.  That will take a big chunk out of the Visa and I'm going to add extra to my LOC and my student loan, as well finding out what's left on the loan.  I think I'm down to about $3K.  I'm also going to redo my sidebars and see if I can make them better reflect what's growing, what's shrinking, etc."},
{"title": "Returns Queen", "date": "Wednesday 7 January 2009", "text": "The temperature this morning was, with wind chill, -47C. It didn't climb that much higher, ending the afternoon at -43C.It's time for an update, I think.I spent the weekend having way too much fun with a friend. We stayed up too late, drank too much, played \"Guitar Hero\", ate pizza, watched a couple of movies and probably embarrassed two of her kids a bit, too. It was awesome. I need to take more time off work and do things like that more often!I did spend a bit during my hedonistic weekend, however:Dessert, Coke $23.76 (strawberries, $7.99!! Ouch...)Milk (x 2), $13.64I think I made up for that, however (and the fact the purchases were, again, NOT cash), by depositing $36.00 worth of rolled coin into my gift fund on Monday morning. I was surprised I had so much, but it adds up really quickly. Another bonus of cash only - found money in the form of change.I also returned the second book I bought the other day. I thought it might be interesting, or something I could use, but it's not really designed for single people. It was called \"Once a Month Cooking\" and had all kinds of recipes and strategies for cooking a ton of food once a month and freezing the dinner entrees. I'm just not sure it would be worth my while to, firstly, buy all the equipment necessary for this grand scheme and secondly, whether it's actually a practical undertaking in a TINY kitchen. I'm thinking most likely not...Anyhow, I have my fabulous new crockpot and I think that's more than sufficient for one person to make a week's worth of meals.I've taken out $200 in cash, to have for my new cash only undertaking. I used $3.50 this morning because I woke up at 8am (and start work at 8:30!), so I had no time to have any breakfast or throw something together for lunch. I'm not certain how long this will last me, but I'm aiming for a month. Wish me luck!Today I made yet another return. I had bought some tape and a tape gun for packing, but decided I could borrow a gun instead. So I returned it!My total returns for the week amount to $194.66! Most of that is the snowshoes, but that's pretty substantial overall, n'est ce pas?One of my comments from my last post was from a reporter at the Yukon News, one of our two newspapers and the only daily. He came across my blog and is interested in doing an article about it and my attempts at saving money here in Whitehorse. I'm thinking about this as I think it would be fun, but part of what I like about this blog is my anonymity.Hmmm..."},
{"title": "A slip or two on Day One!", "date": "Saturday 3 January 2009", "text": "Yesterday was a really nice day. Weather-wise, it started out at about -41C or so, and didn't climb higher than -37C and there was really heavy ice-fog for most of the day.I met a friend at her new place for breakfast (a small German breakfast: lots of bread, butter, cheese, pate, Nutella..yum!) and we spent most of the day shopping (window & otherwise) and getting caught up. December is one of those months where you're either a total recluse or you've got social activities out the ying-yang. For my friend and I it was the former, so it was great to have the time to get catch up.Our first stop was the recycling centre. It was closed because of the cold weather (this is standard if the temperatures fall below -40C) but the bins were open, so we were able to get our recyclabes sorted. It didn't take long with two of us, but even the few minutes we were there was enough to seriously chill my fingers! We next stopped at The Brick. I'm looking for a hide-a-bed for the living room in the new place. There's absolutely no rush, but I just wanted to get an idea of what's out there. Whitehorse isn't the kind of place you can just wander around or \"show up\" and find exactly what you want. You can spend weeks or months searching but still might not find what you you're looking for. There aren't really any \"great\" deals because there simply isn't enough competition. We went across the street to a store that's going out of business and while there were no hide-a-beds left, there were some lovely area rugs. I'm looking for a couple of these for my living room in the new apartment. The prices were \"OK\", not fantastic, but I think I can find room in my budget for a new rug.I then returned an item and we went to the hardware store. I was looking for a rice steamer, a crock pot and an extra long plug in cord. It turns out that a lot of other people were looking for one of those as well, as there were NONE to be found!My spend:Crockpot: $24.99 (for a 5-quart!! Best buy by far)Steamer/rice cooker: $34.99Spent: $62.98Return: $41.68Total: $21.30I had budgeted $50 for the crockpot, so I got a really good deal! We stopped at Starbucks and I had a steamed eggnog: $3.83.I also took back my snowshoes. I felt a bit guilty, particularly as the kid who sold them to me intially was on cash, but I felt I overdid it a bit on Boxing Day. The skis are plenty and I have no regrets about the return today, so it was obviously the right thing to do.I've already broken two of my goals: none of my spends were cash only and I bought books! I will be returning one because after starting it, it's not quite what I was hoping for. The other book I bought is to go along with the new crockpot: \"The Healthy Slowcooker.\" But I swear that's it!"},
{"title": "Happy New Year!", "date": "Thursday 1 January 2009", "text": "Happy New Year, everyone!I'm not sure I've ever looked forward to a new year with quite so much excitement and enthusiasm as I have 2009. I started this blog in August last year, and didn't really have any goals to set & meet as I stumbled and fumbled my way along through December, but now that I have a better idea of what I want & need to do, I've definitely got some to meet for this year.First, though, I want to say a huge \"Thank You\" to you all for your support. It means so much knowing I'm in such great company as we meet - and in many cases, exceed - our challenges and goals, strive to take control of our spending and clutter and lives. It's been so motivating reading about how you all tackle debt reduction (and increase savings). There've been so many tips, hints, tricks, ideas, etc. and I've come away with a lot of determination to see the end of 50% of my debt load by the end of this year, if not more because it's not large compared to some of the scary numbers I've seen here. No doubt I probably could have done better last year with reducing some of that, but I didn't, so this year is it.I've been working a lot the past while, and not posted for a few days, but I took all my \"junk\" with me to the hotel today to spend some time plotting and planning and thinking. In between check-outs and messing up several usually straightforward transactions (!), I managed to get a few things written out for 2009 plans.Financial Goals1) Cash only for three months - I figure this is a great way to get into a routine and start actually THINKING about where my money goes and to make sure I keep more of it for myself. I'm not brave enough to try a whole year right off the bat like BecomingDebtFree, but I did want to challenge myself enough to make it relatively difficult. If the first three months goes well, then I can try it again...2) Continue to track my spending - I've been doing well with this the past couple of months and find that it clears up a lot of questions if you started out with, say, $100 in your wallet on Monday and have 35 cents left on Wednesday!3) No un-necessary spending - I'm using the Gail Planner \"wish list\" to make a note of what I want and what I need and will keep track of my success that way. As Gail says, if it's not on the list, it's not necessary!!4) Pay off my Visa card and incur no new CC debt! - I was a bit surprised to discover the current interest rate on my credit card is only 1.9% (from 14.9%)! When did that happen? Regardless, while it's low I want to get rid of the balance. This should be easy to do, as I'm still awaiting the overtime cheque from the liquor store hours.5) Keep saving and rolling my change. This will go into my gift fund.6) No Spend Days. I am going to start small and go for two a week for the first three months. We'll see how it goes from there.7) No buying books or DVD box sets! These are my biggest addiction by far (okay, and Tim Horton's) and I honestly spent a huge amount of money in the past several months on both of these items.8) Donate $25 to a different charity each month. I am also considering fostering a child. I had two a number of years ago, but unfortunately just couldn't maintain my donation. I can now.9) Pay off my student loan and my LOC - a total of $8140.10) Move my RSP to somewhere it will actually make some interest!Personal Goals1) Cancel the cable - this I'm going to do when I move in Feb. I've tried just watching less and it's not working. I need to go cold turkey.2) Write more: letters, emails, bad romances. Whatever it is, I just want to sit down and do it.3) Use the phone more to talk to people instead of email/MSN.4) Stay on the Humane Society Board.5) Walk dogs at the shelter. I love dogs, but can't have them where I live, so this can be my dog fix, while socializing and exercising myself and the dogs. I'm aiming to start just once a week right now.6) Get much needed funding for the shelter through grants.7) Use the car less. This will be easy now that I'm moving closer to town! I'll be walking mostly and riding my bike in summer.8) Start tae-kwon-do in September. I've wanted to do this for years, but one thing or another has prevented me (mostly lack of funds and motivation). There's a community group up here that is extremely well-priced and meets 3x's a week.9) Start a class. I'm going to call Yukon College next week once they open and find out what level English class I can get into. I'm also going to contact Athabasca U in Alberta and see if my test is valid there, as there's a Comparative Religion course that I'm interested in doing. Athabasca is way more expensive, however.10) Eat mindfully. I do not really think about what I eat. I will start meal planning and shopping accordingly, cut down on my grocery bills and the amount of food I waste and actually c-o-o-k. Our lone organic food store seems to have morphed somehow into a vitamins and supplements store, so organic things will be bought elsewhere!It's a bigger list than I thought it would be! :PI spent time today on ING to halve the auto-save amounts I had set up. I was putting $600 a month into savings and while I think that's a pretty decent amount, I've cut it back to $300, so the other $300 can go towards my debt reduction. This also means that I have to cut back on the amount I contribute to my RSP for the moment, from 18% to 10%, but it's better than nothing and I have to remember it's only temporary. The point is that I'm reluctant to stop saving entirely in order to pay off my debt faster.I also printed off a few pages about how to use vinegar as a cleaner (to go along with my ones on lemons and baking soda) and a chart for weekly menu planning and put them all into a binder so that I can get on track with that.Anyhow, I'm so looking forward to following everyone's blogs again this year! I know there are going to be success stories all over the board :)"},
{"title": "Boxing Day \"Sales\"", "date": "Friday 26 December 2008", "text": "I'd just like to start out by saying that this is the FIRST Boxing Day I've ever shopped on. I've worked plenty, but never been a shopper! I'd also like to add that Boxing Day Sales in Whitehorse SUCK.That didn't stop me from spending $800, however (so much for my no-spend day). I really wanted some x-country skis and some snowshoes. No deal there, apart from everything being 10% off, not just the ski package. I've already found a discrepancy which I can probably get fixed this afternoon. The pants I bought were on sale for $90, but were rung through at $120. I didn't notice this until I got home about 15 minutes ago. I have to go back downtown this afternoon anyway, so I'll stop in and see if there's anything they can do. $30 is a substantial boo-boo - guaranteed I wouldn't do it for $3, but I will for $30.I also bought a DVD player, which is something I've wanted for a while. DVDs play fine on my computer, but I like having the separate player for watching that. I went to one place where they were having a Boxing Day Blowout. What a joke! The lowest priced DVD player they had was $100 and they went up from there. So much for savings! I ended up going to the Source (used to be Radio Shack) and picked one up there instead. I budgeted $80, but as I got the only one left - the floor model - it came to $73.49. It was marked at $79 on the shelf, but rung in at $69.99. So, not a huge savings, but still better than the lame \"blowout\" prices at the first place I went to.All the funds for this, by the way, have come out of my \"mad money\" account, so I don't feel too bad for buying. It was quieter than I thought it would be, too, as I went out early purposely to miss the crowds. Maybe it's just some specific places that are going to be really busy.I'm home to have a shower, do the dishes, then head out again for another late shift at the hotel. It was a long night last night, and will be tonight as well, but I can have a bit of a sleep in tomorrow, which will be nice.I need something to do here at the hotel (already!), so I thought I'd update. It's going to be quiet tonight - at least I hope so! Only a few calls so far, about of them half asking if off-sales were open (no).I've come prepared with books, notebooks (to work on my 101 Things, my 50x50 and possibly my 2009 Plans lists), and I should get a meal at some point, too. There's currently a full dinner going on until 8pm, so I may not get it until later, but I'm assuming I'll get something. We're also done with our catering part of Christmas. Every year the hotel caters full Christmas turkey dinners (either a 16lb or a 28lb bird) with all the trimmings. The hotel kitchen staff cooks it, you just pick it up! :)I spoke with my sister briefly yesterday evening and she strongly encouraged me to take the apartment I saw on Monday night. She couldn't understand why I was hesitating at all if the place was so perfect. Regardless of it's perfection, it's still a move and moves are stressful and time-consuming, even if it's to the home of your dreams. There's planning and packing and prepping and cleaning and shifting and unpacking and adjusting involved, so even if you really like the place, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. So I called L and left a message saying that I would like it, invited them to come and meet my cats and then waited.L called today and sounded very happy that I made the decision to move in. I believe it's going to work out well, but she going to check with the other tenant and make sure he's not allergic to cats before the final decision. Once I hear back from her, I'll put in my notice, as I don't want to have to retract that if, for some reason, the cats are a problem. I didn't mention that I have a washing machine (no dryer) in-suite, have access to the garden and a shed (where my bike can be safely locked up) and a raised garden bed so I can grow my own veggies next summer!! There is also a little electric fireplace in the living room, which might actually be nice in the bedroom...hmm...My three shifts at the liquor store wore me out! I'm really sore from all that lifting, stocking, collecting carts from the parking lot and tidying. The staff is great, and they seem to have a lot of fun with each other. It was fun to listen to people meeting up in the aisles and chatting. Still, all that hard work will pay off with 12 hours of work at time and a half, and 9 hours at double time - approx $600 after taxes. This will make a nice dent somwhere in my debt!The past few days' spending looks like this:Monday$50 gift certificate (friend's son)$9.19 lunch$106.73 gift basket for my friend (she was making Christmas dinner, so...)$6.01 Tim Horton'sTuesday$8.91 SubwayWednesday$16.83 items for potluck at liquor store$22.05 bottle of rye (CC)Today, obviously, is a no spend day. There's nothing open - not even a Tim Horton's! Ha ha. My Christmas meal with my friend and her family never materialized yesterday as she ended up taking her daughter to Emergency! I don't mind missing a meal - I was really tired and not really wanting to go out again after working all day at the liquor store anyway, but once I heard where they were, I was just concerned for her daughter. I couldn't get through to either my friend or her daughter, so I just hunkered down to wait. I've just spoken with my friend and her daughter's going to need surgery (it's bladder related), but she's doing \"okay\" for the time being. Poor kid.Tomorrow will most likely be a no-spend day as well, but I am hoping to catch some boxing week sales on Saturday to buy some x-country skis and maybe a DVD player if I can get a good deal and I feel motivated enough. Otherwise, I'm going to start making a list of what I need to do for my move and start collecting some boxes, so I can pack up \"stuff\" like books, DVDs, summer clothing and move in bits and pieces. The new apartment is currently empty, so I can start moving stuff in before Feb 1, which is fantastic, but I have to get myself motivated, organized and buy a good tape gun!Merry Christmas all!"},

{"title": "Hmmm...", "date": "Tuesday 23 December 2008", "text": "I just went to see an apartment. It's a basement suite, 2 bedrooms, a 30 minute walk (!) from the library. The landlady is an acquaintance of mine and we both had \"good feelings\" about the other. It's very obviously a basement, but there are a lot of windows and the paint colours are nice and light. I actually really liked it; it felt very cosy. The extra bedroom is tiny, so would be designated as an office. Once I get my furniture from Victoria, I can set up my desk and computer in the second room and be away from the main traffic area. So to speak, of course, as all traffic is me.So. My current monthly expenditures break down like this:Rent: $550Cable: $58.28Heat & Hydro: $150 (approx)Cell: $50Phone/Internet: $120Gas: $100 (min)Total: $1028.88 before groceries.Potential monthly expenditures:Rent/heat: $700Cable: 58.28Internet (shared): $40Phone: (landline) $35Cell: $50Gas: $50Hydro: $60?Total: $993.28 before groceriesDifference: $35.60Moving won't save me much - if anything - but it's in the location I want and the couple who own the house are fantastic and would make really excellent landlords. I've invited them to come and meet my cats if they want to, so they know they're well taken care, clean and well-behaved. I felt really comfortable there, despite a t-i-n-y kitchen and it would be silly to say 'no'. It's empty and I could move stuff in early...I wouldn't be paying any more living there, which is great, although it would be nice to pay less of course. Waiting, on the other hand, will just frustrate me and I might not find something I like nearly as much mainly because the price is actually really good for where/what it is and where we are.I wanted to sleep on it because I didn't want to make an impulsive decision and end up regretting a move - which is not a little thing. But having spoken with my sister and had some feedback from a couple of friends, I think I'm going to go ahead and take it. I really doubt I'll regret it, particularly since I've been wanting a move to this area for over six months.Timing is everything! It seems I'll have a new home Feb 1! :)"},
{"title": "Weekly recap", "date": "Monday 22 December 2008", "text": "These are the mukluks I got for Christmas from D.  So beautiful...but...This is what ice fog does to the trees.This is ice fog. We had over a week of it last January. It was -44C the day I took this picture. This is 2nd Ave in Whitehorse. The library is out of the photo on the left, at the streetlights. I was outside for literally 5 minutes.I had a pretty good \"no spend\" week, considering it's so close to Christmas. It helped that I made food that lasted for dinners & lunches. That saved me a lot.Having said that, however, I have bought two lunches this week. I worked at the liquor store yesterday for some overtime and have two more shifts. It wasn't quite what I was expecting, mostly a lot of walking around and making sure everything looked nice and full, stocking shelves and tidying. But it should net me about $500 after taxes for 3 days work, and that will pay off my Visa and I'll have a little extra to put on my LOC & student loan.  It's pretty exhausting, as I don't get much time off over the holidays, but like Gail says - do what you need to do to get out of debt.  I don't have much, but it's still hanging over my head and I want to get rid of it next year.I had an excellent day on Friday because I got my exam results back.  I was aiming for a Level 4 essay (demonstrates adequate competency) and ended up with a Level 5 (demonstrates fluent competency)! I am really excited, particularly as I was concerned because I left an hour early! I was relieved, to say the least.  This means I should be able to register for the English class that I want in January, but will have to talk to the college to confirm.My lunch yesterday cost me $17.20 (incl. $2 tip).  One of the women I supervise was also working at the liquor store and we went for lunch together.  It was really good - the only Vietnamese restaurant in town.My other spend on lunch was today and was almost the same price! I paid $17.64 for an excellent hamburger and fries.  Three of us went for lunch as we don't open until 1pm on Sundays over Christmas.  It was a nice suggestion to go and spend some time together.  I hadn't tried the restaurant we went to, but I will definitely be going back.  It was really good.  Probably one of the best hamburgers I've ever had.  I don't eat a lot of hamburgers, but I always try them when I go out to a restaurant.I also spent $50 on a gift certificate for my friend's daughter.  I'm spending Christmas Eve with them, so wanted to give the kids something.  I need to buy a gift certificate for her oldest son and a little something for my friend and I'm DONE! I'm looking forward to dinner with them.  Cats and dogs and kids...it'll be fun!And my present from D...I'm thrilled with the boots, I really am.  They're beautiful.  It's just that I've always been really anti-fur (it's an truly awful way for an animal to die), so I'm having a really hard time with this.  D has a trap-line.  He hunts.  He's First Nation.  This is part of his heritage.  It doesn't make him stop and think and wonder and shudder.  City Girl here, on the other hand, has never understood the need for the use of fur.  Has, until this point, found it quite repellent.  But I didn't live in the North.  I never experienced below -20 before, or windchills, or ice fog, or days of extreme cold out hunting on the land.So I'm having a very difficult time reconciling my hypocrisy in accepting this gift.  And I feel so ungrateful and unappreciative of the work and the thought that went into these beautiful boots.  They are hand made and hand beaded.  They are beautiful and they are WARM.  They fit like a glove.  And I think I need to wear them and love them because they came from someone I care about...right?"},
{"title": "Spending update", "date": "Friday 19 December 2008", "text": "I wasn't sure how my last post would go over, so I thank you all for your nice comments! :) The Yukon's one of those places that piques a lot of interest, but not everyone knows much about, never mind visiting it.  I've never loved living somewhere so much that I want to share everything I can about it, but there's something special about the Yukon.  I suppose part of it is its \"frontier\" aspect, some of which remains today in the buildings and surrounds of Dawson City and, to a lesser degree, Whitehorse.  The population grows slowly and our current Territorial population is about 34,000.  It's its own small community! Very apparent when you run into someone you know in Dawson City, which is about a 7 hour drive north.  That happened to me in August and it was very surreal!Only a week until Christmas and I'm basically done.  I have two presents left to send, but there's no point now until after Christmas because they won't get where they're going until after it's over anyway.  D (the man I'm dating) and I are going to exchang gifts tomorrow night.  I got him an iPod - a bit more than I had anticipated spending, but something I know he'll really like - and he called me the other day to ask what size feet I have, so I'm very curious to know what he got me.  Skates? Boots? Snowshoes? Slippers?I got a card and letter from my aunt in Toronto today and she stated that she's at the stage in life where she feels the need to hand on some of her treasures (she and my mum are twins, and they turn 77 next year).  That said, she's going to be sending me a charm bracelet that my Dad apparently started for her year ago.  I'm flattered and very moved by this as my Dad died when I was 13, so I will have something from both of them to cherish.  I am really looking forward to receiving it.I've been doing quite well with my spending this week (so far), although I'm not really counting my Tim Horton's spends because, well, it's not really my money I'm spending :) I made a great big salad that lasted me three days and managed to not spend as randomly as I normally do.I mailed a parcel to my friend in Kingston on Monday, and am hoping it makes it there by Christmas.  The book cost me $3.71 and the postage: $13.51.  Ouch!My Canadian Tire purchase the other day cost me $29.38.  I've tried out the spray on de-icer and am a little frustrated because I think I must be missing something.  I spray it on and it FREEZES! Argh... I'm sure that's not what's supposed to happen.  It then gets stuck on the ice scraper and ends up all globby and mucky.Another visit to the grocery store to stock up on lovely fruits and other perishables for salad cost me $78.62.  I made gigantic fruit salads for three days with pineapple, strawberries, apple, banana, blueberries and blackberries.  Amazing how a bowl of that can fill you up! All the fruit, obviously, is grown elsewhere, so the carbon footprint of my blueberries alone is HUGE, but honestly and particularly in the middle of winter, it's really nice to have some fresh fruit.  My cravings lean towards starches and carbs, which your body craves in winter to stay warm.  But it does get a bit much sometimes.My cost of visiting the vet on Monday for Dinah's ears (it turns out BOTH are infected - unusual for a cat) was $134.10.  That included the vet consultation and all the medication she needs for a week to ten days.  Hopefully this will clear up her infection for good.  It's not the cost, but it makes her miserable and she hates me when I give her her pill and put various liquids into her ears.  Poor girl!The temperature today was -36C, with ice fog.  Today was a day to start the car and walk away.  I started up the truck about 20 minutes before I left work and she was humming along fine by the time I needed to go.  It's still strange to do it, but it takes at least that long for me to be barely warm.  Northerners aren't the most environmentally friendly people in mid-winter, unfortunately."},
{"title": "The Weather Outside is Unfit for Cheechakos", "date": "Tuesday 16 December 2008", "text": "Itâs officially winter.  This, of course, is all relative, depending on where you live.  The current temperature is -21C, but with the wind chill it âfeels like -31C.â  Our overnight is supposed to be -30C.  Itâs warmer today than it was yesterday, mind you, when the daytime high was -27C - like somewhere else last week!I bought a new ice scraper today, as my old one is really dull and worn, which just makes an unpleasant job that much worse.  Fighting to scrape ice coated windows and getting nowhere is frustrating, tiring and takes longer than it needs to.  I decided it would be a(nother) Christmas present to myself (thanks mum!), so picked a fancy one with an extendable arm, a squeegee/brush head and a really nice ergonomic handle.  With the amount of scraping we do here â often twice a day â you need a decent scraper that will last at least two winters and thatâs comfortable to use.  Itâs amazing how pleasing a new thing like that can be!Last week, after my shift at the hotel, I noticed the cook spraying stuff on his windshield, so I asked what it was.  âDe-icer,â he said.  You spray it on, leave it a bit, then turn your wipers on and voila! Iâve never seen it before, so while I was shopping today, I had a look for it.  Handily, they have it right beside the scrapers, and there are several different kinds.  The kind I picked needs a cold start, so I have to remember NOT to start the truck for warming prior to scraping.  You leave it about 30 seconds (it claims to work to-40C) and then just squeegee it off.  Iâm looking forward to trying it tomorrow morning, but I need to ensure I read the instructions properly first.Living in the North incurs a whole new series of habits and costs.  When I first moved up here I was, in Northern lingo, what they call a âCheechako.âA cheechako is a person who is a tenderfoot, a newbie -- the term dates from the Klondike Gold Rush of the 1850s in Alaska and the Yukon. Daniel Pinkwater quotes a friend living in Alaska as saying the word is an Upik pronunciation of \"Chicago,\" but I can find no confirmation of this, and in fact a web site I found explains the word as \"combining the Chinook Indian word 'chee,' meaning new, fresh, or just now, with the Nootka Indian word 'chako,' which means to come, to approach, or to become.\"But whatever the source, the new people coming up from points further south, inexperienced in mining or surviving Alaskan winters, were called \"cheechakos,\" and the word found its way into the works of Jack London and Robert Service, and it's still used in the area to describe newcomers. (It also seems to be used as a name for stores and tour companies.) After a certain amount or time or experience, one becomes a \"sourdough.\"You become Sourdough after a year.  The term derives, again, from the Gold Rush era when the experienced Rushers learned to keep a starter of sourdough close to their body, ready to use in case they needed something to eat.The Cheechako year is supposed to be the one where you gain all â or a lot â of the experience you need to live comfortably in the North.  Itâs taken me a bit longer than that (I donât listen very wellâ¦), but Iâm getting there.Iâve learned many things:1) Always have a full tank of oil at home.  For this, you need cash (here, itâs a min. $400).  It gets cold without oil.  If you run out of oil, diesel will do the same job until the delivery can be made.  How about that? People seemed surprised that I didnât know this when I ran out (twice!) last year.  Approx 8 month cost: $4000.00 (assuming $700 every six weeks, Oct â May)2) Winterize your car! You will be grateful you spent the $150 to put in a battery blanket, block heater and oil pan heater.  I bought the items at the auto parts store and then had them professionally installed.  A garage is nice, too, but if you canât afford a garage with attached house, make sure you at least have a plug in available for those extremely cold nights.  One time: $300 (supplies and install)3) Tires.  Snow tires! Never mind those âall seasonsâ that some people swear by.  Snow tires are designed for better performance in the snow and the change in temperatures (different rubber) that accompany it.  They are, simply, safer.  I had studs added to mine, but I think the next set I get will be Blizzaks.  These are apparently some of the best winter tires on the market these days.  Fairly pricey, but well worth it.  Approx cost: $400 - $500 for 4 tires (mine are small).4) Products like fuel line antifreeze, winter wipers, winter windshield fluid,  and antifreeze (make sure itâs pet friendly!!) are the âlittle thingsâ that can make a big difference to your comfort and safety in a car.  Most are relatively inexpensive, and the fuel line antifreeze, for instance, comes in 6-packs, which can last the winter.  Approx cost over 8 months: $100.5) Emergency kit.  This consists of many life-saving items like space-blankets (the shiny silver ones), candles, traction mats, gloves, flares, shovel, hand saw, axe/hatchet, etc.  I took a winter driving course several weeks ago and actually went out and bought a few things necessary to start a kit.  I never travel out of town in the winter â mainly because Iâm particularly aware of the limitations of my vehicle â but it never hurts to be prepared! Approx cost: $250.6) Winter tune-up.  I neglected mine this year, but will definitely be taking wee truck in for service in the spring.  Itâs vital to make sure brakes, exhaust system, engine, etc. are working properly and to fix anything that needs to be replaced.  Cost: varies, $250?7) Clothing.  This is pretty obvious, even to the uninitiated (me).  Boots, gloves, coats, hats and scarves all help to keep heat in, but the real key to staying warm and comfortable is layering.  Wool (not the older heavy stuff, the new, thin & light garments) and fleece are ideal.  Think of yourself like an onion: a layer to wick the moisture from your body keeps you dry, a layer or two to keep the heat in keeps you warm, and an outside layer keeps the wind at bay.  Of course thereâs clothing for everything that you do: skiing, snowboarding, walking, hiking, sledding, general use, drivingâ¦My dream parka, for example, costs $600, but I would honestly never have to buy another one in my life.  The one I got for $150 last year, though, is just fine.  Buy the best you can afford, so that it lasts and is useable for many years.  Cost for clothing: $1500 minimum for good quality, basic stuff that will keep you WARM!8) Always have a full gas tank! This isnât so important in a more southerly place, but in the North itâs not uncommon to let your vehicle run for prolonged periods of time.  Itâs so totally counter-intuitive that it was the hardest thing to wrap my head around.  Donât turn off the engine, but get out of the car, lock it and walk away.  Of course, donât forget your second set of keys or youâll end up locking yourself out on a very, very cold day.I locked myself out of my (running) truck on a morning that was -43C.  It sucked, but fortunately I had my wallet and my BCAA card with me.  I had stopped at the bank to get some cash, and the woman who tailed me in actually worked there, so she let me use the phone to call for assistance.  Wee truck sure was warm and toasty when I eventually got back in, though, and in all honesty, I would rather she be running at -43C than not! I learned to keep one set of keys in each coat pocket.Living in the North is not cheap.  We pay more for food, gas, heating, everything.  Eight months of winter and $200+ monthly electrical bills can play havoc on a budget, even a tight one.  Iâm keeping the heat as low as comfortable this year and using a fleece to stave off the worst of it â Iâve got all the thermostats set at 15C, and Iâm finding it warm enough so far.  Iâve got baseboard heating, one of the most expensive types, so I donât want to make the same mistake as I did last year and crank it up to 24C or something sub-tropical like that.  Mind you, when it was -44C for three weeks in January, it was nice to come home to a toasty apartment.  Then I got my $350 electrical bill.  Ouch!But on the up side, the colder it is, the better and brighter and more beautiful the Northern Lights.  In December 2006, during my first winter and just before Christmas, there was a jaw-dropping display.  The sky was literally filled with lights, falling, dancing and running across the sky.  I probably watched them for an hour.  Phenomenal.  Man cannot even dream of coming close to matching that beauty.Itâs not really a budget entry, and itâs kind of long, but just thought it might be interesting to cover some winter costs of us Yukoners."},
{"title": "Weekly roundup", "date": "Saturday 13 December 2008", "text": "I was up before 6:30 this morning, scraping that darned ice off the truck at 6:45 and at SuperStore by 7:00. Their hours until Christmas: 6am - 12am!I am determined NOT to do any more shopping (apart from, perhaps, some perishables) until the (Christmas) madness is over and I am not remotely patient enough to go during the weekend days or after work. One of the staff there said I sure had my timing right - about 10:00 and the place is a zoo. I figured it might be, which is why I wanted to get out there and just get it done. I had my list, but did I follow it? More or less...meaning that I got MOST stuff on it, but saw yummy things down every aisle, even though I had to pick my way around stockers, boxes, carts...I swear these things just jumped in on their own! There were no actual tills open (?), so I guess they want people to use the new self-checkouts instead, but as I was using my gift cards, I couldn't (they don't take cash). The lady at customer service opened a checkout for me. How fabulous! I am so glad to have that over and done with.The grocery bill came to $180.91, but I've got loads and loads of stuff to keep me happy over the holidays, so I'm actually pretty happy with the amount I spent. I stocked up on pasta and rice (which I love) and which are great as leftovers for several days. I've also got a bunch of stuff to make a giant salad (spinach base, carrots, peppers, onions, cheese, eggs, tuna or chicken), and if I make it right, it should last me almost a week. I still have almost $100 left on my gift cards, too.Once I got home, I did my dishes, cleaned my floor, my microwave, part of the bathroom and the stovetop (even took off the metal thingees and washed them), took out a bunch of garbage and removed my recycling to the truck. All before 10:30! I'm amazed at myself...but now I have my whole day to play :)My spending since Wednesday looks like this:WednesdayLunch at Tim Horton's $7.96 (on gift card)ThursdayAmazon order $167.38 (from my Christmas money)4 DVD box sets, 1 bookAnd just in case anyone's keeping track, that's five DVD box sets in one week: Planet Earth, Arrested Development S1, Coupling S1-4, Heroes S1, Sex & the City S1; Mastering Digital Photography was the book I chose. I'm pretty much set, as long as I can break my new addiction...Thursday evening four of us got together to make pizza. It was really good! My share was about $15. Much cheaper than the dining out we've been doing the past little while.FridayGas $44.15 (87.9!!!!! Wahoo! I NEVER thought I'd see it below a dollar, never mind .90 cents a litre)I realize this is still high compared to eastern Ontario (my friends in Kingston are paying 67.9L right now), but for the North, it's pretty awesome.I've made a couple of phone calls, too. One was to the cell phone company. My current contract is up in June '09 and I was hoping I could make some adjustments, but it's actually cheaper for me to keep what I've got now and renegotiate when the contract is up. I'll probably look at pre-paid or pay-as-you-go, because I use nowhere near the 40 free minutes a month I currently have. I did find out that I've been throwing money pretty randomly at the cell phone bills and currently have a credit son my account of about $150! That means No payments for me for about 3 months.The other call was to student loans to find out my current balance. It's come down a bit to $3264.22. Interest (out of interest) is .54 cents a day, and the rate has fallen 1/2% to 6%.I also stopped by the cable provider to find out the status on my account. It turns out I have a credit there, too: $113. Wow! I've decided to cancel at the end of my cycle in Feb. Just in time for spring and the beginning of our long days.This means that for the next two months, I have an extra $220 to throw at my debt. This will probably be my LOC and my student loan, as I'd like to see higher and lower numbers respectively in those.I have to take my princess to the vet on Monday (the calico in the photo). She has another ear infection that I want to clear up before it gets worse. I don't want another \"worst I've ever seen\" infection. Poor princess. I also went to the doctor to refill some prescriptions and visited my bank to discuss RRSP mutual fund options. There are a couple that I'm interested in, so I just have to get a printout of my account information and can get myself set up.So I'm feeling quite productive these days, checking things off my list of to do's. I have some time off over the holidays (not much, as I decided to take three shifts at the liquor store to help out) and I want to poke through my closets and bookshelves and find things I can get rid of. I'm in a purging mood, probably because another new year is right around the corner.One day over the holidays will be devoted to Boxing Week sales (when did Boxing Day morph into Boxing Week exactly?). I am looking for snowshoes and x-country skis and accoutrements. The winter weather here is too damn nice to spend inside ALL the time."},
{"title": "Gail's Planner - Initial Review", "date": "Thursday 11 December 2008", "text": "I got Gailâs TDDUP Life Planner the other day (HURRAH!), and having had poked through it, I thought I would give my (initial) impressions, as Iâve had some queries about it.Itâs set up like a regular spiral bound day planner with lots of space for organizing day to day events like appointments, outings, reminders, etc. (and it includes the last week of December, so you can get your new habits started early!).  Lots of room to make notes and to jot down thoughts or ideas.You start out with several exercises designed to track your spending, your fixed expenses, where you currently stand in relation to savings vs debt, and lay out your big goals.  What do you want in 5 years? Where do you stand now? Habits: Good or bad, they go in here, too.Each month thereâs a Monthly Plan, along with a section to track your variable spending (The Magic Jars!) and advice on how to stay organized, make necessary changes, etc.  Itâs set up on a weekly basis, along with a âto doâ list and suggestions for shaving and saving â thereâs even a column to show what youâve saved on a daily basis! âWish listsâ for those items you want - and will need to save for â are included as well, so you have a place to write them down and keep track of costs and savings.And, of course, it has âGail-ismsâ scattered throughout to prompt action and thought!I donât generally use daytimers.  The intention is there, but I always forget Iâve got them and they languish, empty and unused instead.  Although the basis of this one is the same (organizing and keeping track of things), itâs prompting actual ACTION from you as well; you need to participate to see the results, not just note down that youâre meeting so and so for lunch on such and such a day so you wonât forget.  How much did you spend on lunch? Did you drive? Did you stop to pick up a card at the drugstore for that birthday you almost forgot?And donât forget: you need to take responsibility for all of this!"},

Not too shabby, I'd say!It'll be two weeks until I hear anything about my test, but I know I didn't do as much review as I needed to. My final essay was a bit wordy, but it's done. I finished an hour ahead of schedule, so that either bodes very well or very badly!I spent the rest of my day doing some shopping - it's starting to get a little busy out there! - doing a laundry, doing the dishes and vacuuming the apartment. I have an early start in the morning at the hotel, so I'm hoping to get to bed early again tonight.But I thought I'd better update before I hit the sack. Goals completed first:1) Poke through my closets again and donate more stuff to charity now that I have so much NEW stuff - NOT DONE2) Take the old pots & pans to charity; I bought a new set on sale - NOT DONE (I'm still using the old ones, too)3) 10 No Spend days -2/10 - better than nothing!4) Send overseas Christmas cards - COMPLETED (have one last minute one to do tomorrow)5) No more credit card spending - NO, BUT PAID OFF AND CUT UP MASTERCARD!! Can I have a WOO HOO?6) Start Christmas shopping - ALMOST COMPLETE DEC 67) Look into satellite vs. cable costs - COMPLETED (decided to cancel cable all together)8) Pay the car insurance in full $496.12 is what remains after the Oct payment - COMPLETED9) Create a 6-mth & a 5-yr plan - NOT DONE10) Finish my 101 Things & 50x50 list...ongoing (it's hard) - STILL NOT DONE!BONUS: I read 10 (!) books this month!\"The Writing Class\"\"Letter to a Christian Nation\"\"Shattered Dreams\"\"Blood From a Stone\"\"Zookeeper's Wife\"\"Capitol Offence\"\"Debunked - Conspiracy Theories, Urban Legends, and Evil Plots of the 21st Century\"\"Tell Me Where It Hurts\"\"Pawprints of Katrina\"\"My Father's Keeper\"That 101 Things list is going to be the end of me! To be honest, I haven't even looked at it for the past while. Maybe I'll do it for the New Year instead. But otherwise I completed more than I thought I would!So, my spending over the past couple of weeks has been a bit all over the place. I've got a bit of an addiction to Starbuck's steamed eggnog right now (thank goodness it's only once a year!) and have indulged in about 5 of them in the past two weeks. I don't want to think about what's in them - I just like them!I won't list all my spending from the previous week, but will catch up on this week's because having it written down really does help to take stock.SundayTea $1.92Breakfast $7.56Dinner $30.96MondayDVD Box Set (Corner Gas S2) $31.49Passport Photos $21.00 (sooooooo not happy with them, but needed one for the college exam today)Lunch $8.91Starbuck's $7.56 (eggnogs & croissant)TuesdayLunch $13.02 (incl. 2L milk)WednesdayPet Photos $32.24iPod $198.45 (Christmas present - I'm being exceptionally generous here...)ThursdayPS3 video game $62.89 (Christmas present)Starbuck's $5.78 (eggnogs)Cat food $46.99Expense repayment +$75.00 (for pet photos & USB stick)Friday2 photo reprints $2.08Book $14.15Donation $125 (Christmas present)Book $30 (Christmas present)Digital photo frames (2) $132.96 (Christmas presents - these are going to my sister and my brother with photos of their trip to Whitehorse in the summer)Tim Horton's $103.90I know how that last one looks. What can you buy at Tim Horton's that costs THAT much? I bought a gift card for myself. My mum put $1K into my account for Christmas (thanks, mum!!) and I took a few days to think about what exactly I should do with it. I had a few ideas - and got some good advice, too! - so I decided that I would get a few things I \"wanted\", instead of things I needed. Which was also some advice I got - ha ha!I decided to spend some on \"fun stuff\" and the rest will go into my savings accounts. So I got myself a $100 Tim's card and a $250 SuperStore gift card. I don't plan to use the SuperStore card right away; I want to keep it for those times I might be running a bit short. The Tim's card is going to be my treat card. Next up: some books. I'm trying to limit myself to $100, but it's hard! I think it's worthwhile to wait for Boxing Week, however, to buy something(s) instead of paying full price pre-Christmas.I'm also considering some x-country skis and accoutrements...a camera bag...a polarizing filter...a printer...oh my!I did do some spending today after my exam and picked up presents for my mum. She had asked for slippers, so I stopped at Reitman's and picked up a pair I think she'll like. I also got her a Coles gift card for some books and a box of those new Ferrero Rocher chocolate - the \"Collection\" edition. Once I get it packed up tomorrow, I can send it off and it will be there in plenty of time for Christmas.Spent:Mailing box $3.98Gift Certificate $50.00Slippers $12.00Chocolate/wrapping paper $11.00I have spent a lot on Christmas - more than I intended actually - but I'm really pleased with what I got for everyone. I'm looking forward to a nice, relaxing holiday!"},
{"title": "Car shopping...um...dreaming", "date": "Wednesday 26 November 2008", "text": "My favourite car out there these days is a Toyota FJ Cruiser. It's one of these. Of course it's out of the question right now, but it's nice to look. I'm not sure why I like them so much - they're the up to date version of the old Toyota LandCruiser - but I'm partial to Toyota, so that might have something to do with it. A co-worker has just bought a new Honda Fit, and I think that's what's started my daydreaming again.I do this on occasion, although I simply can't afford a new car right now. It's kind of like perusing the real estate websites; I can't afford a house, but I like to see what's out there and what the prices are like. I just have to be a patient. Prices are bound to fall, there's going to be used vehicles for sale, I might just change my mind, etc. I went online and played around a little bit with pricing, interest rates, term, and down payments. A lease would work - if I had $15K to put down, which I don't. And a lease, unless you can write it off, is Not Good. Honestly, I just want something newer than my current one (an '81).I was playing around with December's budget and because I get paid three times, I technically have a \"free\" paycheque. If I manage to just stick to my bills, plus some groceries, I should be able to put about $500 into each of my savings accounts! That's very exciting, particularly as I've already got my Christmas fund sorted out, so I won't (hopefully) need to draw anything from the paycheques to cover anything there.I've decided to get my sister and brother in law gift certificates for Kiva or Heifer International. This way they can choose one or several loans to invest in or the gift of an animal for a needy family. I think it's perfect for them, particularly as they're trying to downsize and don't really need any more \"stuff.\"So my spending for the past several days looks like this:Saturday$6.57 water$6.98 (2 x tea & breakfast sandwich)$9.47 cat foodSunday$5.88 Starbuck's (a treat of steamed egg nog; felt I deserved it after my photo shoot the day before)$41.98 yogs outfit from Reitman's (on sale; 40% off!) to replace old, shrunken workout pants$39.47 Gail's Budget BinderMonday$103.14 \"Bare Essentials\" campaign through work (purchasing basic things like toothpaste, shampoo, etc. for women's shelters - that's the photo of \"the stuff\" at the top)$4.02 tea and bagel at Timmy's$28.84 for 69 5x7 pet photos (!)I took the photos to the photo store downtown and said \"Please don't make me take these to Wal-Mart!\" The guy was awesome; I would have been happy with a price match (.97 cents for a 5x7 at Wally-World), but he printed them off for .39 cents apiece!! I am SO, SO, SO happy. I loathe Wal-Mart and really didn't want to spend money there, even if it was for charity.Tuesday$11.64 milk and snacks$12.79 Quizno's (...haven't done a grocery shop yet...)So, not too bad overall, considering about half of it was for charity, and I do get the money back for the photos."},

I couldn't stand it anymore, so pulled it out of my wallet, took the scissors to it and just did it.There's still $53 owing on it (plus monthly fees of $6 - it's a secured card), so my plan is to pay off the remaining amount at the beginning of December (with my \"free\" paycheques), plus six months of fees, THEN cancel it. I'd already lowered the limit on it, but it's still too much of a temptation to keep around in my wallet.And my mother called me yesterday and asked if books were fine for Christmas (I have my wish list on Amazon). I suggested either a Superstore or Tim Horton's gift card would be great alternates and instead she's settled on cash, most likely $1K!! :O Exceptionally generous...I'm going to funnel most of it towards a new(er) car, my travel account and my house account.Although that would take care of my VISA card...hmmm...Anyhow, I just had to share my news!"},

Isn't she gorgeous?These were two of many wonderful, beautiful pets who came for their photos today. I believe it was a success today. There was about a half hour or so at the beginning when I was fumbling a bit with the download program, but once I got my head around it and relaxed, I was fine. We didn't have as many people as we would have liked, partially because it's Super Bowl weekend (or Grey Cup or something...), it was a beautiful day, there are lots of craft fairs around and people possibly weren't aware that our photo shoot was a fundraiser. The advertising is going to be amended to state that. As well, the man who played Santa said that last year the second day was a lot busier, so hopefully the same will be true this year.But my back is sore and my knees are sore and I'm tired, but really pleased with how things turned out. So far we have about $600, with the potential for a lot more next week.*******************************************************************Frugal Dreamer has tagged me to tell six interesting things about myself and then tag six others.So, this is my list:1) I'm dating a man 15 years younger than me...and we share the same birthday!2) I never wear - don't even own! - a lick of makeup.3) I live by myself and I have three cats.

{"title": "Moving money", "date": "Saturday 22 November 2008", "text": "I realized the other day that I was really tired of seeing my money just sitting around in my credit union, earning a few pennies (if that) each month, so I decided to move my \"non-immediate\" savings to ING. I transferred $500 (about half) from my vet account, my entire house account ($765.16) and my entire travel fund ($300). While the interest rates aren't what they used to be, the funds will actually earn some while they sit in ING.I got more than I thought from my part-time job, too, so that topped up my Christmas fund, plus paid down some debt, which is nice. I now have only $53 owing on my Mastercard...I may just do a $haronRo$e and cut it up before I pay it off, simply so I'm not tempted to rack it up again! Regardless, it feels pretty good to have it down to such a small amount. I get three paycheques in December, so can you say 'bye-bye' Mastercard?My spending over the past couple of days wasn't bad. I had arranged to meet a friend for dinner on Thursday night and when I arrived at the restaurant (the only genuine Mexican restaurant north of 60!) I saw three extra people! How fun! We had a great time and the food was excellent, as always. Mrs. Sanchez is a magician in a very small kitchen. Everything is made fresh when you order it and the place was packed. Dinner: $20.16 I had a course again today, so the first spend of the day was at Tim Horton's for a tea to take with me.  It was actually pretty interesting - how our branch in the government is organized - and I learned a few things that will benefit me as a supervisor.  It ended about an hour earlier than it was scheduled to (yay!), so I stopped at the photo shop on my way back and then went to Subway to pick up my lunch. Tea: $1.92Subway: $8.92 It turns out that my friend brought her tripod into town for me today, so I didn't end up buying one (YAY).  I had stopped at the photo store to look for something else I needed, but it turns out they didn't have it, so I saved myself some dollars there.  Accessories for photography aren't cheap, so I'm actually a bit relieved right now.  I'll save up to buy a few more bits over the next few months instead. I'm off to bed.  I'm tired and my nerves are starting to get the better of me, and I definitely don't want to be tired and unco-ordinated tomorrow! I have extremely expensive studio lights (borrowed) that I have to be very careful with - one slip and they're gone, quite literally - and I need to be calm and focused when I'm handling them. We're all ready to go, so wish me luck!"},
{"title": "Mid-week spending update", "date": "Thursday 20 November 2008", "text": "This is what Whitehorse looked like at about 1pm yesterday afternoon. I went for a walk with my camera at lunch and took a few photos along the waterfront. Every single tree in and around Whitehorse is coated with thick hoar frost - they all look like those white Christmas trees - know which ones I mean? It's freezing outside (-22C yesterday morning), but so, so beautiful. It's really early for such heavy and frequent ice fog, but what a beautiful world it leaves behind.My spending this week hasn't been too bad.  I bought breakfast at the hotel on Sunday (bacon, rye toast and eggs) and had a very quiet shift, which I spent reading for the most part.  Nice to have a job that you like and that you can legitimately read at (of course, not until I've done my work, which at this time of year takes all of, oh, 10 minutes or so...).$5.16 for breakfast (staff get 50% off)Monday spends:$24.01 for milk, tea (3 boxes Celestial Seasonings ON SALE!) and snacksI also ordered $33.00 worth of coupons from Save.ca and got my $10 back from my friend, so not a bad day overall.  Some of the coupons I'm going to give to the shelter to purchase pet food ($5 off Iams dog, puppy & kitten food).Tuesday I bought a pizza to split with my friend while she and I went over what we needed to do for the photos on Saturday.  I ordered over the phone for a pick up, looking at a pepperoni lovers for $15.99, but when I paid the bill it was only $12.50 for a medium! That was a pleasant surprise.  I've been craving pizza for a while.  It wasn't great, but it really hit the spot and satisfied the craving, so I'm good now for a long time.Today I was really bad.  I got paid today (and got $200 more than I normally do - still can't quite figure that one out, but it's unlikely that it's wrong, so, great!).  I was rushing off to a class this morning - \"Your Union and You\" - and ended up stopping at Tim's for a tea and a bacon breakfast sandwich.  I almost didn't end up at the class because we were two supervisors down, one of the the printers got jammed, the admin assistant was sick again and I had to call in one of the auxiliary staff to come in while our regular staff cleared up three days worth of mail in the back! I learned all this exactly 10 mins before I left.Fortunately everything worked out: IT came to fix the printer, one of supervisors was just late, the mail got done, the auxiliary staff shift worked out perfectly and my class was actually more interesting than I thought it would be.But of course, because I was up late, I didn't get lunch made either, so ended up going to Subway and picked up a 6\" for lunch.Breakfast: $5.06Lunch: $8.33I'm disappointed that I ended up spending that much for two meals, but I'm giving myself a break simply because I've been doing so well the past several weeks (overall).  I think, however, that I'm going to have to get a tripod because I haven't heard from my friend since last week, although she was supposed to be in town at some point getting some work done on her car.  This is a non-negotiable necessity for my photos over the next two weekends, so I may have to \"splurge\" and make a purchase.I've just heard tonight, however, that there is competition for the Pet Photos this year, which is unusual.  The ex-Board Pres (quite a piece of work) is taking Pet Photos at a separate location, although it's doubtful the money raised is going toward charity.  This is actually quite mean-spirited and low, in my opinion, but somehow not a surprise, knowing how she is.  I'm not certain, but it might even be on the same day.  If so, that was done on purpose.I'm working on a post about \"winter weather and costs\", which I'm hoping to post in the next few days (not before Saturday!).  I think it will be a good reminder of what I've spend, what I need to spend, what you need to be careful with, necessities, etc.  I don't have years and years of experience behind me, but it doesn't take long to understand a few important points."},
{"title": "Weekend round-up", "date": "Sunday 16 November 2008", "text": "I've just found out that the official term for ice fog is \"Fog Depositing Ice\" which is how Environment Canada describes it. Regardless, it's fog and it's ice and it was quite heavy and made the 10-minute drive into town a careful one in the -20C morning. It will dissipate once the temperatures go up, but as it's only 8:17 a.m., still dark and still cold, it will probably be several hours yet.Yes, there are times when I wish I lived somewhere else (mostly when I'm scraping my car windows in the cold and the dark and am just sick to death of it), but those times are few and far between.My spends from Friday look like this:Lunch with a friend: $7.50 (a really excellent organic lentil/brown rice bowl)Tea: $1.92 (I've decided to ask for a Tim's card for Christmas, seeing as I spend so much of my own money there every month - why not ask someone for a gift certificate to use instead?)I was at the shelter dog wash on Saturday from 12 - 3 and afterwards stopped at the grocery store to pick up a few fresh things. I bought:pasta $1.58 x 4 bags (the no name brand)cat litter/food: $13.95cucumber $2.59egg nog $2.99(9lb) box of mandarin oranges $6.98cheese $12.18cream of chicken soup (2 tins)$3.18feta cheese (bag) $4.99container of cat litter $10.483 tins cat food $2.97Total: $53.35Who spends $2.59 on a single cucumber? We northerners. Further north, in, say, Iqaluit, prices are even higher because everything is flown or shipped in. Prices for 4L of milk sometimes hover around $12! You have to really like spending some time grocery shopping because produce can be pretty sketchy sometimes, so my general rule of thumb is that if it looks like it's been run over by a truck once, BUY IT! Twice, forget it. There'll be another truck in on Friday. All our produce is trucked in from Edmonton - takes at least a couple of days to get here and if the roads are bad during the winter, sometimes the trucks simply don't make it, or are delayed. Coming from Vancouver Island, where the produce is fabulous and cheap and plentiful, I was initially horrified by quality and cost, but you have to eat, right? You just have to suck it up and shop carefully.My problem with coupons and fliers here is that most of the stuff that goes on sale, I simply don't eat or use. A lot of it is processed food items, some of it is stuff I just don't like, and there are a lot of cleaners that I don't use because they're not environmentally friendly. So it's mostly convenience stuff, which is great, to a point, but that leaves me with not much to choose from on the sale shelves and whatnot. I think I shall have to start scouring the coupon websites to see what sort of things they have and try to pick and choose what will work for me.I am going to make some muffins now, so that I have them for work this week."},

With 8 months of winter, that's a good thing!I'm really pleased that I've managed to do so well with my big grocery shop two weeks ago. I STILL have lots of food left. I've been able to take lunch every day and also have plenty left over for my dinner. It's a good thing I like potatoes! 10 lbs is a lot for one girl to eat...My spending yesterday was stamps for my international Christmas cards for a total of $20.16 (12 Int'l, 2 US). I even got them mailed off, so that's one less thing to worry about this month. I'm not going to worry about my Canadian cards just yet, but can work on getting them done during my shifts at the hotel over the next several weeks. I'll sure need something to do, as high season is long gone...I also bought a book: David Bach's \"Start Late, Finish Rich\", $23.05 (inc. tax). Are personal financial books a need or a want?? I've read his \"Smart Women Finish Rich\" and felt that this other title was more than appropriate.Today my spending looked like this:Phone/Internet payment: $43.00Coke: $2.06Tea: $1.92Books: $50.30 (1 financial book, Gail's bible: \"Your Money or Your Life\", and a travel book, which will be paid for out of my travel account - \"Lonely Planet: Southwest USA\"). I went to the photostore today to check out tripods, too, as that will be my next purchase. There are some decent ones for 20% off right now, but I have to take into consideration weight, strength and durability as well. I was surprised they weren't as pricey as I imagined, to be honest, which is promising. A friend is loaning me hers for the pet photos over the next two weekends, so I can see how that works and make a decision from there. Some of the tripods even had little min levels on them... I also loaned my friend $10 for gas for his truck (he gets paid tomorrow), and as he's good at paying me back, I don't mind doing this on occasion, although I did call him a mooch. But it's time for me to get to bed, even though it's only 8:45. I was so tired by the time I got home after work today that I was dreaming of bed when I walked in the door at 5:30!"},
{"title": "Remember", "date": "Wednesday 12 November 2008", "text": "I find it disturbing that when I was searching for photos of poppies I ended up at a site promoting white supremacy...I'd just like to take a moment to say \"thank you\" to those who have fought and died for our freedom in the past and who are fighting now.  To those who fought bigotry and hate, so we can have the choices and freedoms we currently enjoy and - usually - take for granted.  I bought a poppy several weeks, but lost it shortly afterwards, so felt a little naked without it today.  I like to have the spot of colour.My day was long.  I had an early shift at the hotel and we were overstaffed at the front desk, so there wasn't much to do, which is really frustrating.  It does mean double time, however, which is nice for my paycheque and I've decided that taking some extra shifts in banquets (serving, setting up, tearing down, etc.) over the Christmas season might be the way to go for some extra cash.My spending today:Tea $1.92Gas $48.84 (46.555L @ $104.9L <--YAHOO!! Plus I made $1.40 I can put towards groceries at SuperStore).I'm reading an excellent book, if anyone is interested in a recommendation.  It's called the \"Zookeeper's Wife\" about the Warsaw Zoo during the war and how it became central to the Resistance and as a hiding place and way station for escaping Jews.  It's really hard to read about the death of the animals, but it's a really well written and compelling read."},
{"title": "Saturday spend", "date": "Sunday 9 November 2008", "text": "I spent $7 on tea and danish for my friend and I this morning on my way to the Humane Society and that's it. I had intended to stop at the plaza afterwards and start my Christmas shopping, but the items I wanted for my mum (slippers) haven't arrived yet, so the motivation for that dissappeared very quickly. It appears I'll have to wait another week or so to start.I was at the shelter this morning for a photoshoot. Last year, the Carcross posties had a fundraiser for us (Carcross is about an hour south of Whitehorse) and presented us with a cheque for $2600, which was a fantastic donation. This year they managed to almost double their collected amount and presented us with a cheque for $4000! Amazing! Carcross is a big cruise ship day trip destination, so a lot of the people who donated were just visitors, away from their homes for several weeks and missing their pets. One cruiser apparently made the bus driver stop specifically so she could drop $20 into the collection tin. She'd seen it on the Internet and wanted to contribute.Anyhow, it's important for the board members to show up at as many fundraisers and promotions as possible, and I really like to be there to support my friend, the administrator, too. This shoot was really fun. The photographer for the paper took the pictures (his own as well as at least 4 others') and we should see ourselves in the paper next week. How fun! That's us at the top, there.  One of the posties has a puppy called Melvin, who's actually going home next week, and that's Odie, who is still looking for a home.  He's a bit overwhelmed with all the goings on, poor little fella, but a lovely boy.Wednesday's pay was 1/3 of what I normally get because of my holiday, but I still made sure to put a little bit into each of my savings accounts.  It appears that my princess might need another visit to the vet for an ear infection in the very near future, but I'm going to keep an eye on it over the several days and see how it goes.  My vet account is rebuilding nicely after Bylaw's dental expenses, and I still have $125 in my car account after paying the insurance last week.  While the pay was comparatively small, even after all my transfers, I still have enough for grocery bits & pieces plus my international stamps for Christmas cards.An early night for me tonight - I have to be up at 5:30 to get to work.  After a dinner of baked potato and sausage, I will most likely just head straight to bed, even though it's still early.  I still have lots of time to do some reading, too."},
{"title": "Weekly Round Up", "date": "Saturday 8 November 2008", "text": "Well, I've got to hand it to myself: I sure can spend money! This comes as no surprise, but is definitely increasingly frustrating to me, so I suppose that, at least, is a step in the right direction.My week looks like this:Sunday - NO spending! Hurrah!Monday - $9.00, Tim Horton's (3 teas & 2 choccy danish)Tuesday - $480.08 car insurance for the yearWednesday - $550.00 camera flash & extra battery for cameraThursday - $119.00 exam fee & study guidesFriday - $56.35 prescription, toilet paper, milk & snacksAt first glance, I'm really quite horrified (I use this word a lot to describe my spends, don't I?), however, if I dissect it a little more carefully, it breaks down much better (as long as I conveniently ignore - for the moment - the Timmy expenses).Car insurance is a necessity if you drive, as everyone knows.  Paying off the full year in advance is quite a coup, as I normally pay monthly, which adds interest so is actually not a very fiscally responsible way to pay.  This way, I've freed up $51.92 each month, which I can divert into my car account and/or onto my debt.  Plus it was $16 cheaper than my statement indicated.The camera flash and extra battery.  That does, technically, fall into that awkward gray area, but I've been nominated to take the official \"Pets with Santa\" photos for the Humane Society at the end of the month! It's a fundraiser we do each year and it's hugely popular.  We had a great photographer last year, but as he was the husband of one of our departed board members, we'd prefer to leave that particular option lie.  Buying a flash was on my list of \"eventuals\" for the camera, and it's been moved up to accommodate my first ever photoshoot.  I am both terrified and very excited about this fundraiser.  I hope I'm up to snuff!Yesterday's spend was a bit impetuous, I admit, however, I need this particular exam to get accepted into the local college.  If I am going to reach one of my 5-year goals - teaching English as a Second Language - I need to start my classes NOW.  The exam is called the LPI - Language Proficiency Index - and I can use it in lieu of transcripts to apply for a class.  As I don't know what program I want at this point (Communications? Linguistics?), it makes more sense to work towards realistic classes (English, Psychology, that sort of thing), earn the credits and apply them to a program once I make a decision.  The exam is being written December 6 and I've also ordered the study guides, so that I can make a real, concerted effort to PASS this.  No one except me will profit from passing this, and I can't afford to waste any more time putting it off.  I could register for a correspondence course from a bigger university, but it would cost three times as much.  Each class at the local college is $150, a bargain by any stretch.And today's spend, well...necessities all.  Toilet paper, my prescription, milk.Frugal Dreamer did some research into budget tracking options over on her blog.  It appears the majority of us use Excel, but I'm going to experiment with a couple of others and see how it works out for me.  I'm not that disciplined, so having a program that does a little more of the work for me would be nice."},

I've not done it since I got back - I really hate going right after work, because it gets crazy busy at Superstore, and I usually end up walking right back out.  This morning I was there before 10:00, and spent my time poking around.  I really do love to grocery shop, I just hate having to fight traffic to get to the cucumbers!So I filled my cupboards and fridge today with the following:fresh pineapple (sm) $3.191% cottage cheese (750 g) $3.98Ground Round (the soy stuff, 1248 g) $8.6910 lb bag of Gala apples $7.98Bottle of Coke $1.75 (inc recycle fee)Ice cream (splurge #1) $5.49Red pepper #1 $2.13 (these cost $9.68 kg!)Granny Smith apples $5.60 (1.215 kg @ $4.61 kg)pasta sauce $4.39Tikka Masala sauce $4.99Pesto $2.89Korma sauce $4.99Red pepper #2 $2.37Lemon #1 $1.29Lemon #2 $1.09 (2 for $2.38)Gr peppers $2.11 ($5.49 kg)10 lb russet potatoes $4.29red onion $.90pasta sauce $2.892 x gr onions $1.00bananas $1.99 ($1.72 kg)2 x mandarins $5.964L skim milk $4.69radishes $.85yogurt (750 g) $3.99tapioca pudding (splurge #2) $2.98turkey breat (frozen) $16.99eggs, free run lg $4.39cucumber $1.99soy cheese $4.98turkey sausages $5.99raspberries $3.29veggie slices 2 @ $3.99 eaorganic spinach $3.29tuna steak (frozen) 2 @ $7.99 eacat food $4.38 (6 @ 0.73)cat litter $3.58Scary total: $166.64After superbucks: $163.03Then I went to a second store:turkey fillets $6.56turkey sausages $3.28chicken breasts $15.77 (this was the cheapest family pack I could find)egg nog (splurge #3)tomato soup $1.54 (2 @ 0.77 ea)cr of chicken soup $3.18 (2 @ $1.59 ea)half a ham $8.38 (I SWEAR it was the smallest one available!)Grand total: $48.06Total groceries: $211.09I made a big quinoa salad when I got home, cut up the pineapple and have put some of the raspeberries and yogurt into a container for breakfast tomorrow.  The salad should last me at least three days, and I'm hoping that I can stretch out the rest to last at least three weeks which will bring my total weekly grocery spending to $70.00 per week.  Lots of pasta, rice, chicken, etc. in my future, and I'll most likely have to refresh the veggies at some point, but I think I'm good to go.  I love having food in the house, and have hated paying for lunch every day the past couple of weeks.  OUCH!I also managed to finish off two more books this month, which brings my total to 5! That's quite a lot, but I keep taking them out of the library for some reason...And I DID return that book I was reconsidering as well.I've made my list of November goals as well.  There are kind of a lot, but I think I can manage most of them without too much trouble.1) Poke through my closets again and donate more stuff to charity now that I have so much NEW stuff2) Take the old pots & pans to charity; I bought a new set on sale3) 10 No Spend days4) Send overseas Christmas cards5) No more credit card spending6) Start Christmas shopping7) Look into satellite vs. cable costs8) Pay the car insurance in full $496.12 is what remains after the Oct payment9) Create a 6-mth & a 5-yr plan10) Finish my 101 Things & 50x50 list...ongoing (it's hard)I'm also going to continue putting 18% of my pay into my RRSP, which I started doing in September.  It's growing very well with the added 8%, and I have to decide if I want to put it into ING or into Scotiabank once it reaches $3500.  I think ING is more stable at this point, as I'd put it into the mutual fund option with Scotiabank, however, it's such a little amount (comparatively) that I don't think the fluctuations of the market at the moment would affect it too badly.I signed up for Savings Bonds before I left on holiday as well - I've chosen $10 per pay at this point, but can always adjust it, depending on what happens with my job.  I also opened one of the new Tax Free Savings Accounts at ING.  They give you a bonus at the moment if you open one (although they aren't \"official\" until Jan 1), so I thought that sounded like a good idea.  I put $1000 from my EF into it, leaving me just over $500 in my EF, which at this point is fine.  I've adjusted the amount I transfer into the EF each month as well, from $250 to $100 (split equally between my EF and my new Tax Free Svgs).  After reading Frugal Dreamer's concerns about her debt and savings, I decided to cut back on what I was saving, too, and I'm not willing or comfortable to cut it entirely at this point.  But this does give me an extra $150 a month to put towards my debt!And if anyone's interested, gas has fallen below $120.0! It's currently $117.9 p/L."},

Well, I can't say that my spending this month was anywhere close to \"frugal\", more like \"How much can one woman actually spend?\"As it's basically the end of October, I thought I'd review how I did/am doing on my goals.1) Start paying cash for everything â when itâs gone, too bad!- This definitely needs work.2) Two no-spend days a week- Again, something to focus on3) Start keeping track of my spending, down to the last penny (something I needed to have been doing for months already)- This I've started!4) Start shopping âat homeâ before going to the grocery store- will be doing this this week, before I go shopping5) Delete World of Warcraft from my computer- Done!6) Hang plastic in my windows before I leave for Victoria on Wednesday- Three out of four done; last window to be done in the next couple of weeks7) Finish my 101 Things & my 50x50 list- No8) Get to bed by 9:30 p.m. every night- Most nights I have, despite visiting friends on holiday, etc.9) Get snow tires on the truck before I leave for holiday (we had snow on Monday! It didnât stick, but stillâ¦and Iâd rather miss the rush)- Did this on Oct 7; very glad I did, as we now actually have snow to stay10) Find out what I currently owe on my student loan- $3395.20 as of Oct 23/0811) Start Christmas shopping in Victoria- No12) ENJOY MY TIME OFF!- Absolutely did!!Long-Term Goals1) Read 2 â 3 books a month (totally do-able)- Three this month: \"A is for Alibi\" by Sue Grafton; \"The Case of the Missing Library Books\" & \"Mr Dixon Disappears\" by Ian Sansome)2) Floss daily (I really like my teeth where they are!)- 10/31 days so far3) Find and use wheat/gluten-free/low sugar/organic alternatives whenever possible (snacks, regular use items, etc)4) No book purchase until the end of December! (I work at the library for crying out loud â this shouldnât be difficultâ¦)- have bought 4, but will most likely return one5) Keep, roll and deposit change regularly- on track6) Meal plan and cook weekly7) Reach $2K in emergency fund, then halve my contribution and put half towards my outstanding student loan- EF is just over $1500; in the meantime I'm going to put $10 p/wk extra onto my loanBetter than I thought, but still not fully completed.  The long-term goals, obviously, are a constant work in progress, but a decent start on them is promising.My holiday, while welcome, relaxing, very enjoyable and warm, was also quite horrifying with respect to spending.  It turns out that being \"stuck\" in the North, with limited access to all the wants of the Outside is a very good thing for me, apparently.I went down with a list of needs:New jeans (Warehouse One is not an option, I'm afraid - I'm TOO OLD to buy pants there)Underwear (because I refuse to shop at Wally World)Decent gloves (more competition=better prices)Body Shop itemsA wedding present for my sister and new BILAnd ended up with a LOT of wants:FurnitureFabulous beeswax candlesA Bodytalk sessionMuseum/IMAX visitVarious soapsAnd of course the dinners and lunches that I shared with my friends.  And the little \"things\" I picked up: Gel Gems, slippers, table settings (for my new table), books, funny magnets, mailing a pkg of \"things\" home, some T-shirts...Yes, it was, essentially, sheer and utter madness.  I don't even want to add up the numbers because I'd probably fall over.  However, I will say again that it has been over two years since I've been Outside, I put money straight into all my savings accounts first (in most cases a little more than I normally do), and I received an extra $1000 on my regular paycheque.  Excuses all, I know, but I'm set for a very long time now, and the next few months will just have to be extreme belt-tightening ones.I realize that furniture is not usually something that you'd buy while on holiday, but I love what I bought.  My sister's partner is an artist and he and his ex-wife used to have a business, part of which was reclaiming second-hand furniture.  David would carve the hard edges off the pieces and add images into the wood - stars and moons, for example - and his ex would paint them these wild, bright, funky colours.  I think David is happy to have that final tie broken with his ex, as he wants nothing to do with her, yet is also glad the pieces are going to someone who will really appreciate them.  The price they gave me for 7 items is excellent ($400), plus I will pay for the shipping.  The only catch is that I have no idea when I'll be getting the pieces, as they're making plans to move to Cambridge (UK) for my sister's PhD, but as nothing's definite yet, it could be 3 months, it could be more like a year.  Regardless, I will at last be able to get rid of my garage sale/college dorm collection!The trip itself was great.  I didn't realize how much I actually needed a holiday until I was on it! The first day I arrived, taking the ferry from Vancouver to Nanaimo, on the Island, I saw a pod of killer whales and a pod of porpoises! I've never seen the porpoises before, so I was thrilled, to say the least.  I also saw a little group of 4 porpoises from the ferry on the way back to Vancouver! I visited with two friends up-island and then headed down into Victoria, where I stayed with my sister in James Bay, the oldest residential area in Victoria.  Beautiful old Victorian-era buildings and a 20-minute walk from town, so I was back and forth daily, as well as making visits to the beach and ocean, which is a block from my sister's place.I'd forgotten how damp it was there, and I plumped up like a plum! It was great - my hair curled up, my skin was lovely and smooth and soft...but it was difficult to sleep sometimes simply because it was also quite warm.  Not complaining (!), just making a point. :-P My sister and her boyfriend had a commitment ceremony the weekend I got to town (basically they got married, just without the fuss and muss and bother of a \"legal\" wedding and a third party officiating), then it was Thanksgiving and then I only had 4 days to see my friends! I couldn't see everyone, unfortunately, but I saw the people I really, really wanted to see.  It was a little overwhelming, as I had to work around their work schedules obviously, but we picked up basically right where we left off, which was, I admit, a relief to me.  Distance shouldn't change the basics of good friendship, but it can, and I think I was worried about that.All in all, a wonderful break, although I was a little melancholy on my return last week, mainly because there are aspects I really do miss, but I know that moving back would be a mistake as it was a \"grass is greener\" moment.  I've decided that perhaps I just need to visit a little more often, instead.And try to convince my friends to visit ME instead! :-)I do have some photos, but I've been a little unmotivated since I've been back, so haven't downloaded them yet.  I will post some when I get organized and share a little of Victoria with you."},

I also returned two pairs of pants and exchanged another. I've taken $100 out of the bank so that I have some cash to travel with tomorrow as I know there will be some costs involved in getting myself to the Island. I'm getting SO excited! :-) I can't believe it's been over two years already.  I am splurging somewhat and renting a car for two days to visit some friends while I'm on the island, so I'm going to have to make sure I'm careful not to get carried away the rest of the trip.I am a little concerned about my little girl cat, Dinah; of course just as I'm heading out of Territory for an extended period of time, it appears she's got a bit of an infection in her lower lip. It doesn't seem to be bothering her at all (unless I fuss with it), so I suppose all I can do is ask my friend to keep an eye on it while he's here. I've learned that tea tree oil is toxic to cats, so I can't put that on it, but I did try a little antiseptic cream which might help a little bit. Regardless, it will require a vet visitThere's always something!My spending hasn't been TOO bad over the past couple of days. This is how it breaks down:Oct 5/08Dinner $45.90 (that was just mine...ouch)Oct 6/08Tim Hortons: $6.58 (2 teas, 2 cinnamon buns)Returns: $28.35 & $33.60 = +$61.95Oct 7/08Starbucks $4.28 (hot chocolate, chocolate croissant; and I'm sure that's not quite right because a venti costs $4.75...)Snow Tires $100.80 (from car account which is suddenly very low). Although I'm not really a Starbuck's fan, I had a nice couple of hours sitting there with my book, just relaxing and waiting for my truck to be ready. I haven't ever really done that before.It's a cup of tea and an early night for me. I have to be up early to catch a plane! :-)"},

The total amount for the two was $624.95.  Not quite getting myself out of debt, but like I said, I justify the decision simply because of the low(er) interest rate of the LOC.Okay!

{"title": "October already!", "date": "Thursday 2 October 2008", "text": "Where does the time go? Iâm sure I didnât accomplish much this month; it certainly doesnât feel like it.

Whatever I didnât do last month will just get rolled over into this month anyway.Iâve decided to make a list of both short-term (monthly) and long-term goals that I can plug away at, mostly so I donât stress myself out and beat myself up if I donât accomplish something I wanted to right away. We all understand that life gets in the way of plans as well as our own human foibles, so as long as Iâm consistently managing my monthly goals, focusing on changing old habits and being conscious of my spending, I think Iâll consider myself âon track.âI know I have receipts somewhere for what I spent during the last couple of days of September (Iâm at work at the moment and am going mostly by memoryâ¦which isnât that great at the best of times!). I had a biggish dental bill for a cleaning - $117 â but thatâs important because thatâs a matter of my health and overall well-being. Besides, I love that clean feeling on my teeth afterwards. It makes me reluctant to eat againâ¦And I spent $28.65 on groceries and sundry (which, er, includes the ever-popular Tim Hortonâs).Apart from that, I managed quite well. I made an error on my calculations for reimbursement for my Dawson travel, but thatâs okay: Iâll be getting back a total of $377.30, part of which will be applied to my December rent, the rest into my various savings accounts.Today I went up to the HR HQ at work and picked up a Canada Savings Bond application form. The rate is far from what it was in the 70âs & 80âs (hovering this year at around the 3% mark), but itâs âout of sight, out of mindâ opportunity to save some of what I make. It comes directly off my paycheque (and itâs $10 per payâ¦not even noticeable) and is therefore painless. So, a goal I hadnât written down, yet accomplished anyway.I am officially on holiday for 16 days as of tomorrow (!!!) â all of it unpaid. However, I did pick up two extra shifts at the hotel over the weekend, which Iâm regretting a bit now, because all I really want to do over the next three days is relax and get myself organized before I head down southâ¦but Iâve committed myself now, and my shifts finish early enough (3 pm) that I can get a few things done after work if I have to.So without further ado, these are my lists of goals, short- and long-termOctober goals:1) Start paying cash for everything â when itâs gone, too bad!2) Two no-spend days a week3) Start keeping track of my spending, down to the last penny (something I needed to have been doing for months already)4) Start shopping âat homeâ before going to the grocery store5) Delete World of Warcraft from my computer - Done Oct 26) Hang plastic in my windows before I leave for Victoria on Wednesday7) Finish my 101 Things & my 50x50 list8) Get to bed by 9:30 p.m. every night9) Get snow tires on the truck before I leave for holiday (we had snow on Monday!

{"title": "Week-End Round Up", "date": "Sunday 28 September 2008", "text": "I've been away all week and have just spent a couple of hours getting caught up on all your blogs.  Everyone's been really busy! Holly is working on her 101 list and gave blood (!); Frugal Trenches is focussing on what she needs to make sure her life-puzzle pieces fit together well; Frugal Dreamer is doing great with her monthly goals...It's so inspiring to have so many people on the same journey and be able to follow the success's, the slips and the recoveries.  It's exciting to read how everybody reaches their goals each month - or does their very best - and continues to find different goals each month.  I'm learning so much from reading all the blogs that it's almost more fun to just read and not write! :-)I've had a week away working in Dawson City.  It's a pretty quiet community and more so now that a lot of places have closed for the season.  I'm not sure what the permanent population is, but it hovers somewhere around 1,800 I think.  It's the third largest community in the Yukon and has a comparatively big library, which is a school/public library combination.  This poses its own challenges when it comes to automation, but we were there to weed books and spent 4 very full days pulling items that hadn't been borrowed in five years off the shelves.  We ended up with about 60 boxes - and we're only half done! It will mean a return trip to finish it, but it's a pretty good start.  At this point, I'm not sure we'll get back before spring, as we hit snow flurries just north of Stewart Crossing (about 3 hrs north of Whitehorse) on our trip back.  The road will probably close in the next month or so...Because I was travelling for work, the spending this week was a little all over the place.  I also made a visit to the animal shelter and bought some food for the dogs, which bumped up the total (but just a bit...ahem...).  I missed the chance the last time I was up there in August, so wanted to make sure I made it this time.  It was nice to see it and although it's small, they definitely do what they can.  Right now they only have four dogs and four cats, so they're doing \"better\" than we are - some of our dogs are doubled up.My spending for the week is as follows:$240 cash: Meals for most of the week, including half the cost of taking the librarian and her boyfriend out for dinner on Thursday evening (Dawson ain't cheap!); some small groceries and shampoo/conditioner because I managed to leave mine at home; and a thank-you gift for my co-worker who cared for my cats while I was gone! :-($178.50: 3 giant bags of dog food for the shelter (that's with the musher's discount).  The manager is a great girl, super chatty and even donated some food for residents of the Whitehorse Humane Society!$45.79: 2 breakfasts at the hotel + lunch for my co-worker and I at our stop in Carmacks on the way home on FridayGrand total: $464.29Except for the dog food donation, I will get all my expenses back and probably MAKE money from that.  The per diem's of the Yukon Government are quite ridiculous, so I'm not complaning because if I've figured it out right, I should get almost $600 back.  On top of that, I worked 16 hours of overtime this week.  As I have no choice but to get paid out for that, that should add approximately another $500, too.  It was exhausting work - because we were so focused on getting as much done as we possibly could, the longest time I was out was an hour & a half on my trek to the shelter! Gah...But I'm off work starting Friday, and off to Victoria on the 8th, which I'm looking forward to.  I'm really excited about my time off: a little shopping, a little eating and a lot of catching up with my friends. :-)"},

{"title": "A weekly round-up", "date": "Sunday 21 September 2008", "text": "Well, it hasn't my best week to date by any stretch of imagination, but apart from mad spending on DVD box sets on Monday and Tuesday (which, as Frugal Dreamer says, will keep me entertained for weeks now), I also bought a plane ticket and BCAA coverage for my truck. I've been saving for my trip to Victoria since about January and had just over $1500 to this point.  Airline prices have gone up so I paid $100 more for my ticket than I would have last year, but there's nothing I can do about that.  I have two airline choices to get Outside: Air Canada ($$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$) or Air North ($$$).  My total, then, for my return flight on Air North (taking into consideration the minimum two-week discount) is $628.25.  This has already been pre-paid onto my Visa card, and I still have plenty of funds to use in Victoria.  Plus I have a paycheque this week and in two weeks' time, when I'm actually there, so there's still a little time to plump up the travel funds until I leave in October.  I'm actually taking 10 days off after much mulling and thought because I haven't had a holiday in two years, I work every weekend and sometimes taking care of yourself and relaxing is worth more than a paycheque.  I've reached that point, as I want some time to get a few things done around the apartment.  With one day off a week, lots of stuff just gets pushed aside for \"later.\"I bought roadside assistance again because with a very old truck (by vehicle standards - she's 27) it's a peace of mind that I need through our very long, very cold winters.  Last year I used it twice in two weeks: once for a tow ($125) and once for unlocking the truck ($60) when I shut the keys in it (it was -43C that morning...), and for $70 for the year, I definitely got my money's worth.  I feel it's well worth the cost, even if I don't have to use it this year.I've got two trips that I'd like to do next year, so I'm going to be very careful with what I spend while I'm away this time.  I found a pamphlet about Horsepacking Trips of 1 - 8 days, which I thought was really fortunate, as I've wanted to do something like this for years! Of course, I've decided on a 7 night trek (may as well make it worthwhile, right?) for $2188 and a driving trip to the South-West US.  This was just decided today with a co-worker of mine and we're looking at next September, so there's lots of time to plan, etc. Two things in particular may halt the trip, namely a road-worthy vehicle and whether my friend will still be in Canada (she's German) as she'll need permanent resident status to do any travelling! So...planning is fun, but I'll need a contigency plan in case it doesn't work out.Spending this week (apart from the above):Lunch on Friday with a friend: $7.98Groceries: $16.49 (inc. $10 for 16 kg of cat litter)New shirt: $31.50 (this was on sale, plus I also saved $5 by exchanging a pair of pants).  Another want, I admit, but it looks really cute! Ha! :-)Another week of travel ahead of me.  5 days no driving (not really counting the fact I'm driving to pick up a government vehicle Monday morning and leaving my truck until Friday when I need to get home).  Plus I'm going to get loads of overtime from my week of travel, plus another reimbursement cheque for it, so I should be fine with keeping my expenses and savings about where they currently are.But first there's a 5 a.m. start...blah!"},
{"title": "Uh-oh...", "date": "Thursday 18 September 2008", "text": "I have NOT been good the past several days.  Not at all.  I went shopping on the weekend with a friend and ended up with two pairs of new pants that would fall into that big gray area of \"needs that I wanted\".I have about 8 pairs of cords (I LOVE cords), but most of them don't fit me anymore, so keeping in mind of the coming cold months, I decided to find a nice pair that I could actually be comfortable in.  I picked up one pair ($27) and a pair of jeans ($32), but am going to return the jeans for another pair of cords on the weekend.  They're much warmer for winter and jeans are just jeans, really.  I have three pairs and that's sufficient for now.My friend, however, picked up the lunch tab, which was really nice of her.  So we got to visit (rare) AND I got a free lunch out of it, so I certainly can't complain about that.  After lunch, we swung by the grocery store and I picked up a few things for the animal shelter that they needed.  I set aside about $80 a month for the shelter (it can buy a lot of food or supplies) and spent $73.73, which falls well into my monthly budget for this, so that's my charity dollars spent for September.  I've also offered some more of my time, to help clean the cat cages on at least one weekend day, which will give my friend some well-deserved time off.I finished watching the second season of Weeds on Sunday night and this of course prompted me to rush out on Monday and start spending blithely at the store (not Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart is the Evil Empire and other people can spend their money there, but not me!).  Honestly, it was almost embarrassing...Season 2 of Ugly BettySeason 3 of WeedsSeason 1 of The OfficeSeason 1 of Pushing DaisiesFinal installment of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's EndGrand total: $209.94!!I share them with co-workers, and I borrow on occasion too.  I currently have Season 1 of Northern Exposure, Charlie's Angels (the Series) and a Canadian show called Slings & Arrows to watch.But that still doesn't really excuse my mad purchases.  I'm trying not to watch as much cable, so I suppose I'm justifying my spending that way, but still...I guess I'll have to use my \"mad money\" account to cover those expenditures.I also spent $45.39 at the drug store getting a few things that I needed.  Some is going to be used right away, some will be good for quite some time.  I needed a spacious cosmetics case to take travelling with me, as the one I have now barely contains the half dozen things I take with me.  The new one has space to spare, so I'm really pleased.I did get confirmation that my very first investment has been received and set up with Investors Group.  It's ostensibly a house fund and I've also started a $50 per month automatic debit with them into an RSP.  With all the horror stories around about defaulting and bankruptcy-protection seeking insurance companies, it's a little nervewracking to be making decisions like that, but I really don't think there's anything that we can do except trust a little in \"the system\" and know that it will recover, it just won't be overnight.  I'm still convinced that saving and investing are safe enough.  Although the rates aren't staggering at this this time, I believe that a little return is still a positive return.It's far better than no return at all!"},
{"title": "Weekend Round-Up", "date": "Saturday 13 September 2008", "text": "My day off today! So it's time to do some things around the house - dishes, laundry, hang some plastic in the windows (one down, but have been putting off doing the rest because I have to fiddle around the blinds, so it's a bit time consuming), and go for lunch and shopping with a friend.On the shopping list today: a new winter jacket, something in between my parka and my windbreaker; a really skookum pair of gloves as I seem to have real trouble keeping my hands warm in the winter; and I have to remember to pick up my prescription! I have a savings account that will be suitable \"mad money\" for these items, so I won't have to be putting it on a credit card or taking it out of an account that I need.My biggest expense this week was a vet bill for $510.65 for my cat Bylaw, who had a dental appointment.  I was expecting it to be twice that, actually, so I was - dare I say it? - pleasantly surprised to hear the amount.  The reason it's \"so cheap\" is that Bylaw didn't need any extractions, which I'm curious about.  Maybe that's another visit...Regardless, it came from the vet account, and I paid by debit, so no credit card interest!I did spend $66.42 on groceries & cat food, too.  Not bad, but instead of doing the smart thing and \"shopping\" at home first, I picked up 4 loaves of bread for a really good price only to find I had 4 already in the freezer at home! So, I reckon I'm good for bread for about 6 months now, as I don't eat as much bread as I used to! Granted, this was a last minute shop instead of a planned one, so not surprising I bought stuff I didn't need!I spent three days in a workshop this week, where all meals were supplied, so all I needed (oops! \"wanted\") was my tea from Tim's to start my day off right.  To top it off, I'll be getting a little overtime as I was involved in presenting at the workshop.  Yay! And I'm still waiting for a reimbursement cheque for a trip at the end of August.  That will likely arrive sometime next week and should add just over $100 to my finances.So, despite a couple of big spends, it's actually not as bad as I thought and I STILL have lots left in my chequing account!"},

My Internet was acting up for a couple of days, so I haven't been able to post as this isn't something I should be doing at work.  I started an update yesterday, but got distracted before I got much done, so don't remember where I wanted to go with it.But it's a new day today and it doesn't matter what didn't get done yesterday.On Sunday I worked at the hotel and spent $1.92 on my tea from Tim's (I admit, it's an addicition - I'm naming them \"Tim-ergencies\" from now on...).  It's a nice routine, but when the temperatures plummet to -40C, I refuse to apologize for a hot drink to get me going in the morning!For breakfast I would have bought some pancakes (a weakness), but the server offered to share an omelette with me, so I took advantage of that instead.  It was a really good omelette. :-)Over the past couple of days I've worked on my September goals, so despite the fact they're late this is what I've come up with (in no particular order):1) Finish my 101 Things in 1001 Days list (wow...this is challenging)2) Save all my change, including my twoonies to roll and put in the bank (I need the loonies for laundry)3) Read \"Smart Women Finish Rich\" and do the accompanying exercises4) Ensure that my overtime and my travel reimbursements are designated to both debt and my savings accounts as equally as possible.5) Get a copy of my Canada Pension Plan update6) Ask financial advisor about \"pre-tax\" investing and whether this is realisticI got part of my travel reimbursements yesterday and deposited the cheque today.  I have one more coming and have another whole week of travel coming up, so can expect more sometime in October (this travel thing is fun!).  The upcoming travel also means quite a lot of overtime as well, so this bodes well for my debt repayment and savings accounts.I'm planning a 10-day trip Outside in mid-October to Victoria to visit my friends.  Now that my storage locker has been taken care of, I can spend all my time relaxing and visiting with people, which will be really nice.  I want to be independent instead of relying on other people to get me around, so I'm hoping to rent a car for the time I'm there.  As it happens, I got a renewal letter for BCAA yesterday as well and it turns out that Hertz rentals offers discounts to BCAA members! So while renting a car isn't cheap, at least I can save some money if I decide to do it.  I'm going to do a little research into it and see what the offer looks like before I make a final decision.The trip, however, will be \"free time\" for me, as I don't get paid holidays from my job, so I have to be careful how I spend while I'm gone.  I just have to stay focused and not go crazy with the shopping opportunities that I just don't have here."},
{"title": "Daily Tracking September 6", "date": "Saturday 6 September 2008", "text": "I'm spending my day off puttering about and trying to get caught up on a few things. I did a big load of laundry, which washed while I went out for an hour to pick up a few things.After my financial boost of cancelling a couple of unncessary things over the past week or so, I didn't do particuarly well today, even though I made a list before I went out.Cat litterWater (x2 or 3): ... Cost: $0.59?? Wow! Somebody certainly made a mistake in my favour when ringing through my 12 bottles of water! Whoops... :-PI wanted to stock up on the flats of 35, but they were sold out. I realize it's sort of stupid to BUY water, but I recycle the bottles and donate the proceeds to the Humane Society.Total: $11.62Pillows: x2.My pillows were awful. Constant pounding and \"fluffing\" didn't help, so I bit the bullet and bought two new ones today. I took my older pillows (I had 4) to charity, as they're still okay, I just haven't been sleeping very well lately, so I updated the pillows and hope they'll help.2 pillows: $166 rolls paper towel: $5.00Also purchased was a travel bag, as I don't have one that suffices for short trips. I don't need a regular sized suitcase for a weekend away, so this will be a good compromise and is the perfect size for carry-on luggage for a plane, too.Travel bag: $15Total: $37.80And the unnecessary purchases (I was swayed by the colours...):3 new towels: $20.95The old towels will be donated to the Humane Society for their monthly dog wash as they're still in good enough shape to use for quite a few dogs!I made a dozen muffins this afternoon, too, so I have snacks to take to work for the next few days. I've only paid for one visit to Tim Horton's this week, too, as one co-worker paid for my tea and another owed me one. :-)Travel plans for Dawson City are in the works for the week of September 22. It's going to be way more work than the last time we were there in August as our task this time is to thoroughly weed the library and barcode some of the books in preparation for automation sometime in October. This will be a LOT of work, but will equal some serious overtime. My status at work means that I have to get paid out for any overtime that I earn instead of taking it as time owing. Time owing would be a nice option in this case as I'm taking a few days off in mid-October and won't be getting paid for it. Everything should balance out okay as long as I designate the funds properly.I'm still waiting (a bit impatiently) for my expense cheques from last month, too, but will get my overtime on my next paycheque on Wednesday. I'm not sure exactly how much I'll be getting, but it will be designated appropriately.I also had some good news from a friend in Victoria today. She and I had been sharing a storage locker since just before I moved North two years ago. Today, she emptied it out! She's just bought a house and is going to keep my things for me. Not only does that save me $240 a year, I have a little refund of $30 due to me!"},
{"title": "(Almost) Daily Tracking - September 3", "date": "Thursday 4 September 2008", "text": "I like that I'm actually beginning to understand this money stuff. Â I have a LONG way to go, don't get me wrong, but I'm finding that I like to see that I'm saving a dollar here, a dollar there...The past couple of days have actually been pretty good in the grand scheme of things and will save me a total of $40 a month or $480 a year. Â Not insubstantial over the course of, say, 5 years: $2400. Â That's a pretty good injection into an Emergency Fund or into debt repayment, so I'm really pleased with that.After several attempts at phoning to try and cancel my video game account over the past couple of days and getting nothing but a busy signal, I ended up going on-line to do it this afternoon, so I am now video game free (okay, as of the end of September, when the current pre-payment expires)! Hurrah! :-) Savings: $15/mthI also had to speak with my credit union (which is still in Victoria) about one issue yesterday and while I was on the phone, the service rep suggested a different account type for me. Â My current account is free everything, apart from visits to other ATMs. Â Whitehorse has no credit unions, only the \"Big 5\" chartered banks, so everytime I use a bank's ATM, I get dinged $1.50 from one of the \"Big 5\" plusÂ $2.10 per transaction from the credit union in Victoria (I thought the ATM visits were free, but apparently that's only true if you use other credit union ATMs...there's always something!). Â Anyhow, those charges were costing me $10-$12 a month - I take my rent from the credit union account - and with the new account, I get 4 free withdrawals a month from a \"not my bank\" ATM for a flat fee of $5 a month, which will allow me to get my rent essentially for free! Savings: $5/mth (approx)I also deposited $28 in rolled coins into my bank account today, although I'm somewhat annoyed that as of September 1st, the interest rate has dropped by 0.75%! I've decided that I will put my Christmas gift funds into this account instead of saving for something radical, as it's not really an issue if I get a lot of interest on something like that.My spending over the past couple of days looks like this.

That's a lot of thinking to do...And sincere thanks to Canadian Saver for picking me as one of her \"I Heart Your Blog\" faves!

{"title": "Chopping costs slowly", "date": "Saturday 30 August 2008", "text": "Yesterday I finally crossed a couple more things off my lists of \"to do\" items.I called the phone/Internet provider and shaved $20 off my monthly bill.  I initally switched providers (we have two, one now owns the other, so any potential savings are marginal to zero) as I wanted a land line, and the alternative to cable Internet was ADSL.  Bundled, the two cost me - now - $115 a month.I also called and lowered the limit on my credit card.  Because it's a secured card, I'm pretty sure I can't negotiate the interest rate, but I think I will try calling and see what I can do.  I lowered the limit so that the less I have, the less trouble I can get into.  And besides, it's all earning interest, but not the good kind.So my monthly fixed expenses are as follows:Rent: $550Cell phone: $50Phone/Internet: $115Cable: $60 (I am having THE worst time letting go...)Student Loan: $60Car Insurance: $51.92Savings: $250WoW account: $15So, there is a potential savings there of $125 if I cancel the cell phone, the cable and the stupid WoW (World of Warcraft) account.  The WoW people aren't open on weekends, so I'll have to wait until Tuesday morning now, as it's the Labour Da, weekend, but it will be the next thing to go, as I really don't need (and, honestly, want) the game anymore.  I rarely play it, so it's really pointless to keep paying for it.After that, I'm going to look into changing my cell phone account, if it's possible.  I have 9 months left on the contract, however, so I have three options.  A) I can cancel the service and pay out what's left on the contract ($20 per month for each month left, which would be $180) or b) see if I can \"sell\" the phone and remaining contract to someone else, or c) see if there's a way to go to pay as you go instead of the monthly fee.  Yet another option is to keep the cell phone and get rid of the land line, but that's a bit more complicated as I need a landline to have Internet, so I'm paying for it anyway.  The easiest and cheapest option is to find someone to take over the contract from me, then I can go to \"pay as you go\".  I like the security of a cell phone, particularly in the winter, so I'm not ready to let it go entirely, but I need a cheaper option.And that leaves the cable.  The easiest thing to do is just pull the plug and have it done with, but why can't I let go? I have DVDs galore to watch, dozens of books to read and god knows what else to do instead, so it's not like I'd lack for entertainment.  I'd really miss my reno shows, though...I know, I know.  Excuses, excuses - it's easy for me to justify having it.  It's not as bad for me as smoking (and I managed to quit that cold-turkey 12.5 yrs ago), but it's still an addiction, my last big one, actually and it's really frustrating me that I can't simply turn it off.  I suppose the fact that I'm actually watching less is a start and I was doing very well in June/July, when I was getting caught up on a gazillion DVDs and movies and really enjoying NOT watching TV.Argh!"},
{"title": "There's still room for improvement", "date": "Friday 29 August 2008", "text": "I managed to have 5 days no driving (although I drove another vehicle during that time) as I was doing some traveling to the communities over a two week period. While I did spend during the travel, I will get it back as expenses (and because of the way the Yukon Government works, Iâm going to get back MORE than I actually spentâ¦and I donât even need receipts! What a great dealâ¦).I have two bank accounts that I actually use, so it gives me the opportunity to âdouble dipâ on occasion, depending on when pay days fall. The idea is that some bills come out of one account and some â usually rent â out of the other. And for the most part, thatâs what happens. Or at least has been happening since Iâve been more focused on everything.My spending looks like this:Bank 1:Tim Hortonâs: $5.76 (x3 visits @ $1.92 ea for tea, down from daily visits!)Tim Hortonâs: $3.84 (tea for me & a friend)Gas: $55.12Food: $22.76Bank 2:Dinner, Dawson City: $22.00 (reimbursed)Lunch for drive home: $11.76 (a FANTASTIC sandwich, water and an apple; reimbursed)Cinnamon buns: $17.00 (literally dinner plate sized, x2)Chocolate & milk: $9.73Groceries: $19.40Oil change: $15.62Plastic sheeting for windows: $16.78Superstore: $1.46New clutch: $787.07Dinner, Watson Lake: $26.75 (reimbursed)Breakfast, Watson Lake: $14.58 (reimbursed)Vet: $315.99Dinner: $70.00Total: $1415.62Hardly what could be called a thrifty month! :-P However, itâs not all as bad as it looks, despite some big numbers in there. The funds for both my cat and the clutch came out of separate accounts which Iâve set up specifically for such situations. Iâve needed a new clutch for some time now and my cat, Bylaw, was suddenly unwell, and actually needs to go back in two weeksâ time for dental surgery. When the vet gave me the estimate of how much that was going to cost me, Iâm glad I was sitting down: $800 - $1000!Still, thatâs exactly the reason Iâve set up these accounts and spent so much time building them up. The cap was $1000 on each (at this point) and while these expenses mean that the accounts are now essentially empty, at least I HAVE them and there was no panic about where the money was coming from. And Iâm hoping that if I keep saving through October at the rate I am, I will have enough money in the car account to pay my insurance for the whole year.Iâm expecting reimbursements for my travel, however, which helps the rather high monthly total seem not quite so outrageous. That works out to approximately $375.00 which will be split between debt repayment and account replenishment. I also rolled (most of) my coins and emptied my âcash jarâ to come up with an extra $268 which will also be split between debt and savings.So, the monthly expenditures are reduced as follows:1415.62- 643.00772.62Wow! Almost half. That makes me feel way better actually because Tim Hortonâs really isnât a need and, well, neither are the cinnamon buns to be honest. But I have the buns maybe two or three times a year and they last over a week! And I donât go to Timâs every day anymore, either. Iâve slashed it from 6 days a week to about 3, so thereâs still room for improvement, but Iâd say itâs a definite start. :-)"},
{"title": "Options", "date": "Tuesday 19 August 2008", "text": "Two days work at the hotel this week, and another shift slated for Saturday afternoon for a few hours, so while I'm not really excited about it (mainly because I don't like the evening shifts) it will obviously help to pad my paycheque at the end of the month, allowing me a little more \"play\" with my funds.I redid the budget for my jars yesterday and have shaved off over $100 a week, which gives me $500 per month for \"everything\" instead of $960 (I'm single.  What on earth do I need almost $1000 a month for over and above my fixed amounts?).  My charity jar took a pretty big hit, down to $20 a week from $45, but only because I already give part of my time to the Humane Society and right now, I can't afford to give as much money as I originally wanted to.  I've also halved both my clothing amount and my \"other\" amounts mainly because I don't really buy clothes all that often and my \"other\" is generally for cat food, which is bought only twice a month.I feel good about that, and also the fact that I went to get a new shirt today because I \"need\" one and ended up not buying anything because I just wasn't motivated to look for anything and didn't want to \"break in\" my new Visa card.  That would have just been stupid, seeing how far I've come in such a short period of time.  And quite honestly I'm sick of shopping at the same place all the time (honestly, my choices are Reitmans, Wal-Mart (evil) and Mark's Workwearhouse, so...), so I might just wait until I go south in October and I have far more choice.One thing I'm anticipating later this year is a move closer to town.  Anticipating, but trying not to focus too hard in case it doesn't happen.  A co-worker is doing some work on her basement suite and I asked if she would keep me in mind when it's available.  Yesterday I asked what she thought she would be charging for rent and nearly fell over when she told me: no more than $550.  For everything! And she's not even sure it'll be \"that high.\"My fingers are tightly crossed because it's in a part of town that will allow me to walk to work, and not rely on my truck so much, which is what I want.  It will also allow me to set aside a relatively large chunk to put towards a down payment on a house, and still have loads left over for emergency fund, RSP, savings, etc.  There's someone else who's interested, but I figure if I keep asking how things are going, perhaps offer to help where I can, that might help, but I'm also firmly of the mind that if it's meant to happen it will.  Think positively, think about it, but don't obsess."},

I took her in to have the brakes looked at because they're squealing badly.  It appears that they're just fine - dirt or dust is the cause of the noise - which is good news and which is what I thought, as was the fact there was no charge for the check (but as they're still noisy, did they clean them?).  I'm a little torn about getting the work done, as the truck is essentially worthless as a resale, however, I need a clutch.  The part that floors me most is the fact that the parts come to a total of $287.  It's the LABOUR that bumps the price up so much: almost $500 for approximately 4.5 hours.I'm in the wrong job apparently!My spending today is as follows (not as much as I figured):Oil change - $15.62Plastic sheeting for windows - $19.88Water/Coke - $11.77File folder & correction tape - $17.93Book (Xmas present) - $3.31Total: $68.51Then I have to take some time over the next week to get my bills organized, the file system labelled and everything into its slot.

I actually way overspent (not unusual) today, but because I printed off some recipes at work last night and shopped accordingly, I can make the food last at least two weeks.I had to go to THREE different grocery stores to find everything I needed; apparently the trucks didn't arrive yesterday and there wasn't much produce to pick from:Produce$2.38  2 lemons (@ $1.19 ea)$1.58  2 lemons (@ $0.79 ea)$1.18  2 limes (@ $0.59 ea)$1.42  ONE orange$3.29  1 bag new red potatoes$2.99  1 bag new red potatoes$4.94  1 bag Gala apples (@ $4.17 kg)$1.70  2 bunches gr onion (@ .85 ea)$2.88  strawberries$3.78  2 avocadoes (@ $1.89 ea)$2.55  2 green peppers (@ $5.49 kg)$0.36  4 bananas (@ $0.44 kg - maybe I could live only on bananas...)$0.42  3 pieces ginger root (...or ginger...)$1.98  1 pkg basil$2.19  1 cucumberBakery$3.98  2 loaves breadMeats$4.80  ground beef$3.04  maple ham, sliced$6.66  pepper steak (2 in pkg = 2 meals)$4.69  round steak$4.47  round steak$5.99  turkey sausagesGrocery$10.49  1 case bottled water (35 bottles, incl. recycling fee/deposit)$2.99  vanilla parfait$2.99  muffin mix$3.69  ground round (ground chicken soy)$4.18  2kg frozen peas$4.18  2kg frozen corn$3.68  ground nutmeg$2.79  fusilli pasta$2.79  farfalle pasta$0.78  white vinegar$2.89  basil pesto$1.47  Coke$3.69  balsamic vinegar$5.59  organic pasta sauce$4.69  korma sauce$2.99  lemon & herb seasoning$5.31  3 tins tuna (@ $1.77 ea)$4.98  2 ltr organic milk$6.68  2 bottles juice$3.28  1 bottle Worcestershire sauceOther$5.84  8 tins cat food (@ $0.73 ea)$15.21 bakewareTotal: $162.86/3 (wks) = $54.29 p/wkSo, taking a look at everything on my purchase list, all I'll need to buy next week is some fresh produce and probably some more milk.  There's definitely room for improvement (e.g. losing the Coke and the vanilla parfait), but it's far better than I used to do.Dinner tonight: grilled pepper steak, potatoes and steamed veggiesAdmittedly, the baking tray was not a necessity, but I've already used it.  It's a mini-loaf pan and I put it to use as soon as I got home.  I currently have a cookie sheet as bakeware, so this addition will get a lot of use.I'm going to take a page from Frugal Trenches blog and do a \"shop\" at home next time I go grocery shopping so that I'm only picking up absolute necessities.  I CAN cut my budget, by quite a lot each time, as long as I'm careful, diligent and stick to my lists."},
{"title": "Personal Assets", "date": "Friday 8 August 2008", "text": "I'm trying to think of what I own that could be considered an \"asset\".  Looking around, I see:A new bike (ridden exactly once)My laptop300+ books (most of which are finally off the floor)Three catsA new digital camera, andA truck older than the man I'm dating.So.  I'm not sure that anything on that list could be an \"asset.\"  At least, not in the financial sense.  Not in the \"important\" sense...Granted the new bike was, in retrospect, an impulse buy.  I was really yearning to get back out and do some riding (I used to ride everywhere in Victoria when I first moved there), get fit, use the car less, etc.  I went into the store to look and came out having put a deposit on a shiny new bike.  I took it out for a spin and ended up spraining my knee! I haven't been on it since.  The giant hills and the Alaska Highway that I would be riding every day are also a deterrent.Regardless, I don't totally regret the purchase.  We've had a pretty miserable summer all around and the only people out on bikes consistently are the hard-core riders.  Like the ones who ride even during the winter.  In -40.  I.E.  NOT me.My laptop is my \"window to the world\".  I keep in touch with my friends on it, I write on it, I play games on it, I watch movies on it...It's really my lifeline and I'm always on it.  I'm trying to do more on it because I'm still tied to my cable and can't quite cut the cord.  But I'm paying $60 a month to watch one channel and I'm finding it harder and harder to justify it.  I think I need to implement the \"bandaid\" solution.  Just do it.My books.  I'd read more of these if I didn't have cable.  I'd probably also use my \"Learn Italian\" and \"Learn French\" books if I didn't have cable.  There's so much I want to do, but don't because it's easier to turn on the television to entertain me than make the effort to entertain myself.My cats Elmo, Dinah and Bylaw.  My babies.  I love them to pieces.  They make me happy, keep me company and are worth every cent I spend on them.  There is no monetary value on unconditional love.My digital camera.  This was a purchase I actually did think about.  My family came into a small inheritance from a great-aunt in the UK whom we'd never actually met.  We each got about $2K.  Not a huge sum, but a welcome gift at Christmas time.  I debated about what I wanted to do with this.  I have student loans.  I had a credit card balance, a stupid loan (one of those loans you get to get yourself out of debt and then end up further in), and an overdraft that all needed feeding.However, instead of paying down my debt, I decided that I would buy myself \"something nice.\"  Along with that, I would set up two accounts that I considered important: a vet account and a travel account (a flight from Whitehorse to Vancouver costs about $600).  I decided on the camera because I have always had one; I love to take pictures and it would be with me for years, as a reminder of this great-aunt who had gifted me this money.  I knew myself well enough at the time that had I put it all onto my credit card, I may as well have just set a match to it.Instead, I have this fabulous camera that lets me be creative and playful and see the world in a totally different way.  I have far too many pictures of the cats, but I use it for \"business\" as well, as I'm a board member for the Humane Society here in Whitehorse and we have fundraising events that I like to record.  I've elected myself the Official Photographer.I did also set up the two accounts I mentioned above with starting amounts of $250 each.  It was a good plan, as I've done far better with them than I imagined I would, but the peace of mind it gives me is worth 10 times that.  Since then I've started one for a house, my car, an emergency fund and will now have to designate one for my new canal boat goal.  Little bits at a time; some are needed later, some sooner, so the amount of money that goes into each one can vary a little, depending on what I feel needs a bit of a boost.Last, my truck.  A 27 year old Toyota.  Small.  The heater may not work anymore (I'll find out this winter).  Runs reasonably well, but I think this will be my last winter with her.  She's not as reliable or as safe as I need up here, but I'm unwilling to part with her just yet.  A vehicle really is a necessity up here as the distances are so huge and the bus \"service\" really isn't.All those are just a part of what I consider \"assets\" - there's also the fact that I live in a place where the air is pristine and clear - you feel good breathing it in -, the light is breathtaking all year round, the pace of life is a little slower, I have good friends and I feel more peace and contentment than I've ever felt.  That's what makes some assets more valuable than the market or a bank or the media can assign to them."},
{"title": "Life in a Northern Town", "date": "Thursday 7 August 2008", "text": "Also the name of a pretty good 80's tune, an actual Northern Living Allowance is a tax break granted by the Canadian Government to anyone and everyone who lives north of Grand Prairie, Alberta (55 degrees N Latitude).I've been reading Gail's blog for a few months now, and from there have found plenty more fantastic personal finance blogs like this one, this one, and this one.  There's an entire community out there minding their personal finances, getting out of debt, saving money, reaching their goals and so much inspiration to be had on a daily.  I'm hoping that writing down my goals and savings achievements and putting them \"out there\" will make me more focused, realistic and accountable for my spending.I'm a 41 yr old single female living in an exceptionally beautiful part of Canada.  It's not cheap, however, but even here there are ways to save money.  If people can live frugally in London, after all, I can certainly find ways to do it here! I work two jobs: one day a week at a hotel, and a \"day\" job in a library.  While the library job is very well paid, it's not permanent, so I am also on a journey to search for a job I get to keep.One of the better financial decisions I've made in the last several weeks is enlisting the help of a financial advisor/planner and have just given her an initial $1000 to put into an RSP.  I've also spoken with my bank about various savings options that they offer and will be looking at another RSP with them, only in mutual fund form.But to start, my goals are as follows:A new(er) car (fall 2009)A house (2012)Retirement savings plan (ongoing)Trip to South Africa to help my brother & sister-in-law build their new house (2 years)Canal boat in England (5 years)I've also set up several accounts I use for the vet, travel, my car insurance/maintenance and which fluctuate according to need.  I've decided recently to bump up the vet account from $1000 to $2500, as I think that's a more realistic amount (I have three cats and want accessible funds should something happen).I know I need to set up a more focused monthly budget, set some goals (definitely some \"no spend days\" as Frugal Trenches does), and stick with my cash jars system that Gail advocates.  It's a terrific idea and it really, honestly WORKS if you're focused and determined.  And all this sort of stuff only works if you shift your thinking about why you spend, how you spend, where you spend, etc.  You have to really look at the reasons behind it: are you bored? Depressed? Angry? Like a raven, do you like shiny things?I'm looking forward to this."}
