Mung Bean Biscuits could be addictive and does not yield much for the portion  as the cookies are compact.  All the recipes are workable.

Just remember to press hard otherwise the dough will break away.  But, my opinion is, it is worth all the trouble.  These are really good biscuits to snack with a hot brew of Chinese tea.Mung Bean Biscuits aka 'Lek Tau Ko' in Chinese Hokkien dialectThese biscuits melts in the mouth but the nibbed almonds are crunchy.  Lovely biscuits.  In future, I would try with split green beans to make these biscuits.  The biscuits will be pale, yellow golden colour.Recipe adapted from No Frills Recipes with some modificationsIngredients[makes 80 pieces]300 gm green beans - to be fried and mill grind to get mung bean flour*30 gm rice flour 60 gm plain flour 120 gm icing sugar 100 gm nibbed almonds 130 gm shortening Add a bit of cooking oil if dough is too dry * if store bought mung bean flour is unavailableRinse mung beans several times under running tap water, then drain in a colander.Heat a wok to stir-fry beans in dry pan over medium heat until the water dries up.  It takes about 4 minutes until the water has dried up.  Lower heat to medium-low and continue to cook for another 6-7 minutes until fragrant.  Stirring constantly.   Set aside to cool completely.When cooled, grind the fried beans in a dry mill grinder, in batches.  Sift the grinded mung beans to obtain the flour.  Repeat grinding and sifting the coarse  leftovers until it yields about 270 gm mung bean flour.  Discard the coarse leftovers.  [Can prepare this earlier before baking day].

This Pandan Kaya is much easier to make compared to Caramel Kaya where you would need to caramelise the sugar to a perfect tone so that the Kaya colour would turn out nice. This Pandan Kaya is very aromatic as the pandan juice blends very well with coconut milk and eggs.  I used the stirring over direct heat method instead of double boiling.  *This method is quite fast except that you need to keep stirring the mixture  while cooking to get a nice texture and to prevent it from getting lumpy or burnt at the base.*Overall, I am happy with the result as the 'kaya' is smooth, perfect consistency and nice colour.  It is worth the effort to prepare homemade kaya.  By the way, this recipe uses duck eggs.  It is alright to use chicken eggs but advisable to use large eggs.Ingredients[makes 3 tubs x 200 gm]4 duck eggs - lightly beaten to combine egg yolk with egg white250 ml thick coconut milk250 gm sugar10 blades of screwpine [pandan] leaves - washed and blended with 3 tbsp waterBlend pandan leaves with water.  Squeezed out the juice, set aside.In a big bowl, add in pandan juice, sugar and 50 ml coconut milk.  Stir to dissolve the sugar.  Gradually add more coconut milk as the sugar dissolves.Pour in lightly beaten eggs [do not beat eggs until frothy], mix with well.Strain mixture into a heavy based pan [I used Thai 'golden' wok].  Bring mixture to cook over  medium low heat, stirring constantly* until the mixture is of a runny thick consistency [leaves a trail mark as you stir].  This takes about 20-25 minutes.Remove from heat, cool before storing in airtight containers.Serve with bread, pancakes or some Nyonya Kuihs."},

Taste wise, not too overwhelming but if you wish to savour it right away you would probably need to increase the dressing ingredients a bit more.  If you wish to rest  or chill it until later, the taste is perfect when the flavour is absorbed  by the eggplant.  When steamed to the required tenderness, it is of soft texture.  The natural sweetness of the eggplant blends well with the savoury dressing.I believe this salad would be great to serve with some fried chicken, pork and boiled/mashed potatoes.Ingredients300 gm eggplant - washed, cut into long sections and halvedsome shredded red carrotsome shredded red chillisome toasted sesame seeds some toasted ground peanutsDressing1-2 stalks spring onions - chopped3-4 cloves garlic - chopped1/2 tbsp chilli flakes or chilli sauce1-2 tbsp sweet savoury light soy sauce2 tsp fish sauce2 tsp sesame seed oilSoak cut eggplant in water with some salt or vinegar.Bring water to boil in a steamer.  Drain and place eggplant in a steaming plate. Steam eggplant for 7-10 minutes over high heat or until tender.  Test to check if eggplant is tender with a chopstick.  If it pokes through easily, then the eggplant is cooked.Remove and leave to cool before pulling them apart into shreds.  Meanwhile, mix dressing ingredients in a big bowl.  Add carrots and chillies.  Mix well.  Taste to adjust seasoning.Add eggplant and toss to mix well.  Top with sesame seeds and ground peanuts [if using].  Serve immediately or chill to serve later."},

It's a thick, smooth golden-colored syrup made from cane sugar that has a unique buttery scent and a light caramel flavor and less sweet. Golden Syrup for mooncakes is a type of inverted sugar that has a beautiful amber color, a rich and fruity aroma, and a very creamy texture.You can make your own golden syrup by using the following recipe.  For use in making mooncakes, it is advisable to prepare the syrup earlier at least 2-3 weeks in advance.

You can make more in one go that can last you for years.  It could be the unique magic of this golden syrup that makes the mooncakes smells so fragrant and also contributes to the nice colour of the mooncakes.Ingredients[makes about 1 kg syrup]1 kg sugar750 ml water1 lime - sliced into 4 slices - seeds removedPlace sugar is a heavy based saucepan [about 18 cm width].  Pour in water, stir to combine.  Add in the lime pieces.Bring to boil over high heat and stir occasionally.  Boil for 10  minutes.Reduce to medium low and leave to boil for an hour or more until the colour turns golden brown and of runny thick consistency.Off heat, leave to cool before storing in glass jars or containers.  Remove the limes slices.Store at room temperature in a cool place.  Keeps well for years if of well."},

Scoop some rice into the cone [I used about 1 tablespoon], place 1 piece pork belly, chestnuts, salted egg yolk and mushroom.  Cover with about 1 - 1 1/2 tbsp rice [depending on the size of chang you wish to make]. Press the rice firm, cover it with the extended ends of bamboo leaves and form into a pyramid [chang] shape.  Tie and secure it with the hemp string.Finish doing the same for the rest of ingredients.  Trim the edges of the bamboo leaves and excess strings. Place the changs in a big pot.  Pour water  enough to cover them.  Bring to boil and cook for about 3 1/2 hours or until the rice dumplings are cooked.  Add more boiling water should the to water is reduced below the changs.Remove from water and hang dumplings to dry before storing them or serve warm.Notes: Some benefits of Embryo Rice - contains selenium said to prevent cataract, helps to remove body toxin and absorption of nutrients"},

When applying egg wash for the first tray, pop the second tray into oven. When the second tray is done for the first round of baking, return first tray to oven after egg wash is done.I made my own castor sugar by blending fine sugar in a blender.I try Singlong brand of pineapple paste this year. It is sweet and sour type and fibrous which I like. I do not need to add any lemon juice to adjust the sweetness. Instead, I rub in little unsalted butter. This is another “secret ingredient” to make store-bought pineapple paste taste better.The baking temperature and time will also affect the texture.

The ones which we particularly remembered and liked are the Lechon, Pork Braten and Chicken Adobo.  Of course, we loved the simple fresh salads and boiled potatoes prepared by brother Heinz which go so well with the meat dishes. We were never tired of the Chinese steamboat dinners [at home or at the restaurants] which we enjoyed whenever we met either in Switzerland, Philippines or Malaysia.Back to this Chicken Adobo, it is quite similar to the Chinese braised soy sauce chicken but with the addition of vinegar, bay leaves and black peppercorns.  In fact, there are quite a number of Filipino dishes which taste sourish.  Either vinegar or lemon/lime juices are use in the preparation.  There are some meat dishes with Chinese influence too like their pig trotter stew which they also called 'hong bak'.  This recipe is very basic Chicken Adobo recipe which I modified slightly. It tastes savoury, sourish and has the flavour and aroma of black pepper.   It's awesome.I am sharing this post today in memory of dear Heinz who passed away  suddenly this day 2016.  Sadly missed and forever remembered by all of us.  Ingredients3-4 chicken thighs - cut into 2 piecesseveral pieces of dried bay leaves4 tbsp light soy sauce2-3 tbsp Apple Cider vinegar4-5 cloves garlic - skinned and crushed3 tsp sugar1 tsp ground black pepper1 tsp whole black peppercorns1/4 tsp salt to taste1 cup or more water1/2 tbsp oil [can omit if using non-stick pan]Marinate chicken pieces with all the ingredients except whole black peppercorns, salt and water for 1-2 hours or overnight.Heat up a non stick pan, put in the marinated chicken [skin side first] to cook until nicely browned.  Flip over.Pour in the marinating sauce and add in the whole black peppercorns and water.Bring to boil, cover then simmer for about 20-30 minutes over low medium heat until chicken is tender.Uncover and continue to cook until the sauce is reduced and thick.Dish up to serve with rice."},

I have this book for umpteen years but has never tried this recipe until now when I make Bee Koh as a offering item for praying to Jade Emperor God [9th day of Chinese New Year - Pai Thni Kong]. My family is Hokkien, so this day is also the Chinese Hokkien’s New Year where Taoists will perform prayers to the Jade Emperor God [Thni Kong] on his birthday.  In the past, my mother and mother in-law will prepare Bee Koh for this occasion but this is already several years ago.  These 2 great ladies are getting old [in their 80s] and not so energetic doing the usual chores that they used to do years ago.   So it is my turn to prepare it but I'm quite skeptical if mine would be like theirs, so I have to rely on recipes from my collection of recipe books. Anyway, I am happy that all the recipes are workable but in my opinion, I prefer this one cos’ the rice is softer, the texture is chewy, sweetness is just nice, very aromatic and I like the shiny look of it.  We finished this kuih very soon with spoonfuls of it instead of slicing cos' it is chewy and soft.As praying item - traditionally  the kuih needs to be decorated with red dates and dried longans.  Isn't these cute?Recipe source from At Home With Amy BehIngredients425 gm glutinous rice – washed then soaked for 4 hours or overnight, drained3 pandan leaves – washed and knotted100 ml water250-300 gm granulated sugar225 ml thick coconut milk [from 1 ½ grated coconut]1 tsp salt2 pandan leaves – washed and knotted½ tsp fennel [jintan manis] – I omitSteam the soaked and drained glutinous rice over boiling water with pandan leaves for 10 minutes.

The best result is seeing that the design stays after baking.  The mooncakes are soft after airing for several days.To me this is a good recipe for doll mooncakes as the dough is soft and moist, easy to handle and the design stays. The recipe here is triple the portion of Mimi’s and this portion yields 20 pieces with gold fish design and 18 pieces with the pineapple design.Recipe adapted from MiMi Bakery House [method slightly modified]Ingredients390 gm golden syrup90 ml canola oil2 ¼ tsp alkaline water570 gm plain flour – sifted together with cinnamon powder2 ¼ tsp cinnamon powderAny doll mooncake molds of your choiceCombine golden syrup, canola oil and alkaline water in a mixing bowl.  Mix  until the ingredients blends well.  Set aside for 3 hours [I left mine overnight].Add sifted flour to syrup mixture lightly until well combined [do not knead the dough].  Leave for several hours [I left mine overnight].Divide dough into small portions according to the size of the mold used.  Roll into round shape and dust lightly with flour.  Press it into mooncake mold.  Tap to dislodge dough from the mold.  Arrange on baking tray lined with parchment paper.Bake in preheated oven at 180 degrees C [middle shelf] for 15-20 minutes [this is without glazing with beaten egg].  ORBake in preheated oven at 180 degrees C for 10 minutes. Remove to cool for 15 minutes, apply egg wash on top and sides.  Continue to bake at 175 degrees C for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.Remove to cool on wire rack then store in container to air them for 1-2 days.  The mooncakes will be soft after airing."},

You can omit the fried egg crisps and it is a vegetarian dish.Read further and you may like to add this vegetable to your diet.Benefits of Chinese Cabbage / Bok Choy for Health1. Chinese cabbage is one of the most effective natural remedies for cancer. Being a cruciferous vegetable, it contains a fair amount of glucosinolates – an organic compound that fights against cancer. Brassinin, which is basically a phytoalexin and has excellent cancer-preventing properties, is also present in this plant. Apart from these two vital elements, Chinese cabbage is also loaded with the anti-oxidant beta-carotene. Studies have proved that it can reduce the chances of developing cancer along with healing the damages caused in our body by cancer cells.2. Dietary fiber is essential for proper digestion of food and Chinese cabbage contains a lot of that. When you eat this veggi, you consume enough of this nutrient and develop bulk inside your digestive tract. It eventually accelerates your digestion by removing unnecessary materials from our body.3. Including Chinese cabbage in your diet can be extremely beneficial for your heart. It is because the vegetable is full of two most important minerals – calcium and potassium, which can regulate the blood pressure levels efficiently. The amount of sodium present in it is also quite low, which is good for maintaining the health of the cardiac system.Want to know how Chinese cabbage nutrition benefits can make you healthy and beautiful?

It can be cooked in many ways, grilled, breaded, deep-fried/pan-fried, roasted, baked and boiled, etc.Chicken is also a good source of niacin [vitamin B3] - which aids in metabolism; vitamin B6 - important to immune system and blood sugar level maintenance; biotin [vitamin B7] - which helps cell growth; and vitamin B12 - which is involved in nerve cell and red blood cell maintenance. It also contains iron [oxygen transport and cell growth] and zinc [immune system functioning and DNA synthesis].Having shared this much of information about chicken meat, this is one of the many easy chicken dishes which I prepared with honey sauce.Joyce has shared some nutritional facts about honey which is high in antioxidants, improve digestion and good for the skin etc.  Looks like this is a nutritious and healthy dish which we can prepare for our family. The chicken pieces can be deep fried or pan fried.  If you prefer crispy fried chicken pieces then you can cooked it using deep frying method.  I prefer pan-fried in a non-stick pan/wok as no oil or not much oil is needed to cook them.Fragrant fried chicken in tasty sweet sauce.  It is appetising enough to go with rice and definitely suitable for the young and teenagers in the family.  Of course, the elders can once in awhile indulge in it, too.Ingredients[serves 2-3]2-3 deboned chicken whole legs with skin1 big onion - coarsely chopped1 red chill or 2 chilli padi - chopped1 tbsp toasted sesame seedsGarnishing - some chopped spring onionsMarinade for Chicken1/2 tsp of salt and sesame seed oil1 egg white2 tbsp cornflour [can omit if chicken is with skin on]Sauce Ingredients [combined]3 tbsp plum sauce2 tbsp honey1/2 tbsp sugar1 tsp sesame seed oilChop chicken into bite size pieces or keep whole.  Marinate with seasoning for several hours.Heat up wok with enough oil for deep frying in medium hot oil until lightly golden and cooked or heat up a non-stick wok without oil, pan fry chicken whole legs [skin side first] until oil oozes out and skin is golden brown. Turn over to fry the meat side until cooked and brown.  Dish up.Using the same wok [remove excess oil], saute onions and chillies until fragrant.  Pour in the combined sauce, bring to boil until bubbly.  Return the fried chicken to the wok, mix well with the sauce.Dish up and sprinkle sesame seeds and spring onions as garnishing.  Serve hot.I'm submitting this post to the event Little Thumbs Up [March 2015 Event: Honey] organized by Zoe [Bake for Happy Kids] and Doreen [My Little Favourite DIY] and hosted by Joyce [joycescapade.com]"},

It really is an energy saver kitchen gadget.  How soon the food is ready depends on what you are cooking.  For chicken, it takes about 2 hours.There are 2 separate stainless steel pots.  I used the small one to cook rice and the big one to cook this chicken.  Safe time and energy. The chicken pieces and arrowroot wedges are just tender and has a bite.  The sauce is thick and very tasty.  It is so delicious with rice.By the way, I used this cooker to cook Nyonya Curry Chicken, the curry was awesome.  I just need to fry the ingredients until aromatic, bring to boil and leave the remaining cooking process in the outer pot.  All the frying and boiling only requires about 15 minutes.Thanks to my BIL, I'll cook something good for him next time when he comes back.  I think he knows that I'll appreciate this or is it that he enjoyed my cooking very much, hehehe! Ingredients[serves 3]2 chicken whole legs – cut bit size pieces4-5 arrowroot [ciku] – peeled and halved1-2 stalks spring onions – cut into 2” lengths5-6 pips garlic – peeled and keep wholeA few slices of gingerSeasoning2 tbsp each of light soy sauce, oyster sauce and black vinegar1 tsp each of sugar and pepperMarinate chicken pieces with some light soy sauce, 5 spice powder, sugar and potato starch.If Using a Thermal Cooker - Heat cooker pot, add in some cooking oil, fry chicken pieces and arrowroot  until brown.

When my hubby saw this dish, he asked why I did not prepare this at his mother’s place.   This year like in the past, we spent 6 days at my MIL’s place, preparing for CNY there. Even though we live in the same state, I never have the chance to spend CNY eve or CNY at my own house cos’ I have to do all the cooking for days at my MIL’s place.  There isn’t time for me to be back home cos’ there is no other women folk in her house to help. My MIL does all the shopping/marketing, while I do all the food preparation and cooking with whatever she bought for many meals.  So my response to my hubby's query is ‘The main ingredient [streaky pork belly] isn’t available at your mum’s place'.At times, it is rather impossible to cook what you wish to if the shopping/marketing is done by another especially when you can’t even plan a menu.  I just need to wait for instructions from my MIL what she wants  me to  prepare and sometimes the ingredients needed aren’t sufficient too.  So you need to improvise and make use of what you have in hand and also to avoid wastage.  I never like to waste food ingredients.You may be wondering why I didn’t do the marketing since I’m doing the cooking.  This is not allowed, she loves to buy.  If both of us does the marketing,  then there will be excess and wastage in the end.Back to this dish, it is very easy to cook yet it is so presentable, tasty and delicious.  The sauce is sour, savoury and spicy while the fried pork is crispy, tasty and aromatic.  Both blends very well.  You may increase the sauce portion if you prefer more sauce.Ingredients300 gm streaky pork belly – cut into 3 inch length piecesSome salad leavesSome sliced tomatoesSome toasted sesame seedsSauce [combined]1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tbsp Apple cider vinegar1-2 tbsp chilli sauce [more if you like it spicy]Marinate streaky pork belly with some light soy sauce, wine and mirin [can replace with some vinegar and sugar].Heat a non-stick wok without oil, fry pork belly pieces [in single layer] until oil oozes out and crispy on both sides.Line serving platter with salad leaves and tomatoes [ you can add canned peaches and blanched broccoli florets].Place fried crispy pork slices on top of salad, drizzle sauce over meat and sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds.Serve immediately."},

The rice has to be steamed first and moreover the some rice has to be coloured.  Anyway, I took the time to slowly run through the ingredients and the steps.  Looks easy so long as I can prepare the fillings earlier and the wrapping probably the next day.So these are the ‘fruits’ of my 'labour'…..They not only looks nice but tasted good.  I'm very happy with the result.  My sis gave a thumbs up after trying one. The rice is soft, chewy and taste good with the aromatic savoury sweet filling.  Making them small looks dainty but you can always increase the rice portion to make bigger dumplings and also to finish off the fillings.   My hubby says it is not necessary cos’ it is eaten as a snack rather than for a meal.  Perhaps, next time, I will double the rice portion so that there won’t be leftover filling and more rice to cover the filling.   I had leftovers - used up in the next post].Recipe Source for my selected Cookbook for February 2016 – Nyonya Flavours [modified]Ingredients[makes 20]40 dried bamboo leaves – soaked until soft and wiped dryHemp strings2-3 blades of pandan leaves – washed and cut into 3 cm lengthsIngredients for Filling300 gm pork belly – skin removed and chopped coarsely150 gm candied winter melon [tungkwa] – chopped100 gm ground roasted peanuts1 tbsp peppercorns50 gm [8 cloves] garlic20 gm [3] cekur ginger roots4 tsp coriander powder2 tsp salt to taste2 tbsp sugar to taste2 tbsp cooking oilBlend peppercorns, garlic and cekur roots in a processor until fine and mix in the coriander powder.Heat oil in a non-stick pan, sauté ground spice ingredients until aromatic.

Bake until cookies are crispy and golden brown.Cool baked cookies on a wire rack and store in airtight container. *Alternatively, use roughly chopped roasted salted peanuts or cashew nuts instead of walnuts.This post is linked to Cook and Celebrate: Chinese New Year 2016 hosted by Yen from GoodyFoodies, Diana from The Domestic Goddess Wannabeand Zoe from Bake for Happy Kids"},

Whenever he goes visiting her, he must bring her something to eat, that prompted me to make more paus over the weekend.  One of them, is this vegetable pork paus.The filling is very easy and quick to prepare with just 2 main ingredients [cabbage and pork], no pre-cooking is needed.This pau skin dough is a good one -  pliable and easy to handle.  I advise not to reduce the sugar as the pau skin should be a little sweet to taste good with the savoury filling.  Looking at the pleated paus tells that the dough is good.   I could even pleat it into a leaf shaped pau.  After steaming, it is soft, moist, fluffy and  remains soft even on the next day.  But I always prefer steaming hot paus, it is more aromatic.Recipe adapted from Coco Kong’s book on ‘Paus’ [slightly modified]Ingredients For Filling150 gm minced pork  [with some fats should be good]150 gm cabbage – chopped, marinated with ½ tsp salt and squeezed out excess water1 tbsp fresh ginger juices [I used grated ginger]1 tbsp spring onion juices Seasoning1 tbsp light soy sauce,  1 tsp sugar,  ½ tsp each of msg and dark soy sauceFor Filling – Mix and knead ingredients for filling with seasoning until it has a springy texture.

The kuih skin is soft and chewy [QQ] and the filling is good as the sweetness is just nice for me. My mum and brother in-law ate it and said it is nice.I have made my AKK in 2 designs,  that is the usual tortoise design and peach design. Recently,  I had ‘acquired’ the peach design mold from my MIL’s kitchen and put it to use here.  I like the design and moulding the AKK is not difficult at all.

I followed the meat filling recipe but used my usual  ‘Sure-Can’ pau skin recipe cos’ I wanted  a bigger quantity.For the filling, the meat is cooked with red rice wine yeast [ang chow], thus is the name of this pau ‘Fookchow Red Rice Wine Yeast Paus’.   The filling is quite like Char Siew with red rice wine yeast flavor, more of a savoury taste than the sweetness of char siew.  It has the fragrance of rice wine.Overall, it is quite unusual but good.  The pau skin is perfect – soft, light and fluffy.   If you are one that loves meat paus but afraid of the sweetness of char siew filling, then you can give this one a try.I made a total of 16 medium size paus.

{"title": "NYONYA TAU EU BAK [PORK BELLY IN DARK SOY SAUCE]", "date": "Friday, November 13, 2015", "text": "Tau Eu Bak [Braised Pork Belly With Eggs] is a common dish in my mum’s place.  She prepares this dish at least once a week using pork belly, firm beancurd and hard boiled eggs as the main ingredients together with soy sauce as seasoning.   Her Tau Eu Bak is good eventhough the seasoning is according to her own estimation, like using her finger tips to add in the sugar and pouring in the dark soy sauce and light soy sauce straight from the bottle without a measuring spoon.    Yet, it never fails.  This trick, we can never master.I came across this Nyonya [Peranakan] pork belly dish recipe shared by Pearly Kee in her book ‘A Nyonya Inheritance’.  This recipe is one of the  recipes which I have tried from her book.   Her way of cooking this dish is different from the other Nyonya recipe book ‘Nyonya Flavours’.  For a comparison please refer to this  Recipe.Anyway, this Tau Eu Bak turns out well, good and tasty, too. In my opinion, it is not difficult to  cook this popular Nyonya dish yet the result is awesome.   I have adjusted the seasoning a little such as reducing the amount of dark soy sauce and white pepper  to suit my own preference.  I have also omitted 1-2 steps because the pork belly was already tender after braising for about 45 minutes.   The original recipe stated about 1 and ½ hours or so for the meat to be tender.  For this recipe, you would not be able to see the whole garlic after cooking.Yummy-licious Nyonya dish, so good to serve with sambal belacan and steaming hot rice.   My advice is to cook this whole portion and store them in smaller portions if you can finish it in one go.  Recipe adapted from ‘A Nyonya Inheritance’ by Pearly Kee with slight modificationsIngredients[serves 5-6]600 gm pork belly with skin – cut chunky pieces1 bulb garlic – skin removed and keep whole3 pieces firm beancurd [taukwa] – quartered and fried until golden4 hard-boiled eggs [or more if preferred]2 cups [500 ml] waterMarinade [Mix together in a bowl]4 tbsp soy sauce2 tbsp dark soy sauce [I used 1 tbsp]3 tbsp sugar½ tsp salt1-2 tbsp white pepper powder [I used 1 tbsp]Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl and rest for 15 minutes for the sugar to dissolve.Place pork belly pieces, garlic and marinade in a pot and turn on high heat.Stir the ingredients to mix evenly.    It is important to control the heat to prevent the marinade from drying up too fast.   Reduce to medium heat and constantly stirring until the marinade is almost dry and oil begins to surface [about 10-15 minutes].   This will give the dish an amazing flavor.Add enough water [1 cup] to cover the ingredients.  Turn to medium high heat and cover to boil until the liquid is reduced [about 20 minutes].  Top up with more water and cover to cook for a further 20 minutes.Then add in the fried beancurd pieces and hard boiled eggs.  Stir to coat ingredients with the sauce.Cover and lower heat to simmer until gravy has reduced by half and has thickened.Serve warm with steaming hot rice.Pearly’s Tips – Proper heat control is very important for this dish.  The easiest is to cook it in a slow cooker for 2 hours with just enough water to cover the meat.I am submitting this post to Cook Your Books Event #28 [November 2015] hosted by Joyce of Kitchen Flavours"},

Quite similar to the earlier recipe [from Nyonya Flavours] which I used here. Cooking this dish isn't difficult if  the spice paste is prepared in advance and kept in the refrigerator until needed which was what I did.It is a good recipe to use if you like to try Nyonya style braised pork belly with potatoes.   I like this recipe.According to chef Pearly, a typical Hong Bak includes pork and potatoes with some other delicious variations such as duck with sweet potatoes or yam and chicken with potatoes.Recipe adapted from Pearly Kee’s book ‘A Nyonya Inheritance’ [slightly modified]IngredientsHong Bak Spice Paste10 gm sand ginger [sar keong or cekur]10 shallots [100 gm] shallots 3 cloves garlic1 tbsp preserved soy bean paste [tau cheong]3 tbsp coriander powder1 tsp white pepper powder1 tsp nutmeg powder [I omit]Other Ingredients600 gm pork belly cut into bite size pieces3-4 potatoes – peeled and cut into wedges [I used 2]4 tbsp oil1 tbsp sugar1 tsp salt1 tsp dark soy sauce600 – 750 ml waterBlend sand ginger, shallots,  garlic and tau cheong into a paste, then add in the powder ingredients to mix.Heat oil in a non-stick wok, sauté spice paste until aromatic over medium heat.

It is aromatic, spicy and tasty.   The prawns and petai are crunchy and well coated with the dry sambal.  The cooking method is also different from the earlier recipe . It is very straight forward [Step 2] where all the spice paste is fried together with oil and prawns, yet the sambal tasted good and the prawns aren't overcooked.

In a non-stick wok, without any heat, put in the oil, spice paste,  prawns and seasoning.  Stir well.   Turn on to high heat and keep stirring until the mixture becomes dry and aromatic [about 10 minutes].  Keep stirring to prevent the paste from being burnt. 3.       When the bubbles are smaller and the prawns turned white and firm, add in the stinky beans, lime juice or tamarind water.  Stir to mix well and cook for another  3 minutes.4.       Taste to adjust seasoning.  Dish up to serve.In Pearly’s book, she has shared some tips on the use of this recipe to prepare the sambal with other ingredients.Pearly’s Tips – This is a very versatile dish.  Instead of prawns you can use 10 hard boiled eggs or 20 hard boiled quail eggs or 600 gm squid.  Add in the eggs or squid at Step 4.  Squid always tastes better slightly undercooked.  When the tentacles start to curl, it is time to turn off the heat.Note - I have used this portion of sambal paste to cook with  3 different ingredients, prawns/petai, eggs and squid [ 1/3 portion].See Other Pearly Kee's Recipes belowNyonya Mixed Vegetable CurryNyonya Hong Bak [Stewed Pork]Nyonya Kari Kay [Curry Chicken]I am submitting this post to Cook Your Books Event#27 - October 2015 hosted by Joyce of Kitchen Flavours"},

{"title": "PUMPKIN ROSE FLOWER MANTOU", "date": "Friday, October 16, 2015", "text": "This is a lovely mantou recipe which I came across from this blog [Food 4 Tots].   The recipe yields about 10-12 pieces mantou.   I have doubled the portion to make the regular shape mantou and flower shape mantou.  All in all, it makes 10 of each.These mantous are soft, moist and light.  It is not too sweet. I can say this recipe is a keeper if you love mantou.Recipe adapted from Food 4 Tots  with slight modifications to the methodIngredients220 gm pumpkin puree from about 300 gm pumpkin100 gm castor sugar500 gm plain or pau flour2 tsp instant yeast2 tsp baking powder ¼ tsp salt30 ml corn oil [I used vegetable shortening]100 – 120 ml water [depends on how concentrated is the pumpkin puree]Steam pumpkin with skin for about 30 minutes or until soft.  Remove and scrap the flesh, mash, weigh to 220 gm and set aside.  Keep excess if any for other uses.Using an electric mixer, combine all the ingredients except water and oil in the mixing bowl.  Knead the ingredients into a rough dough adding the water gradually.  You may not need to use up all the water depending on how concentrated is the pumpkin puree.Knead until soft and add in the corn oil or shortening.  Continue to knead until soft, smooth and pliable [no longer sticky].Place the dough in a lightly floured bowl, cover and leave the dough to rest for 20 minutes in room temperature.Lightly dust the working surface with flour and punch down the dough to deflate.  Divide dough into 2 equal portions [about 480 gm each]. Shape into balls.How To Make Rose MantouTake one portion, divide dough into 15 gm each [30 portions]. Roll each piece into a flat circle of equal width. To form the rose, please see pictures below.Place rose buns on paper cases and rest for 30 minutes or until double in size in a steaming tray.Steam from cold water over medium high heat for 18-20 minutes. Off fire but leave buns in steamer for a further 2-3 minutes before uncovering and remove to cool on wire rack. This way, the mantou will not shrink after cooling down.How to Make the Regular Shape MantouTake the other portion and roll into a rectangle [about 14” x 7”].Brush a thin layer of water on the top surface, then roll up the dough like a Swiss roll  starting from the wider edge. Roll the elongated dough out until it reaches a length of 15 inches.  Cut the dough into 10 equal portions [about 1.5 inch].Place each portion on a piece of baking parchment paper or muffin liner and leave to proof for 30 minutes or until double in size.Starting from cold water over medium high heat, steam the mantou for 18-20 minutes (depending on the size of the mantou).Off heat and leave them for 3 minutes before removing them to cool. This way, the mantou will not shrink after cooling down.Notes from Food 4 Tots:You can steam the mantou using the stainless steel steamer but make sure to cover the lid with cloth to prevent water dripping onto mantou.Mantou is best to serve warm or hot. If consume the next day, store inside an air-tight container and keep in the fridge. The mantou can also be frozen for up to 3 months.

More so, I haven’t heard or tried  this soup at all even though my family cooks numerous Nyonya dishes.  Looking at the ingredients make me wonder how would the taste be like with preserved bean paste [tau cheong] in a soup.  Is it possible to drink a soup like that with yam [taro]?Anyway, with some yam leftover from cooking Yam Rice, I gave this soup a try by just cooking ½ the portion of this recipe which is enough for 3.  To my surprise, this is a lovely soup if you are a yam lover. The soup is thick cos’ of the soft yam which tasted good.  Hard for me to explain but my hubby says it is quite like Ark Or [Braised Duck with Yam] without the aroma of Dong Quai.   According to him, Ark Or has Dong Quai in the dish. The final verdict is that we love this soup very much and I would not mind cooking this soup again.  Perhaps, next time I will add several pieces of Dong Quai in it.  I didn’t add all the salt but my hubby says the soup has to be a little salty to bring out the sweetness of the yam.  He is right, the soup tasted much better with a little more salt added.   My hubby loves Ark Or but I don’t have an authentic recipe [still looking for one].  Anyone has the recipe, do let me know.  Thanks.Recipe adapted from Nyonya Flavours  [slightly modified]Ingredients[serves 5-6]500 gm yam [taro] – skinned and cut big cubes2-3 tbsp cooking oil500 gm chicken – cut bite size pieces [I used meaty chicken pieces]6-7 slices ginger4 cloves garlic – chopped2 tbsp fine preserved soy bean paste [tau cheong]1.5 litres waterSeasoning¼ tsp  white pepper powder½ - 1 tsp salt to tasteHeat oil in a non-stick wok, pan fry yam pieces until lightly golden.

{"title": "HOME-MADE CHAR SIEW AND CHAR SIEW PAUS", "date": "Friday, August 7, 2015", "text": "This is a long post which has 3 parts. Part One is on making your own Char Siew.  I followed Wendy's 'No bake Char Siew' recipe using her latest method.  Very easy.  The char siew is good.  I used only 450 gm pork belly with the exact portion of  seasoning from Wendy’s recipe.  You can make a bigger portion to serve with rice and also for making paus.Part Two is to prepare the Char Siew filling for making Char Siew Pau.  I followed Agnes Chang’s recipe [slightly modified] with Char Siew made in Part One.  The filling turns out good, very tasty yet not too sweet or salty.  It is nice.Part  Three is to make the Char Siew Paus.  I followed the recipe from Coco Kong’s book on Paus with slight modifications to the ingredients [reduced sugar and increased water quantity] and method.Verdict – the pau skin is soft, moist and chewy, the char siew filling is moist, fragrant and tasty.  What more do you expect from home-made paus?  It is awesome minus the extra sweetness of store-bought paus.  Do give this a try and discover the possibility of making good home-made paus.  You may like it.Part One – Char Siew Ingredients450 gm pork belly strip – skin removed [about 2 cm thickness]2 tbsp light soy sauce1 tbsp dark soy sauce1 tbsp Chinese Rose wine [Mei Kwee Lor] ½ tsp salt Enough water to cover meat pieces3 tbsp sugar [I used brown sugar]Place pork belly strips in a non-stick pan.  Add in light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, salt, wine and enough water to cover the meat.Bring to boil then lower heat.  Cover and simmer for about 20-30 minutes.  Flip over the meat to cook the other side for another 20-30 minutes or until the pork fat part is softened.Turn to high heat, add sugar and let it braise until the gravy is reduced to almost thick. Keep stirring when gravy is bubbly to prevent burning.  Off the heat.Let the meat to cool in the wok  with the gravy before slicing.Part Two – Char Siew Filling for Steamed Char Siew Paus350 gm home-made char siew  [from Part One] – chopped1 big onion or 3 shallots – peeled and chopped finely100 ml water1 tbsp cornflour, 1 tbsp tapioca flour and ½ tbsp plain flour [combined]3 tbsp toasted sesame seeds2-3 stalks spring onions – choppedSeasoning1 tbsp each of  light soy sauce and oyster sauce½ tbsp dark soy sauce3 tbsp sugar [I used brown sugar]Add onions into char siew sauce from Part One.  Stir fry until aromatic.  Add in the char siew, seasoning and water.  Bring to boil and simmer for 5 minutes.Sprinkle in the combined flour over char siew mixture, stir to mix until almost thick.Off heat, leave to cool before adding toasted sesame seeds and chopped spring onions.Chill in fridge until required.Part Three – Making Char Siew PausIngredients for Pau Skin[total weight – 700 gm, makes 35 gm x 20 dough]300 gm pau flour100 gm wheat starch or tang mian flour50 gm icing sugar1 tsp double action baking powder2 tsp instant yeast or 10 gm200-210 ml water [original recipe uses 160ml - too dry]30 gm shortening20 paper linersCombine both flours, sugar, baking powder  and yeast in the mixing bowl of an electric mixer fixed with a dough hook.  Add water gradually as you knead the dough.Knead until a soft dough is formed.  Add in the shortening and continue to knead till dough is soft, smooth and pliable.  Shape into a round ball.  Cover and proof for 20 minutes.Divide dough into 4 equal portions [175 gm each].  Roll into a log and divide into 5 equal portions [about 35 gm].Shape into balls, then flatten each ball with you palm.Press the edges of the dough to thin it before wrapping the filling.  Gather the edges and pleat it into a pleated pau or shape into a round ball.Place on paper liner and arrange it in a steaming tray.  Finish wrapping the rest of the dough and filling.Set aside to proof for about 40-45 minutes from the time you make the last pau.Prepare steamer and steam over rapidly boiling water for 10-12 minutes.  If using a normal steamer, bring water to boil first before steaming.Remove, serve immediately or  cool on wire rack.This post is linked to the event, Little Thumbs Up August 2015 [Brown Sugar and Molasses]  organised by Doreen from My Little Favourite DIY and Zoe, Bake for Happy Kids hosted by Jess of BakericiousI'm submitting this post to Cook Your Books Event #26 [August 2015] hosted by Joyce of Kitchen FlavoursThis post is also linked to the Best Recipes for Everyone August 2015 Event (Theme: Dim Sum)  organised by Fion （XuanHom's Mum Kitchen Diary) and hosted by May (厨苑食谱 @ mayck-law.blogspot.com"},

{"title": "THE VERSATILE BLOGGER AWARD", "date": "Sunday, August 2, 2015", "text": "THE VERSATILE BLOGGER AWARDThank you Veronica [Minty's Kitchen] for nominating my humble blog for The Versatile Blogger Award.  The nomination itself is truly inspirational and encouraging for me to carry on food blogging from this point of time.What I have in common with Veronica is our passion for cooking and baking.  I was attracted to her blog for its’ simplicity of  recipes and especially love looking and admiring at the beautiful photos in her posts.  They are really tempting  for one to quickly bookmark them in my ‘Must Try List’. If you share the same passion as me, do visit her here.VBA has some basic rules  for you to follow after you have been nominated.  They are:A] briefly thank the person who had nominated you for the Award;B] post the award badge on your blog;C] list and share 7 facts about yourself; andD] nominate 10 blogs that deserve this award and inform them Please visit this  website if you like to know more about this AwardHere are Some Facts About Me1 – I’m a Penangite from the ‘Pearl of Orient’.  My late Granny was sort of a Peranakan Nyonya, wore Batik sarongs and Kebayas with ‘Keronsangs’  all her life.   I remembered she had her hair neatly combed and secured with a net and ornate pins as decorations. She was a good cook but too bad, I did not have the chance to learn cooking from her because there are too many ladies in the house.  I’m the youngest lady in the family then. 2 – I do not know why I started cooking and baking.  It has to be something that happens unnoticed or is it  a duty to fulfill when you are married into a big family.  Perhaps, it is an expectation that daughter in-laws must know how to cook.  It’s not an easy task especially when your mother in-law cooks well.3 - What prompted me to blog about food from my kitchen was the need to put on record somewhere my aging mum’s family recipes.  I was afraid there will be a day my family will miss her awesome dishes.  She is in her 80’s yet still busy in the kitchen. My mum is a good cook, her  recipes are without exact measurements [it’s all by handfuls or pinches].  Do check out my posts in 2011 for most of her recipes.4 -  I have a collection of food magazines and recipe books which must be put to good use, tried and tasted more so to be shared.5 – ‘Monotonous’ way of  cooking/baking is not my style, meaning cooking and baking the same thing for the family within a fixed routine.  It’s boring and I believe there is a wide range of food to choose and enjoy everyday.6 -  Healthy yet yummy food is my main consideration when selecting recipes, best are those with easy cooking/baking preparations and methods since these days people are always busy.   Me for one.7 – Meeting with as many fellow food bloggers on the screen is a daily chore which I look forward to.  In a way, I learned a plenty from these visits. One of my greatest achievement in blogging is getting to know many people, friends from all over the global. Last rule to fulfill is my nomination of deserving bloggers for The Versatile Blogger Award.  Here is the list:Joyce of kitchen flavoursWendy of Table for 2.. or moreAnn Low of Anncoo JournalDG of Tested and TastedCheah Soke Hah of No-Frills RecipesJoceline of Butter, Flour and MePhong Hong of Phong Hong Bakes and CooksHHB of Happy Home BakingJasline of Foodie BakerIvy Sew of Simply Beautiful and Healthy LivingMy congratulations to the deserving nomineesThis post is getting too long and it’s time to express my appreciation for being nominated for VBA [VBA website].

Reserve 3 tablespoons of the water*. Mix in 1 tablespoon of sesame oil to the cabbage and set aside.Place minced meat in a small mixing bowl. Add salt and add in a little water [squeezed from the cabbage]. Use a pair of chopsticks to stir constantly in the same direction till the water is fully absorbed. Continue to add in the remaining water, a little at a time, stirring with the chopsticks in the same direction. With each addition, make sure water is fully absorbed before adding more water.Add in soya sauce, stir with chopsticks in the same direction, mix well.Add in grated ginger, sugar, pepper, stir with chopsticks in the same direction, mix well.Add in remaining 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, stir with chopsticks in the same direction, mix well. Add in finely chopped spring onions and cabbage.  Mix well. Leave to chill in fridge for 1 hour.  You can prepare the filling earlier and refrigerate until required.Ingredients for the Dough[ dough weighs 450 gm - makes 14 x 30 gm]250 gm plain flour [I used pau flour]3 gm instant dry yeast [about 3/4 tsp]30 gm caster sugar150 ml water1 tsp shortening or oilPlace all the dough ingredients [except shortening] in a mixing bowl. Knead to form a rough dough. Add in shortening and knead till smooth. Cover dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 5 minutes.Divide dough into 14 equal portions.  Shape each into a ball then flatten to form small discs.Wrap the dough with filling [about 1 tbsp]. Place pau  on paper cup cases.  Proof for 40 minutes or double in size.Place paus in a steamer and space them apart so that they do not touch one another. Steam over boiling water at high heat for 12 minutes.Turn off the heat and leave the lid slightly open for 3 minutes before removing the whole lid. Serve warm. Notes:Keep any leftovers in fridge [store in airtight containers] and re-steam till hot before serving."},

{"title": "PUMPKIN BARLEY DRINK", "date": "Wednesday, July 22, 2015", "text": "I had this drink [warm] at a Kopitiam somewhere near Jalan Ipoh  during my recent trip to KL.  It was so good that I fell in love with it.  We asked whether they  serve this drink daily but was told ‘It depends’.  There is a brewed drink daily but they can’t  tell us what exactly and the schedule.  Looks like we have to visit this Kopitiam every day which was what we did after our morning exercise at the Metropolitan park nearby.  Too bad, we didn’t manage to have another mug of this drink before we left KL cos’ they prepared other drinks like sugar cane and various herbal teas etc during the next few days.I had started looking for the recipe and saw one by HK Choo [Jottings of Life] which look quite similar but hers is like dessert. The first time I prepared this drink the consistency was not like the one I had in KL probably because I added too little pumpkin.   This time I added more pumpkin puree and it is almost similar to what I had but less sweet.  Now, I’m happy to share the recipe here but you can reduce or add water depending on whether you like to serve it as a drink or thick dessert.   I add more water cos' I like it as a drink.Ingredients[serves 5-6]500 gm pumpkin 100 gm pearl barley - rinsed2-3 blades pandan leaves [knotted]1.2 litres water150 gm sugar to taste [I used brown sugar]Steam pumpkin with skin till soft [about 40 minutes] and scrap out the flesh.

Overall taste blends well with the sweet pumpkin flesh.  Nice dish to serve with rice.  I served this dish with Tea Leaf Rice.It is best to cook the pork ribs until soft before transferring to the pumpkin bowl so that the flavours are well absorbed by the pork ribs when the pumpkin is steamed.Recipe adapted from  the book Festive Temptations Ingredients[serves 3-4]½ pumpkin [about 400-500 gm] – seeds removed300 gm pork ribs – cut bite size pieces1 tbsp each of chopped ginger, garlic and fermented black beans1 red chilli – chopped [I add some chopped dried red chillies]1 tbsp oilSeasoning1 tbsp fermented soy bean paste [taucheong]1 tbsp each of  cooking wine and light soy sauce1 tsp each of sesame soil and sugar¼ tsp pepper100 ml waterHeat oil in a non-stick pan, sauté chopped ingredients until aromatic.Add pork ribs and stir fry until well mixed with the ingredients.Add seasoning, stir fry to mix then add water.Bring to boil, then cover to simmer for 40 minutes or until pork ribs are tender.Thicken sauce with some cornstarch water.Transfer pork ribs and sauce mixture into pumpkin bowl.Steam over medium heat for 45 minutes or until pumpkin is cooked.Garnish with spring onions and chopped red chillies.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is necessary for the basic functioning of cells, as well as optimizing the heart’s rhythm. CoQ10 levels are reported to decrease with age and to be lower in some patients with some chronic diseases such as heart conditions, muscular dystrophies, Parkinson’s disease, cancer, diabetes, and HIV / AIDS.The heart also contains twice as much collagen and elastin than regular meat, which is good for the skin and connective tissue, and actually helps prevent wrinkling and aging.Heart is high in vitamin B12, iron, and potassium, in addition, also contains Selenium, Phosphorus & Zinc, along with essential amino acids that help build muscle, store energy and boost stamina and endurance.\"The soup is herbally, clear and tasty.

She buys the 'fresh cordyceps' [Tang Chang Cao]* from the wet market which is not too costly.  This is the name she got from the vegetable seller.  A hundred grams costs RM1.80 and is enough to cook a soup with 3-4 chicken wings.  It is crunchy after boiling.  We finished eating all of it. *Information received from reader, these are called Chong Cao Shen [虫草参 or 地蚕]  a kind of vegetable root. The soup is herbally and very tasty, not too bitter with the dong quai but aromatic.  It’s a nice soup which does not require long time to brew.  All in a matter of 30 minutes and the soup is ready to devour especially after a hard day’s work.Notes: Cordyceps sinensis is a caterpillar fungus that grows on a type of caterpillar. These days, this parasite is cultivated using grain. Cordyceps is known as an anti-asthmatic and anti-cancer agent which helps smooth muscle relaxation.  It is used to stimulate the endocrine system,  as an antibacterial agent,  and to aid patients suffering from chronic renal failure. According to this article, Today,  cordyceps is used in China specifically for the treatment of fatigue,  cough,  impotence,  and anemia.  It is listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia as a treatment for asthma and “impotence and seminal emissions with aching of loins and knees.”One of the newest on the long list of cordyceps benefits is that of an immune modulator.  While certain compounds in cordyceps significantly boost immunity,  there are others that appear to modulate the immune system so that the body doesn’t attack healthy tissue.  This could be a huge breakthrough in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.  Cordyceps is truly a miracle fungus.Ingredients[serve 3-4]3-4 chicken wings – discard the tip and cut into 2 pieces – blanched in hot water and rinsed2 dried mushrooms – soaked, rinsed and quartered4 red dates3-4 slices of dong quai100 gm Chong Cao shen [虫草参 or 地蚕]  900 ml waterBring water, mushrooms, roots, red dates and dong quai to boil for 10 minutes until aromatic.Add in the chicken wings, bring to boil then simmer over low heat for a further 15-20 minutes.Add salt to taste and a little chicken stock granules if preferred.Dish up to serve hot with rice."},

Used to make these pancakes for him but it was quite a while since I last made them for him.  Recently, he commented that it has been a long time I didn’t make him these pancakes.With ChingMing over and having some free time, I made these pancakes for mynephews.  The best part is, I didn’t haveto fry them for him.  I need only toprepare until Step No. 6  and he takes overthe rest when he wanted to indulge in these crispy, fragrant and tastypancakes.  He loves these pancakes alittle more salty, peppery and with lots of spring onions/scallions.  This I fully agree with him.The pancakes can be made individually or as a whole log then cut into smallerpieces.  If you have the time, it wouldbe better to make them piece by piece according to the size that you prefer.Ingredients[makes12 medium size or 24 small size pancakes]600 gm plain flour or Rose flour100 gmspring onions or more - washed, drainedand cut small cubesSome oilfor brushing [2-3 tbsp]Somesalt to tasteSomepepper to taste¾ cuphot boiling water¾ cupcold waterSometoasted sesame seeds – optionalPutflour in a mixing bowl, add hot boiling water and quickly stir with a pair ofchopsticks to mix until flour looks like coarse bread crumbs.Fixmixer with a dough hook, add in cold water. Knead dough until smooth, then add in a little oil.  Continue to knead until soft , smooth andshining. Sprinkledough with some flour and shape into a ball, cover  to rest for at least 30 minutes.Kneadrested  dough to release airbubbles.  Divide into small portions.  This dough can be used to make Chinese Pancake with sweet paste filling too [click here to see recipe].Rolleach portion into a rectangle, spread evenly some oil over surface, sprinkle alittle salt and pepper followed by spring onions.Roll updough into Swiss roll style, seal the edges then roll into a circulardisc.  Finish doing the same for theremaining dough.Heat anon-stick pan with oil.  Flatten thescallion pancake and fry it till crispy on one side, flip over to fry the otherside until crispy.Removeand place fried pancakes on absorbent paper. To serve, cut pancake into smaller pieces.  Serve immediately with chilli sauce.Notes:Can keepindividual dough pieces in separate greased plastic bags in the fridge for 2days before frying.Pancakescan be pan fried till cooked but not brown then bake in oven at 200 degrees Cfor 7-8 minutes before serving."},

This time I tried steaming the kuih in plastic cups [is it healthy?] but it is much easier without having to grease or heat them before filling up with the batter.  You can use porcelain teacups or stainless steel moulds, too but remember to grease them.The kuih is soft, chewy, very aromatic and the natural green colour comes solely from the pandan juice.  No colouring is added.  As stated in my previous post, a good Kuih Kosui should have a dent in the centre as seen in the photo here.Ingredients[makes  40 teacup size kuih]140 gm rice flour60 gm green bean flour 400 ml water1 tsp alkaline waterPandan Sugar Syrup180 gm castor sugar 200 ml water6-8 blades pandan leaves [I used 15]Toppings200 gm freshly grated white coconut1 tsp salt to tasteMix rice flour and green bean flour with 400 ml water and leave to soak for 1-2 hours.Blend pandan leaves with  200 ml water.  Extract the juice.To make the pandan sugar syrup – boil the sugar with pandan juice in a saucepan.

Long ago, I won't make kuihs that have coconut or coconut milk in them, thinking that it is unhealthy to consume too much of it and of course, sugar.Nowadays, I don’t bother cos’ after all I’m not eating all of them, hehehe!. There are many people around that I can share them. I'm happy just to taste a little will do…hope I can control myself.  This kuih is quite addictive, you won't stop at one.I noticed that for this kuih, some recipes stated to cook the batter and some don’t.  On safer side, I tried the warm batter method cos’ I remembered my late great aunt used to do that and she makes very good Kuih Kosui for sale then.  I was even more convinced prepare it this way after reading Wendy's post on pandan kuih kosui.  Hers look so pretty and I like the quantity of sugar she used [only 90 gm]. According to this recipe from the book ‘Nyonya Flavours’, the batter is not heated but the steaming cups are heated for 5 minutes before the batter is added [I skip this step].  I followed part of Wendy's method [Step 5 and 6] which is more similar to my late grand aunt's.Anyway, the kuih turns out well.   It is chewy [QQ] and there is a hollow dent in the centre.

Must say I have no regrets cooking it cos’ the soup is really tasty and has a certain natural sweetness from the fish and salty taste from the chai por.Moreover, I was happy that I managed to buy the ‘old’ chai por [see photo on how the old chai por looks like] and the fried tofu  when I went back to my mother in-law’s place at Air Itam market, Penang.

{"title": "EZ Chinese Black Beans Pork Ribs Soup", "date": "Thursday, December 18, 2014", "text": "My  mother in-law cooks this kind of soup quite often but usually with pig’s tail which I find it quite oily and avoid drinking it. Recently, I read from Kat Juju that black beans aka black turtle beans is an excellent source of protein and fibre.  It is also packed with powerful anti-oxidants providing the body with lots of essential vitamins and minerals. From TCM [traditional Chinese medicine] point of view, this soup helps to tonify the kidneys, strengthens yin energy and nourish the blood.  A must for people who are tired, run down and whose body needs recovery. According to Kat, kidneys are the body’s natural filter of the blood and remove waste which is diverted to the urinary bladder.  Like all kinds of filters, the kidneys need to be nourished and detoxed to maintain its proper function. Traditionally drunk by pregnant and women undergoing confinement, this blood nourishing soup is beneficial for both men and women.Verdict – Like what Kat Juju says, this is a delicious and so easy to make soup.   I tried and she is right even though  I slightly modified the recipe for more simplicity.  I replaced red dates and kei chee with another specie of red dates called Goji Dates [available at medical shops].  This is a seedless red dates which are sweet and stays in shape even after boiling for a long time.  If you can’t find them then use the ordinary red dates and kei chee.  The black beans are crunchy soft and the pork ribs are tender.  Nice soup which I wouldn’t mind cooking it often. Ingredients [serves 2-3] 200 gm pork ribs – cut small pieces 50 gm black beans [pre-soaked in cold water for several hours, drained] 9 Goji  red dates or 20 red dates and a handful of Goji  [kei chee] ¼ piece of cuttlefish – rinsed well A few cloves of garlic 800 ml water Salt to taste Blanch pork ribs in boiling water for several minutes to remove the scums.

Scald in hot water for 1-2 minutes. Clean and pat dry. Pierce the skin all over [I used a BBQ skewer]. Turn over and make a few slits across the meat lengthwise. Mix together salt, Chinese wine, 5 spice powder and garlic. Rub mixture all over the meat side. Do Not marinate the skin side. Once the meat side is evenly rub with marinade, place on a flat plate, meat side down and skin side up. Leave meat to marinate in fridge for 1-2 days uncovered. This is to dry the skin and get the meat well marinated. To roast pork, preheat oven at 250 degrees C for 10 minutes. Bring meat to room temperature. Place meat pieces [skin side up] on roasting rack on top of a foil covered baking tray. This is to collect the oil drippings and for easier cleaning after roasting.Place roasting tray in the middle level of oven to ensure even roasting. Roast for 25 - 30 minutes.  Remove from oven, turn oven to top heat.  Dab excess oil on the skin with kitchen towel.Return meat to oven, put on the top level to roast for a further 25 - 30 minutes.  It may take longer time depending on each individual oven [about 45 minutes for it to crack nicely and stay crispy for long time].In between roast, it is okay to open the oven and dab oil from skin with kitchen towel. Continue roasting till the skin has cracked up and slightly burnt. This is to get a crispier skin.Remove meat from oven and scrap off the burnt skin with a serrated knife.

I have tried a few and do not mind preparing them again especially the simple ones such as this recipe. Thanks to Soup Queen. Before I go one to share the recipe, below is an excerpt from Soup Queen which I would like to share.Notes shared by Soup Queen [here] about PumpkinYou can refrigerate the leftover but do not freeze.  Just warm it up lightly on your stove but not bring to a boil.Pumpkin is good for your eyes as it is loaded with vitamin A and antioxidant carotenoids, particularly alpha and beta-carotenes. Containes vitamins C, K and E and lots of minerals including magnesium, potassium and iron. According to Chinese medicine, pumpkin seeds [dried and ground up] are good for expelling worms from your intestines. On the western front, pumpkin seeds are famous for helping with prostate health.According to TCM sites, pumpkin has a cooling nature and helps to resolve dampness, stabilizes a hyperactive foetus, kill worms, reduces fever and diabetes.  It is also [surprise] an antidote for opium addiction. What's most interesting is that pumpkin seeds help to build Kidney Yin which is essential for reproduction and fertility. Verdict - refreshing and healthy dessert.Ingredients[serves 4-5]1/4 pumpkin - remove skin and seeds - cut cubes or wedges50 gm barley - rinsed and soaked for 15 minutes70 gm rock sugar or more to tastesome pandan leaves - cut into pieces1500 ml waterBring water to boil with barley.  Once boiling, lower heat, cover to simmer for 45 minutes.Add in pumpkin and pandan leaves.  Bring to boil and simmer for about 10 minutes or until pumpkin is soft.Add in rock sugar to taste.Serve warm as a dessert.    This post is linked to the event Little Thumbs Up (Oct 2014 Event: PUMPKIN) organised by Zoe (Bake for Happy Kids) and Mui Mui (My Little Favourite DIY) and hosted by Eileen (Eileen's Diary).Also submitting this post to \"My Treasured Recipes #3 - Taste of Autumn (Oct/Nov 2014)\" hosted by Miss B of Everybody Eats Well in Flanders and co-hosted by Charmaine of Mimi Bakery House."},

Then put it in the freezer for 30 minutes to become firm. Shape into cone shape, then flatten the cone shape dough. Roll them up from the wider ends.  I skip the step, instead I divide the dough into 2 equal portions.  Then roll the portion into a rectangular shape, cut slantwise into a triangular shape for each piece. Flatten each piece and roll them up from the wider ends and pinch the tappering end to seal. Transfer them onto the baking tray and let it prove for 50 minutes. Brush with egg wash [remaining half egg plus a little water]. Bake at 190 degrees C for about 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.

This concentrate part of pandan juice give cakes a nice and light fragrant of pandan leaf.This post is linked to the event, Little Thumbs Up organised by Bake for Happy Kids and My Little Favourite DIY, and hosted by Diana from the Domestic Goddess Wannabe"},

{"title": "Dragon Boat Festival 2014 / Duan Wu Jie 2014 / 端午节 2014 [Chinese Rice Dumplings' Festival]", "date": "Thursday, May 29, 2014", "text": "Rice dumplings are eaten by Chinese on the 5th day of the 5th lunar calendar to commemorate the death of statesman-poet Chu Yuan who committed suicide about 2500 years ago.  Chu Yuan was a senior government officer during the Zhou Dynasty before he was framed by an evildoer and exiled by the  King.  His unsuccessful attempts to convince the King of the kingdom's much needed reforms led to his suicide by jumping into the river.  People rowed boats to seek for his body in the river and threw rice-filled bamboos into the river  in the hope that the fishes would eat the rice instead of Chu Yuan's body.Today, dragon boat racing and the eating of rice dumplings [they are now wrapped in bamboo leaves instead of being stuffed in the bamboo shoots] form the The Dragon Boat Festival, held annually in commemoration of Chu Yuan.Chinese people from different dialects have their own unique version of rice dumplings, most probably influenced by the differences in background, and hence the taste.These are the various version of rice dumplings that I have made during this festival.Alkaline 'Kan Sui' Glutinous Rice Dumpling [Kee Chang] Taiwanese Lou Rou ChungGreen Beans Rice DumplingsRed Yeast Black Pepper Rice Dumplings Tai Shan Style Rice DumplingsWhat You Should Know About Rice Dumpling-MakingOlder rice grains have a springy bite when cooked whilst fresher ones cook to a softer and mushier finish.  Generally, people prefer a more springy bite.When wrapping the dumpling, don't pack it too full or the filling may not be cooked through in the stated time.  For the same reason, don't bind the string too tightly around the dumpling - leave room for it to expand.For perfectly cooked dumplings, always ensure that they are entirely submerged in the water during cooking.  Have boiling water ready to top up the pot should the water level drop enough to reveal the tips of the dumplings.  However, it is best to fill the pot with ample water from the start of cooking to prevent hasty additions of water in the midst of cooking.Wrapping Chang - Step By Step and Boiling ChangTake 2 pieces of bamboo leaf and align them, one on top of the other.  Holding them with one long side facing you, fold both ends away from you, around and upward, such that the centre of the long side nearest to you becomes the point of a cone, whose back walls are formed by the overlapping ends.Spoon a tablespoon of rice into the cone, then place a chestnut, some pork, a mushroom and a salted egg yolk [if using] on top.Cover the filling with 2 tablespoons of rice.  Make sure the dumpling doesn't feel too full.Fold over the ends of the leaves which are protruding from the back of the cone [the cone's tip is pointing towards the right]....and wrap them round the side.Bind the dumpling with a string by simply looping it round the bak chang twice and securing with a knot.Fill a large pot with enough water to fully immerse the dumplings and bring to a fierce boil over high heat.  Lower the heat to maintain a gentle boil.  Continue cooking for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  Top up with boiling water if dumplings are not fully immersed in water.  You can cook the dumplings from cold water but must not use cold water for topping water level.ENJOY ALL THE CHANGS YOU CAN THIS DUAN WU JIE FESTIVAL 2014"},

The original recipe is from Florence [Do What I Like - Lady Grey Cupcakes with Yuzu Cream].  Florence uses Lady Grey [1 tablespoon], a light black tea blend, which has been flavoured with lemon and orange, scented with a hint of Bergamot. The aroma is definitely citrus.  Since I didn't have this tea, I substituted it with Lipton tea sachet just to try out this recipe before I buy the Lady Grey.  Instead of Yuzu Cream, I used crumble topping.It's a good attempt as I believe most people will have tea bags in the kitchen to try these cupcakes. Steps are easy and straightforward. This cupcake has the tea aroma but not the citrus flavour without the Lady Earl tea.The texture is soft, light and fine, with the crumble topping, it's a nice cupcake.   It's a keeper as I always have a liking for soft and light cupcakes that aren't too sweet too.  My hubby gave a thumbs up for this when he had one while the cupcake was still warm.Visit this site for Its' Nutritional FactsIngredients[makes 9 cupcakes]50 gm butter - room temperature50 gm castor sugar1/4 tsp salt1 large egg65 ml milk130 gm self raising flour1 sachet Lipton teaCrumble Topping20 gm butter20 gm castor sugar60 gm plain flour or 45 gm plain flour+1 1/2 tbsp ground almond - Rub in until it's like bread crumbs and refrigerate until requiredLine baking tray with paper casings.  Preheat oven at 175 degrees C.Sieve flour and fine tea leaves together.  Set aside.Cream butter, sugar and salt in a mixing bowl with a hand whisk until light and fluffy.Add in the egg, beat well until creamy and light.Fold in 1/2 portion of the sifted flour and milk.  Mix well with a spatula.Add the rest of flour and milk.  Mix to just combine.Spoon batter into prepared paper casings until 80% full.  Top with crumble toppings.Bake in preheated oven on middle rack for 20-25 minutes.This post is linked to Little Thumbs Up May Event - Milk Theme organised by Bake For Happy Kids and My Little Favourite DIY,hosted by Tze of Awayofmind Bakery House"},

{"title": "Classic Nasi Lemak", "date": "Friday, May 16, 2014", "text": "I'm a Nasi Lemak lover but I don't cook this often as it is quite addictive.  Most times we hear people talking about Nasi Lemak being a high cholesterol type of food because of the coconut milk and some of its' condiments like eggs, fried anchovies/groundnuts, prawns are also high cholesterol stuffs. Keeping this in mind, I will go for the really good Nasi Lemak but it's quite hard to come by these day. Sometimes, the rice is good but the condiments aren't that pleasing and vice versa.During my childhood days, we used to visit my maternal grandma in Kuala Kurau [a small fishing village] in Perak. She will buy a heap of the Nasi Lemak Bungkus in banana leaf as breakfast for us.  The condiments are simple assam prawns or fried fish with sambal belacan.  I remembered the rice was so fragrant especially wrapped with banana leaf.  At that time, a packet is only RM0.15. We are always so happy and grateful to enjoy these little packets. This is also one of the reasons we look forward to visiting my late grandma.  It's not happening now.  Those were the good old times and memories.So, hehehe!, the best option is to cook my own as I would know what goes in to the rice and the condiments [sambal belacan, fried prawns, cucumbers/tomatoes, fried fish etc] that we love to have with it. Forget about the coconut milk and other 'sinful' stuffs, we will enjoy it to the fullest, then forget about Nasi Lemak for some time.   The 'some time' duration can be months later or even a year.  My last Nasi Lemak was in September 2013 when we had Pandan Nasi Lemak.  I can have Nasi Lemak with curry or sambal belacan but not my hubby.  He only wants Sambal Belacan with fried fish, anchovies and some ulam [fresh herbs] or fresh vegetables [cucumbers, four angled beans, ladies' finger etc].My hubby eating his plate of Nasi Lemak  with his fingers.

{"title": "Steamed Moist Chocolate Cake", "date": "Wednesday, May 14, 2014", "text": "Verdict of this cake by Jess of Bakericious which I fully agreed.\"The cake is not only moist and chocolaty but surprisingly soft.  The rum gives a special fragrance to the cake, making  it really delicious and yummy.  The cake texture is so fine and lovely that you would not guess it is a steamed cake.\"My hubby gave a Thumbs Up too for this nice, lovely cake. It is the best ever steamed chocolate that I have made.  Since the cake by itself is so....nice, I omit the melted chocolate coating.According to Jess, this cake can be served chilled or in room temperature.  Like Jess, this cake has also changed my opinion about steamed cake which to me usually is a cake with coarse and sometimes tough texture, heavy and dense. However, this cake is the direct opposite.  Moreover, it is a yummy and fuss free chocolate cake.  Very true - really easy even for a novice cook to do.  I only need to use a saucepan and a mixing bowl to do the preparation.  IT'S A KEEPER. My appreciation to Jess and Tin Tin for sharing this lovely, workable recipe.  By the way, I saw this recipe sometime in 2010 in Tin Tin's blog Cooking Crave, copied it but haven't try until when I saw this again in Jess blog.  Thank you.This photos are actually the edges of the cake.  I have cut the edges to make it into a rectangular cake which I'll be giving to my mom.  Next time, I'll make another one using a round steaming tray for my family.Visit this site for Its' Nutritional Facts [here]Please visit Jess or Tin Tin's blog for the original ingredients.For Cake Ingredients [slightly modified]180 gm butter [I used 50/50 butter and corn oil]180 gm castor sugar200 ml low fat milk1/2-1 tsp vanilla essence2 eggs, slightly beaten with fork100 gm plain flour [I used cake flour]50 gm cocoa powder [good quality]1/2 tsp baking powder1/2 tsp baking soda2 tbsp of rum [optional]Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and baking soda into a large mixing bowl.  Set aside.Lightly beat eggs with a fork.  Set aside.Combine butter, oil, sugar, vanilla essence and milk in a saucepan.   Stir over low heat just to dissolve the sugar and melt the butter.  Remove from fire and keep warm.  Stir in the rum if using.Add in the beaten eggs into the slightly cold liquid mixture, stir to mix well.Heat up the steamer [I used electric steamer - no need to preheat it].  Lined and greased a 8 inch round baking tray [I used the oval shape steaming tray of my electric steamer and lined it with cling wrap for easy removal of the cake].Gradually pour the liquid mixture into the flour, using a hand whisk to stir till well to mix [cake batter should be runny like the batter for brownie].Pour the batter into the tray, place in the steamer, cover the top of the tray loosely with a piece of foil.Cover the steamer and steam over medium heat for 45 minutes or until the skewer comes out clean.Cool the cake in the pan before removing to cool on the rack.Slice cake to serve.  Cake can be served chilled or in room temperature. For Frosting [if using]*100 gm chocolate, chopped into small pieces25 gm milkDouble boil the chocolate and milk until chocolate is melt.Pour onto the cake and chill the cake.* As mentioned by Jess, this amount of chocolate ganache is insufficient to coat the whole cake, you need to increase the amount of chocolate if you want to frost the entire cake.I'm submitting this post to Bake Along #60 - Theme - Chocolate Cakes hosted and organised by Joyce from Kitchen Flavours, Lena from Frozen Wings and Zoe from Bake For Happy Kids.I'm also linking this post to Little Thumbs Up [May 2014 Event-Milk] organised by Zoe [Bake for Happy Kids] and Mui Mui [My Little Favourite DIY] and hosted by Tze [Awayofmind Bakery House]."},

{"title": "Nyonya Bee Koh [Kuih Pulut]", "date": "Wednesday, May 7, 2014", "text": "The following write up on Bee Koh is from Penang Travel Tips.  It explains well of this Nyonya kuih. \"Bee Koh are Nyonya glutinous rice cakes. The Bee Koh is also known in Malay as Kuih Pulut, and is often made by the Malays particularly during Hari Raya. Sweet and sticky, the bee koh comes in two types, white or brown, depending on whether white sugar or brown sugar is used. The difference between the Nyonya bee koh and the Malay kuih pulut is in the texture of the rice grains. In the Nyonya bee koh, the rice grains are fully softened while in the Malay kuih pulut, you can still feel each grain.In Penang, it is one of the desserts offered by the Taoists to the Jade Emperor on his birthday, which falls on the 9th day of the 1st lunar month, coinciding with the 9th day of Chinese New Year.\"  The original recipe is double of this portion.  In my opinion, this is not a difficult Nyonya Kuih to make at home.  Minimal ingredients and quick to do kuih, Step 3 is the most crucial step as whether the Kuih will set well depends on this step.  But I believe, practice will make perfect.  Use less sugar than 180 gm if you prefer the kuih not too sweet.  Next time, I'll try with brown sugar.Recipe Source - Bee Koh Recipe - Penang Nyonya KuihIngredients[makes 6 inch round plate]  200 gm glutinous rice (pulut bee) 150 - 180g white sugar or brown sugar[I used white sugar]200 ml thick coconut milk Soak the glutinous rice overnight. In the next day, drain the rice and steam it until fully cooked. Mix the sugar with coconut milk, and stir it in a saucepan or pot until the sugar fully dissolves. Strain it and return it to the saucepan. Add the glutinous rice to the saucepan, gently stirring it until it thickens and leaves the pan clean [about 20 minutes].Lightly grease trays, then pour the mixture into the trays. Use a spoon to press over the surface to make it even, then leave it to cool.Once the bee koh has cooled down, cut it into rhombus-shaped cubes (a rhomboid or rhombohedron). They are ready to be served.Notes: Visit this site for Its' Nutritional Facts [here]"},

If you are one [like myself] who usually keeps some of the common herbs in the kitchen, it is worth to gather them and cook this Bak Kut Teh for your family.  Honestly, I didn't follow every part of the whole recipe but I found the Bak Kut Teh soup itself good [tasty and aromatic].  I wouldn't mind preparing this tasty soup which is quite easy.Below is the recipe copied from Sonia's Blog - Nasi Lemak Lover which was well written and easy to follow that I wouldn't want to change it even though I didn't do the following.- pork ribs and pork - the fragrant garlic oiled rice [cos' my hubby doesn't like fried garlic oil]- beancurd sheets, button mushrooms, Chinese cruellers [Yu Char Koay], fried shallots - I omitHere, I wish to thank Sonia for this lovely recipe as I like the idea of gathering all the pieces of herbs together and know what is in this Klang Bak Kut Teh.  Next time if I do prepare the soup, I will try to reduce the water to make a more intense version.  I believe it should be good.If you are interested in this Claypot Klang Bak Kut Teh, do hop over to Nasi Lemak Lover to see Sonia's posting.   The photos on the herbs and other ingredients should be very helpful.Klang Claypot Bak Kut Teh (Pork Ribs Tea) 吧生瓦煲肉骨茶*serves 5-6paxChinese Herbs to put into a muslin filter pouch3 sticks Tong Sun党参1 slice Gui Pi（cinnamon skin)桂皮10 slices Gui Zhi(cinnamon sticks)桂枝1pc Chen Pi (sun-dried tangerine peel)陳皮 45g Yu Zhu/ Yok Chok玉竹2 sticks Gan Cau甘草 3 slices Chuan Xiong川芎1pc Shu Di熟地 1 stick Niu Qi牛七3 slices Don Gui当归1/2tsp White peppercorn白楜椒1/2tsp Black peppercorn黑楜椒1/2tsp Hua Jiao花椒1/2tsp Fennel seeds小茴香1tsp Goji /Wolfberries枸杞1kg pork ribs, blanch in hot water, set aside2.5lts water1 honey date蜜枣2 roasted whole garlic黑蒜头2tbsp light soy sauce2tbsp dark caramel soy sauceSalt to taste3 star aniseMethodBring water to boil in a big pot.

This way the waxed meat are more tender and tastier with the wine and ginger. However, instead of just mixing the steamed meat with rice, I place them over the cooked rice in individual serving platter, then steamed it again just before serving.  My hubby loves his food steaming hot, otherwise I can skip this step.Anyway, this rice dish tops the list of my CNY favourites.  My  hubby requested that I get more waxed meat this time, he wants to prepare it for his 'club'  buddies, too.Ingredients[serves 3-4]1 cured/waxed duck drumstick2 pieces waxed duck breast meat1 piece liver sausage2 Chinese sausages [local lap cheong]finely shredded ginger - garnishingfinely shredded spring onions - garnishinga few slices of ginger2 tbsp Chinese cooking wine [I used Shaoxing wine]4 cloves garlic - minced and fry until crispy [I omit]2 cups rice - cooked in the rice cookerSeasoning - boil together3 tbsp light soy sauce1 tbsp Chinese cooking wine [I used Shaoxing wine]1 tsp sesame seed oil1 tsp sugardash of pepperBlanch waxed duck meats with boiling water for 5-10 minutes [to get rid of excess oil and smell].  Place the blanched meat and sausages in a dish, top with some ginger slices and drizzle in the wine.  Steam for 15-20 minutes.In a saucepan, bring seasonings to boil.  Set aside.Cut the waxed meat and sausages into slices.  Debone the cured duck drumstick, sliced.Fluff up rice and scoop into individual serving platter or in the rice cooker.  Place sliced waxed meat/juice from cured meats/seasoning on top of the rice [individual platter] or in the rice cooker [stir to combine].Garnish with spring onions and ginger before serving.Notes: I steamed the bowls of rice for 10 minutes before serving with garnishingNotes: Visit this site for it's Nutritional Facts [here]"},

According the Wendy, she did not dry the arrowhead slices and her chips turned out fine.2. Drop the arrowhead slices vertically into the deepest part of the oil. It will sink at first and then rise to the top.3. Don't overcrowd the chips when frying and make sure they don't overlap or they will stick together.4. Be patient, wait until the chips are properly fried before removing from oil or else they will be soggy.I'm submitting this post to Aspiring Bakers #39 theme - CNY Rock and Roll January 2014 hosted by Moon of Food Playground."},

This is going to be one of my resolutions for 2014 - Must start to try them from now.  So my dear friends, you may see a dish so similar to yours, that's if I did it right, hehehe!If I do try them and post the recipes after trying for record purposes but forgotten to link to the respective blogs, my sincere apologies.  Hope you will give me a 'tinkle' if you do spot the errors and I'll update and link it up right away.  I'm not young anymore and good memories do fail me at times.Anyway, I was happy all throughout 2013 and thought it was a good year for me with things running smoothly until Christmas Day. My family and relatives are healthy, safe and sound.  But on the fateful early morning of Christmas Day, I lost my dear youngest brother in a road mishap.  He left us so suddenly without uttering any words. Leaving his aged mother, siblings, his loving wife and two young daugthers. This really shattered my thoughts of a beautiful 2013 and a big blow to my family, relatives and even his friends.However, throughout the year, I have made many new friends through food blogging, outdoor social activities and recreational sports etc.   I do appreciate all the valuable comments, feedbacks and advices which are very inspirational.   Through food blogging, my friends, relatives and family especially my hubby and myself got to enjoy a wide range of yummy-licious home-cooked food in 2013.  I think there were over 270 new recipes that I have tried throughout the year.  To me, it's quite an accomplishment.  With so much good food and bakes, I must say that none in the family has their waistlines expanding 'sideways'....Got what I mean. So it is still worth the effort to prepare home-cooked food.So much said, happy or sad, life has to go on.  It's time to wish all readers/visitors of my blog and blogger friends a safe and good new year ahead for all.\"May this new year brings safety,good health and happiness to all.  Most of all, please do enjoy visiting me here to keep me going\"\"HAPPY NEW YEAR 2014\"P/S: To my dear readers and blogger friends, I will not be posting any recipe regularly as before as I'm not in the 'mood for food'.  But I would love your visits to this blog even though the new postings aren't regular for the time being.  Take care."},

The bread turned out so lovely and I suddenly thought I should try another time to find the most needed spare part [oven thermostat] to rescue my oven.I'm writing this post in the hope that some readers and fellow blogger friends may have some advice on this.  Most people would say, just buy a new one after all it's more than 20 years old.  I did buy a new one but only a small one cos' I haven't a place to fit in another built-in oven.  I believe there are 'older' ovens elsewhere still functioning well and mine, if I can find the thermostat, it should work well again.  I'll also check it out with Fiamma, KL for help.I'm reluctant sad to throw this oven away just because of this problem.Thank you."},

However, the main purpose is to try some of the wonderful recipes shared in these magazines when I retire from work...hehehe!  it's a long wait.I have summarised the article and just sharing some main points about this simple word 'EGG'.  It is probably the most loved food in the world.  Found in every kitchen of every cuisine and ranks one of the most nutritional food known to mankind.The Healthy Egg- rich in high quality proteins [9 essential amino acids];- has significant number of vitamins [A,D,E and B12] and minerals[riboflavin, iron, zinc, folic acid and phosphorus].  These nutrients are important in promoting good vision, maintaining healthy skin, improving resistance to infection, building healthy red blood cells and maintaining the central nervous systems, etc.- has a very small amount of fat that helps the body to absorb fat soluble vitamins [ADEK], makes hormones and bile acids.Eggs are essential helpers in the preparation of food.  They are use to:- thicken custards and sauces;- leaven souffles and cakes;- binds meat;- stabilise emulsions such as mayonnaise.Beyond the Dining Table [Uses of eggs]- for hair and skin care [excellent toner for oily skin];- eggshells can be used to clean the insides of glass bottles and jars, remove smell or odour from them;- water from boiling of eggs can be used to water houseplants when cooled.  The minerals in the water is great growth booster for plants.From a simple EGG, great dishes have been born irrespective of the cooking methods - boiled, steamed, deep fried, pan fried, stir fried or baked.Anyway, this post is also about Tea Eggs, the recipe shared with this article which I prepared to share with LTU - Eggs theme.  This dish makes an excellent cold  or warm appetiser.Ingredients[recipe adapted from Home Cooking Magazine April 1999 with some modifications]1 dozen eggs - cleanedPlace eggs in a saucepan.  Cover with cold water and add some salt.  Bring the water to boil slowly.  Stir the eggs with a pair of chopsticks in a circular motion continuously while the water comes to a boil [this is done so that the egg yolks with be in the centre of the egg white when cooked].When the water boils [stop the stirring], reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Drain and leave the eggs to cool.Using the back of a spoon, crack eggs all over but do not remove the shells.Place cracked eggs in a saucepan again.  Add in the tea leaves and all  the ingredients below.  Pour in enough water to cover the eggs.Boil for 1 hour on medium low heat.  Drain and serve either warm or cold.1 piece cinnamon stick2 star anise3 cloves3 pieces dong quai [optional]1 tsp 5 spice powder1 tbsp salt1 tbsp sugar3 tbsp light soy sauce2 tbsp dark soy saucea few slice ginger [optional]I'm linking this post to Little Thumbs Up August Theme - Eggs organised by Zoe of Bake for Happy Kids and Doreen of My Little Favourite DIY and hosted by Baby Sumo of Eat Your Heart OutI'm also sharing this post  with Cook Your Books #3 Event  hosted by Kitchen Flavours"},

{"title": "Mexico Buns", "date": "Saturday, February 16, 2013", "text": "This recipe is from Happy Home Baking which was well written with every single detail.  Please do visit here if you wish to bake these buns.Below is the recipe copied from Happy Home Baking with her consent which I'm keeping here for future reference.  There are some little adjustments to the measurements. Ingredients[makes 10 buns]tang zhong (water-roux):25 gm bread flour125 ml waterbread dough:210 gm bread flour60 gm cake flour20 gm milk powder40 gm caster sugar1/2 tsp salt6 gm instant yeast [I used 2 tsp]1 small  egg, lightly beaten85 gm water84 gm tang zhong (water-roux)* - I used all of the above tangzhong20 gm unsalted buttertopping:50 gm unsalted butter50 gm caster sugar50 gm egg, lightly beaten [I used 1 large egg]50 gm cake flour1 1/2 tsp instant coffee powder 1/2 tsp vanilla extract1/2 tsp warm waterMethod to make topping:* Dissolve instant coffee powder with the warm water, mix in vanilla extract. Set aside.* Beat the butter with caster sugar, until light and fluffy. Add the beaten egg one teaspoon at a time, beat well after each addition (add in egg gradually to prevent the mixture from curdling).* Add in the coffee mixture gradually, beat well after each addition. Sieve over the cake flour. Mix with a spatula until just combined. Transfer topping into piping bag fixed with pipping nozzle (round tip).* Let the topping chill in the fridge until needed. Remove from fridge about 5~10mins earlier before use to allow the topping to soften a little. Method to make tang zhong:Place 25 gm bread flour in a saucepan. Add 125 ml water, mix till smooth, making sure there are no lumps of flour.Cook over medium to low heat, stirring constantly with a hand whisk to prevent it from burning. Within 1 to 2 mins, the mixture will start to thicken, stop when you see traces in the mixture for every stir you make with the hand whisk. The 65 degrees C tang zhong is ready. Immediately transfer the hot tang zhong into a bowl and cover it with a cling wrap, making sure the cling wrap sticks onto the surface of the mixture. This is to prevent a film from forming on the surface. Leave to cool completely before using it.Method to knead dough by bread machine:Place water, egg, tang zhong (use 84 gm), sugar, salt, bread flour, cake flour, milk powder in the pan of the bread machine (according to the sequence as stated in the instruction manual of your bread machine).Make an indentation on the flour and add in the instant yeast. Select the Dough function of the bread machine and press start. Leave the lid of the machine open (this is to prevent over heating). After about 10 mins of kneading, add in the 22 gm of butter. Let the machine continue to knead the dough. After the kneading cycle has stopped (20 mins), Stop and Restart the machine. Continue to let the machine knead for another 20 mins.Remove dough from the bread pan. (Note: refer this post for instructions on how to knead dough by hand.)Grease hands with some vegetable oil (this helps to prevent the dough from sticking to your hands). Remove dough from bread machine. Shape into a smooth round. Place dough in a lightly greased (use vegetable oil or butter) mixing bowl, cover with cling wrap or a damp cloth and let proof in room temperature (around 28 to 30 degrees C) for about one hour, or until double in bulk. Remove the dough from the bowl and give a few light kneading to press out the gas in the dough. Divide the dough into 10 equal portions (about 55 gm each).Roll each dough into smooth rounds and place on a greased (or lined with parchment paper) baking tray.Space doughs two inches apart to allow them to expand. Cover with damp cloth or cling wrap and leave doughs to proof for the second time for about 30~40 mins, or until double in size. Pipe topping onto each dough. Make sure to cover the entire surface with the topping. Bake in pre-heated oven at 180 degrees C for 15 mins or until golden brown. Remove from oven and transfer to wire track to let cool. Once cool, store immediately in an airtight container. Best served warm (re-heat in oven if necessary before serving)."},

[ * ] Method to make Dough from Happy FlourMix all the dough ingredients together and knead to form a soft dough. (For water, try to add 1/2 of the among first and then add some at a time. You may need more or less water, it depends on your sweet potato and flour). Wrap the dough up and rest it in the fridge for 1 to 2 days  (this allow the flour to absorb the liquid). Thaw knead the dough again before use.  (If dough is dry add some water, if wet add some flour)."},

When refrigerated, the wakame is preserved with sea salt and is partially dry so that it’s moist to the touch, but not dehydrated and brittle like nori sheets.Along with the increased popularity of both the raw food diet (also called living foods) and macrobiotic diets, wakame, has gained in popularity in the west.

Bake in preheated oven at 170 degrees C for 30 minutes.  Remove and cool on wire rack.  *  Notes - To prepare black glutinous rice flour-  Grind 100 gm black glutinous rice in grinder until fine.  Sieve, then grind a few times until you get really fine rice flour.  An Article  About  Black Glutinous Rice BelowBlack rice - revered in ancient China but overlooked in the West - could be the greatest 'superfoods', scientists revealed today. The cereal is low in sugar but packed with healthy fibre and plant compounds that combat heart disease and cancer, say experts.Scientists from Louisiana State University analysed samples of bran from black rice grown in the southern U.S. They found boosted levels of water-soluble anthocyanin antioxidants.Anthocyanins provide the dark colours of many fruits and vegetables, such as blueberries and red peppers. They are what makes black rice 'black'. Research suggests that the dark plant antioxidants, which mop up harmful molecules, can help protect arteries and prevent the DNA damage that leads to cancer. Food scientist Dr Zhimin Xu said: 'Just a spoonful of black rice bran contains more health promoting anthocyanin antioxidants than are found in a spoonful of blueberries, but with less sugar, and more fibre and vitamin E antioxidants.  'If berries are used to boost health, why not black rice and black rice bran? Especially, black rice bran would be a unique and economical material to increase consumption of health-promoting antioxidants.' Centuries ago black rice was known as 'Forbidden Rice' in ancient China because only nobles were allowed to eat it.  Today black rice is mainly used in Asia for food decoration, noodles, sushi and desserts. But food manufacturers could potentially use black rice bran or bran extracts to make breakfast cereals, beverages, cakes, biscuits and other foods healthier, said Dr Xu. When rice is processed, millers remove the outer layers of the grains to produce brown rice or more refined white rice - the kind most widely consumed in the West.   Brown rice is said to be more nutritious because it has higher levels of healthy vitamin E compounds and antioxidants. But according to Dr Xu's team, varieties of rice that are black or purple in colour are healthier still.   They added that black rice could also be used to provide healthier, natural colourants. Studies linked some artificial colourants to cancer and behavioural problems in children. The scientists presented their findings today at the 240th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston .  Victoria Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'In reality, it's unlikely there's a single food out there that will have a great impact on lowering your risk of heart disease. Healthy eating is about a balanced diet overall. 'It's great if you can eat more of some groups of healthy foods, like having five portions of fruit and vegetable a day, but there is still no conclusive evidence that 'super foods' alone make a real difference to your heart health.'I'm submitting this post to  World Bread Day 2012"},

{"title": "'Cake To Moon Over' by Chia Joo Suan", "date": "Wednesday, September 12, 2012", "text": "Mid-Autumn Festival is around the corner and I believe many people are making their own or heading to the popular or their favourite outlets for the attractive little 'cakes' of various shapes and variety of fillings.Here, I'm sharing a very informative article on mooncakes from a book 'What's in your food? written be a food chemist Chia Joo Suan for your general reading and food for thoughts.[Mooncake [a dessert] is known for its exotic taste, health giving properties and is very nourishing.  A closer analysis of the ingredients used in making the mooncake indicates the claims by our grandmothers were not far from the truth after all.Types of mooncakesThe special feature of mooncake is the thin pastry [about 1/2 cm thick] with lots of filling.  Traditional versions use various nuts, seeds and beans as fillings. The pastry is shaped in a wooden mould either round, square or other shapes.  There are words or decorative patterns on the surface of the cake to differentiate the type of fillings.Nutty filling - the main ingredients in the nutty mooncake are walnut, almond, melon, sesame and olive seeds.  These are bonded together with cooked glutinous rice powder flavoured with orange peels and glazed winter melon chips.Benefits of the nuts - studies reported that eating nuts regularly could significantly reduce the incidence of coronary artery disease.  Nuts contain a high content of unsaturated fatty acids [helps to reduce blood cholesterol level] and are low in saturated fatty acid.Walnuts - have a good ratio of omega-3 [noted for protection against heart disease] and omega-6 fatty acids  [shown to lower the level of the bad cholesterol - low density lipoprotein LDL].  Contains amino acid [phenylalanine] that functions as an antidepressant and helps improve memory and brain functions.  Deficiency of this amino acid could be the reason for slow growth, lethargy, liver problems and general weakness. Also contains amino acid [arginine] that stimulates growth hormones and improve immune system. Promotes muscle growth and wound healing.  Deficiency of this amino acid may cause hair loss.Almonds - contains amino acids [leucine and isoleucine] are required for energy and blood sugar regulation, growth and wound healing.  Thus resolving fatigue, depression and irritability problems.  The natural relaxant tryptophan helps to alleviate insomnia by inducing sleep and relieves anxiety.Generally, nuts and seeds contain many minerals and vitamins required for body functions.  Almond, walnut and sesame all have selenium.  Melon seeds contain cucurbocitrin that aids in lowering blood pressure and improve kidney functions.Sesame seeds contains serine, phosphorous and calcium - known to improve skin complexion, nourishes the brain and bone.  Tyrosine in sesame seeds aids in mood regulation, overcomes depression and improves memory and alertness.Red Beans - another favourite filling, help alleviate anaemia, build strong bones and relieve water retention in the feet.Lotus seeds - contain 4 times higher potassium than peanuts.  Potassium is responsible for the electrochemical balances of heart tissue and other muscles.  Helps to regulate heart functions and normalise blood pressure.  Also contains other minerals [phosphorous, iron and calcium] helps to maintain proper body functions.  Its B vitamins help calm the nervous system.Prelude to pastryThe dark colour of the mooncake pastry is due to lye water and syrup.  The alkaline water gives a soft and dark colour to the pastry and aids in longer shelf life.  Addition of lime juice [citric acid] in the syrup, giving the pastry better texture and aroma.  Commercial products may have propionic acid [a permitted preservative] in the pastry to prolong the shelf life.Loaded IntakeMooncakes are loaded with calories contributed by the nuts, sugar and oil.  Nutty mooncakes contain high amino acids nut excessive consumption of amino acids [esp. phenyalanine, leucine and isoleucine] may give rise to symptoms of energy imbalance, thus resulting in headaches, thirst or other uncomfortable feelings.]Notes: While nuts and seeds may be good  for the body, they are loaded with calories.  To benefit from eating nuts and seeds, take only about 25 gm or 3-4 tablespoons a day."},

Squeeze the meat slices a little as you mix in the marinade and leave for 1/2 hour or so, then add in the red rice wine residue. Mix well and refrigerate for several hours [best overnight or you can prepare it earlier, it's alright to freeze it for more days but must thaw before cooking]. Place meat slices on a single layer in a pan.

Sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds [forgotten to sprinkle sesame seeds - too eager to taste the char siew]. Pan-fry Method Heat a non-stick pan with a little oil and pan fry meat slices on low heat for 15 minutes on each side or until slightly crisps at the edges [use low heat to prevent burning of meat slices]. Dish out to serve [there is no gravy for this method]. Note:  For pan fry method, marinate meat with all the sugar in one go.I'm submitting this to Muhibbah Malaysia Monday hosted by  Suresh of 3 hungry tummies."},

Doctor says it's just tired muscles probably from exercise or some strenuous work...what is the remedy then...some painkillers and ointment to soothe the pain..and hope for the best [that's why not in the mood to do much cooking or baking].Then, met my sister in-law, she says she had the same problem before and her cure came from eating confinement dishes [that means lots of gingery and sesame oil stuff].  That time her sister in-law was in confinement and she finished the leftovers.... So where am I supposed to get the leftover confinement dishes???  No problem, I made a simple one myself and here is my ginger fried rice using only sesame oil.  Hopefully it can help to make me better otherwise must try other confinement dishes.. hehehe.  Here are some dishes which I have cooked before that uses lots of ginger and sesame oil ['Ang Chow' Chicken; Sesame Oil Ginger Chicken Soup; Fried Sesame Oil Ginger Chicken; Family Style Sesame Ginger Meatballs].Ginger is healthy and adds flavours to dishes, stimulates immune activity and helpful in treating colds and flu.

A cup of cooked white rice supplies dietary fibre equivalent to that of the juice of 3 oranges.low calorie meal - a meal with rice does not supply higher calorie than a meal without rice.  eg. high protein food comprising 2 pieces of chicken drumsticks supplies 600 calories, while a bowl of plain white rice has 205 calories and when served with a piece of chicken drumstick  provides a total of 505 calories [difference of 95 calories].  The difference will allow you to enjoy other food.rice is low in fat and free of cholesterol, supply energy for our daily activities and contains protein, minerals and vitamins.unpolished brown rice and parboiled rice are good sources of vitamin B1, B2 and B3 as well as iron, phosphorus, magnesium and selenium.I'm sharing this with Muhibbah Malaysian Monday hosted by Suresh of 3 hungry tummiesClick here for other Fried Rice Recipes"},

Ingredients[for 8 inch tube pan - best to use a slightly bigger pan]3 egg yolks (use large eggs)25 gm  caster sugar [I used 1 1/2 tbsp]40 ml vegetable oil [I used 3 tbsp]80 gm plain yoghurt [I used strawberry yoghurt]1 tsp lemon juice80 gm cake flour - sifted4 egg whites (use large eggs)55 gm caster sugar [I used 3 tbsp]60 gm dried strawberries - chopped small pieces [some cake flour for dusting]Method from Happy Home Baking Sieve flour and set aside. Chop dried strawberries into smaller pieces.  Coat with flour and sieve to remove excess flour. Set aside.Place egg yolks in a mixing bowl. With a manual hand whisk, whisk the  yolks a little. Add in sugar and whisk to combine. Add in vegetable oil gradually, whisk to combine. Add in yoghurt and lemon juice. Whisk to combine. Sieve over the flour and whisk till the flour is fully incorporated. Do not over mix. Set aside.In a clean, dry mixing bowl, beat egg whites with a handheld electric mixer on low speed until mixture becomes frothy and foamy.  Add half of the sugar amount and turn to high speed and beat the mixture. Continue to add in the remaining sugar and beat until the egg whites reaches the soft peak stage.The soft peak stage is reached when the peaks of the whites curl over and droop slightly. The egg whites should appear smooth and glossy. (Do not over beat the whites until stiff, it is better to beat the whites till soft peaks for easy folding with the yolk batter.)Add the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk batter in 3 separate additions, each time folding gently with a spatula until just blended.Add in the prepared dried strawberries. Fold in until just blended Do not over mix. Pour batter into a 17cm tube pan (do not grease the pan). Tap the pan lightly on a table top to get rid of any trapped air bubbles in the batter.Bake in pre-heated oven at 180 degrees C for 30 mins [lower rack], or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean, when lightly pressed the cake will spring back.

Apart from the LMK flavours, it also has the fragrance of the lotus leaf.  I should say it is Yum Yum [better than store bought].My first intention was to follow 3 different recipes shared by Sonia, [Nasi Lemak Lover], Ah Tze [Awayofmind] and Happy Flour [LMK].  On second thought, I think I can't handle 3 different recipes in one go, so I decided to use a recipe that I have which makes enough to give to my mum and her grandchildren.  To my dear friends, I will try each of yours when I am preparing less of it.Here are the ingredients and method.  I actually made 9 LMK with lotus leaf and 3 in bowls.Ingredients[makes 12 bundles]600 gm glutinous rice - washed and soaked in water for at least 4 hours or overnightSeasoning for glutinous rice [mix together in a big mixing bowl]1 tsp salt1/2 tsp each of sugar, Ajinomoto, pepper1 tsp dark soy sauce1 tbsp light soy sauce2 tsp sesame oil3 tbsp oilDrain glutinous rice and steam for 45 minutes or until rice is thoroughly cooked.  Remove and add to seasoning.  Mix seasoning and rice well.  Roughly divide into 12 equal portions.3 chicken thighs - deboned - each cut into 4 pieces12 small dried mushrooms -  soaked and keep whole2 Chinese sausages - skin removed and sliced slantly to get 12 pieces100 gm char siew - store bought [cut 12 slices]150 gm pork, cut into slices [I omit]Seasoning for meat and mushrooms1 tsp salt1 1/2 tsp sugar1/2 tsp Ajinomoto1/4 tsp pepper2 tsp light soy sauce1/2 tsp dark soy sauce1 tbsp each of oyster sauce, sesame oil, cooking oil2 tsp wine2 tbsp water2 tbsp cornflour1 stalk spring onion and a piece of ginger - lightly mashed [optional] Season chicken, pork and mushrooms with the seasoning for meat for at least an hour.3 pieces of lotus leafBlanched in hot water until soft.  Remove and rinse to clean.  Using a scissor, cut each leaf into 4 pieces.  Drain on colander to drip dry the leave.To Wrap LMK in lotus leafTake a piece of lotus leaf.  Place a piece of each ingredient about 2-3 inches from the edge of the broad side of the leaf.  Top up with 1 portion of the steamed glutinous rice.  Fold the leaf to cover the rice and wrap up like a parcel.  Tuck in the end to seal well.Place parcel on a steaming tray.  Do the same for the rest of the ingredients.Steam LMK over boiling water on high heat for 30-40 minutes.Serve hot.Steamed LMK in bowls The LMK rice is soft, QQ and taste is just nice.  The meat and mushrooms have the fragrant smell  and flavours of spring onions and ginger."},

{"title": "Sweet Leaf [Sayur Manis] Egg Soup", "date": "Monday, June 18, 2012", "text": "This leafy vegetable is known as 'sweet leaf', is a shrub grown in some tropical regions.   In Chinese it is called mani cai (马尼菜), in Malay it is called cekur manis or sayur manis.  It is one of the most popular leaf vegetables in South Asia and Southeast Asia and is notable for high yields and palatability.  Its multiple upright stems can reach 2.5 meters high and bear dark green oval leaves 5–6 cm long.  The flowers and small purplish fruits of the plant have also be eaten in Indonesia, the leaves of the plant are used to make infusion, believed to improve the flow of breast milk for breastfeeding mothers. It is a good source of vitamin K and also have high level of provita-min A carotenoids, especially in freshly picked leaves, as well as high levels of vitamins B and C, protein and minerals. The more mature leaves, the higher nutrient content of the leaves.   This is the vegetable that we use in ‘Pan Meen’.   In Vietnam, the locals cook it with crab meat, minced pork or dried shrimp to make soup. In Malaysia, it is commonly stir-fried with egg or dried anchovies.  My mum cook this in soup with either ikan bilis or dried prawns and an egg.  Sometimes, I stir fry it with sambal belacan dried prawns.  Its crunchy and has a bite.  Whichever way it is cooked it is full of fibre and green goodness.  Ingredients[serves 2-3]150 gm sweet leaf [mani cai] - separate leaves from stems - soak to wash leaves thorough and drain in colander**1 tbsp dried prawns - washed and lightly pounded1 tsp chopped shallots1 tsp chopped garlic600 ml water or 3 rice bowls1/2 - 1 tsp salt to taste1/4 tsp peppera dash of msg to taste1 eggHeat soup pot with a little oil to saute shallots, garlic and dried prawns until fragrant.  Add in water.Let it boil for 5-10 minutes until aromatic.    Add in the vegetable to cook through.  Break in an egg and lightly stir to mix.  Bring to a boil again and serve immediately.Notes I was told that the type of sweet leaf that taste better are the ones with slightly curly leaves.To separate the leaves from the stem, just hold the stem at one end and push down with your thumb and index finger.To wash the leaves, crushed them with both hands then soak in water.  Rinse several times and drain dry in a colander. Some people believed that diabetics should not take too much of this vegetable because it is 'sweet'. For more information on this vegetable, please refer to Fong's Kitchen Journal.

  With so many things prepared, the saddest thing is that none of her other children [my hubby's siblings] turned up for the prayers.    I think they must have forgotten the meaning of ancestral worship on such ocassions.  Some came later for dinner.  Myself, have been in the kitchen the day before to prepare the ingredients and cooking since 6 am in the morning on CNY eve and busy till late afternoon and again in the kitchen from 5.30 pm to get the steamboat ready for my hubby's siblings and families.  You must be wondering why I have to slave myself, my problem is I can't bare to see an old lady doing all these things for her grown up children.  It should be the other way round.  I would find it hard to sit down  and enjoy these food.There are still many, many more things to prepare such as Kwang Cheang, drinks and sweet dessert.  My MIL didn't manage to prepare the Kwang Cheang before the second day of CNY because of her knee problem.  I could not help her with this because my hands are tight with so much to handle single-handedly and of course she has her own recipe [different from mine].Don't forget the cleaning up of the kitchen, dining hall, living room and house compound when all have left late in the evening.  My legs are aching by then.  It is really very tiring and you can't even complain or make a comment.  You may be branded as 'calculative'.  Even a maid has the right to make face when overworked but not me.   My hubby wanted to comment on this when his siblings arrived but I stopped him because they may blamed the wife.   Best to do more and zip up the mouth.So what's the meaning of CNY for  me especially when my hubby and me do not have any children.  Just take it that we are doing charity work for people.Food for First day of CNY  Lunch -  Penang Prawn Noodle Soup [40 pax] , Chai Boey and reheat the CNY eve leftover dishes/soup.Dinner [30 pax] - Steamed Fish, Vegetarian Curry, Chai Boey and the CNY eve dishes etc.[managed to take pictures of only a few dishes - too busy with the serving].  Cooked according to my MIL's instructionLuckily for today, I did have 2-3 of my sisters in-law to help with the serving and washing.Food for Second day of CNY [no pictures taken - really busy with the food preparation and also have to visit my mother before lunch and has to rush back to cook dinner [35 pax].  The following were the food for the whole day.Braised Sea Cucumber with Roasted PorkChicken Soup with Straw/Button MushroomsStir Fry Boiled Chicken with Soy SauceStir Fry Beansprouts and Tau Mui Stir Fry Leafy Greens with Fish SauceSteamed Fish with Ginger/spring onions in soy sauceSpicy Sweet Sour Big PrawnsStir Fry Vegetarian Dish [Snow Peas, Mushrooms and vegetarian gluten balls etc]Stir Fry Vegetarian Mutton with Sesame Oil and shredded gingerSteamed Braised Duck with braising stock* The vegetarian dishes were prepared for one my hubby's  sibling [the couple are vegans]For 3 consecutive nights, I have to wait till almost midnight before I could clean up the hall after all the people has left otherwise I would not have the time to do it the next morning when there are more chores waiting to be done.  Imagine how can one enjoy this kind of CNY with lack of sleep/rest and especially when there is not even a word of appreciation from the people. But I felt happy because I have done something good for the CNY [this I have being doing yearly since I got married in the 1990s].

The cooking will go on for several days. Guess I just have to follow her orders to make things easier.  I will not be posting the recipes for the dishes that will be prepared because what ingredients used will depend on what my mother in-law has in her kitchen.  I would not have the time to take pictures of the ingredients and the dishes because I am cooking for several families and I have no say of what to cook.  It will be very stressful to cope with all these in one go and with the house full of people.Some of the CNY decorations in the Penang Heritage ZoneAnyway, I hope the CNY 2012 will be a good and happy year for all of us.

GOOD.Here is the recipe for the buns.  Makes about 24 buns, if you prefer a small quantity then just half theingredients, it is still okay.  I mix the starter dough and measured the rest of the ingredients and went back to sleep till 8.00 am.  By then the starter dough is ready for use.Ingredients - Starter Dough250 gm bread flour [I used 200 gm bread flour and 50 gm plain flour]3.25 tsp instant yeast dissolve in 200 ml warm waterAdd flour into the yeast mixture and mix into a sticky dough.

For more than a decade, I was always with him whenever he was in hospital for heart problem and other ailments.  This time, I happened to be away and I believed he wished for his other children to take care of him. He recovered from his skin problem and was about to be discharged but then he was suddenly coughing 2 days before discharge.  I arrived home late on Sunday 23, October 2011 night because my flight was delayed for 2 and 1/2 hours.  I went to hospital the next morning to take care of him and to show him all the photos I took while in Taiwan [please refer my other blog - Cooking Pleasure - Travel & Food].  I didn't have the chance to show them to him.  He was still alert when I arrived at the hospital and only said to me \"I thought I won't be able to see you again, you must come early morning tomorrow to take care of me\".  I saw tears flowing down his cheek.  I know this is bad omen.  I changed his pampers and cleaned his body.  Then, he had difficulty in breathing which we thought is asthma.  The nurses attended to him and later the doctors came.  After 20 minutes, the doctor told us my Pa's heart stopped beating and has passed away [due to massive haemoptysis] after they failed to rescue him.  He passed away very peacefully, eyes closed and mouth smiling like in deep sleep.  He was 82 years old.  My brothers and sisters were at his bedside. I am glad he waited for me and my husband to be back.  I always believed he will do that for me.  While I was away, my siblings and sisters in-law took care of him very well.  He ate the food he loves to eat during his stay in hospital. My Pa should be very happy that all his children cared for him and were at his bedside till his last moment in this world.My Dearest PapaNot only myself and my siblings  are glad to have him as our Pa but my Ma is also the luckiest lady to have him as a loving and caring husband for sixty [60] years.  Their marriage is through match making and yet it has lasted 6 decades.  Their marriage is a model marriage to us all as we remembered there has never been a time of misunderstanding all these years.  Even till the time before he left for the hospital, he had asked my nephews to look after my Ma.My Pa was not only a caring, loving husband and father, he was also a 'commendable' grandfather to all his grandchildren and a great elder to all that are related to him.  One who had cared for all that came to him for help and guidance.  He had brought up his 4 young siblings, 6 children and cared for his mother and wife for more than half a century since the age of 30 when my grandfather passed away at the age of 51.  My Pa was the sole bread winner of the family.  Imagined during his younger days as the eldest child, life was so difficult especially during and after the Japanese Occupation.  He had never ever complained and always forgive other peoples misdeed throughout his life.  He led a very simple life [without smoking, gambling, drinking] and took care of other peoples' needs before his.I thanked God for giving me a very GOOD father for more than half a century.  A father whom I would like to have for my next life and thereafter.  Long before, I have been using this song as my handphone's ringtone and here I dedicate this song to my dear Pa \"DANCE WITH MY FATHER\" by Luther Vandross.  May his soul rest in peace and the sweet memories be with us forever and ever.Dance With My Father [Mr Ong Kok Beng @ Ong Khit Thow]Back when I was a childBefore life removed all the innocence My Father would lift me highAnd dance with my mother and meAnd then spin me around till I fell asleepThen up the stairs he would carry meAnd I knew for sure I was lovedIf I could get another chanceAnother walk, another dance with himI'd play a song that would never ever endHow I'd love love loveTo Dance with my father againWhen I and my mother would disagreeTo get my way I would run from her to himHe'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah yeahThen finally make me do just what my mama saidLater that night when I was asleepHe left a dollar under my sheetNever dreamed that he would be gone from meIf I could steal one final glance, one final stepOne final dance with himI'd play a song that would never ever endCause I'd love love love to Dance with my father againSometimes I'd listen outside her doorAnd I'd hear how mama would cry for himI'd pray for her even more than meI'd pray for her even more than me I know I'm praying for much too muchBut could you send her the only man she lovedI know you don't do it usually, but dear LordShe's dying to Dance with my father againEvery night I fall asleep, and this is all I ever dream."},

Several of the temporary vegetarian food stalls along the road Vegetarian food outlet in the vicinity of the templeThere are numerous vegetarian recipes in my collection but most of the time, I cannot prepare all of them because there are too many for just the 9 days.   Usually, I will select the most preferred and add in some new recipes.  For this year, I will most probably be preparing the following dishes for my family and some friends who are on vegetarian diet.Here is a list of dishes which I will probably prepare for this year's festival.  I will avoid using the processed food [such as vegetarian chicken, squids, prawns, kidney, ham, sea cucumber and mutton] as ingredients for preparing these dishes.  I may add other recipes depending on the availability of the ingredients.

During the Phor Thor Festival, although prices do not vary vastly but sometimes to get a good piece is quite impossible.Two weeks ago a friend of mine bought a piece of roast pork at Ringgit 36 per kilogram but the piece of roast pork does not look appetising at all. When she asked the butcher why, she was told that 'Can help it, during festive time it is like that'. So this time around, I decided to roast a piece myself since I have a good and simple recipe [please refer to recipe posted on 16 May 2011].Here are the pictures for preparing roast pork.  I paid Ringgit 19.00 for this lot of pork.Marinade: 1-2 tsp salt, 2 tsp 5 spice powder and 1 tbsp cooking wine.  Some coarse salt for the skinScalded pork belly and marinating ingredientsRub marinade on the meat side only. Leave in fridge for 2 days before roasting. This is to dry the skin and to flavour the meatPut coarse salt on skin side and roast @ 250 C for 25 minutesAfter 25 minutes, remove salt, turn oven to top heat Roast pork on top rack  for 30 minutes or until skin is burntRemove from oven, scrape burnt skin with serrated knifeThe skin will be crispy after scraping the burnt partYou will hear the crackling sound when you chop the siew yokeNotes:If the skin is not crispy or burnt after 30 minutes, leave to roast for further 10 minutes.  Different oven may have different heating but with practice you will get a good piece of roast pork where the skin remains crispy the whole day.  Always put the skin side facing up before cutting.Definitely worthwhile to try it if you do not mind cleaning the oven after that."},

It is very important.Some people asked why I post such simple recipes like fried fish, omelette, tofu and stir fry vegetables in my blog.  No doubt, there are many wonderful, creative and experienced cooks everywhere but there are also many people especially the young ladies who would love to prepare some simple, fuss free dishes for their families but just do not know where and how to begin.  There are some who think that eating out is more economical than cooking at home for small families.  This is not so anymore all over the world with global food prices escalating.  At the moment, my intention is simply to make a record and to share these home-cooked food recipes which my Ma has been and is still preparing for her family [children, grandchildren and  relatives] at the age of 80.  For how long she can continue her duty that she loves to do, nobody knows.  But if she knows that in future her younger generations can still continue to prepare the food she is cooking for us now, it is definitely great consolation.   She is so happy, when I told her that she has an audience daily for her recipes all over the world.  The food she prepares may be simple, easy and inexpensive but it is a tremendous effort and of course it tastes  simply delicious because she cooks with love, care and concern for her loved ones who are either at work or in school.One thing for sure, there is always a table with food ready to be eaten when her children and grandchildren are back home either for lunch or dinner.

Boiling  ready soup [the bubbly foam is chilli oil]This is home-cooked version of Penang Prawn Mee [Hokkien Mee].  My family [my Ma] used to sell this noodle during the 70's till 80's.  We stopped selling this noodle and other 2 varieties Java Mee [see recipe here] and Lor Mee [see post] after my grandma passed away.It is not difficult to prepare and definitely worth trying even if you are in other countries so long as you can find the ingredients.  When I was in London for holidays in the 80's, I prepared this noodle for a Malaysian friend who missed it very much.  She could find all the ingredients required and we enjoyed the steaming hot noodles at home. It was Autumn time.  Her Italian husband and 2 children each enjoyed a big bowl of Prawn Noodle.Photos above showed quantity for about 30 bowlsIngredients  For the Stock[serves 4-5] 600 gm fresh prawns [best to use hard shelled prawns - either small or medium size]1.5 litres of prawn stock 3-4 tbsp finely ground chilli [add more for spiciness]2 tbsp rock sugar1 tsp msg to taste2 - 3 tsp salt to taste1/2 cup oil300 gm pork [any part or even 1/2 trotter] - wash and keep whole piece  Wash and shell prawns.  Set aside prawns in refrigerator. Put prawn shells in a sauce pot with some water.  Boil prawn shells thoroughly till cooked [see photo].  Off fire and leave to cool.Put boiled prawn shells and liquid into a blender to blend till almost fine.  Pour into another container and add more water.  Strain over a fine strainer to get about 1.5 litres prawn stock.  Keep stock in the sauce pot.   Discard the shells.Heat oil in wok to saute chilli paste. Add half portion of salt and rock sugar.  Fry till chilli oil surfaced.  Add in half portion of prawns [can keep the remaining for other dishes]. Continue frying till prawns are firm.  Pour in half of the prawn stock [if the wok used is big enough to hold all the prawn stock, then pour in all ].  Bring to a boil till prawns are cooked.Dish out the prawns from stock and set aside.  Off fire and scoop the stock back to the sauce pot.  Use the same wok, on low heat to fry the prawns till dry and firm.  Dish out to cool, then slice each prawn into a few slices to be served with noodles [see picture on sliced prawns]. Boil prawn stock again, add in meat.  Taste and adjust seasoning [salt, rock sugar and msg].  Continue boiling till meat is cooked.  Dish out meat and set aside to be served with noodles.  The noodle soup should smell very fragrant.  Off fire.  Before serving, the soup must be reheated till boiling for better taste.[See next post] for ingredients and on how to serve prawn noodles [Penang Hokkien Mee].Note:  Leftover soup can be refrigerated and use to serve with any other noodle soup [instant noodles or rice vermicelli - without other ingredients].

Ready soup with fish meat added.Assam Belai is a spicy, sourish sweet soup almost similar to the famous Penang Assam Laksa with fish [mackerel or sardine] as its main ingredient.  The cooking method is simple and ingredients not as much as Penang Assam Laksa as it can be a soup to be served with rice or rice vermicelli [thin rice noodles].  It is especially easy to cook this in Penang since we can get the chilli paste mix from the vendor in Penang wet market.   Just tell him how much fish you have and he will sell the quantity needed.  Alternatively, we can just blend our own chilli paste [paste consists of dried chillies, lemongrass, shallots, tumeric]  and shrimp paste [belacan].For this recipe, I bought ready mix chilli paste [RM 1.50] to cook 1 kg fish [ikan kembong].

When boiling, add in fish to cook, then remove fish and set aside to cool.  Meanwhile add in the remaining 1 litre water, daun kesum, lemongrass, wild ginger, tamarind slices and tamarind mix into sauce pot.  Continue boiling till soup is very fragrant.When fish is cooled, separate fish meat from bones.  Discard the bones.  Set aside fish meat.When soup is fragrant, remove all the boiled soup ingredients and discard.  Continue boiling soup and add in chilli paste with belacan.  The soup will turn into a very appetising soup [see photo].  Add in fish meat and seasoning to taste [should be spicy, sweet and sourish].Bring soup to a thorough boil for 5-10 minutes on high heat, then lower to medium heat to simmer for about 20 minutes.If thick soup with more fish meat is preferred than add less water or add more fish.  If eating with noodles, then you may need more soup.  Heat up to serve with rice and garnish with mint leaves for added flavour.NotesCan add other ingredients such as sliced big onions, chopped wild ginger flower, sliced pineapple, mint leaves and shredded lettuce if serving with noodles. If you have tried Penang Assam Laksa before then it is easy to check the taste of this soup.Can use this soup base to cook other fish [whole] such as mackerel, sardines and various species of stingray.No oil is needed to cook this dish."},

My Ma prefers this type of long beans [I think it is called snake beans] to the normal type which is thinner and straight, looks greener.  She says this type cooks faster, more tender and soft.

{"title": "Crispy Roast Pork Belly [Siew Yoke] - 脆皮燒肉", "date": "Monday, May 16, 2011", "text": "Roast pork or siew yoke is getting expensive these days. In Penang the prices ranges from RM 40.00 to more per kilogram depending on where you purchase them. I searched through some of the food blogs and I was happy to come across a recipe from Reesekitchen which is quite simple for a first timer like me. I gave it a try and it turn out as above. Since I am using a small oven, I have to cut up the piece of pork belly [1 kg] into 3 pieces. The result was encouraging.I can't remember whether I followed exactly the recipe but below are the ingredients and method that I have written down.Ingredients1 kg pork belly [the flatter part]1-2 tsp salt1 tbsp Chinese cooking wine2 tsp 5 spice powdera few cloves garlic - smashed200 gm coarse salt - for the skin when roasting Wash pork belly pieces. Scald in hot water for 1-2 minutes. Clean and pat dry. Pierce the skin all over [I used a BBQ skewer]. Turn over and make a few slits across the meat lengthwise. Mix together salt, Chinese wine, 5 spice powder and garlic. Rub mixture all over the meat side. Do Not marinate the skin side. Once the meat side is evenly rub with marinade, place on a flat plate, meat side down and skin side up. Leave meat to marinate in fridge for 1-2 days uncovered. This is to dry the skin and get the meat well marinated. To roast pork, preheat oven at 250 degrees C for 10 minutes. Bring meat to room temperature. Place meat pieces [skin side up] on roasting rack on top of a foil covered baking tray. This is to collect the oil drippings and for easier cleaning after roasting. Cover skin evenly and fully with coarse salt.Place roasting tray in the middle level of oven to ensure even roasting. Roast for 25 - 30 minutes. Remove meat from oven and discard the salt from the skin. Return meat to oven but put on the top level to roast for a further 25 - 30 minutes [can alter heat to top only].In between roast, it is okay to open the oven and dab oil from skin. Continue roasting till the skin is slightly burnt. This is to get a crispier skin.Remove meat from oven and scrap off the burnt skin with a serrated knife. Above photo showed the burnt skin already scraped off. Leave to cool for 10 - 15 minutes before slicing to serve."},

Leave to proof till double in size [about 30 minutes].  Before steaming, brush dough with rose colour water.Heat enough water on high heat in wok.  When water is boiling, put steamer [I use 2 x 14\" bamboo steamer] over the water and steamed for 20 minutes [see above photo].Off heat and leave steamed buns in steamer [covered] for about 3 minutes before uncovering to remove buns to cool on rack.  The purpose is to get a smooth skin bun.  If using other steamers be careful of water vapour that may drop onto the buns.Notes:Can substitute warm water with fresh coconut water, the buns will be even more fragrantBuns can be eaten fresh after steaming or sliced and spread with butter or to wrap roasted pork [siew yoke] or braised soy sauce pork belly.Can leave the bun skin plain if not for praying purpose."},

{"title": "Chinese New Year 2011", "date": "Saturday, February 5, 2011", "text": "Today is 3rd day of CNY.  It has been for more than a decade that the 3rd day of CNY is the first day of CNY that I can really relax and enjoy the new year holidays. Days before CNY and 1st and 2nd day are always the busiest days which I sometimes wonder why must I stressed myself out with CNY preparations, baking, washing and cooking.  This is all because I have to be a responsible daughter and daughter in-law to my parents and parent in-laws. I have to bake CNY cookies for both families. I have to cook for my in-laws for ancestral praying and also prepare lunch/dinner for visiting families [about 5-6 families] for 2 days.  Luckily,  some sis-in-laws help out with the washing after the meals otherwise I would look more like a maid. This year was no exception with more responsibilities because my mum in-law couldn't walk cos' of a crack pelvic bone since the eve of New Year 2011.Anyway, I managed to bake these cookies - Peanut cookies, butter cookies, cranberry & oatmeal cookies, choc-chip & raisin cookies, floss & sesame cookies, kuih bangkit [helped by my hubby] and ribbon biscuits.  Actually planned to bake more varieties [smaller quantity] but couldn't because of the above constraint.For ancestral praying on eve of CNY, I prepared the following dishes - Too Thor Th'ng, Lor Bak, Black Vinegar Trotter, Nasi Kunyit Chicken Curry, Jiu Hoo Char, Fried Yellow Noodles, Fried Fish and Pak Cham Kai [boiled chicken] and rice.  You may wonder why I prepared so many varieties but this is my mum in-law's 'style'. For years, I have also to prepare steamboat for dinner [for 3 families] after ancestral praying but this year I do not want to over stress myself, I told my 'MIL' I can only prepare steamboat for lunch on 1st day of CNY [for about 6-7 families].Then is cooking dinner for about 25 people. Dinner I cooked - Mixed Vegetable Soup [left over ingredients from steamboat], Fried Fish Fillet with 3 Flavoured Sauce, Vegetable Curry and  salad [one of my hubby's sibling's family is vegetarian], Stir fry Assorted Meat [Chicken, Roasted Duck and Pork] with soy sauce.On 2nd day of CNY, because I have to visit my parents, I prepared  Vegetarian Tom Yam Beehoon and Fried Rice with Sausages and Eggs for lunch again these are for hubby's visiting siblings and families.  By late afternoon, I have to rush home again to prepare dinner for the same number of people. For dinner, I cooked - Spicy, Sweet & Sour Big Prawns, Chicken with Corn/Chayote  Soup, Stir fry vegetarian cauliflower/broccolli, Stir fry Beancurd with Leek, Steamed Teochew Style Fish Head and Lor Bak [balanced from CNY eve] just reheat in oven toaster.You may be wondering why I have to do all these stuff - this is my MIL's style.  Luckily, my hubby helped during the cooking and the later clean up after the people left later in the night.  For your info, I have no children, so it is worth all the trouble?  The main factor is because we have to abide to my 'MIL's style in ushering the CNY and other ladies in the family claims that they can't cook. Best part is we have to leave our own house a few days to do all this at her house.Lucky thing is my hubby announced eating out today, otherwise these duties will carry on until the holidays are over.  So what is CNY to me? Our priorities are not my hubby or myself but basically is to be a responsible son and daughter in-law and not to offend the 'MIL'.  Saddest thing - none who ate in the house said a simple 'thank you for the food and trouble'.Sorry, no photos of the food and cookies taken because of the huge crowd in the house and I am stressed out.  Maybe in future when my priorities change, I will post the pictures and share the recipes."},
