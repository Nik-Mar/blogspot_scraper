{"title": "How I store my produce (HI Barb) and use it", "date": "Thursday, January 4, 2024", "text": "First on storage...I use Bluapple classic and Bluapple Fresh mats. Have now for maybe 3 yrs. Works good when I have a frig full of produce coming in from gardens and need extra time to process it. I like the mats as I can wash and dry them. I can buy refills for the classic. I am now going to try Bluapple veggie zips (also reusable) for my lettuce and mushrooms. Hubby said he likes the mats because if something does start going bad, the mat keeps it contained and can be washed, like the cucumber that got under a bag of lettuce.I couldn't figure out where the lettuce came from (he got it from Amish).Some of my standard practices of keep produce longer I learned in culinary classes.Mushrooms get brushed off gently and put in brown paper lunch bags and closed.DO not leave them in closed plastic as they will get slimy.Greens, all greens are wrapped in white kitchen cotton dish towel(yes those big thin white cotton towels your grandma or great grandma used) or paper towels then in plastic bag. I also wrap my homemade bread in a white kitchen cotton dish towel before I put it in the bread box.  Amish wrap their lettuce (head lettuce only. I haven't seem one grow leaf lettuce for their family) in newspaper and put in spring house (around 37-38° which is like our frig). N's wife E wraps their Chinese cabbage in newspaper also for the spring house. Said she has had it last at least 2 months that way unless N eats it. He likes to snack on it while working.  I have done this with green onions also and then in a plastic bag not sealed. Celery is wrapped in foil.I keep apples, bananas and avocados separate from greens as they give off gases that will mess greens up.ALWAYS remove rubber bands from produce. Remove leafy tops from root veggies (toss radish tops in your salad and cook up the beet, turnip etc tops.). I try to keep a damp cloth over them and in the bottom of frig where it is the coldest.I freeze my ginger. I keep my potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions (not with potatoes) and garlic in basement which is cool . Garlic is in mesh bag hanging. Onions are in panty hose hanging (*yes it works). Potatoes and sweet potatoes are in milk crates (not on concrete floor) covered to keep out of light. Keeping that stuff in frig makes it turn to starch. I just spend a day once a month making sure I go through the potatoes to use what is going to sprouts first and breaking  sprouts off. The biggest tip is what to eat firstAny greens I have are ate within 7-10 days and that is pushing the limit. Kale, collards and mustards hold longer than lettuce and spinach. Head lettuce hold longer than leaf lettuce or precut lettuce. I have had ice berg lettuce wrapped in newspaper for 2 wks. Just pulled the outer leaves off . Cucumbers are in this group also.Tomatoes NEVER go in the frig. About 2 wks on the counter with the side of where the vine was DOWN. We usually eat them before 2 wks. But I tested it for Daughter 2.I put a paper towel under the tomatoes.Bell peppers last about 3 wks on the fresh mats. I take them out of the plastic bags.Turnips, parsnips. rutabagas, radishes and beets are loose in crisper drawer.I had a root cellar at the old farm rental that I could hang my cabbage and Brussels sprouts by the root. I don't have that here but have a friend say they did Brussels sprouts that way in their unheated garage. They just moved the cars outside until they had it ate since they didn't think they should start the car in the garage with it. Amish hang theirs in the barns or equipment sheds. I might try the barn this coming year.Broccoli needs to be dry and not wrapped tight, stored in bottom of frig. I don't put it in the drawer as it needs room. The same with cauliflower. I will make sure both are dry but keep loosely wrapped. Turn cauliflower root side up to help it last longer. I've had it 3- 4 wks in the frig. I've wrapped cabbage including cut cabbage with Press and Seal and kept it for at least a month(usually 3-4 months) in the frig.Brussels sprouts will hold about a month.  SOOOOO I focus on leafy greens and tomatoes first. Peas, snow peas and green beans in season.Then bell peppers, mushrooms, head lettuce and shredded carrots, summer squash if during season.Then broccoli and cauliflower, root veggies like beets, radishes. Then cabbage, Brussels sprouts, carrots and celery. Winter squash in season. My onions will store up to 3 to 4 months usually. Usually I run out before any really go bad. When I get down to 1 bunch of celery and an open bag of carrots I know I need to make a produce run. We only do bananas and oranges for fresh fruit. I store OUR apples in frig deli drawer.If I buy pineapples, I put cut it up and put in freezer. We eat berries in season (I have strawberries, blackberries, black raspberries, red raspberries, honey raspberries and am now am growing blueberries again) I can peaches (order bulk through Amish). We grow grapes (freeze what we don't eat) and rhubarb (can what we don't eat as pie filling)."},
{"title": "We need rain, went to store and chosing greenhouse to buy", "date": "Wednesday, January 3, 2024", "text": "Where the brown grass is to green grass is where the top of pond usually is. The pallets are usually under water for the fish to hide in. WE NEED RAIN for ponds and cisterns  AND SNOW for the deep wells.I have researched greenhouses and am strongly looking at a canopia by Palram (Amazon, Tractor supply and Lowes sell them) I need to decide on size so I know how much a floor will cost me. Amish just use vinyl weed barrier. So I might go that way as I can get that from Amish greenhouse down the road. I went to the store... we were almost out of fresh veggies and cereal. I buy cereal as we are not big bread eaters. I need folic acid...my folic acid dropped, caused my potassium to drop and it was not a pretty picture. I actually debated on pulling the cereal costs out of the medical budget since that's the only reason I buy it. I would rather eat my meds than pop a pill.ANYWAYS. I stayed close to budget. I do think I set the budget too low for this time of year but it will average out for the year... Right? I get the green house up and going and next winter I might not have to buy all the fresh veggies.I bought some meat that was on sale and I have coupons for. I am low of beef crumbles, sloppy joes and taco meat. I got a chuck roast on sale and then marked down. I will be making beef stew and beef and noodles with it. I got light and fluffy extra wide noodles for tuna noodle.I got a free birthday cake from Krogers as it's my birthday month.Hubby thought it was funny Kroger's knows my birthday is this month but his entire family that makes a big to do about birthdays never remember mine even though it's the same day as his dad's. My parents was the same way, my brother never remembers either. It used to hurt, now it just doesn't matter. Hubby remembers and so does the kids. The menu changed as Hubby wants to use the new deep fryer. I put the hamburger pie in the freezer. Will fix the chicken that is now thawed as sweet and sour chicken with rice and stir fry some veggies with it. So we can do some deep frying this weekend. I want to make kofta. I saw the recipe in Milkstreet magizine and it looked interesting. Hubby likes to try different foods from other countries.I got broccoli and cauliflower for broccoli,cauliflower salad, veggie plate, California blend (I have carrots),in some salads and stir fries.I got red cabbage and green cabbage for salads, coleslaw and frying.I got celery as I do celery, carrots and onions as mirepoixI got 3 bags of mixed salad and 2 containers of mixed greens. That will last a week to 10 days then it will be canned cole slaw, raw carrot salad etc..I can do a cold veggie pizza with ranch dressing.I got cucumbers to slice in salads, to dice up and mix with cream cheese for sliders.I got shredded carrots (because I am lazy) for sunshine salad, leaf salads and sauces. I got mushrooms and bell peppers (NOT GREEN as I can't eat those, actually green bell peppers are not ripe that is why they are green). I do a lot of bell pepper, mushrooms and onions. Am going to start adding a bit of ginger (now in freezer) and garlic to it for health.I got avocados for salads and guac (I got tomatoes on the vine and cherry tomatoes. We snack on cherry tomatoes). I got kale as I know autumn stew is on the menu this month at least once and I can put the kale in salads or dehydrate it for kale chips. We know we will have to go get milk two more times this month but that is all we should need.Prayers for peaceBlessed be"},
{"title": "PANTRY CHALLENGE ", "date": "Monday, January 1, 2024", "text": "We are doing a pantry challenge for January.  I took care of the leftover prime rib, bagged 6 meals from it for the freezer.I took care of the leftover ham, bagged 8 meals from it for the freezer.I did mention to Hubby that eating from the pantry shouldn't include me shoving more into the pantry with leftovers. I have to deal with the leftover pork shoulder roast today after supper.I found some artichoke spinach dip in the freezer so I can serve that as the \"greens\" to Hubby while I have canned spinach for my greens today. We have the leftover pork shoulder roast, a little bit of leftover kraut and leftover mashed potatoes and leftover apple crisp .I pulled a can of black eye peas for today also.Tomorrow we have chiro and grocery store. So I am putting two individual hamburger pies (I use sloppy joe, corn and and use the leftover mashed potatoes) that we can put in the air fryer or microwave when we get home.I will have chicken on Wednesday. Thighs for Hubby and breast for me. Not sure on sides yet. Depends on what needs used up.I have twiced baked potatoes in the freezer. Maybe asparagus or peas. Canned peaches???Thursday is taco bowls, tortilla chips and salsa.Friday one pot green beans, potatoes and ham with White Lily cornbread.Saturday is Aunt Dolly's casserole, cooked hamburger crumbles, a layer of sliced potatoes with cream of mushroom (or cheddar) soup for the sauce. Served with a salad.Sunday is pasta e fagoli  and garlic Texas toast.I reminded Hubby Lent starts Feb 14th. We do fish on Fridays (his faith) during that time. I just picked up some battered fish for the freezer and I have canned tuna, mackeral and salmon. I will pick up some light and fluffy wide noodles for tuna noodle. It's the only time I don't want homemade noodles LOL. I might make some tuna fish salad for myself. I know of at least one Friday we will go to the one restuarant for the fish buffet."},
{"title": "Goals for 2024", "date": "Sunday, December 31, 2023", "text": "I plan to try to keep up with the Amish instead of the Jones. SNICKERING. WHY? Because Hubby is worried he will die from heart issues and I will struggle to pay the house off.  I already set the budget on what would be coming in if he died since I have already been a widow and dealt with that but also the widow on the other side of E, had to give up her own car (had payment) and the house phone due to her hubby's death. She hates his car but it was paid for. She can't even go to church or the food pantry to work daily as she did.GOALS:Make extra monthly payments on mortgage. Add another 3 months of emergency savings (would bring us up to 6 months)Have a regular mending day instead of the basket is over flowing day.Frame a couple of the puzzles Hubby is putting together and hang them.Eat healthier. More at home and homemade instead of take out.Finish the 15 projects we have listed as most of the materials are here.I have lost 30 lbs. with being ill. I will be doing a lot of sewing to adjust what clothes I have to have clothes fit as I do not plan to gain all of it back.Gardens...I would like a small green house Tall enough for me to WALK in but not huge. N who we bought the house from said to get a green house over a high tunnel or we would be replacing the cover every other year. His mother backed that unless I was going to make it 8 ft by 8 ft by 8 ft, then the high tunnel would be fine but I would need a darkening cloth to put over it during summer or the plants would burn. I need new strawberries to start 6 new beds. Mine got the blight.I need to replace 1 elderberry bush, 2 roses and 3 peonies. I want to add sunflowers, tulips and daffodils and move the tiger lilies from the pot to either by the house or along the fence line. I need to move the daylilies out of the mint patch..I plan to grow my own sweet potato slips. Mrs. Mast gave me two sweet potatoes when she heard I was going to grow my own slips. Said they were the perfect size. About the size of my hand. She didn't want anything for them. I think it's because when her dad broke his leg, Hubby was the one that went and got the horses from the woods and trailered them home.  I plan to start my own tomato, bell pepper, Brussel sprouts and cabbage plants. I might add broccoli to that.I plan to extend the harvest from early spring to late fall or even Jan with January king cabbage.I want a better routine for cleaning the home, a day for baking and the mending.Daughter 2 gave me her routine and it's based on what day trash is collected. So she adjusted it for my trash day. The only issues is she has 1/3rd of the home I do and it takes her 2 days PLUS she mops (OCD) her wood floors twice a week. I am not mopping my wood floors, 2/3rd of house are wood floors, twice a week LOL. I am not sure I want to spend 6 days a week either. BUT then I do NOT have OCD. I have two that it was nothing to find them on their hands and knees with a toothbrush scrubbing the baseboards. I want to only do one major shopping a month with quick run for milk two weeks later. I also want to start buying our meat from the butcher shop as I am tired of the recalls. I would rather pay a higher price, support local farmers and the local owner and know that if there is a \"recall\" I will get a phone call  instead of wondering if the meat I repackaged for the freezer is in that recall. Instead of  NO SPEND Jan. I will do a low spend Jan. Prayer for peaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Ending the year ramble", "date": "Thursday, December 28, 2023", "text": "Even though it was almost 60 outside, we kept the wood stove going instead of letting it go out and turning on the furnace. I would like to not have to order propane before Feb.  I used up 2 large pots (#25 ball and root pots) of scraps from the Sawmill for the stove. Most just toss the pieces, some as small as 1 inch wide by 1inch. I use the stove shovel and shovel that stuff in. Usually will burn for 30 minutes to an hour depending on what gets shoveled in with it. End cuts off pallets goes in that mixture also.A couple of gentlemen around the block (ha ha as the block is about 5 miles) that has sold us some wood offered us the scraps they can't cut to sell so we took the wagon over at the beginning of Dec. The one called last night, their dad who lives out of state had emergency heart surgery. They are taking turns of who is going to take care of him and they were going to try to finish cutting wood. We offered for them to just put what ever they had not cut  and what ever they had cut sitting there , to load up we would buy that also. Gives us wood for next year at this year's price PLUS clears out their yard incase they don't go back to cutting wood for a longer time than they are planning. Hubby offered to bring our tractor and help them load. We also have a load up at 309 sawmill that they want him to get at no cost to us. Just pieces that won't cut the right size for the lumber they are cutting and no one wants it.We contacted the kids about dropping off Christmas today after Hubby's medical appt. Now even the boys have the crud. One granddaughter is taking delivery for two other families. Said she would have her husband deliver them as he is wearing mask and gloves when at work anyways. I can put it on the porch and she will come out and get it when I go back off the porch. She will Lysol it LOL. Keeps me from being around it Son 2 told me to tap on the door and then put it in the garage. Covid came back negative but he thinks it's a false negative as he has had covid before, flu test came back negative also but he is definitely sick. I told him the unnamed virus is like that and there is no test or treatment at this time for it. Daughter 2 is iffy. She thinks she is okay but for me to text her before stopping. She might get called in to work as others are getting it. Since there are several birthdays coming up, I am dropping those off also. We don't need milk so no stopping at the store. AND we have already planned eating out for today. I thought dog tags were due this month, they are due next month so I moved that to Jan. I will be buying the 3 yr tags. Charlotte is 6 so probably won't buy more for her unless she is like Wilbur and Rascal that both lived until 12/13 yrs old.E gave us 5 gallons of mineral oil for lamps for the running we did when M had Susie. That saved us $25. Should get us through the rest of winter. We sure did not use 5 gallons of fuel in the truck to go get her one mile away.  We get 17 mpg in truck.E told us he paid the hired girl (niece that is 16) $60 for coming over to help with baking as his two older girls couldn't handle it with trying to take care of the younger kids while M is down from having Susie. I asked what the boys were doing? As usually the boys handle the younger ones while the girls are in kitchen. They were in field picking feed corn and he was in the barn with a mare delivering. GEEZE. Did say the niece went to making the pies while the bread dough was raising, something the M had stopped doing and admitted she needed to get back to that timing. They baked 36 loaves of bread, 4 sheet cakes (about 17 inches by 12 inches) and 24 pies in one day as they would not be baking until the following Wednesday after Christmas. I am quite sure all three stoves were being used. I also told him to say something as I could have baked the cakes. He admitted the M told him that after he had already sent for the niece. I scheduled our chiro for the 2nd so I can pit stopped at Kroger's and use my Fresh Mode credit that expires the next day.I refilled our vitamins from my stock, checked to see what the price was now. Price had went up 3%. We had some Christmas decorations die, I found replacements on clearance and ordered them using my Pinecone research credits to pay for them at Amazon.I gathered our tax stuff, the only thing left is Hubby's business he closed and he said he has most of it. The bank said if he had issues getting some statements to down load to come in and they would just print them off for free for him. I can see him just going to go get them.I need to finish putting Christmas away and deal with some extra food into the freezers. Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},

Hubby had not burned them yet. Charlotte barked at them, they looked at her like they were waiting for her to come join them. Was not happy when I put the flash light on them... decided to go over and eat E's corn stubble instead and then back across the road to eat what is left of the bean field. Have 4 of kids' families down with flu and upper respiratory crap and one has covid also. Was warned to stay away over Christmas. Right now the only ones not sick are the sons.Hubby wanted to know what we saved in Dec. Over $429. and then I decided to NOT go to the grocery store even though I have coupons expiring for things we WOULD eat.... we have plenty without it so if NOT spending it in the first place (would have had to spent $85.64 to save $14.05 about 15% savings) then add the $85.64 to what is saved. I told him after New Year's I would go down to the butcher shop and get ground beef. It's local meat only so helps our farmers. It is the only meat I need and it's not a I am out  of it and I know we have prime rib today and tomorrow I will bake the ham. Plenty of leftovers for the week. He is still deciding between ribs, pork butt, pork tenderloin or pork chops for New Year's eve and New Year's day. I figure he will go on the lighter side. I have canned pork (I canned it) that I could just add to kraut, add mashed potatoes, have greens and blackeyes peas the next day and call it done. M and E had their baby, Susie *named after 2 aunts and 2 cousins* was born the 23rd at 10:06 pm. She is the 11th child, 6 boys and she makes 5 girls. Her mother in law was midwife. M was thankful Hubby went over to bring her home so she wasn't out in a rough buggy ride or having the baby in the cold rain with wind that came in that morning. Plus he got to hold the baby while E helped her in the truck. Came home bragging he got to hold her before me.Hubby got a bill from medical office. Was flipping out (lovely dementia) that he had his deductible met, gave them his medigap coverage info blah blah blah ... took me twenty minutes of saying CO PAY not deductible was due to finally click what the bill actually was (we had co pay and deductible with his old ins from employer). Then he came back and told me he couldn't remember his username or password for his bank acct to pay the bill. Number one, I really don't want him messing with finances with his dementia flaring... HA HA and number two, this man has not paid the medical bills in over 25 years. I just told him to show me the email he got. I pointed out it was not due until Jan 15th so I would take care of it when I paid the rest of the bills and we would talk to the bank about him forgetting his username and password (I have them but it calmed him down as he knew the bank was closed). I have noticed since it is really dark (it didn't get light until almost 8:30 yesterday morning due to rain coming in, even E mentioned it as they are burning more lamp oil than usual) and it's dark at 4:30 pm, his dementia is flaring more than it usually does. I started turning on lights at his desk where he sits most evenings while he watches the news, checks his computer and does sudoku. He seems to have calmed down. I also am making sure we stay as close to routine as possible as I know that can flare things up.  We stuck pretty close to the menu for the week. I don't know if the routine of what we eat during holidays kept that part stable or the fact I wasn't trying to put a lot of food on the table since it is just the two of us and neither of us is eating a lot at one time. He has already asked what we are doing with the leftover prime rib, that depends on how much walks out the door with Son 1, he did laugh when I reminded him of that. I did mention Philly cheese steak subs and or pizza which both are favorites of his. He then asked about the ham, he would like some fried potatoes, beans and ham and corn bread. That is doable also. We already know we will be eating out on the 28th, between medical appt for him and dropping off Christmas and Bday to the kids we won't be home until closer to 7 pm. We can go eat after appt while waiting for kids to get home from work since we will be about 30 minutes from them. Kids are passing the stuff on down to the grandkids as trying to get everyone  together is impossible any more. Round up this morning as all the kids was up at 3:30 (even single sons). All the girls and their kids have some sort of icky and the Sons do not have anything at this time. SIGH. Take care of yourselves. There are ickies out  there LOLMerry Christmas PS I miss the snow, we didn't get any snow... an inch would have been nice. Doesn't seem like Christmas without snow. I live in the north for a reason, SNOW for this season LOL"},

We haven't had that in a long time and it's been a constant worry. AND I made the extra payment on the mortgage.We only bought a gallon of milk and a large loaf of bread. We have been cutting and stacking wood and grilled cheese sandwiches replaced pizza. Cheaper and I wasn't stopping to bake bread.I picked up the two prime rib roasts I ordered. Cut one into steaks to vacuum seal for later. Had some \"scraps\" left so cut them up for Philly steak subs or pizza or stir fry. Simmered the fat scraps for broth and froze that.I have cranberry jello coming in. I buy enough for the year usually. This time I bought for 2 yrs.  I have MIL's purse coming in. She asked for a purse like mine for Christmas except not in purple. Decided on gray. There was two shades of gray. I ordered both so she can chose which one she wants. I can put the other back for later for either of us.We are going to Menards for the 12% rebate sale. We have on the list as we have been waiting for next year as we try not to shop there unless 11 % rebate is going on. On the list is 3 storm door pumps(what hold door open/closed), two have quit working completely and I know the 3rd one is the same age.  Aircare humidifier filters, for front room humidifier. I have the Amazon price so it has to be lower than that. Paint for bottom step of loft so I quit missing the blasted thing, even with the light on it blends into the kitchen floor. I am going to paint a strip at edge of it so I know it's the last stair. I need 10 food grade buckets with gamma lids (I saved rebates for this purchase) I have enough rebates to get 12 so Hubby said to do that. He could see me dehydrating more apples next year than I did this year due to lack of room. We decided to not keep the Christmas lights on until Jan 6th like we normally do but unplug them after Christmas to help keep the electric bill down. We will be talking of goals for this coming year during the week. Blessed Beprayers for peace"},
{"title": "I think you can get the ickies through texts and phone calls (not really but still)", "date": "Tuesday, December 19, 2023", "text": "Daughter 1 had to cancel back surgery. She has covid.Daughter 2 has the virus going around (unnamed and they are giving meltable puke med and steroids for it)on top of her hot flashes and night sweats.Son 1 has a nasty cold, only a cold as he went to the doctor for it before it became a sinus infection (his go to icky yearly).Son 2 caught a head cold and then the virus and then food poisoning (again). I told him to quit eating out. Daughter 3 got a head cold that went into a sinus infection that triggered her migraines.Daughter 4 got the virus, passed out and hit her head so now has a concussion on top of it. THEN got noticed that her landlord was sued by city for not fixing the spouting and a couple other things(like furnace) that she offered to fix if he would let her take it off her rent... Now it's they are going to condemn the house if he doesn't fix it. She has 6 rescue dogs that are parents and children, 3 have serious medical issues from being abused and eating dry wall to stay alive, trying to find a place it going to be hard because she is sure he is NOT going to fix it. She tried to buy it from him 2 yrs ago when her job was steady. ( She did not listen when we told her to buy something else as the house is perfect for her just needs upkeep) She needs 4 more months at where she is to qualify for a mortgage.  She has been splitting household bills and gas with her son who is an adult but moved in with her when he lost hours at work. He is working full time, her hours float. He was bragging he got his car payments caught up and paid ahead... he forgot to keep gas money until the next pay check and it was his turn to do that and since he didn't say something before paying ahead, Daughter 4 spent her  money of fuel for heat. They use kerosene as the furnace died two years ago. I lent HIM the money and I am charging him the interest I am losing on the money and gave him 2 months to pay me back. Bet he doesn't do that again as he hates paying interest especially to old people as he called me to his other grandmother who is 5 yrs older than me. I would have loved to hear that blast he got from her LOL.THEN I got sick... I pretty sure they gave it to me through texts and phone calls as I have not been around any of them. LOL.I thought covid or RSV as the widow on the south side of us had been over and then came down with RSV and her daughter has covid. Nope. I got the virus with no name.Since I could not keep my heart meds down, Doc gave me meltable Zofran and prednisone. IF that doesn't kick it down, it is definitely in the hospital since he is not willing for me to spend the winter sick. Spinach is one of my go to when I am sick but that is on recall here. There was no ginger at the store but I found ginger tea another go to for me. I also put ginger and ginger tea on my stock list. I need horseradish. Ours died this year. I didn't think to find someone growing it. I know if I eat it regularly I don't get head colds and that seems to be going around also. I took the Zofran, it tastes like crap for such a little pill. It definitely kicked down the throwing up, not even nausea, that was great... being awake because of the prednisone was not. I forgot it did that, probably was good for Hubby as I fed the stove. Doesn't matter where you are in this house, you will hear the stove being fed.  I will take that at lunch time so I get the \"stay awake\" done during the day. I went back over our budget...forgot to include school taxes and tax preparer.Hubby wants 4 eat out/or take out meals a month. I told him I would see, it would be coming out of grocery money (that is usually where I take it anyways). He offered to pay for it out of his spending money that he earns doing odd jobs about twice a month that comes under hobby on taxes. He still keeps track of it as if it was business. You never know when the IRS is going to change something. I am looking at CD's for savings. I like Ally's no penalty CD's for the might need before 11 months. Then I float between the others. I put the medical deductible and out of pocket in the money market. We have to pay by check for the dentist and our primary. Neither one accepts credit cards. For what we pay with credit card, I just transfer that amount to our joint checking when the bill comes in. It's nice to earn some interest on it.Hubby will now get a RRA to help pay medical since he is on Medicare. I told him that when that comes in to cover a bill , its getting divided between mortgage and savings as we didn't count on it as the company was looking at ending it. He saved 85 ¢ per gallon on diesel last night at Kroger's. I told him that savings goes in to mortgage and savings. I loved the look of WHAT on his face. We were going to go to chiro this morning, canceled because of me being sick, we were also going to the store for things we need, he might go to Walmart here (Kroger's closed) as I know Save A Lot does not carry it. Plus he has to go pick up the prime rib this afternoon. I will put the money we would have paid to chiro in savings for mortgage and savings since we won't go until Jan now.E is going to put his horses in our pasture he rents from us to eat the fodder (corn stalks), asked if he could because he will have to put up barb wire fence that connects to our fence, we will put up the solar hot wire so the horses will stay off our fence. BUT Hubby took down two of the gates so they need to go back up and he needs to move the wood he just dump there so he can finish cutting it as there is no way to cut it with the horses. He said as soon as he dumped it, he remembered E was going to put the horses there and thought that just added more work. I told him he could just finish cutting it and get it done as it will be about a week before E moves the horses. But he thinks he is moving it closer to the barn so he can cut in the barn when it's raining and he has nothing else to do.  I really hope you all are well and doing good with very little stress. Prayers for peace (and sanity because I think we got some crazy ones running around)Blessed BeJuls"},
{"title": "OK... HERE WE GO.", "date": "Thursday, December 14, 2023", "text": "Remember this??? We bought this house  over 6 yrs ago. All projects are done except the steps onto the south end of kitchen porch (left side of house) , but material is on site. AND we decided since Hubby's mom is using walker with wheels (and possibly a wheelchair as she had polio as a child) that we would remove some of the gravel at the end of the ramp we put on front porch and put in a cement pad to would connect to the cement pad that is already to the left of this photo. Amish tie their horses up there as N put a horse rail there with cement pad.. E said he could help with that if Hubby needed him and E thought he could borrow a mixer if they poured the concrete themselves. Amish have several cement mixers.I have garden seeds. Our electric company figure out what it costs me to have my grow cart on for 3 months. They were shocked a bit of the increase but I reminded them that this is NOT LED. These are 120 watt fluorescent and there are 12 of them. All debt is paid off except the house. We do need to save to replace Silverado so I am saving for it also as I really do not want a loan.IRS changed rules on inherited IRA, I now have to take RMD from Daddy's IRA. After talking with Hubby and then my Finance guy WE decided that I could use that IRA to help pay off the mortgage. It won't pay it off fully but it will take a healthy bite out of the debt.  Hubby asked for me to write out the plan First is we continue to pay the extra we pay nowthen we add the money I am getting from IRA (finance guy said it would last about 1 1/2 yrs)  I am not touching my own investment unless I have to.Both being on Medicare as of Jan 1st will save us $9,216 in health ins and out of pocket. Divide that between mortgage and saving for car replacement.When I track the budget, anything under budget the money automatically goes to savings for when it is OVER budget (like Christmas lights) as I know Jan electric will be over the budget while late spring is always under budget. ANYWAYS... what ever is NOT used in the budget by next Dec will be split between savings and mortgage. Money saved with coupons or sales will go in savings and on mortgage.I printed off a year's spread sheets of each category for the budget. Hubby will do it on paper but not on a computer even if it's on HIS computer. I think his dementia messes with him there where he always kept books when farming.Welcome to the ride LOLPrayers for Peace Blessed be"},
{"title": "choices", "date": "Wednesday, December 13, 2023", "text": "We went to see Hubby's parents. Like us they are keeping away from social activities due to the virus going around. We sat 6 ft apart for each other. MIL sprayed Lysol as we left. We talked about ways to save money and keep bills low. She was surprised I was canning meat until she checked the price at her local store. She down loaded the same coupon I had used and went. Got three chuck roasts (all cooked and in freezer in servings for two) and 2 whole chickens cooked and in freezer also. She won't have to cook for 3 weeks she said LOL.Son 2 was in ER again, high BP AGAIN. They are changing his meds but he also told me this morning the job he changed to when he retired from Army is worse stress (and not due to wars even though it's a civilian job on base) than being in military. PLUS he is bouncing through denials from  Army over working burn pits for a year in Iraq. Daughter 4 caught the virus I had for 6 wks. Her two sons picked her up and carried her to the car and took her to the ER. She's passed out on them twice in the past 24 hrs. They had enough of her \"I am okay\". Her lupus is one of the worse flare ups the ER had seen , but not the worse the Lupus doctor had seen. On different meds and getting her BP up from the low she had.Son2 said if they shared BP , they would both be normal. Daughter 2 said she fainted at work (custodian at school) due to hot flash. Was lucky she warned the one she was working with what was going on and that she needed to lay down. They caught her before she fell over. School nurse checked her out and now she has appt with her doctor over it.Daughter 1 has out patient back surgery the 18th. Daughter 3 and Son 1 wants everyone else to stay away from them. We agree with those feelings. We are doing phone conference with finance guy tonight (he doesn't want virus and said it went through the office so he was not having anyone come in either) .We are changing budget so I need to sit down after conference call and deal with that.Most the Christmas decorations are up.How is your month going?"},
{"title": "End of year.", "date": "Thursday, December 7, 2023", "text": "I went to the local flower shop and asked the owner to make me an arrangement that was 24 to 30 inches tall. Not some cookie cutter thing. He loved it, most come in and order something they saw on line. He come up with this. When I picked it up, he told me to only toss the greens, keep everything else and dry out the pot. He will reuse it for me so I am not spending so much. I think I will take some of it back for an Easter arrangement. I down loaded what was on the credit cards, added it up and put it in the categories I have in our budget to see where we went over, what we might not be acknowledging etc.The thing about using credit cards for everything. You are paying to last month's bills on this month's income.I then watched Hubby freak over his CC being over $4000. So I showed him he had his truck brakes ($2000) and one of the two batteries replaced in it ($500) plus fuel ($575) for all the medical appts as the other truck isn't trustworthy to go that far. He also used his card for something he picked up for E that E paid him cash for. Then the meals out as lunch was between appts. The good news is he got 1.5 % back on that so it went to help pay that bill.Medical was high between the two of us. BUT 2024 we will both be on Medicare, Part B, AARP medigap, Hubby Aetna Part D, Me Wellcare Part D and GoodRX Gold for his nasal spray, nitro and my inhaler. Good Rx Gold will save us 3/4s of what it would be on Part D and within 2 refills of those meds saves to pay the cost of the GOLD.  We will save around $9,000 on medical compared to what it cost us to have insurance this year. Since mid Sept we have had 3-4 medical appts a week. That is done. We have 4 I think this month and that is it. I have 3 appts I missed due to be sick. I will reschedule them for Feb. or March as I try to NOT have many appts during the winter. Groceries was double. I got turkey for Thanksgiving plus extra turkey for freezer, got corned beef for St Paddy's, two hams , one for Christmas week(not the day) the other for Easter, and ordered the prime rib (deducted the money for it) for Christmas eve and one for freezer. I found a whole chicken at 7 lbs. usually at 5 lbs. on sale with a coupon at Kroger's. I roasted it last night. Today I will be tossing carcass in pot and to finish getting the meat off the bone and making broth. I also got 5 chuck roasts. On sale, had additional coupon and Fresh mode $.  Ended up paying $2.28 a pound. Have 9 qrts. of beef with broth and a Dutch oven to drain today to can the broth I made with the scraps I did not can. I had to pick up celery, carrots and milk for regular groceries. I now have tons of bread for us that was given to us from different people. At least it is not the same old bread LOL. Got half of it in freezer but we need to eat the rest but it is in frig.Utilities were down, electric is not in until the 11th that will probably be up as the propane furnace was on half the month (if outside temp is over 40 and it does not get below freezing we use propane instead of wood stove). Propane tank is at 45% We refill at 25% so don't need that filled this month. I have credit on my acct at propane co.I finally replaced my last purse. I got 4 on sale for the same price I would have got 1 mid summer when I first started pricing them. I also got 2 pairs of jeans. I dropped from size 12, to 10 to 4 when I got sick and lost 30 lbs. I now bounce depending on the day between a 4 to 8. Granddaughter age 13 lent me  her size 8 to make sure I could wear them before buying them. I got two pairs on sale so it was the same cost of buying 1 without a sale and then used my points on my credit card to pay for it. SO zero out of pocket for me.Christmas lights are starting to die on us. Not surprised as they are over 7  yrs. old, some are 12 yrs. old So we are looking at what we might want to change to. Over all, we paid additional 2 yrs. on mortgage, saved 3 months of income and are fully stocked. Take out Crohns attacks, potassium drops and Hubby's heart attack... it was a good year."},
{"title": "Dec 1st 2023", "date": "Friday, December 1, 2023", "text": "Let's see....We have been eating from our pantry. I bagged 5 meals for freezer from the turkey from Tday and then got another  4 meals when I cooked the caraccas for broth. I dealt with pomegranates and those are now bagged in 1 cup of little gems (that is what Hubby calls them) in the freezer.I added sausage to an apple onion stuffing, prebaked them in large muffin tins and froze them. I can add gravy and a veggie or salad and have a quick meal. Got 9 meals.I cut up the jumbo pineapple and froze most of it.Once again I am running out of freezer room. Need a spot for the 2nd prime rib that is coming in 2-3 weeks. I told Hubby I was going to make some ice cream and then I could take the ice cream maker bowl out of freezer. Should be close to same size of prime rib.M asked us to go to Aldi's for her ( they always pay for us to go). She wanted several bunches of bananas and a case of cream cheese. A case is usually 12 or 24. Since I had to get the cash for the kids, grandkids, and great grandkids Christmas, we just drove on over to Aldi's that was about 15 minutes from the bank. He got her stuff and I got the stuff for the HAM radio group's Christmas dinner that is Saturday. We \"get\" to get the condiments, buns and appetizers this year. I will pull the condiments from the pantry. Got the buns and decided on cream cheese rolled in dry Italian salad dressing mix with crackers, pinwheels of tortilla wrap, cream cheese and small diced red and green bell peppers and lunch meat (beef and ham)with cream cheese wrapped around dill pickle spears. This time cases of cream cheese was 36. M got one and I got one. I can keep it about a year if it's not already gone by then. It most likely will be gone by June.I also found a ham butt so now I have ham for Christmas week and ham for Easter. That finishes the holiday meat until July 4th 2024. I started working on 2024 budget. I first looked are where we started 2023, looked for things we removed from budget through the year and what will be out of the budget for 2024. I finished my Medicare stuff. Hubby got Good RX. Gold (daughter 4 pushed it as she uses it more than her health ins drug part) It covers his nasal spray and nitro and my inhaler for 1/4th of what it would be through our Part D. Two fills of each saves more than the cost of the yearly cost of the GOLD. I figured up what we would be out of pocket for all the medical. (I like it to be sitting in the money market earning interest) and realized we will be saving  $15,000 a year. Yes you read that correctly.Since Hubby closed the business and the \"work\" truck is now on regular insurance and it is paid off as the insurance money from the totaled flat bed trailer paid it off.... there is now a savings of $9600 a year on the truck insurance.  We also no longer have the truck payment so that is $10080 savings also. He also will not have the wear and tear on the truck since he is not driving it 200-300 miles a day. So I will be keeping track of that this coming year.Between not using the propane furnace as much and getting wood free from E and cheaper wood from sawmill.  We have lowered the \"heat\" bill by $3,000.I canceled some subscriptions Hubby was no longer using due to not working. Savings $1500.95% of punch list of things to be done on the house (not including windows or siding). We do want to pour concrete at end of front porch ramp at the horse tie up railing (where Amish tie their horse and buggy) so when MIL comes over, she isn't battling the gravel drive way with her walker that has wheels. E said he could get the cement mixer the Amish share for us to use so we only had to buy the concrete mix. I  know we spent $10, 000 on the house with odds and ends needing done and the solar pump being finished.Total out of the budget ALMOST $50,000. Yes you read that correctly. I went over it 3 times and then Hubby went over it three times. Then OUR Financial guy went over it three times. I quit pulling my IRA completely. I have an annuity that was Daddy's that I will be moving over to go to savings also. It will cover Christmas for 2024. I have my seeds for the garden. I told Hubby I need a place for the grow cart as I am going to once again try to start my own plants. Some years it's great other it's almost a waste of time and money.I need to work on the grocery budget. Hubby needs to call about a bill that was lowered and suppose to stay lower for a year that went right back up. Still when compared to what the kids are paying for the same thing ( not our company and ours is not available in their area) we are paying about half of what they are for same service. We know there will come a time we won't be able to get it lowered. I texted the kids, out of 30, 15 had some crud. Sunday we start getting our vaccines caught up. We are only getting two at a time even though Doc said we could get 4-5 of them together. We were like \"no thank you\", Neither of us want that sore of an arm.Got to go feed the fire.Stay safePrayers for peace and sanity Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Day 1 of week one.", "date": "Thursday, November 23, 2023", "text": "Charlotte insisted we start the day with our normal routine of sitting on the kitchen porch while I drink coffee. I was definitely wrapped in a blanket.We decided to eat our main meal at noon with snacks later. I roasted the turkey, baked a large sweet potato to split between us. Baked Brussels sprouts in bacon grease so they were crispy on the edges. Bakes stuffed mushrooms.  I added a spinach salad with sliced strawberries, feta cheese and strawberry salad dressing one of the kids passed to me as they didn't like it. I heated a couple rolls. We did not have any of the pecan pie or pumpkin pie but the day is not over.I set the table (used to bug the crap out of Hubby) with the dishes my Daddy bought Mother on their 5th anniversary to celebrate buying their first home. Plus I used the silverware that was Hubby's grandmother on his Dad's side. His parents said it made them feel good because none of the kids wanted it because it was silverplated instead of silver. Since they would have been farming for a living , I struggle to see them spending money for real silver. But that is just me I guess. I took the crystal punch bowl Son2 gave back and used it for the citrus fruit. There is oranges, lemons, limes and pomegranates. The oranges look yellow in this photo. While putting leftovers away I found a bag of mixed salad that has taco flavoring that needs used up. So moved enchilada casserole up to this week to go with the salad.  I washed the outside of the  west side windows so we can start dealing with Christmas decorations. I ordered some things we needed replaced for Christmas decorations that was on sale at Amazon.Tomorrow I will be bagging up the turkey by meals and starting broth from the bones. Probably cleaning, and decorating. Be safePrayers for peaceBlessed Be  Okay, we had 3 doctor appts, DONE until Monday and that is only Hubby.I no longer need to take potassium (YEAH) , or go get more blood work and won't see primary until Feb. Am able to schedule my doctor appts I missed while sick. Able to schedule our vaccines also.Primary is letting Hubby's cardiologist make the call over one med that Hubby takes for tremors, it might be the glitch in his heart beat, or it could be just how it beats since he has a deformity.We sucked it up after chiro and my blood work and went shopping for the bulk.Went to Menards, got bottled water, pretzels, Chi Chi chips (the only place that carries them) and candy for Christmas. We will get 11% back.Went to Aldi's, got a small turkey for roasting later this spring, corned beef (now in freezer for St Patrick's day) some specialty cheeses, a pretzel bite tray, brown and serve buns and fresh cranberries. They did not have any ham which I usually buy there.Went to Kroger's. Hubby pushed cart #1, I got cart #2. I got fresh veggies and a couple salads, oranges, limes, lemons, a pineapple, apples, pears  and pomegranates. I got dairy.  Hubby grabbed some different breads as at this point doc wants it on the table and we will work at lowering chemicals after the holidays. I have lost 30 lbs. I look like my mother when she was taking chemo. They were out of their 49 cents turkeys so I did not pick another turkey up. I usually have 2 in deep freezers.  I did get a log of ground beef (I had coupon) for making ground beef crumbles this week. I bag them in 1 cup sandwich bags and then in freezer bag. Helps make quick meals or to add to casserole or pasta. I use Bluapple in my frigs to help keep produce longer. It does seem to work pretty well.  I got junk food as I know if I didn't he would start picking worse crap up when he would go get milk and veggies.  He picked up a pie that was half pumpkin and half pecan. He would have gotten more but I pointed out I had the stuff to make cranberry custard pie, mini cheese cakes along with any fruit pies, cakes , cookies etc. I do not make pecan pie any more as Son2 can no longer eat it and it was being tossed. I think half a pie will get ate. Pumpkin never gets tossed LOL.Went to the butcher shop, got 2 meals of cube steak, 2 meals of bone in pork chop, 2 meals of boneless pork chop and ribeye steaks to make in to Guy Fieri sliders for NY eve, Philly steak subs, and Philly steak pizza.  I will slice them on my meat slicer after they are frozen. Confirmed I had 2 prime ribs or 1 large one (depends on what he gets in) on order for Christmas eve. I will make several meals from that.Went to Save A Lot and got a ham. If I don't use it for Christmas I will use it at Easter. I have a rack of ribs, a pork shoulder roast and 2 small pork tenderloins I can use for NY eve/NY day.Figured out we still stayed in the $85/week range for the groceries . IF we go longer than 8 weeks and don't pick much up, it might be lower than that. Wrote out 154 meals without repeats from what is in house (included prime rib ordered).  That is 22 weeks and puts us to Easter. I would love it. We know we will have to get dairy and some fresh veggies. I should have enough winter squash, potatoes, and onions ( might be on light side there) . It took four hours of shopping, on top of 2 hrs. of driving AFTER blood work and chiro appt.  Lucky that the weather was on cool side so we could just leave the perishables in the coolers out on the porch and I put it away the next morning.We talked about how it worked.. I had a full grocery list on clip board, in categories and in order to shop store (non perishables/middle of store first). We would set the carts at one spot, he stood with them and I walked the aisle to get what was needed, Limited us from trying to work around others. We went on Tuesday so the crowd was not bad as it was on Wednesday when our grandkid set me a pic of him trying to get some odds and ends. The check out line was to the back of the store.BUT the negative, if is is colder than what it was (34 degrees out is like a frig) or hotter like in Summer, we would have to leave earlier, not have any other appts (especially blood work) to get it , get home and put it away immediately. It took me 1 hr. to put it all ways (yes it fit in 3 frigs) and the meat is wrapped and in freezers. I was hauling butt to get it done that fast.I do have some things to do before Monday night (trash goes to road) like dealing with today's turkey carcass. Making the apple sausage stuffin muffins (Rachael Ray the only stuffing Hubby will eat), making apple sausage puffs (crescent dough), noodles (main dish and side) and taco seasoning. Off the top of my head.We will be cleaning and decorating this weekend. It usually takes us a week to get the decorating done inside and out. I think it might take 2 wks. just because of him still going to cardio rehab 3 times a week and my energy is still in the toilet. We figured if we only go every 8 weeks. We will save 4 hrs. of our time, not counting cost of the gas to run the stores. We did not stop at the Mennonite or Amish store. They were packed.This week on the menu is Today: Roasted turkey, roasted Brussel sprouts, baked sweet potato, baked stuffed mushrooms, salad optional ( easy meal) pie and pumpkin roll (from Amish)Friday . Leftover steak from Applebee's that we celebrated at last night after no more blood work and back to 3 month appts. Probably will have bell peppers, onions and mushrooms sliced with it into tortilla wraps to give us enough for a meal. Pear salad or apple salad.Saturday Leftover turkey in noodles (making noodles for pantry), Mashed potatoes, asparagus from freezer, cole slaw (canned) Sunday Apple sausage puffs (I am using a lot of recipes out of the cookbook The Cabin full of Food) . This works well as the ingredients is close to what the apple sausage stuffin muffins is. So less mess to clean up. Monday Nonna's pizza... think sheet cake pan, thick dough, good coating of pizza sauce, sausage, pepperoni, bacon, ham,2-3 different color of  bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, banana peppers, black olives and cheese. Chef salad .Tuesday Spaghetti squash bowls (turkey alfredo most likely but could be taco meat and toppings) Wednesday Rheuben casserole on rye bread. It's a crock pot thing, layer of canned corned beef, thin layer of Swiss cheese and then topped with a layer of kraut (I have homemade kraut) I usually put a layer on Swiss on top when I serve it. We both use horseradish cream sauce on the sandwich if we eat it like that. Other wise we use the rye bread to sop up the juices. Thursday I will finish using the spaghetti squash as pasta.    Stay safePrayer for peaceBlessed be"},
{"title": "Hubby brought up", "date": "Monday, November 20, 2023", "text": "He would like to do the grocery shopping like we did when the kids were growing up. I'm like... which part? The stop at butcher shop for the reduced on Saturday night because the store was closed on Sunday? The nine loaves of homemade bread I baked DAILY? The leftovers going into casseroles and leftover casserole going into soups?No, the part we only go every two or three months for bulk. That was before Amazon for sure.  I had changed to once a month with milk run between last summer when one of the Amish ladies told me she was saving 25 % by not going every other week. In Sept with all the medical problems I went to 6 wks. Groceries are now averaging $85/week.I showed him our standard list. There are a few things added due to holidays. Pointed out that fresh salad and fresh veggies will not last that long. He is willing to pick up some fresh veggies when he picks up the milk. I have no problem with going to January without being in the freaking stores. I don't want what ever new crud is going around. We are still averaging 4 medical appts a week.I wrote out the list to increase the amount of time before we need to shop. Added some healthy snack food as I know we will snack more than eat meals with being mostly at home. I am hoping that the medical appts go down to one or two a week not four like now. I also made note... fresh salad and seafood first/ fresh veggies (think carrots and celery) and poultry next. Root veggies (and winter squash, cabbage in storage) next and then canned goods and freezer goods. I did tell him if it goes to waste we lose that money. I usually will dehydrate, freezer or make casserole or soup before that happens but it does happen sometimes.He understands he will be in store pushing a cart. AND there will be at least 3 if not 4 stops.If we take our time and I figure it correctly, it should be manageable between the two of us.The side benefit, if I reduce the grocery budget doing it , that money can go over on to the mortgage.Stay safePrayers for Peace Blessed be"},
{"title": "When you get reminded of some funny things that happen at family holidays.", "date": "Friday, November 17, 2023", "text": "Like the house catching on fire (no one hurt but enough damage) right before Halloween and we ended up with the spookiest house because the windows were black and looked like they had spider webs on them.Same year, had Thanksgiving for 25, used church kitchen up the street. No one could believe we pulled it off but we did.I made an Alabama Lane cake, went to move it from counter to table and it fell. Hubby caught it in the bowl he was getting for mashed potatoes. Ended up being Alabama Lane cake trifle. I cried over that one.Deep fryer with turkey in it blew out at controls. Hubby kicked it out of Daughter 2's garage and saved the turkey. She said her garage smelled like turkey for months. No damage to garage or an cars.Had Tday dinner outside as it was a great day, saw a couple next door and thought it was neighbors friends so invited them to share meal. Neighbor's thought they were kids friends, kids thought they were our friends... Not one of us knew them but it was the best of times. Never could figure out who there were. LOLDaddy asking me where I got yellow cucumbers because he liked them as well as the green ones. He was eating raw yellow squash and zucchini. Yes we eat them raw. When Pop (stepdad) asked what I used to make the turkey moist but not mushy and I handed him a pint of homemade turkey broth that he helped me can. When Mother asked what was in the pinwheels... and it was tortilla wrap, cream cheese and diced bell peppers. BUT the part that still gets shared to this day... Is when someone will tell the grandkids (most are adults) to NOT SPOIL their dinner by eating from the veggie platter. Daughter 4 still can not live that one down. As she really did tell her kids to not eat from the veggie platter or they would spoil their dinner. Her husband at the time looked at her as she had lost her mind. LOL We are now marking off days like I did for my parents so we can keep track. I asked Hubby what day it was, his answer was 4.I don't think so as we already had Veteran's day and Daughter 2's birthday. He laughed.He thought I was asked what the day was to figure out how many prednisone and potassium tablets . I was to take which was 4 that day. Doc and told him to write it on the calendar since we both look daily at the calendar on the wall.Hubby had voice therapy today, I had blood work.I put away the stuff on my computer tray (that I never use for my computer) that sits at my rocker. I wiped all the tray. I put the pile of papers on the radio by my phone in the bill box where it belonged and wiped it off. I did my blog and started catching up on my National novel writer month of 50 K words by Nov 30th. I checked with Life Lock to make sure that was all up to date.Ordered 2 prime rib roast, one for Christmas eve and one for the freezer.I am not up to cooking. Lifting pots and pans is still a struggle but better.I could actually give my phone number and social without looking today. Last Friday I was clueless.Yesterday, Hubby stopped at Taco Bell's , not one of our normal places (would be mine) and got me 3 crunchy tacos for lunch and a Mexican pizza for supper. I took 2 potassium at lunch and 2 at supper. Today I go to 3 a day.  for 3 days and then it is 1 a day twice a day until a month..I walked very slowly around the perimeter twice. It was a nice day. Hubby said it was nice to see me out of the bathroom and bedroom where I have basically lived for a week. We went for his voice therapy while I played where is my blood order? sitting at the hospital and it didn't help Doc's office was ran over with sick people and his head nurse aka his wife was the only one in besides him so she was slow getting back to me of the phone number she faxed it to.I finally tracked it down (where Head nurse said she sent it and they said they didn't get it) and within two minutes watched the office manager walk the young lady that lied about getting it to the door.  Had 8 \"vampires\" what I call the blood takers LOL, trying to find a place to pull blood from...sigh. Finally the head boss found if she moved her thumb a certain way she could get to a good one and stuck me. We went through Mc D's and got a double cheeseburger for each, split small fries and I got a small ice tea as I had a headache. Got home, Hubby went back to town for groceries that I was not up to dealing with and he had to jump the truck to get it started twice. Replaced that battery, thinks there is a short in the  rear brake lights again (has happened twice now) and it drained it. Going to call about scheduling that to be checked. He picked up Special K, milk and 3 bags of mixed salad. Doc calls to tell me my potassium in not in the toilet (2.9) but hanging over the seat (3.4 LOL) and he would like it to be at 4 (with toilet lid shut). Magnesium is in normal range and he can't think what would cause the potassium to drop. I asked him if he had checked my B9, Folate? Total silence. No because I am past childbearing. I pointed out that just because I am past that doesn't mean it can't be the issue as I know from experience that drops my potassium. Has been added to my blood work on Tuesday even though we see him Wednesday. Means I can go to store and pick up a few things to get us through the holiday and decorating for Christmas and NOT on the day before the holiday. There is one thing I would never miss about the holidays. The kids start fighting with each other until I want to smash heads together. I blame Mother as she always felt she needed to start it right before the holidays. I am glad they are having meals with their kids (yes our house is big enough but they know they can't fight with each other within the length of our arms) So they are eating else where. Son 2 who just broke up with his lady due to her cheating is going to his biological aunt's for dinner as he is close to her boys he hasn't seen for a couple years. Son 1 is going south with some buddies as he is not seeing anyone. Hubby said he noticed that they didn't offer for us to come to eat and I laughed. They know full well they start fighting with each other in their own homes we will still smash heads. Until the day we die before that stops. Less stress for us as I would probably try to figure out how to eat with 4 different kids, couple of the grandkids are going to be with their other parents also. By Christmas things will calm back down. Hubby mentioned we had no place for putting puzzles together. I used to have a cardboard for the table and we would move it to the bfast bar. His Mom told him to quit doing them as he made 2 into pictures for her (framed etc.) so he stopped completely when she meant for her alone.   I ordered a puzzle table and some puzzles I think he would like, one I know I would like to do  for us as our Christmas gift to each other. I know I will have to change what I store on the bfast bar (beside clutter) so we can sit it there when using the table. It has drawers for the pieces so I won't have to keep gathering them up and putting them back in the box. Daughter 2 had one like this for years for her 4 boys(who fight with each other around the holidays also).We are having pumpkin spice Special K for bfastIt's supposed to rain, soaker rain most the day but be warm. I have to clean the stove as the rest of the week is to be cold. Nice to have a couple days break of hauling woodI am thinking beef stew for supper. I have canned beef, just turn broth into gravy, add carrots, onions and potatoes. Either bake bread or biscuits along with salad should be plenty. Best try to get some sleep. Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "I am in recovery. Its going to be long time.", "date": "Wednesday, November 15, 2023", "text": "My potassium is 2.9. Usually at 3.5 they have you in hospital with potassium IV. Since Doc just watched me hobble in to his office on Hubby's arm. He knows I am better... as I could not walk into the ER or out of it on Friday. LOW POTASSIUM CAN CAUSE HEART ATTACK. I already left sided heart disfunction (which goes in to left sided failure).At ER on Friday nightParamedic took me to my room as the staff was busy and my BP was 85/53 and I was having chest pains. Pain level at 8, throwing up and diarrhea. I had taken 2 Humira and it did not not slow down the freight train (because Crohns wasn't the problem) Told Hubby he expected me to just slump over at any time and figured he was the best person at the spot to deal with it. Hubby told him they could tag team it as he was retired EMT. plus squad driver.RN took one look and called for blood work, and all the heart crap  stat. PA came in and started hooked up IV but was nice to draw blood since he taking my only good vein. They did a small amount later to run second test for heart attack. NO heart attack but definitely heart event with stress. Still was at level 8. painMeds for throwing up. Had to wait for ct scan to show nothing was blocked before they could give me a pain shot.  NO blockage, gave me standard morphine (that's all I can take) It did not kick the pain down. Still at level 8. Not throwing up (such a relief) but went through 8 diapers in the 3 hrs. we were there.  Said potassium low. So as I was being releases I asked what meds was being sent to pharmacy... Potassium. Doctor has already been in an out making comments about I have crohns. I asked for pain meds to get me through until I could see my doctor. He refused. I could see my primary for pain meds for my crohns. Nothing for diarrhea, nothing for throwing up, nothing for pain. PA could not understand it and mixed the powdered potassium and wondered out loud why I wasn't just given the pill. When I immediately threw it up and he wiped up the floor, washed and dried my crocs so my feet wouldn't get wet. He pulled what was in the that powder, Printed it off and told me to make sure my doctor saw that. It has citric acid. Citric acid is know to cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and sever stomach cramps. I walked in hanging by my fingernails on that cliff and walked out wondering how to harm myself without screwing it and causing more pain. Thoughts on our 30 children, grandkids and great grandkids pasted through  my mind. It was great grandbaby that had to have four surgeries since birth 3 months ago to get her shunt to work correctly that stopped me. I could imagine her tiny little foot kicking my in the butt. She worked so hard to come home and I was giving up over a butt head's belief. I had crohns so I should just accept the pain. IT was not the crohn's causing the problem but the potassium.I hadn't been able to hold anything but water down since Tuesday the 7th (Hubby said politics has made me sick). Call primary early Monday morning and leave message including I had thought of self harm until I thought of baby. I was in, blood work drew. Meds for pain, throwing up, diarrhea and potassium. He filed a complaint at that Hospital. He is checking my blood work again on Thursday, got the hospital Hubby has voice therapy to take his order and run it so I don't have to drive so far. IF it is still down, I will be in hospital until it is up enough I am not in danger.My GI  and my GI PA was through the roof. I was not told to follow up with them (I did request it be after Tday as I want to get the potassium fixed first). Was not sent records I was even in. Full review of the doctor and his orders concerning me are under review. The fact that several of the staff heard him tell me I had crohn's I could talk to my primary and ignored I was a heart patient  and GI patient with level 8 pain and no meds to cover Friday night to Monday was shocking. The nurse at my GI office called and asked how I was doing. She doubts if the doctor remains on staff. In this hospital , it's not 3 strikes you are out, it's one strike and you are out. He didn't even follow protocol. Said the RN and the PA and the ct scan tech all reported him also. We will see where that goes.  Meantime I am limited up as I get to shaky to walk. I have no strength. But I have to eat solid food with the potassium. Yesterday I cut up 3/4s of a cheeseburger slider in to 8 pieces to have 1 before each pill and 1 at the end to get rid of the nasty tasting crap. I actually held it all down with sips of water in between and puke meds 30 minutes before I started. Now down 30 lbs. I look like Mother when she was on Chemo"},
{"title": "Update of Hubby Neurologist report ", "date": "Tuesday, November 7, 2023", "text": "First they did nerve testing on his legs. He has very little feeling in the skin of his legs but the muscles definitely are NORMAL on the feeling. Said we will have to watch him for minor cuts etc. getting infected. His arms are the same way. It is due to the prediabetes. His balance has improved also. Doc K said heart issues can mimic other issues so make sure he does not miss cardio appts. Was surprised Hubby doesn't go back to cardiologist until May. Said that meant he was doing great. Doc K didn't get the results of the testing done by another Doctor. Hubby didn't have them either so Hubby is calling today to find out what is going on with that. Doc K ordered at home sleep apnea study... I have to find a way to keep Charlotte from waking him up. I would have him sleep upstairs but he gets up to potty through the night.  Doc K agreed that eating foods that help with issues instead of popping a pill was the best way to go. He thought it was funny primary took Vit B complex out as you just pee the excess, until I showed him on my phone (thank you Google) that high dosages will affect SLEEP. Since we eat the foods that have B Vitamin in them, the pill was making it too high and neither of us was getting a good night's sleep. B Vitamin helps with Dementia.  He asked about coconut oil (another one that helps) Sends triglycines up and he just had a heart attack. That went bye bye also.We talked about Beta glucan (oats, barley, sweet potatoes etc.) helping with the metabolic syndrome and some issues and he was for us trying it for the next 3 months. That will have another round of blood work from primary done to show if it is helping. He asked if Hubby was in cardio rehab. As he felt Hubby probably doesn't need it . It starts today. His cardiologist said he only needed to go for information and ins reason for 3 visits and if he doesn't want to go any more that was fine as he does more \"work out \" at home than he will at rehab. Got to get around to get some work done before we head to rehab. Prayers for PeaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "What I am doing this week ", "date": "Monday, November 6, 2023", "text": "Not canning  SNICKERINGDealing with scarp wood. We put it in tubs and I use it to limp evening fire to night wood, bump up heat for cooking or if it's warm (50s) outside use it instead of the longer lasting wood.We have several appointments. Hubby has nerve testing and follow up with neurologist today. Tomorrow is cardio rehab and that will be 3 days a week unless he stops. His cardiologist told him he does more work at home than he will with the physical work out he get in rehab but he wants him to at least go 3 times due to insurance issues. Wednesday he has to take the wood wagon to the saw mill. He also has to catch E when he is not in the fields taking off beans. Amish work together taking their crops off. He need E to mow the around the edge of the pond, mow the asparagus (our mower would damage it, his is to the side so weight it not on the asparagus) and see if he knows anyone selling cords of wood. He would like to have one cord cut as he gets tired easy and not sure he will get the wood he has cut to size. He had someone give him about half a cord....it's too long for our stove so he has to cut off about 2 inches (more for tubs) .I changed our chiro appts back to the regular day so it matches our appts with primary and blood work. One trip, less gas and Hubby will be less frustrated of losing a day of working at home.I need to declutter and clean the 1st floor. THEN I can start decorating. Won't turn the decorations on but we won't be worn out trying to do the \"get it done in one week\" mode we usually do at Thanksgiving. He is going to start decorating the outside since it's to be nice this week.Daughter 1 is having surgery next week. She's on disability right now. She has had serious health problems for the past few years. We talked to her and her hubby about them needing to look for a different home that was one story and not up a hill that she has to walk down to get to the car or where she can't get to the laundry room as it's in the basement. They didn't do it. NOW she can't walk up or down the 9 steps to get to the car and it's too steep to ramp. They had to take a window out of the bedroom and put a door in to get her in and out of house. Lesson learned. She does not want to rent but might have to due to interest on mortgage loans. She's too young for the one set of apartments that would work great. Daughter 3 told her a couple places that she could probably get into. Daughter 3 used to work at the old folks home.Son 2 is having more testing and tons of follow ups. The berries are only half weeded. So one or both of us will probably try to get more done this week. I am reading \"The Cabin Full of Food\" by Marie Beausoleil. I am also following her at justplaincooking.caI need to rewrite the to do list that is for both of us. Hubby loses his list.Prayers for peace Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Sunday is the day of rest. I cleaned the basement.", "date": "Monday, November 6, 2023", "text": "I went down to get something out of the one freezer and had to move the dehydrator and thought enough is enough.I cleaned the mechanical room first as it is off the freezer room. Cobwebs down, breaker box, furnace and water softener dusted and floor swept. I had Hubby check the furnace filters and water filter. He couldn't remember changing the water filter so he change it now. I will now put that on the calendar to make sure one of us changes it. I will remind him to flip the pipe on the septic tank. It's changed with the time change.I moved the dehydrators to a shelving unit in the bucket room and finished putting away stuff off the top of the 3 deep freezers. Move a couple things off the top of the one refrigerator (now in donation box) and put some of the extra empty canning jar boxes there. I picked up a green Rubbermaid thinking there was stuff in it... it was empty. I have been sitting the food processor on top of it. Now food processer is in bucket room on shelving unit, rubber maid is going to barn. I stacked all the empty wide mouth quart jars thereThe regular mouth pints and the wide mouth pints stayed by the refrigerators. I keep them neat as if I don't we fall over them walking into this room.The pantry area was just dust and sweep. I do need to finish grinding some of the herbs and greens I dried but that can be done later. I hung the onions on the wall. Hung garlic in bags from stairs and put the little onion in the hanging basket. Straightened up the regular mouth canning jars under the stairs. Moved the solar cube to that area so I am not moving it daily to get into the chest of drawers (It was Daddy's) that I store small baking pans in.Straightened up the buckets that hold flours and grains. Hubby takes things and sits what ever on these buckets instead of putting it away. Just something I have to get used to with his dementia. I have 3 rice buckets and 1 bucket of homemade noodles and one bucket of Ramen noodles in the pantry. There is 9 buckets at bottom of stairs of what I use weekly. There was 1 small bag of trash, 2 small boxes of burn trash (one was mostly dog fur as Charlotte has a bed in the basement for when she is hot or scared) and 2 boxes of donations and 2 boxes for Daughter 4. I do have 1 boxes of extra kitchen stuff as we have grandkids starting to go out of their own and I let them pick through that box.It took 6 hrs. BUT it's done and I should be able to maintain it since I moved things around. It helped we bought 3 shelving units when we bought one for Daughter 2.  I might add another one for the oils that sit to the right of the staircase . I will see what I have in barn I can use as this area never gets water so I won't have to use something waterproof.I already did the lofts last month. I do need a better system for some things in then north loft. I might go book cases for it. Make it out of the scrap lumber we have in the barn  as the north loft is canned goods like cases of soup, coffee and teas etc. and canning supplies like canning salt, citric acid etc. Cleaning products are in boxes on the other side. Building book cases is winter project.Ever think \"I am not going to do anything today\" and then work twice as hard?Prayers for peaceBlessed be"},

We will see how this saves electric. AND we will know how long a solar charge (goes to batteries and then the pump) works with OH sunlight. If the grid goes down here NW Ohio) like it does repeatedly in NE Ohio. We will be ok water wise.I never bought a baby monitor for the kids or grandkids but Hubby sure did for this solar pump. He wanted to monitor the pressure and make sure there was no issues and doesn't want to go to the pump house every time he wants to check it.First day, it turned off. He had it programed wrong.Second day, he had the pressure drop to 15 before it would kick on. Takes less than 5 mins. to bring back up to pressure but the washer wasn't done filling and it shut off due to lack of water. So the pressure is set for 25 with no higher than 45 (50 is the max).He wrote on the calendar were the electric meter was and where the propane tank level was. Said he was going to read both once a week. I have learned the curve of watching what water I am turning on with what ever is running also. Flushing the toilet when showering is  NO NO. LOLWe are being careful with our water. Our pond was 12 inches lower than normal. We have gotten 1 inch total rain this week. It's supposed to be drier winter in Ohio. If we don't get enough rain/snow. Six Amish families won't get ice this winter for their ice houses... which means we will be making ice blocks in the freezer. Been there and done that the second year we were here. We get our well water from SNOW. Rain runs off to the streams and rivers. Snow fills the water under ground which is the deep well.Our Amish neighbor had his 1000 gallon cistern go dry. He is putting up more spouting to run to that on the new wash house he is building. Mean time has his wind mill pumping daily to bring water into the house by a garden hose. His sister in law is washing their whites so the rust in the well water doesn't ruin their whites.Our water softener company let us know we are only using the water of 1 person daily. That does not count the watering of the gardens as I don't have outside water lines going through the softener. We have 3 more beds to replace then I can run the drip lines in the gardens. Goal for next spring. I have the drip lines. Bought them on sale.I reused our canning water several times in the canner. I then used it to wash the pots and pans. We had a rain downspout break, Hubby put a trash can under it to catch the little rain we got. He then poured it in the drain of the pump house as that goes to the pond.Our Amish neighbor came over to use the phone. He came up to the house because it wouldn't go through (we put a phone in the barn for Amish to use). He handed Hubby the paper with the number and then had to pull out his flashlight for Hubby to read it. He wasn't using the 1 in front of the number for long distance. He thought it was funny he was using his flashlight in an Englisher house. We only have a ceiling fan light in the dining room and I have it so the light doesn't come on. We use oil lamp and Christmas LED candle for light in that area. We moved our supper to 4 so we don't have to turn on lights to eat since it will be getting dark at 5. The wood stove is on. Propane furnace is off. It's now cold enough outside that the house doesn't get up to 80 plus with the wood stove (we open windows just like Amish do) and it stays around 74  to 76 degrees.I didn't decorate for Fall... mostly because of how sick I have been (thankful it is SLOWLY going away, doc thinks it's long haul side effect of covid) SO besides the pumpkin decoration with LED string lights there is no extra lights. I bought LED lights for 2 windows that was still the old lights so ALL the lights for Christmas is LED now.I am done canning (Hubby says I will find something to can) but all the food is in the pantry. I told him We are eating from the pantry and freezers. I want to do more canning of our meat and less counting on the freezers. How are you doing?Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},

Said he had a hard time reaching it while sitting and didn't like getting off to move it. Hubby said he did a good job and it's nice to have. Will have to modify it to a quick hitch. But it does connect to the tractor now and work. Hubby just likes quick hitch since we have some many attachments for this tractor. Done with him using the walk behind snow blower on the lane that is over 300 ft. Done with him shoving gravel in the yard with the bucket on the tractor. Probably won't get enough snow to use it now.

Need NO groceries, as I grabbed milk when we got flour and sugar for M. SIGH. Haven't found a primary in our area. The one that had great reviews retired. Talked to a couple of his patients that said they are driving to Lima... no thanks. If I am driving 45 minutes to Lima I might as well stay with my primary of 15 yrs. for the hour drive. My in laws said they don't have a primary any more, they are all specialists and take care of the prescriptions for what they are being seen for. They go to Urgent care for general issues like flu etc. Brother in that area said that's how he has had to go. SIGH.Have a great day. Stay safe Prayer for peaceBlessed Be"},

My aunt laughed when PT was teaching him... told him to breath like I do... take deep breath as counting to 5 slowly, hold 5 and release 5. PT told her that was good. He got it but could only count to 3, said give him a week and it will be 5.Knowing how he is, he will work that above 5 in couple weeks.Son2 is getting through his heart testing. He has a glitch (he is his mother's child) on left side of his heart, his BP is higher than the doctor likes. He has sever sleep apnea so machine is being ordered unless his ins will pay for Inspire. His cholesterol is over 250 , his sugar is borderline (he had sugar problems as a child) He has hearing issues (I could have told them that). His PTSD is flaring but not bad. His Cardiologist is not putting him on meds until the sleep apnea is taking care of because it could be what is causing the glitch. Son2 thinks it's Mother's genes and then laughs as he still remembers my parents talking about Children's hospital telling my parents I only had a 50% chance of living year WITH surgery for heart and digestive issues, without I maybe had 6 months. IN GOD'S HANDS. Hubby's check up yesterday with Cardiologist went well. Told him he was doing good but still to go to Cardio rehab at least 3 times, more for knowledge that actual work as Hubby told him he trims and mows 2 acres (1/2 acre is with push mower), he cuts wood, stacks it, then moves it with bucket on tractor, unloads and restacks in house and on porch. Though he needed to find ways to move more during winter but not walking behind a snowblower for a 400 ft. lane and then all the ramps, sidewalk and porches/deck. Also needs to lose weight. He told cardiologist he has metabolic syndrome and he had been losing about 2 lbs. a month but since he had heart attack and then covid, he hasn't lost. He is to eat 3 meals and 3 snacks with the last snack 3 hrs. before laying down. I texted his Mom and asked if his Dad had the same problem. YES and to get the weight off she made sure he ate bfast (Hubby doesn't) and main meal at lunch time (he hates stopping to eat and never ate lunch when in the factory), and then soup, salad or raw veggies, fermented or pickled foods and whole grain bread for supper around 4 pm. (our meal time also). She does have some kind of fruit dessert daily. His Dad doesn't like ANY fresh fruit. I am still sniffling, coughing, hacking especially in middle of night unless I sleep sitting up which KILLS my back. I have found if I take my honey, turmeric, pepper and cinnamon mixture, before bed, I still wake up sniffling, coughing and hacking but I DO NOT have the nasty sore throat. I've gained 3 lbs. I am up to size 4 (I was wearing a 10/12 when I got sick). Doc told me to use generic Vick's rub before bed and hot shower if I am coughing hard. It's not as hard as it was, though I have morning sickness (HA HA) from the drainage.Over all we are either getting better, or at least getting answers of what is wrong, which actually is better because you aren't worrying causing anxiety wondering.Prayers for peace Blessed be"},

NO. Due to pandemic... NO... Both made the comment that the person asking was not understanding. So finally asked why we would be stocked up.I WAS RAISED BY PEOPLE THAT WENT THROUGH THE GREAT DEPRESSION.Mother's grandma canned. Her mom didn't, she worked and gave her mom non food items in exchanged for canned vegetables and fruit.Mother and Daddy always had tin can goods under the couch, stacked at end of couch and covered with fabric (I think old sheet) to use as a side table, and behind their bedroom door. There was always home canned food in the cellar along with 100 lb. bag of potatoes they bought from Daddy's Dad.  Daddy always insisted Mother have 10 lbs. of dried Navy beans, 25 lbs. of corn meal and 25 lbs. of white flour. Mother always had some medical supplies, toilet paper and lady products as she called them. I actually started growing navy beans because Daddy was struggling to find them. I grew kidney beans for MIL.Mother said some of their friends made fun of them because of all the tin canned food when they bought the house in the country and was helped moving her and Daddy. They stopped the making fun when two weeks later the WHOLE GROUP lost their jobs when the plant closed down without warning right at Christmas. No unemployment at that time. But because my parents stocked food and had the money set back for 3 months, they were okay. Two of their friends lost their homes, one ended okay by moving their parents in with them. I asked both of my kids what was the lesson learned.BOTH said, don't run your life on world events, run it to protect during bad times, no matter what those bad times are. Like having 2 children under the age of 3 in Children's hospital (me and my younger brother) when Mother went into early labor and baby brother died at birth. No health insurance in those days. Or granddaughter who went into labor early and whose baby just got released 60 days from children's hospital.  Son2 is one of those kids, he is having serious health problems and ended in ER with heart issues (not attack) the day Hubby came home from have heart surgery. Never married, has no kids, so we are his next of kin. He works for military, can't get his retirement from other military for over 10 yrs. He checked what his disability pay would be, looked at his out flow and told me he might have to move back home. Thankful, his ex girlfriend was being supportive and her with Daughter 2 (both are driving him to appts as we live 2 hrs. away and they live 15 minutes away) not only dealt with him with other testing, but both set down with him and his budget and cut the crap out of it. Both have worked over 15 yrs. as food servers and raised kids without child support being regular or at all for long periods of time. They know how to budget. My thought  BETTER THEM THAN ME. Now he is on THEIR budget, his stress level has dropped and he knows he could stay in his own home while going through all the medical testing. AND I am not worrying about having 2 elderly cats in a house a dog doesn't like cats. Then the other child told me that since Hubby farmed and I was raised the way I was that it's automatic. Even when I was a widow with a negative estate , kids at home and no income as I had just left my job as it was costing more for a babysitter (we had 4 kids and late husband's sister in home) than I was earning. There was food and TP stocked (lady products) I paid off the estate of $25,000, kept our home by doing odd jobs, housekeeping, laundry, ironing, delivered phone books (we still get one here in the mail LOL), babysitting, yard sale every other weekend. I took the house we had bought 1 step from being condemned appraised at $30,000 and 4 yrs. later had it appraised at $54,000. I got ALL of what I used to fix the home from yard sales and thrift shops.I look at things and say this is what I want done, is it a NEED or a WANT. Needs come first. Like brakes for the truck that is going to cost over $2,000. A snow blower for the tractor , Hubby says is a want, I think more NEED as the last thing he needs to do is spend hours with the  walk behind snowblower one we have snow blowing our lane after his heart attack. They already warned him about being out in the cold. E would come plow it for us as he does the two widows lanes.  I look to see if I can do it CHEAPER but not cheaply so it doesn't hold up for long term usage. It's cheaper for me to garden (get exercise, purpose and Vit. D) and to can, freeze and dehydrate than spent $$$ at the store, let alone be exposed to what ever crap (RSV, covid, flu, whooping cough as Amish do not vaccinate) going around.I still take buttons, zippers, and good material from clothing that is worn out. I just patched 2 of Hubby's work shirts. My kids have played checkers with buttons on a checkered table cloth when they were little. I still use junk mail that has nothing on the back for scrap paper. Amish will use the back of the envelope. I've gotten a lot of notes from M that way. Then we toss them in the wood stove.  Son 2 just told me he has 6 of the large packages of TP in work out room closet besides his 6 pk in the hall closet. I asked why... he noticed in a couple stores it was low on TP supplies. Figured he lived closer to his 3 sisters, niece  (who's baby of 2 months who has been in hospital since birth just went home) and his ex (she let me know they are dating again this morning) so they could come there for TP. He let them know he would even bring it to them if they needed it. I am quite sure there are 2 going to say something about that isn't in his budget. I noticed he is PAYING ATTENTION to the supply chain which he hasn't done before. Hubby notices OUR supplies... made the comment that TP was too low, if the kids came up or M needed some we wouldn't have enough to go 2 months (mentioned I went through 18 rolls in 3 weeks with Covid and Crohn's). I told him I ordered bulk and it would be here. I even mentioned that Son 2 had picked up extra for his sisters and niece. Then he noticed I was down to 1 box of Borax and 1 box of washing soda... No worry, M just borrowed a box of each and she will replace it.  That came back last night when they came over to borrow 3 dozen regular canning lids (I buy them in bulk) to can grape juice that was given to them from other family.  Do you stock anything? Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Life and saving", "date": "Tuesday, October 24, 2023", "text": "Hubby closed business credit card (took 2 weeks to get it done). They sent him a check for his cash back since there was nothing owed on the credit card. That is the final closure for the business.Went to pay the hospital bill and it wasn't matching what was on our insurance. I requested information. Explained it wasn't matching what was listed as paid on the insurance (they showed insurance had paid). I think they sent separate bills to insurance but put it all together for 1 bill for us as the doctor did that but he made note that he had combined ALL of his billing into one for us and separate for insurance.I made 5 gallons laundry soap.It's going to be in mid 70s the rest of the week, so Hubby put creosote log in wood stove last night and let it burn instead of wood to let stove go out so I can clean it today or tomorrow. Furnace is set at 68. I doubt if it gets that cold as I just looked at it and it's still 73 in house. I put in pantry  7 meals of ground beef crumbles, 10 meals of taco meat, 5 meals of chicken (leftover from roasts),  6 meals of brats(gave to us), and 2 meals of lil smokies. I have chicken/broth to can, beef/broth to can, still working on apples for apple jam and using skins and cores for apple butter and still working on tomatoes for pasta sauce. I have flash freezing smoked brats and smoked sausage.Hubby found an Amish selling sweet potatoes (most grow them but don't usually sell them in this area). She told him to stop back this week as they would be finishing digging the rest after he bought 12. One of her sweet potatoes makes 2 meals for both of us. She gave him a couple small ones for me to use to starts for us next spring.  He noticed she had potatoes on her sale board yesterday. We will be checking it out, if she has big ones like the sweet potatoes I won't have to buy baking potatoes at the store. I have small purple, small red and small Yukon potatoes that I grew myself. I have some small russets. Hubby started clearing the gardens yesterday. We plan to have it done by Thursday when the rain comes in. We had a killing frost yesterday. I hope to get the weeds dealt with in the berry vines also. I need to pull the onions in the next week or two which means I need to deal with the cured onions. I will cut some of the onion tops to dehydrate.Hubby ordered a tarp for the basement ramp from local Amish man. There is an area of about 10 ft by 10 ft at bottom of ramp. We put a nice roof over it making sure there was ventilation. I want to use it as a food storage area using the coolers to keep the winter squash in as Hubby just harvest another 8 golden acorns (neither of us remember ever growing them but they grew this year in the compost pile). I also have pumpkin, butternut, green acorn squash and one spaghetti squash. The Amish at the tarp shop asked where he was putting the tarp. When Hubby told him, he suggested he make us a \"tarp\" door  with 2 screens and told Hubby how to frame it so it wouldn't flop and tear up and then showed Hubby he had one on his own basement ramp. His wife said she first thought she would hate it but she really likes it. She uses the area for their winter squash and potatoes.Today I will cut the mint back away from the house and deal with the north flower garden, probably about 3 hrs. of the day. Hubby plans to wash the siding this week or next so I want to get the plants off the siding of the house.Following advice of two of our daughters . We got a Gold Good RX acct. Hubby takes two HEART meds that aren't covered well by insurance (what he has is best covered by what insurance he has plus our pharmacy gave him another discount) What we pay ANNUALLY for the Gold is what we will save in 2 months for the meds. I also ordered through Amazon (for free as I used my points) his aspirin 81 mg. Got him, as insurance doesn't pay for that and I see no reason for spending $2.12 for 30 aspirin when I got 500 for less than $8 (free with using the points). His nitro is good for a year, but the hospital cardiologist  ordered it to be filled every month. Hubby called our primary since they are friends also for advice. Primary backed us as it's a waste but told him to bring it up when he goes this Friday along with buying aspirin from Amazon. He already called his ENT about the cost of the nose spray (also good for a year). She told him that Gold Good Rx is great, Good Rx is good and to get a couple at least into storage but to use it daily through autumn. Also said to check out Mark Cuban Pharmacy. Which my pain doctor uses himself. Back in the day he would have just paid the price and not try to find a cheaper way to get the same thing.I did my Medicare part D. After looking at several sites for top 5 Part D's . I chose Well Care zero premium , zero on meds (gap coverage is $1.20 for all 4 a month) and $545 deductible that I shouldn't meet all year. We rechecked Hubby's D which is Silverscript. That's the best for him at $5.30/ month and $280 deductible. He will only pay $12 a month if he uses the Gold Good Rx for his nitro and nose spray. I can get my inhaler through Gold Good Rx for 1/3rd of my insurance so I didn't even list it on my meds.I have went from Humira to Visbiome (original formula of VSL#3 prior to 2016) Even with \"help\" from the company it was going to be over $1,000 a month. As I have very bad veins and can't do infusions which would have been covered under part B.  Visbiome is $62 a month (I order for 2 months amount to get that price) plus IT WORKS. I used it before 2016 and was having no flare ups for 2 years. Company sold and new owners changed to cheaper ingredients BUT didn't acknowledge it and it quit working. There is a stronger amount but I would have to have my GI send them the script straight to the company. I don't think I need stronger when this is working but it's nice to know that option is there.  I added green tea capsules to both of us. Neither of us would drink enough of it as tea. I searched for top 5... Zenwise came up in several searches. Cardiologist backed it also as a good for cholesterol, blood sugar, inflammation and metabolic syndrome.Hubby stopped at Amish and got local honey and some puffed speltz. I took 1/2 cup, added turmeric, black pepper and cinnamon. Really worked for the nasty sore throat I got from the head/chest cold. I will continue to take it through the winter. I started oil of oregano. I have a child nagging. Started like the other kid suggest. One drop in a shot of tomato juice for 3 days, increase 1 drop every 3 days, don't do more than 5 drops. Nagging child makes her own so she's walk me through when I go to make my own since I grow oregano.I have elderberry syrup that I put on my Greek yogurt. A friend gifted me elderberry mixed with local honey as they were allowed to pick elderberries from another friend's home. I have been taking resveratrol for years for my cholesterol with a 5 mg statin... I have heart failure/disfunction birth defect along with having a stroke due to accident. We can't do coconut oil as it sent our triglycerides through the roof. Not good for heart patients. Daughter 4 uses it as a mouth wash (had infected tooth and her dentist suggested it) and grandchild uses it for skin care. So it won't go to waste.I best get at the day's workBlessed be Prayers for peace"},
{"title": "First Hard Freeze warning", "date": "Sunday, October 22, 2023", "text": "for tonight. We haven't had a frost to harm anything. I will need to cover my onions up and move my radishes that are in pots into the barn. Supposed to warm back up to the 60s even close to 70 the rest of the week. SO covering them will allow them to have another week or so of growth before I start pulling them. I will have to bring the apples in that are sitting on the porch. I have 4 plants still blooming so I will bring them in also. A lot to do on a Sunday.I did 21 pints of applesauce. I have room for 15 more it I triple stack them which I really don't like doing. Hubby told me to do the apple jam which we are low on  and then apple butter (I usually only use cores and peels to do) for the rest of the apples. I use apple butter as the \"frosting\" on spice cakes or carrot cakes beside just putting on bread and rolls. That should use up the last of those apples. I need to put the rest of the honey crisp apples in the freezer room frig.I got 5 qrts. of pasta sauce canned out of 2 gallons of juice.We moved the last of the Yukon gold potatoes, russet potatoes, and sweet potatoes to the basement. I put an apple with each crate as I had a couple Amish tell me it helps keeps them from sprouting. Hubby measured basement ramp opening (4 ft wide). He wants to put a clear tarp (Amish made) there so I can use that area for root veggies and squashes.I froze and bagged apple brats, beer brats and original brats.I froze and bagged chicken thighs.I roasted 2 whole chickens, had roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and corn (starchy meal) and an apple custard with meringue sent over from M. We then had baby carrots and celery as a snack. Hubby also had an apple with peanut butter later. Hubby stacked more day time, night time and what he now calls cook time fire wood in house and on porch. Almost ran me over around the stove with all the wood but I realized that the cook time firewood is pretty helpful. It's small and burns quick. I needed to bump up the \"temp\" to roast the chicken but not for 3 hrs. like day time wood would burn. M showed him the other day when he was over to talk to E her cook time fire wood.Monday's work Pay the hospital bill that came in for Hubby's heart attack. I have to keep repeating we have the money back for those bills to him as it sends him into a panic when he gets them.I will be taking chicken off the bone and separating it for meals and bagging it for the freezer. Then I will cook the bones to make broth and can it.  ACTUALLY I will take it off the bone today when I make supper and do bone broth on Monday.I have hamburger to cook to make taco meat (bagged in 1 cup servings) and ground beef crumbles for freezer. That's for Monday also.I have smoke sausage links (size of hotdogs) to repackage, bag and put in freezer.I try to do most of \"nasty trash stuff\" like meat packages etc. on Monday because trash goes to the road Monday night. Our trash is picked up between 4 and 6 AM  Monday morning. Cook more tomatoes for juice to make pasta sauce . I leave the juice sit over night to let the water come to the top, remove it and then slow cook the sauce all day. Let it sit over night (to make sure all the \"water\" is out) and can the next day.  Hubby said when I was done with onions and tomatoes he would \"stir\" the compost pile and then have E put manure over it.E said he thinks he will be over to mow around pond and the asparagus ferns this coming week. He made it clear to Hubby that Hubby was NOT to be up on the roof of the wood shed replacing the roof. He would do that for us. Hubby said he had patched it so it doesn't leak before his heart attack but he had offered that he would ask one of the other Amish to help as E really is overloaded with work that needs done since his family day to help him with his wash house did not happen so M's wash house is still not done. He also got really cheap materials to build a saw mill so he could work no matter what the weather. His saw is sitting in the open close to our property where the berries are at. He is moving it closer to his own driveway to help trucks from getting stuck in the mud when unloading logs. Three times last spring Hubby had to pull trucks out that got stuck. BUT he made it clear Hubby was NOT to have someone else come do it or be up there himself. I laughed when Hubby said he wasn't going to tick off the neighbor... we might not get any more free eggs and desserts LOL.I had to buy clothes. I hate shopping for clothes and ALWAYS question two of my girls and one granddaughter where the sales are and what they are wearing as their style is more like mine and they are close to my size.  I looked at 4 different thrift shops and found nothing. I have lost 20 lbs. from being sick and the weight is not coming back on. I hate shopping for bras. But I was lucky that granddaughter who is just close to my size told me what she wears and because we were at Hubby's ENT appt. (no cancer, no tumors, nothing to be concerned about, doc figures he is losing his voice do to allergy reaction from wildfire smoke. So will have that dealt with and some voice therapy as he has always been a little \"gravelly\" in speaking) Hubby wanted to stop at Meijer's We don't have one close to us but the kids do. Not only did they carry the bra granddaughter wears (fits great), they were on sale for half price. I also go 2 pairs of every day spandex pants for half price and 3 shawl like vests with hood also half price. I don't have any \"dress\" jackets and the hoodie I wear at home is definitely seen better days. I texted a friend (she's my size) and let her know they had a sale going on. She texted me back to stop and try on the \"dress\" pants she just bought. They were lovely. Hubby told me to order some also as I have NO dress pants. She gave me a code she was given to share (so she gets another discount) and I was able to hit their sale and ended up getting 4 pairs for the price of 2 AND free shipping.  THEN a Facebook \"friend\" let me know she had just bought boots from Amazon that were warm and fit well. She wear's same size as me. I checked it out and ordered 2, one at ankle and one above ankle, both on sale.BEST PART... even with buying so much I am still under budget for clothing. Hubby even picked up another pair of boots, one with steel toes and rubber coating over the toes for 25% off. He is still under budget for clothing. I also just put what is too big for me now back into storage in barn. Hubby thought we should cut that budget some... I am not going to do that as he still has 30 lbs. to lose. He's lost 30 lbs. this year. I've taken darts in all his pants. BUT I know if he loses the other 30 he will need new pants. I do have some put back that got too small for him that were still good. I can see him dropping in shirt size also. He used to wear 3 x large. His long sleeve shirts are x lg. his tee shirts are lg. His pants were 56 waist, now are 44 waist. He'll probably need a new belt also. On the nice side we inputted the RRA (retiree reimbursement acct.)acct. that Hubby got from work. When he was retiring they told him that they had did away with that. Found out that he got it due to the years he had in. They gave him the amount we would be getting. I figured out that it will cover the cost of our dental and eyeglasses ... maybe if those stay on the low side, cover his hearing aids when he has to replace them. Anything not used in one year is ROLLED OVER to the next year.Our primary used to be \" no\" to anything holistic... his daughter went to Africa (she's a doctor) came home and told what they use there... he no longer is a no to holistic. IN FACT, we were talking (as we are friends also) and he mentioned his Daughter was telling her patients with metabolic syndrome to use green tea (capsules or tea) to help along with those that have IBD and IBS...He checked it out and felt it would be good for both of us. BUT mentioned it lowers the iron and I would need to watch that part as I struggle with low iron (always have).  I have green tea (tea and capsules) for other reasons but we decided to start that immediately to see if it helps. I actually wished his Daughter was working in the area as she does both traditional medical and holistic. Menu for the week:Today: Bacon and tomato wraps, salad blend, M's dessertMonday: chicken and noodles, mashed potatoes, cole slawTuesday: steak, baked potato, salad, rollsWednesday: mackerel patties, boiled potatoes with butter, peasThursday: One pot green beans, ham and potatoes with corn bread (pick up more salad and milk if needed after doc appt)Friday: fried cabbage with sausage, fried potatoes and onions, left over corn breadSaturday: stuffed shells , meatballs, salad and garlic toast.Hubby has asked for me to bake bread, make granola, bake monster cookies, bake custard pie (pie crust optional) and make ice cream to go between the cookies. He is thinking on ice cream sandwich (cookie) would be a good sweet that would limit him instead of a bowl of ice cream. He used to eat half gallon of ice cream at a time, then he went to a quart. Then it was a pint. He has found that he can get a ice cream sundae at the gas station (where we get $11 pizza at times) and it's enough. It's 1/2 cup.... I reframed from dancing in joy.How has your week being going?Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "After almost 5 weeks ", "date": "Wednesday, October 18, 2023", "text": "We went to the store. I am thankful the only thing we had to pick up was a gallon of milk while sick.I spent $379.37 at Kroger's with $108.71 savings (5 % cash back) plus $9.50 in Fresh Mode rewards. I spent $47.90 at Country Variety Store on 1 1/2 bushels of apples and 6 pears. *check or cash only* Saved $6I spent $106.90 at Save A Lot with savings of $6.82 (3 % cash back)We have enough to go 6 weeks (not counting anything I already have in freezers) with only picking up fresh produce and milk.I got chuck roast on sale, made it last night with red potatoes (from garden) orange carrots (we already ate all of ours) and white onion from B (add $10 for 15 lbs. of candy onions from B). I will be canning 3 qrts. of beef and broth and 1 qrt. of just broth. Tonight's supper will be roasted chicken. I have 2 that will be cooked same time in wood stove. I will then pick off the pieces for other meals and make broth and can it.At Kroger's I also go a pork shoulder( in freezer), skinless boneless chicken thighs * to be vacuumed bagged and frozen, beef hotdogs bagged and frozen(me only) mini sausage links (Hubby requested pigs in blanket), shrimp, hamburger (make taco meat and cooked ground beef) and a turkey ON SALE. I got 3 salads, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, carrots (big) and mushrooms. I replaced the Sprite and Coke I went through while sick. I got yogurt as my yogurt maker is on order, cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, goat cheese, Vit D milk, heavy cream, half and half and buttermilk. I did very well at writing my list in the way I shop (non perishables first, produce, meat then dairy) so I did NO backtracking. I wore a mask. LORD I was done by time we put it in the truck and worried I was going to be sick from getting too hot. But Hubby cranked the AC up and rolled my window down. By time we got to Country Variety store I was fine.I got apples for fresh eating (Hubby is trying to eat apple with peanut butter instead of almond chocolate bar with peanut butter for his bedtime snack) and apples for applesauce.  I got 6 pears for fresh eating. They charged bushel price for the applesauce apples instead of the 1/2 bushel since I bought 2 of them saving me $6.At Save A Lot ,I got baby carrots (Kroger's looked bad) smoke sausage links (size of bun size hotdog) brat patties, and brats to be rebagged and frozen. I got 2 T-bone steaks as Hubby mentioned he missed getting his steak dinner at Lock 16 for his birthday. He does NOT want to go out to eat. So this weekend I will fix him a steak dinner as close as I can to what he would order.  I got pizza rolls for our lunch and I bought the size of bag that would ONLY be lunch instead of us pit stopping for a sandwich (saving about half of what the sandwiches would have been).I wrote out the meals I was going to serve: Leftover beef brisket from Sunday is going to be fajitasBeef roast with veggies, beef stew, beef and noodle, beef pot pieRoasted chicken, autumn stew, chicken pot pie, and chicken and noodlesMock Lock 16 Steak dinnerPork shoulder roast, mock Brunswick stew, Cuban pork, pork and cabbage casserolePigs in BlanketChicken Shrimp stir fryShrimp scampi Smoked sausageBrat pattiesBratsI also have potstickers and egg rolls, pepperoni and sausage for pizza, stuffed shells, stuffed manicotti, lasagna rolls, penne and spaghetti, Swedish meat balls, meat loaf, Salisbury steak, tacos, crispy bean burritos, breaded pork tenderloin, BLT (while I have fresh tomatoes) grilled cheese with tomato soup, fried bologna, fried ham slices, Philly steak subs, Gordan air fryer fish,  mackerel patties, salmon patties, tuna noodle casserole, fried cabbage (from garden) with fried potatoes (garden) with sausage or ham, one pot green beans, potatoes and ham,  pancakes, waffles , French toast and eggs.  Crepes, I want to learn to make crepes. We should be able to only need dairy and fresh produce until Dec if not Jan. I spent $549.17.... if we don't go back to store for 4 wks. that is  $137.30 a weekIF we can go 6 weeks (only getting dairy, celery and carrots) that is $91.53 a week. I have 5 meals listed so that is 7.8 weeks that's $73.22 a week... SO I am looking at not going back for at least 7 weeks, that's the beginning of Dec. Which is why I went ahead and got the turkey for 99 cents a lb. Not counting soups and casseroles from scraps. I know I have more brisket, 2 pork tenderloins and plenty of bacon and sausage. I am low of pork chops though. Blessed Be Off to deal with more tomatoes"},
{"title": "tomatoes", "date": "Friday, October 13, 2023", "text": "He was working on the trimmer. He did finally after 4 days get the property trimmed and mowed except around the pond. He will do that so E can mow at the edge with his hay mower which is to the side instead of straight with the horses.  I have 29 qrts. of tomatoes to wipe down and take down. Not sure where I am going to be putting the rest of it. But am going to cook it down to can sauce and not over do it.Blessed bePrayers for peace I have no clue to what she wants. I let her out, in , out and back in. She just sat there. Finally she went and laid on the couch. She's probably wondering when I am going to stop coughing. I fed the stove, good thing I was up as it would have been completely out by morning.I am coughing still, it's a bad cough but not as often. Our Nurse called Tuesday to get Hubby's Medicare info as we have a phone appt on Wed and I coughed while he was giving her the info... she actually sighed. But it's better, it doesn't hurt to cough as much or every time. Morning and evening are the worse, it's not rattling and things are still breaking up. No fever, icky crap is clear so no infection. The meds will start messing with my Crohn's (never ending circle) in a couple days so I am backing off a little of that before that happens.  Doc called. One day of work, one day of rest. Hubby to take rest breaks and remember this cold winter will affect him differently. He definitely didn't get the same ickes I gotElectric bill is in at $126. There was AC on that bill so it's not bad. I am using the dryer for bedding and throw blankets. My co op figured if I do 3 hrs. a week in the dryer, my electric will raise about $25. SO I need to try to limit use of other electric to balance that out. Hubby got his surgery bill... He owes nothing of the $65,000 bill. BECAUSE he maxed out his out of pocket in Urgent care, ER and the ambulance  to transported him to the other hospital for surgery. Those bills are still out there.  One bill our health insurance flagged as a surprise billing and for us to NOT pay it until we called them as they were negotiating with the company over the bill. The ambulance was not provider under our insurance. It's not like we get to chose who transported him... DUH.I bought a high yield 9 month CD from Ally. Added enough to both of our savings to be back up to what we want in regular bank. Paid 1 month extra to mortgage and added enough to Money market to cover most of 2024 out of pocket medical. I asked 4 different financial advisors about car loan. Every single one said to follow the 20/4/7 rule (couple kids said they saw the same with Rocket mortgage) 20% down, only for 4 yrs (48 months) and no more than 7% of gross yearly income. Which is almost what I felt we should only pay and Son 2 is looking at the same.Blessed BePrayers for peace"},

SIGH I am now carrying Bleed Cease in my pocket. Doc has me taking my temp 3 times a days to make sure I am not running a fever. SO far nothing. Echinacea tea, honey tea, ginger tea and elderberry honey in my white tea is helping. I ate chili last night, boy did that break some crud loose. My tummy wasn't happy with me but I could BREATHE. Doc did add bronkaid and Mucinex DM and cooked onion, ordered to drink the juice LOL. What ever I am to cough up I am to spit out or it will trigger my Crohn's.... guess he doesn't understand it raging anyways. Drainage does that.Hubby is now holding his fingers in a cross when I come near him to ward off my \"evil\" cooties. I try not to be close. Lysol twice a day now instead of once. Windows are open with the wood stove so we do have fresh air all the time. Humidifier in front room is on 60. I will be turning the hallway one on today.Hubby took a trip down memory lane something he doesn't do much.I remember, he started, when you had 3 surgeries in 3 months... Oct/ Nov/ Dec. 1995. We had 3 kids with serious mental issues and you was juggling \"women\" issues your self. Yep right after we got married and he spoiled the kids by baking snickerdoodles for Thanksgiving dinner along with no bake double layer pumpkin pie and I sat curled up in a chair in the dining room. Then it was I remember, you have 3 different pneumonias  Oct/Nov/ Dec.Yep, 2008 we lost both houses, moved Daughter 2 and her family of 9 and then us from a 3500 sq ft home to a 800 sq ft rental and had 5 storage units  and filed bankruptcy when he went to 3 days a week work instead of 7 days a week work. Talk about income dropping.Then since Brother was texting Hubby (he was with uncle in hospital is doing a lot better and aunt don't look like she's going to fall over) And BROTHER textsI remember coming home from college for Thanksgiving and finding she had not even started school.5th grade, rheumatic fever. Sept through Dec. I did work at home, teacher stopped to give Mom my work daily and started back in January.   THEN my Aunt said, she remembered Daddy saying I was Aunt Hazel who caught everything and anything within a ten mile radius. SO I finally asked... what is the point you are trying to make?YOU get really sick in the fall of the year when YOU am under a lot of stress...Brother was NO.... she's allergic to mold and that's fall... TRUE... beans coming off, hay, corn isn't as bad with it because E takes out rows in middle to allow air flow to help dry his corn. But yeah, it's the mold. I can't walk in a barn that has hay in the mow. I can't take penicillin for that reason. It nearly killed me, Hubby could remember nearly losing me, they sent me home to die. But he couldn't remember what caused it. They gave me a medication that had penicillin in it and it didn't red flag it at the hospital but did at CVS. WHO immediately called Hubby and my doctor to tell them what was happening. But looking back at the cycle... fall is my stress time on top of when my allergies are their worse. I getting the crops in to feed us through the winter, getting the home battened down for the winter and facing bills going up due to winter. NOW, I can see the pattern... how can I change it? I can't do anything about mold season as Brother who is allergic everything said.  BUT what can I change ? IF you have any thoughts please comment as I know this change won't be easy for me. I am a creature of habit."},
{"title": "talking finances with Hubby", "date": "Sunday, October 8, 2023", "text": "I am thankful we have decent health insurance. The medical bills from Hubby's heart attack, my Crohn's and UTI and then covid is starting to come in. We put them on the credit cards (all have cash back).Hubby asked me yesterday what I was doing. He thought I said I paid the bills until after our SS comes in. I did say that, I did do that.He is doing better to stay focused and process what we are talking about but with mild dementia I do have to repeat myself. He is not good at finances and never has been as he grew up on farm loans that got rolled over it they couldn't pay them off.I was checking what was on the credit cards. They all have cash back. We use certain cards for certain stores/ things to get the most back. So I broke it down for him.I have one card that is for utilities and automatic payments like our umbrella ins that is due once a year. Since that is all that goes on it, it's easy to see if there is any fraud charges.Hubby has 2 that is just his and one we both are on. His cell phone and Sirius  are on his, the other one is business and he's shutting it down but our bank offered to issue him a new card for personal. He is going to go in and talk to them, see the lady that has handled mine as she's really into , this would give you this but cost you that but this one would do the same for more for your effort kind of person. Knowing him, it's going to be cash back on what he would use it for. I suggested auto repairs and fuel. That's where it goes now. We'll figure that one out after he goes in at the end of the week. TSC is for the farm so we are both on it. We put groceries on it also. It's easy to see on his cards or TSC if there is fraud. I watch Chase as it's my Amazon card and eating out . I make sure the only thing being charged is what should be. They have caught a couple fraud attempts and denied the charges so that's good.  I canceled all my auto shipments. I have us stocked for 2 years if we don't share with a single kid or grandkid. I had one OTC med that Hubby is no longer taking since his heart surgery. I put it out to the kids and it was gone in a week since I write the price on it I knew what to have the kids pay me. One said that price had doubled in the past 3 months as she was trying to stock up for her and her daughter. They now have enough to go 6 months. I checked out the last credit card, it had all the medical on it and it was NOT a pretty sight. I paid it off . I NEVER carry a balance that will be charged interest. I told Hubby the credit cards are up to high (when you haven't went anywhere for almost a month you might wonder what is going on) then added the medical bills are coming in. I have the money in the money market and savings. I try to always have the next year's out of pocket/dental/ eye costs saved by Nov for the following year so we never stress about paying medical bills (something he did while farming until he went to work in the factory and I always did being self employed) BUT if I use the money market to pay the incoming bills we won't have enough to cover next year's out of pocket/dental/ eye...So I did the shuffle (he rolls his eyes when I say that). We have 4 CD's maturing. They will be in before the rest of the bills will be in. I am going to take them to pay off the medical add what is left to the Money market and we will have enough to cover 2024's out of pocket. I even using the estimate for part D added enough to cover our routine meds. Added enough to pay for 1 set of glasses through Walmart and dental including x rays for us for the whole year. I still need to do Christmas cash and 2024 bday money but that comes out of my annuity I get monthly.  He sat looking at me. I waited then asked... what are you thinking?SO....(he is worse than the kids using that word), we can use the maturing CD's for this year's medical. Roll what is left over onto the money market and have 2024's medical pretty much covered. YES since we both have Medigap policies that should cover it.  We have 2 yrs of OTC meds. YES, I do have some holistic (dandelion root tea for his gout) also just not 2 years. We have propane for the year (cook stove and water heater) and part of the wood with a wagon load (3 cords) to come from the sawmill in next month.  YESHe was able to cut some wood up yesterday. E was out picking corn from 15 acres behind us by hand for his beef cattle and had the boys spend about an hour helping Hubby get some wood cut up. E helped him set up the buzz saw and splitter. So we have a good solid month already cut and ready. E said it's set now that Hubby can use the tractor to move the wood to the saw or splitter and not him trying to lift it. E and the boys will be checking the wood supply when they are picking corn which will be ALL winter. E said there is about 4 months of wood sitting here . He knows Hubby still have 2 trees to pull up from the woods and the 3 cords coming from the sawmill would take us another month. That should take us to Feb. and he told Hubby that. We can put in at the sawmill we want another wagon and it would come in about that time and take us through Feb/ March. So we have heat... I added.... We have full freezers, full pantry when I finish tomatoes and applesauce. Even if I add fresh veggies we can keep the grocery bill down below $200. I just harvested sage to dehydrate and grind which was the last of what I needed. I MIGHT need to pick up garlic bulbs but I do have garlic powder. Lysol was the last thing I needed for cleaning as I make my own laundry soap. We don't need clothes, shoes or boots. I might replace muck boots if they go on sale, right now they are sprayed with flexseal to keep from getting my feet wet. We shop Amish bulk, Mennonite bulk, small business specialty stores.  THEN he said finally what was worrying him. We aren't going to get the house paid off in 5 yrs. and we need to replace the Silverado in 2024.  Probably not on the mortgage. I am still checking the dealership I bought the Silverado from  BUT right now I can earn twice as much interest on a CD than I would save paying extra on the mortgage. SO the shuffle it earn the interest, let the interest pay the extra on the mortgage. I figured a $600 car payment to go into savings/ short term CD monthly. Go at least until June before replacing Silverado and I already have half the down payment if we got a loan (rather not). He sat looking at me.... then said OKAY you are being your Dad, let the investments pay the bills when you roll them over.  I can handle that. IT was like watching a mountain fall off his shoulders. Then I pointed out if I cashed out and paid through the nose on taxes I could pay OFF the house if something bad happened just from my inheritance from my Dad. AND I would still have enough money to live on monthly with his SS check without any investments. He did say he wants to get the business closed this coming week and then after his ENT appt. for what ever is causing him to lose his voice every afternoon. He wants to have an appt for the lawyer to update will etc. That appt. is usually a battle but since the heart attack he's realized that side of things need to be kept updated. I did not tell him I was already making an extra payment every month on the mortgage. Basically turning the 30 yr mortgage into a 15 yr mortgage. In the past 24 months I have made 72 payments. IF I can only make 1 extra payment a month average we will still have the house paid off in 12 yrs. He would be 77. IF I can continue to make 3 payments a month, it will be 8 yrs making him 73. We will see."},
{"title": "Anne Grandfather clock. Sam's club and conversation with Amish", "date": "Saturday, October 7, 2023", "text": "We have had it worked on 3 times. The glass actually broke in half, then it quit chiming, then it chimed wrong . FR complained to the company that made the \"sound\" system. They gave him money back over it and he gave it back to us. It does keep good time. It's not an issue to get fixed as FR can do it himself and he just pit stops when over using the phone or talking to E about stuff. The kids argue who gets it when we die until we told them it was going to auction. Then it was nope, Amish will out bid us LOL. First fire rolling. Right now it's 40 outside with windchill of 35 and it's to be colder by tomorrow. Damp for sure but not rain which we need. We used to do Sam's club, but it's not worth the price of membership nor do we use that size of items any more. Twice I have had fraud charges from the local Sam's club also. Plus it's a good 45 minutes from us... If I was over in Marion visiting in laws we could stop at GFS like my brother does. Having an IBS or IBD (mine is Crohn's) extremely limits fresh/raw anything. I am lucky if I can get a 2 cup side salad without spending 2 days in bathroom from doing so. Been there and done that still eating the 2 cup side salad but figuring out if I can spend 2 days running to the bathroom.I did talk to A, she has Crohn's also. Asked her how she was handling it especially being Amish. She's eating fermented and pickled foods and found by doing so daily, she doesn't have as bad as time when she eats something raw. Still only eats maybe 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup raw at a time and not more than once a day. But insisted I start eating more fermented and pickled foods. This young woman is the age of my girls, I bet Hubby she will stop over in the next month and ask what I have ate that was fermented or pickled. She also said she has taken to eating some kind of apple daily. Daddy did that also. She makes her own cottage cheese and has it twice a week. I got twenty questions over what fruit I was putting on the table daily. Yeah, she'll be over here questioning me SMILING.I can tell you one of the years of next to NONE flare ups of Crohn's was when I was taking VSL#3 ORIGINAL formula (now called Visbiome which I have in frig to start for when I am done with this ickes) and eating pickles or pickled beets 5 days a week with applesauce and cottage cheese. Had it for lunch almost daily with pizza rolls on Saturday LOL. I don't think the pizza rolls helped anything other than my inter child.  My inner child got a nap on the kitchen porch floor in the sunshine with Charlotte yesterday. Hubby said since I had a pillow he wasn't worried but the Amish that used the phone stopped at the wood shed to tell him I was down. He let him know I was napping with the dog and getting our vitamin D. Said the guy first frowned and then said that actually made sense. I went down to the basement and looked... what do I have fermented.I have canned :  fermented kraut, coleslaw, cucumber pickles, pickled asparagus, pickled beets, pickled cauliflower with turmeric, green olives stuffed with garlic, pickled peppers with turmeric. pickled onions with turmeric and salad peppers.  I am low (very low) on applesauce. Hubby said we would pick up apples this coming week. I have enough apple pie filling (home canned with little sugar), I have dehydrated apple slices. I told Hubby I wanted to get that on the table. So this weekend (while I now have a either a head cold or allergies are full blown) we will be changing what is in the kitchen frig to have those items go on the table. MIL suggested pulling one thing every meal, she rotates daily which one she puts on the table."},
{"title": "OKAY... goals for October", "date": "Friday, October 6, 2023", "text": "I NEED to ask myself daily... how can I save money today?  What can I change to stretch those dollars.  Hubby started Medicare this month. He chose to stay with what he picked for these last 3 months for next year. We will be updating the will after closing business. Lawyer said to wait 30 days after business is closed. About half the kids are ticked, the other half agree with our choice, he gets it or I get it ( they all agree with that)and if both are gone, it goes to auction. I calmed a few down with tell me what you are wanting and I will work it out you get it BEFORE I die. Especially when I am decluttering anyways. I got one moving in a year, she plans to get a place that she can have the old cabinet that was my great great uncles. I will keep that aside for her, Might even see if the one Amish grandpa could repair it during this winter. He likes to have something to do and has fixed a couple other things for me. Another wants a trunk and stand, I use the stand, but it will be listed as hers.  It's kind of WORK with not AGAINST me. I still need to pick Part D. I am still deciding between 3 of them. One has no premium, no charge for my regular meds but a $545 deductible... HUM ... seems funny to me. The other one is what Hubby has $5.30 premium, $4 for one med the rest are 0 and $280 deductible. The other one is $78.90, meds are 0 and no deductible. CLOSE business checking. Hubby went to close it, his insurance let him know he had 2 checks coming in the mail for the business... so he waited. THEN he was going to go the other day before he had the heart attack and got another check from the bank that had the truck loan as they had a secondary insurance on that loan so he got money back from that. MAYBE he will be able to close it at the end of this week as Doc said that with negative test (we finally tested negative) and no fever, we could go out after the 11th BUT we must wear a mask. So no eating out. Okay, we did take out last night, first time in 3 wks. We loaded up with Chinese and actually ate a decent amount for the first time. Still visiting the bathroom more than normal.  Hubby has lost 10 lbs. and I have lost 17lbs.  Hubby listed 8 things he would like to have done by end of October. Couple repair jobs, over half are jobs that would take him about an hour. Keeps him moving and yet not over doing anything. He has a couple Amish that have him move trailers around for them maybe a couple times a month if that often to give him some spending money.309 sawmill will have him use their loader to move some wood around for them.  Wood cut was not on the list. He figures he will be cutting wood until end of Nov. E told him that there is a couple trees he cut down that Hubby can get to with the tractor to pull up over here that can be be burned this year. 309 Sawmill told him they would have a wagon load of cut pieces for him late Oct or early Nov, those we usually don't have to cut down to size. He plans to move wagon out of barn, set up buzz saw and cut what we have down to correct size. If nothing else, he has learned to mark the freaking saw like E has of the length and quit guessing as he cut 2 cords of wood 2 inches too long and they won't go in the stove. Good thing I don't mind tossing small blocks of wood in during the day. I did suggest he just cut them in half, still on small size but not as big as pain to store as small blocks go in large pots... the size 5 yr. old trees come in and we can actually rack them if they are cut in half. We get through this cold spell and he can do some cutting but I think he is going to finish the wood shed first. E will have to help him do the roof but he can always go over and help E work on the wash house to help that way.  I definitely am making sure he does take rest breaks and drinks water... okay, man drinks water without being told but he won't drink the water if he doesn't take the break. Household, put things away that came in while sick. I haven't touched anything and am walking around stacks and need to split some packages with Daughter 4. Hubby asked if we needed to stock anything else... I said Lysol spray. He thought I was joking. I used 24 cans in 1 year. No I am not joking, between the house and both trucks, carried it with us to the kids houses to spray before we walked in. MIL used 12 herself and didn't think to spray her car... she is now as their grandsons whole church came down with covid over the weekend. I need to straighten the pantry, move shelving in the freezer room (no more window leaking) and deal with organization and a very good cleaning.  I have taken to opening windows for 30 minutes daily and spraying with Lysol like I did when Covid hit the first time. Bathrooms cleaned daily. My kitchen sink is cleaned nightly when I run the dishwasher. Laundry done every morning (except Sunday) I will continue to declutter the house and the barn. I started a donation box and a kids box. Kid's box is stored in barn so when we go down or one comes up we can take it then but it's not in the way. I have listed seeds I need to order for next year. I plan to start growing my own plants. We are saving $133. 34 a month with Hubby going on Medicare. I want to split that money between the mortgage and the savings.  We will save more when I go on it in Jan.Hubby got the internet/phone lowered by $10. That will be split also. Our insurance guy did some looking and found another discount for us on car insurance dropping the bill $125.19 a month and changed billing cycle . That will be split in two.All refunds or savings like Fresh mode, etc. will be split the same way. I've done this before but have let it slide.Doc wants us to eat a fresh salad twice a week, 3 times is better. It doesn't have to be a lettuce salad, just fresh veggies. I asked if just serving carrots, celery sticks, fresh apples, cabbage as I have that in frig also etc. would be okay... he said yes but wanted some colorful greens in there once a week.  I have some carrots in frig. I need to cut the celery today anyways in the gardens. I am NOT going to the store until after the 11th. I am not sure what lettuces the local Save A Lot carries but I will check it out after the 11th. WITH MASK LOL.I want to go to store once a month (Amish elder suggested it) with a dairy run two weeks later. Said she saved over $100 by that simple changed, used up what she had and made different foods than her normal routine meals. One suggested pantry soup for supper every single night with a meat, potato and veggie lunch, one suggested lunch leftovers become soup or casserole. (M laughed when I told her and asked what was leftovers because she definitely doesn't have those any meal unless someone is sick)  Helps keep the weight down. I am glad they feel comfortable to offer advice. I will take all the advice I can get on saving money and being healthy.  We are are 2 yrs into our mortgage (refinanced to get PI off and lower interest) We are on payment 72. I know that's 36 payments in 12 months. I would like to do BETTER but reality is I will be lucky to do that much with a drop of 50 % income. By using the grill for the tomatoes I keep that off the propane tank for the furnace. Hubby debated last night between the wood stove or furnace. He decided neither at 10 pm when the house was still 75. I got it closed up and curtains shut before it cooled down. It's still 73 so we won't be starting the wood stove or furnace.  Probably going to go take a nap. Been up since 12:30 when my sugar work me up being low.I asked him what he wanted to do for his birthday... he looked and me and saidLIVE. This is my favorite photo of him. He was on the tractor and had just turned it off to see what I wanted. He wasn't thrilled to have his picture taken. Never is. Oh yeah I can understand that comment.  Our oldest (late hubby's daughter) turned 51 yesterday. She's put on more than one application that Hubby is her step dad. Makes him feel good that she knows he is there for her. Brother is 74 today, though he refuses to celebrate that age he tolerates his sister reminding him.We have 2 grandkids birthdays and Daughter 4's birthday. October is a busy month. I got this last night with the comment I am still having chest painsYes he knows I am sharing. I was like... where are you, who is with you, wait, that's normal BP , that's anxiety, wait until I get ahold of you. I ratted him out to his sister who ratted him out to his ex about scaring me like that... His doctor that was in the room told him to quit messing with his mom. He was having testing done to make sure he did not have brain damage from explosions while in Iraq 2 years...Doc said NONE, it's in his medical file but I am telling you I think he had it BEFORE then LOL.I can say we shared the GOOD news. It will calm some of his worries about whether he will be not able to work another 20 yrs. He already has 20 in the Army, wants 20 in Airforce civilian, maybe 25 and then plans to travel if he is physically able. BUT he also knows his house is not handicap accessible. He thought about changing it (close to what he paid for the house to do it) His sister told him to wait, everyone was going to move here and he could have a room since he would be retired he wouldn't have to worry about finding a job in this area.  GEEZEI sent Daughter 2 the annual photo of her Halloween pumpkin... he is getting saggy faced from being so old. She tossed it in 2008 as the lights had died. I changed the lights and bug her each year over it.    He's peaking around at E's kids when they come up on the porch. They got a kick out of seeing it.We got the tarp up that we had made for the end of the porch. Several Amish have this on their porches to keep fire wood dry or the wives to be able to dry laundry on the porch in the winter. I love the fact it has a built in screen that can be opened or closed so we don't have to take it down in the summer, we can just open the screen. It's not hard to take down either as it had special hooks that Hubby said he just slid the hole over and turned it and it was fastened. E checked it out when he was checking out what Hubby was doing with fire wood(used tractor bucket to carry it and then we slowly filled the racks) Took 2 days to get them filled and the two in the house filled but it will take 3 days to use what wood is there up or more depending on how long it stays cold. He thinks M would like to have one when they build the new porch next year. He is going to have her check it out some time. Rest of wood All summer curtains, clothes, bedding and throws are washed, dried and put in barn storage.All winter curtains are up on clean windows,(the only thing I have cleaned beside johns) winter bedding and throws are washed and on beds and furniture and winter clothes are in the drawers. I still need to pick tomatoes today before the nasty 40 degree crap hits with possible frost. I already set up the area at the barn at the grill so it's pick the tomatoes, take to grill at barn. Hubby will put large canner (19 quart... reg quart not wide mouth) on the stove and I can haul through the tomatoes. Core them, grill them, skin them, can them. I can do what ever with them later. I plan on more soups and casseroles this winter anyways. I won't take down the garden. We can do that next week when it gets back up to the 60s. We got some rain, no where near enough but at least some."},
{"title": "October 5th ", "date": "Thursday, October 5, 2023", "text": "This hawk has been here daily for a week now. We know he has caught several mice usually from the compost pile. Our oldest *my late husband's daughter that we were raising when he died* turns 51 today. I told her she had to stop having birthdays. I am NOT that old myself. She just laughed. She has a lot of health issues that she inherited from her mother's side and it's been a really rough year for her.Hubby is better... not got the hacking cough nightly. Been working on 1 thing each day with lots of breaks. E came over and helped him run the apple cider press. They even took my applesauce apples so I will have to replace those. Kids got to climb the widow's apple tree then help press those apples. Local press is running 2 wks. behind. Made 500 gallons over the weekend. That's huge.Hubby was able to get the tarp up on the end of the front porch (pics coming later this week) and even put a little bit of fire wood up on the roll cart.I got the potatoes washed and crated. And a good part of winter bedding, winter curtains and winter clothes washed and in house. I should be able to finish it today. I NEED to get the tomatoes picked as we have warning of a frost this weekend which will ruin them. I will core them, toss on grill to char, let them cool and peel them then can them. Not making sauce or juice at this time. Quick and simple. I can store picked ones in the barn as I get through them. Still nauseated, still have bathroom issues, but no fever or cough. Makes my good tasting water even from the garden hose taste like crap."},
{"title": "GOD PLEASE", "date": "Sunday, October 1, 2023", "text": "give me the strength and the right words to say since I can't give my family hugs and be there for them  while  I have covid.On a good note, Little E asked his mom if he could help bake chocolate chip cookies for us so we would feel better. He remembered I gave them a ice cream bucket of chocolate chips a while back. We got too many and had no storage left for them. He loaded the chips in as she let him put what he felt was right in. So we got 2 dozen cookies from Little E (might let him take more food if it gets us cookies like that) and 3 dozen eggs as they know we feed eggs to Charlotte for her allergies and we have been able to handle eating that also. The kids definitely have found how much they lean on me instead of their dad (who can't be there either) since 5 out of six is NOT married or in relationship. I told the ones that have adult kids that responsibility has to be moved down which means we still deal with the 2 sons. Son1 just went and signed papers for two of his close friends that live close to him to sign papers for him in health emergency. Son2 is counting on Daughter 2 and 4. Daughter 3 does not drive so could not go to hospital to sign. Daughter 1 lives farther away from him then we doI don't usually get on line on Sunday's.  Day 5 or 6 as we think the \"cold\" Hubby thought he was getting was actually Covid. We just decided when we finish the meds we would take the 2nd test then because we definitely missed a dosage , me morning and hubby night.  We actually ate a meal last night, kept it down but then both of us spent the evening in the johns. We had an Amish neighbor around the corner call us to ask if we needed anything from town, even meds as he was going in and thought since we had covid we wouldn't be able to go to town. He dropped off a loaf of bread that his wife baked so I wouldn't have to when Hubby said bread as he is eating toast to keep his stomach settled. Then M sent a loaf over also. So he has plenty of toast.9th person in family in crisis within 8 wks. Daddy's baby sister's husband in critical condition with heart. Mid 80s. Laid in ER for over 8 hrs. They couldn't find a bed for him at a hospital that does heart surgery. So her son called my brother. As they live in southern Ohio and brother lives in north eastern. My brother called me. I told him to call his own Cardiologist and have him find something and to point out uncle is ARMY RETIRED VET. He was transferred within a hour. I made sure I sent a message to brother's cardiologist thanking  him. Covid has taking a lot of beds AGAIN, STILL, SOMEMORE.  This aunt is 10 yrs older than my brother, my Daddy was 10 yrs older than her so brother and her feel more like siblings. He was the same way with Mother's youngest two twin sisters as they were 5 yrs older than my brother.  He was really struggling but knew I had just went through the NO BEDS with Hubby's heart surgery, hated that he had to even call me since he know what I am struggling with.   Instead of going to a family reunion next Sunday we might be going to a funeral instead. Aunt said we could come in last, sit in the back to the side with mask and leave first. Probably would just make a trip later to see her if this doesn't take her too as she's not been well for the past 3 yrs since Daddy died.Then my calm, keep it  based on fact brother went off on a rant over politics and lies and media keep spreading the lies and courts allowing it to continue... when he got done I asked him what part of our parents saying ,politicians are liars did he miss? They tell you what they think you want to hear to get voted in and then do what ever suits them best when they get in. All at one time or another does good work but in reality, they aren't just putting stuff in for those of us that elected them, they are doing it for ALL of our country. What is best of OHIO might be the worst thing for Indiana. SO they have things that they are dealing with that we don't really see  or understand.  I have gotten to the point I watch the weather. Hubby let me know the house passed a 45 day clean and Biden signed it. I haven't even watched the weather, I checked my phone for it. Not like I am going to be out in the gardens. ( I can get back in gardens on Monday and canning is limited to 14 jars a day, BOY does Doc know me)SON 2 is on the waiting list for getting into a Cardiologist for his heart follow up(another Army retired  vet working as civilian for Air Force. Air Force is now involved trying to find a doctor to take him in), Hubby's offered but he isn't in their network for insurance.  But did tell him to make arrangements for his cats and car and to have a packed bag with him at all times. His ex girlfriend has agreed to take care of cats (was bad break up but they are decent friends and lives 5 minutes away) and Daughter 2 in on call for transport and being next of kin until I can take back up that issue. She said she might just stay in that position until unless they do surgery at some point as she's 15 minutes from him and he could return the favor even though her 4 sons are adults, they don't live as close as he does.Covid is defiantly taking it's good old time going away. Both of our fevers broke Saturday morning... that's a good sign right but Doc said 48 hrs. I still am down this morning so there is hope except I have Crohn's so run a fever over 50 % of the time anyways. SO hard telling. Doc told me to judge by Hubby's symptoms, he has a nasty cough that only happens at night. It's better also. But I have nothing but the fever and diarrhea that I have with Crohns. . Would not have tested if Doc hadn't had Hubby test due to cough.  Makes you wonder how many have this crap and not know it as it is the same as other crap they have.Great Granddaughter is having another surgery. Shunt was not working at removing fluid off brain so they removed it and the VAD, Moved the catheter from the shunt to the fluid bag on the other side of brain. Will be putting a new shunt on that side I think Monday. Becka wasn't sure, they are going more of when baby is stable instead of \"let's do surgery this day\" trying to keep her from struggling with all the surgeries. Daughter 4 (grandma) is holding on by finger tips working 3rd shift (her car blew the engine)  saving for new car, homeschooling the teenager, having the older teenager hate being an adult and having to work (LOL) and not in the field he went to vocational school for and babysitting Becka's older daughter so her and Daddy can be at hospital. The neat thing they have now is there is a camara at baby's crib so her big sister can see her and talk to her every day. When Mommy and Daddy go visit her, Daughter 4 will call them and they let baby hear big sister's voice so she will recognize the voice when she does get to come home. Daughter 4 videoed big sister singing to baby sister and Mommy and Daddy show her every time they go to see her.I am going to have to toss food I bought 3 wks. Some of the apples are rotting that I will have to deal with. I hate it but as Hubby put it , we can still buy more apples and make do with what we end up with. I told him we were pulling the gardens for the year as I finish harvesting tomatoes probably within a week or two. As there are still some green. I've canned enough of green ones. I sat down yesterday and wrote out the new to do list for both of  us so if someone asks if we need help with something we can check the list and say YES. E's oldest came over and looked at floor of wood shed. It needs replaced in the one section. He tore out the rotten wood and cleaned it up a bit and said if we had plyboard we could just lay it down over that spot and deal with fixing it next summer when we would clean it out for fresh wood. Hubby has about half of the siding on, E thinks they could put the roof on during one good afternoon as it's not rotted just metal got a hole in it when the tree limb went through it. Hubby has new metal roofing pretty much cut to fit so it's take off the old and screw on the new. I told Hubby I thought we could take it off ourselves but have E or couple of his boys help put it on. They are trying to get M's wash house finished for winter and the out house finished at the same time. Their 1000 gallon cistern went dry. First time in 10 years, we pointed out half his rain spouting is down due to wash house construction and it has not rained in 3 wks. to amount to much. In fact we have gotten more moisture from fog than we have rain and it's not much even with as thick as it is. I told Hubby I wasn't putting water in the pond, if it got much lower, the Amish was going to have to have a fish fry to keep us from having a fish kill. He told E that when E checked on us the other day. E went out and check and said right now it's okay but he also had his brother who put the pond in check it. He okayed it also but did leave a marker that I can see from the house so E or him can see the level and know when it hits too low and to go fishing. I think I am going to take a nap.  I know I will be running to the bathroom"},

One of us will say, got to go and the other will yell thanks as we both head to the bathrooms.Hubby thought I was dumb for ordering 10 boxes of Imodium from Amazon until last night when he went through the box by himself (Doc okayed it when you are going like a water faucet turned all the way on)He complained of being nauseated. I handed him meds and he asked what it was, it's throw up pills shut up and take it. He came back with I don't get motion sickness ( I do) The look I gave him he said was not friendly so he shut up and took them. Ten minutes later told me thank you it helped. Said this is reminding him on my bad crohn's attack... how do I know if its covid or crohn's. It's both combined. I just got to make sure I don't dehydrate to stay out of hospital.We are snacking instead of eating. All 6 kids and several grandkids told us to not try to eat regular meals but snack and drink every hour. That is working, Hubby is using apple cider to keep the sour metallic taste out of his mouth, I am using lemon cough drops. I did point out the apple cider might be helping him having to go more to the the outhouse (SNICKERING). Said it was worth it to kill the taste.  Must be bad because this man doesn't have much taste buds to begin with.Usually day 3 is the worst... not for covid or at least not for me. Day 4 started at midnight right along of sleeping on the toilet. SIGH. Glad the hospital gave me baby diaper cream LOL.Won't be doing anything today....oh well I will be living in the bathroom today. Guess that is doing something... what it's not doing is living in a hospital room like my foster sister did for a week when she got this."},
{"title": "Here we go ", "date": "Friday, September 29, 2023", "text": "Daughter 2 spent yesterday in the ER... with Son 2 as we couldn't be there as his next of kin. Son 2 said it was worse to see her sit and cry as she is terrified of her baby brother dying and dealing with her dad nearly dying and afraid I will die of heart failure or crohns. He did get her to make appt with her shrink while sitting with him and then stuck her with making HIS follow up appts with all his doctors and HIS Shrink.Daughter 4 (who would have handle it better )was babysitting granddaughter so her daughter could be with her baby girl as she was having surgery again. Premature birth, fluid on brain, VAD and shunt was not working so changing which side of brain shunt is on. Granddaughter didn't tell us because we put out Son 2 was in ER. Her line of thinks was we are already praying daily for this child and there is nothing else we can do. As we already paid their rent. What we could do. Son 2 was again having heart event. Not heart attack. He had tons of tests (just like his Dad did) and in now in the follow up appt hoops along with seeing his civilian and VA primary doctors and getting refers to Cardiologist and GI for fatty liver (Tylenol and drinking , but he quit both over a month ago so he's not dealing with withdraw now). Daughter 2 was in ER over weekend for sever sprained ankle. Now in boot and crutches. She explained we couldn't be there because we both had covid for the first time. Doc said even though it's safe for food to be canned while having covid, he knows me and doing 14 to 21 jars plus is too much the first 5 days. I am to rest (I struggle to rest on Sundays) On Day 6 (because Day 5 is Sunday) I can do 14 jars a day for a week. THEN mentioned so CAN HUBBY.As Doc does the canning (in fact we have another couple that the man does the canning) so he figures Hubby can do it also. My line of thinking , I'll do the canning (put jars in , take jars out) and he can process the food to the jars... which is a lot more work. Guess we could flip who does what (that is not happening at all as I know my Hubby), he will take jars out and take jars to basement.A friend told me trouble comes in 3s. SO Hubby's dad cancerous bowel tumor, Hubby's heart attack and great grandbaby born too early was the first 3, Hubby's covid, grandson in Army came out due to damaged knee, daughter 2's ankle is second 3. My covid, Son 2 heart event ... we are missing one and I am okay with that. GEEZE.Do we get to count M's brother getting electrocuted and it past through his hands and feet?? Since we were the one to get the message... fun trying to pass phone calls to Amish while you have covid. I now have a sign on door not answering due to covid. My UPS guy honked until I stepped out and told me he put us on his church prayer chain AGAIN. No one around here can find out what he was doing around electricity to begin. It's not something they are usually around even when working construction site they ask the electric not be on until they are done.  I need to pay bills M sent the 3 little ones over. They each has acorn squash. We were thinking she got ran over... hummm nope. Little E \"harvested\" our compost and took them home for dinner. They explained they were ours and he was stealing food from us which made him cry. Hubby thanked him for harvesting them for us, just to ask the next time before he picks them. Actually we had missed them when harvesting pumpkins. Which Little E let him know the rest of the pumpkins are ready also. They have to enforce not stealing strongly.  E told us later that Little E said he should have asked his Dad first if it was okay to ask us if it was okay to pick them. I struggled at first to follow that statement LOL. We both were a little upset that they came down so strong but we understand their faith isn't tolerant of it at that age. He is old enough to know it's on our property so it's ours as he is 6. M was upset with E because the child crossed the FENCE to get to our compost pile AKA Hubby's garden as it seems every year something grows in it.  And E didn't realize the kids were not with him. He has them help clean up the saw mill (not near the actual saw). SO E got in trouble also.THEN the widow on the other side thought the birds had ate all her cherry tomatoes and come over and asked if she could harvest some of ours No problem as they ran us over. Hubby asked if the little ones (what we call E's kids that aren't in school) had been over to see her as they think of her as a grandparent. YES they had. We told her about Little E and the squash. She stopped and asked Little E if he had ate her little tomatoes and he told her that the 3 of them did. M sighed. Widow told her she's not feeding them enough if they are looking for food else where. M came over and told me what was said and I backed widow. I also pointed out that they are looking for veggies so she needs to increase that serving for them.  E stopped two days later and said the kids are eating twice as much as she was serving them and they both told them that if they are still hungry to say something. I told him that when they see the pan is empty they think there is no more food so they might offer to make something. She's went to having raw veggies in the spring house for snacks. Told E that the kids ate through 3 large zucchini she has cut up like cucumbers like I suggested in one day (she was happy the zucchini was ate as her's is still coming on) She harvest her potatoes early just to have another veggie on the table. They have watermelon and cantaloupe daily   She already puts bread on the table every meal and has some kind of dessert. I told E best buy more material as M was going to need bigger clothes as that means they are growing. He sighed. Widow said she was there when he passed that message on and M sighed also but walked over and made a list to send with the oldest to school as the school teacher's mother does the fabric for the community. LOL  I was like ..she doesn't have to go shopping (isn't that nice)for material as they all wear the same fabric and basic colors. Boys pants are blue, wear brown, green, gray or blue shirts. White shirts for boys in summer or church. Girls dresses are brown, gray, green, and blue Church pants and dresses are black. It came home yesterday as the kids in the back of the buggy waved it at me as they passed.  LORD only knows when she is going to get more time to get more clothes made. She's already up at 3 now getting laundry done so she can start canning after that. I can see her lamp on in the wash room. I should have asked when they hold church, if she's lucky it will be Nov and the ladies all come over to help do a deep cleaning of the home for church so she won't be doing it with just the kids over the weekend when the kids are home to help.We all told them to not feel bad, their kids should know they can say they are hungry to them. M said she told the kids to pick their tomatoes to eat, I told her they could come over and pick our cherry tomatoes as we have more than plenty. I notice she had the older kids come over after school and pick a basket of cherry tomatoes. We got a dozen eggs and a pie sitting on the porch for us."},
{"title": "Maple tree forecast", "date": "Monday, September 25, 2023", "text": "I have noticed the last few years that the east maple tree starts turning about 4 to 6 wks. before the 1st snow. It started turning 2 weeks ago.She's watching to see if I come up through E's pasture. This year it's turning faster than last year. I need to get the stove cleaned and ready and the front porch set up for wood. Hubby is allowed to move wood (with breaks) starting next week. Since it's load the tractor bucket and move it we should be able to handle it with breaks. Tomatoes need picked LOL. I did get 14 quarts of pears canned, am making pear sauce of what is left.Thursday:We ate the last of the leftovers except biscuitsI got green beans done. I planted 6 varieties of garlic so that took 6 garden beds out from spring planting.We bought a very old apple press. Hubby is bored. Right now we have E's kids pick the apples, E takes them to the cider press guy and we pay to have apple cider. E paid for the cider this year so we only got 1 gallon. His oldest boy went with Hubby to get the press (he made sure Hubby wasn't lifting). Hubby showed him where the Scioto river starts as it's runs past his grandpa and uncle's home. We will have to learn how to use this press. It takes about 40 apples to make a gallon of cider.Friday:Appts are time suckers. Worse when you already don't feel well and your great PA( I've watched him take on his own boss to back me) decides to become a wall and not listen. He thinks I should suck it up and get rid of what ever to pay for biologics when I am on Medicare. I finally told him I would when he paid my mortgage for the farm, the taxes and the insurance. He frowned at me over that. Doesn't want me to go back on the OTC meds I was on that worked before the company was sold and the idiots that bought it changed the formula to be worthless. Wanted me to have blood work done to find out if my biologic is not working (really? Like having break throughs every other time doesn't tell you that? and Not having that done either because I am not paying $250 for it) and was not happy when I said I would ONLY if I didn't have to pay out of pocket. One of the nurses told the doctor he is under and HE called me. He told me to pay the mortgage, do what ever holistic I needed to do and take the old formula (his wife takes it also). He grew up poor, he understands, knows he grandparents had to go without meds due to costs, has watched his parents at times do the same and even though he is a doctor, he is not a rich one and knows at some time he will make the same choices. What he does see is the ones that never had to make that sacrifice, or their parents hide that from them.... are clueless and are really going to struggle when they get older.We stopped on way home at Hurley's Farm. We know they sell a variety  of winter squash. They even had the baby butternut so Hubby got 3 of them, we picked up 2 more Acorn squash (A's wife B  had a couple) I picked up 1 spaghetti squash. It's a so and so on our like list but it's another veggie on the table. We also got carrot cake, pumpkin bars with cream cheese frosting and fry pies, pumpkin, blackberry and buckeye (we have no freaking clue but hope for peanut butter and chocolate)We went and got my meds the PA insisted I have even though the ER put me on antibiotics.  Doc told me to NOT take that strength To take half (pharmacy back that as Doc called them to fix that order) and I can't take it while on antibiotics. We had sausage gravy over the leftover biscuits. Both of us is calling it an early night.Saturday, Hubby was doing odd jobs in the yard and E come ask me if Hubby was allowed to do that before he stopped him. GOOD NEIGHBOR. Yes he is allowed. As of Saturday the 5 lb. weight limit was lifted though I noticed he still put the brace on the wrist that they used to enter his artery. He did some small odd jobs that has been on the list forever. Got the info to fix the solar pump then had to find old computer as the new one doesn't do ethernet cable and you have to have that to program it. He is going to let the company know they need to update how to program it. THEN  we were back to ER... this time not for us but Son 2 who is single was in ER. HE was vomiting, shaking, and BP was high. They thought heart attack. ER called and told me as he couldn't hold phone due to shaking. I told them his BP runs high, his old doctor refused to put him on meds because he was active duty and he is retired. ASK HIM when he last drank water instead of pop.... he couldn't remember... yeah. He was dehydrated. His VA doc and civilian doc now know he has a problem. His follow ups are this week. He also knows to lay off drinking pop when he is working a family day at the VFW or at least drink water every other time as they have bottle water. Not only that STUPID drove himself instead of calling the squad AND went to an ER that isn't connected to a hospital so would have had to transfer him to the hospital that was actually closer to him that the squad would have taken him to. HE got that lecture from the ER doctor and then another about having his parents who both had been in the ER in the past week drive 2 hrs. to come get his car and drive him home. Wait until Daughter 2 gets ahold of him as she is only 15 minutes from him and could have took him to the ER (attached to hospital) if he was that freaking concerned about squad bill. We thought he had called her and she wasn't able to go get his car and him... OF COURSE, that retriggered my Crohn's and Hubby's BP was up so we sat around on Sunday enjoying the decent weather. Hubby brought up how stupid it was for Son2 to drive himself to the ER with a possible heart attack. I said he is his father's son since he just was going to drive himself to Urgent care and WAS having a heart attack. I do have to order mesh bags for the apple press. Hubby wanted a ladder to use to get things out of his tool box on the back of the truck. I told him to use the freaking steps built in the end of the truck. He was not happy with me but I made it clear he was just being lazy and if getting into the bed of his truck using those steps was too much he needed to sell that big truck and get something smaller he could manage. Then he said something about buying another vehicle... NOT now, we have hospital bills to pay off and the next vehicle we buy I am picking out as it will be the one I drive the most. I am not just going after something that isn't a good fit and definitely not when I know there are bills in the thousands to be paid off. He got nasty mouthed (which is not his norm, well wasn't his norm until the dementia started that they know think was caused by his heart issues). I can handle nasty mean mouth. Mother was the champ in that contest. He came back two hours later and said he was sorry and figured he made the Crohn's worse... I asked for his BP... it was up also. HE sighed. Made note on his phone of talking over with his Cardiologist about his blow ups as he put it. I told him he was a grenade not a bomb if that would help. Got a laugh out of him but he was quiet the rest of the night which was peaceful. I know we don't NEED another car at this point. He is not working so we can balance doctor appts BUT I also know the work truck costs more to run as it's diesel.He is struggling with what is a want vs a need. He can start on the wood shed this coming week."},
{"title": "I have to laugh.", "date": "Thursday, September 21, 2023", "text": "Hubby just got up to go to potty... I was thinking he was up so I went to go lay down... before I get back to the bedroom I hear him tell Charlotte to go lay down he was going back to sleep... AND HE IS already back to sleep. He has NEVER been able to go right back to sleep. I got her to curl up on the couch across from his chair he is sleeping in, Tucked her in since she has her nose up her butt means she is cold. I noticed Hubby has an extra blanket so I turned the furnace up 2 degrees... the front room will be 70. I can see the widow on the other side of E is up and outside with her dog in the dark as she has a flashlight and is following the dog with it. It's a little dog that had been her late mom's and then her late husband. The widow on our other side is out on her deck... H's dog is over there and she is shooing it home. He is the Amish that property comes up to the side of ours. Even though his lane is on the other road it's nothing for his kids or dogs to \"visit\" coming around the other pond at the other's neighbors.  E and the kids are out doing chores, flash light all over the place. Kerosene light in the barn so the girls are milking in the back stall.  I think about if I had lost him.  Our wills etc. need update. That phone call is for Monday as that lawyer is on vacation. Our old will would stand but still we need to update as Ohio changed the inheritance rules.   He made a comment about I needed help to do a couple things, E pointed out in front of me that if I can't do it NOW while he is alive, means I need to change it as he wouldn't be here if he was dead. I was glad he said it before I did. BUT it is a fact. I need to be able to back the 350 (aka work truck) and back it with our small trailer and the wood wagon.  I need to know who to call for maintenance for that tractor. I know who does the 350, the Silverado and the zero turn lawnmower. I can call the widow to our south to find out who works on her mower for our other mower we used for spraying the lane. I would need name of good tow truck if the truck went down. I need to be comfortable with tractor and changing equipment Daughter 2 told me to youtube it. Daughter 4 backed that, seems both do it for household repairs even though they both rent. I can do household repairs but I don't do anything connected to propane. I have the number of appliance repair guy, son of an old classmate. I wouldn't need to cut my own wood as I could get scrap wood from sawmills (we have 4-6) that sell that. I would need a truck or suv to pull that wagon. If I got to car I would need to have someone deliver it to me. Might not save enough doing that. I need to be comfortable with running the chainsaw and wood splitter.I would need to remove all the phone numbers off his phone and put on mine as he makes the calls to the repairs guys. BUT could I do the work here?  Yes, I wouldn't raise as much garden unless I was selling it at auction (possible thought as income would drop by 25 %)That would also be a way to stay connected to community and have purpose to get out of house. Maybe grow plants for just one person and sell little sets of different plants \"1 or 2 person\" as I definitely didn't need 4 to 6 of each variety I got. But all the rest. Yes I can do it, I can age in place. He just has to quit hogging the tractor etc. LOL  Lana, what was the holistic site you suggested?.... my GI  and a couple friends (one has RA and can't afford her 3 biologics) would like to look at it. I did get the tomatoes that was picked canned as pasta sauce. But I haven't been to the gardens.The garlic is in to plant for next year's garlic. That will be today.  I got one more round of zucchini to go in dehydrators. Still have a few for a fresh dish. I still need to wash potatoes and put them in storage. I need to deal with watermelon. I need to reorganize the frigs as there is a lot of fresh produce that needs ate NOW.I told Hubby we are having pork, sweet potato, brussels sprouts and carrot cake Saturday... he looked at me and then laughed. First day of Autumn . I still need to do the fall cleaning including the wood stove and winter curtains as it sounds to be a doozy coming at us and maybe earlier than late Nov. which is usual for us.Primary Doc is a friend, he told Hubby, he can cut wood with chain saw but not lift wood to buzz saw. He is to have the Amish neighbor kids pick the wood up and stack it or I can. He can use the gas motor splitter but not by hand. As his doctor he can advise, as his friend of decades he can put his foot up his butt. Since even his friend from where he worked as been on him, the friend that Hubby saved his life doing chest compressions when he dropped from heart attack at work... he is listening. HE had a doctor appt yesterday.. just a lot of paperwork but it was an 2 hr. drive to it. He told the nurse he was going to set his phone alarm for 30 mins. and take a nap in the corner of their waiting room before he drove him. They took him back to their break room so he could lay down on the couch. She called to let me know he was taking a nap before heading home and their head nurse was going to listen to his heart before he would leave to make sure nothing was going on. They are medical for his brain. Definitely a good office to care beyond their specialty. I need to look for part D for myself. LOL I know I am doing straight Medicare (already talked to all my doctors) and I will get Medigap from AARP (been member for 10 yrs) so Part D is the last part. I've looked a bit but need to finalize that so on Oct 1st I can just slap that on and have it set for Jan 1st (I turn 65 in Jan) Hubby has had the doctors he is seeing now to take both his medical cards so it's 1 time of doing paperwork. He just has to remind them to remove the other insurance next month. The one was so excited as it removes the preapproval crap (their word to Hubby). Hubby's new Cardo doctor that works here in town besides over to the hospital one town over. Made a point of going past our house. Took one look at the gardens in front of the house. She asked if we grew dried beans. Not this year as we have 150 lbs.  of them in storage. Said put them in the rotation of eating 3 to 4 times a week. Hubby shook his head, nope wife has Crohns. So she said once a week for me and four for him. Then he told her I canned part of them so we could have a quick meal. No sense buying canned refried beans when I can open a jar I canned for the same thing. I can eat a little of beans at a time, but not back to back days. Refried doesn't bother me at all... or hasn't yet. Since Hubby has been in hospital , Charlotte has been waking me up at 2 and as long as I am here in dining room until Hubby wakes up she will leave him alone and she sleeps. I think she is \"nurse on duty\" until 2 and I get the next shift. I am okay with it. I can go back to sleep."},

I called the insurance company and she gave me a ball park figure of $2500. Normally they don't pay for the ambulance but since the doctor ordered it and it was for transport to a hospital to do surgery... if they don't pay it to appeal it to be paid. We have a good part of that in the money market and since the bills will take 2 months to get to us after insurance etc. I have plenty of time to save up the rest. I'll probably just pull it from savings so he can see that money is there and stop that stressing.He will stress about the wood shed, the solar pump, the fire wood, taking the gardens down... I know my Hubby.Daughter 4 was upset that we didn't get enough notice to be there for surgery. I texted her he was going to surgery before I even could leave and get there let alone her 1 1/2 hrs. away.  So she made up for it by texting me off and on all day. She had to attend a funeral of a close friend that is our age, he died from widow maker heart attack. I had to charge my phone twice due to phone calls and texts.She asked if we had enough groceries and then cracked up laughing until she cried... I thought it was as funny as all get out. I told her no, but if she came up and picked it and canned it I would... that made her laugh harder as she is totally clueless about canning. Growing it, harvesting it... no problem. She said the wife of the friend that died was not sure if she would have enough money to pay the bills and buy groceries. So Daughter 4 got a group of them together to go buy a month's worth of groceries with the granddaughter's help of what to buy including toilet paper, cleaning stuff etc. The granddaughter is going to stay with her as they already made the choice to sell the house and move her closer to the granddaughter. They were going to do that before he died so she's trying to do what they had planned. E stopped last night to get update. He said on Monday Hubby is to come over and they would talk about when E could help get the wood shed done. He is working on building the wash room for M. The boys can stack wood anytime we need it, I didn't need to be doing that (he knows I have a bad back), the girls can help in the gardens.... we don't want Lonnie as he takes bites out of the tomatoes and then puts them in the baskets.  M said if I wanted she would just do my canning for me if I need to do other things. I told him I was down to making pasta sauce so should be able to get it done. So she sent over eggs as she know I give Charlotte an egg daily for her skin issues.Hubby is allowed to mow... trimmer not so much for a couple weeks but self propelled mower and riding is okay. Front loader is okay as long as he is not tugging on anything. Hubby asked as he doing that for an Amish sawmill.We have to tweak the diet a bit... more is Hubby has to STOP snacking after supper and right before bed. He showed the doctor what he weighed at the beginning of the year and how he was losing. Doctor told him that was good but would like to see it be a bit more even each week instead of 4 lbs. one week and 1 lb. the next. Doctor gave him an option of Cardo therapy, it's an option because he is physically active. Did say would like to see him walking more. I told him he could walk out to the pine trees and pick up pine cones for the stove four times a day... that's a mile LOL. He told the doctor we have produce on the table daily. I laughed and added because I am out of counter space and baskets to sit on the floor. Glad Charlotte is not interested in veggies that aren't cooked. Tashy and Cookie loved raw veggies and would harvest their meals HA HA. Miss Kira would munch through cherry tomatoes if Hubby tossed them to her, if I touched them she wouldn't eat them LOL. Wilbur would mow the garden down as he loved it all. Rascal he only liked green beans and carrots raw.Prayers for peaceBe safeBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Update widow maker lost", "date": "Saturday, September 16, 2023", "text": "He had a deformity in his heart.... and that is the ONLY reason the widow maker didn't kill him. That is actually how the cardiologist put it. I already buried a husband due to the widow maker. I know how easy it is to miss the signs of the main artery of the heart being blocked. Hubby was trimming the back fence line, felt cold, couldn't get warm. It's 75 and sunny... came in and I took his temp thinking he's caught the bug going around and his temp was 95... that's a BIG WARNING sign. He watched them do the procedure, as it was on an screen that he could see. Surgery was to take an hour. It took 2 as the surgeon decided since he was in there to check a few more things that could \"pop\" up. Follow up in 2 wks. He comes home tomorrow. I'll take him to see his Dad on our way home. He can't drive for a week, can only lift 5 lbs. When he starts moving around etc, if he can't talk steady while working, it's too much. Surgeon thinks when he is recovered he will actually be able to do more than he was.Hubby cracked the joke he should have waited until the 1st when Medicare and Medigap would have paid all the bills. I told him to not worry about that right now, it will take 2 months for all the bills to run through before we get the amount we owe. I will be putting money back monthly to cover it. We do have some in a money market but it's not going to be enough. Meantime I am trying to calm his parents and siblings, my brother, all 6 kids to just stop, he's okay, he is coming home. But we all admit it's triggered the PTSD of when my late husband died, Daughter 4 was 3 and kept asking where Daddy was. Daughter 2 called me tonight, told me to update FB (several friends, classmates and family that aren't local) and my blog and then go to bed. Prayers for peaceStay safeBlessed Be  He was edging the back field where the roses are. Came in and said he was cold. He was working in the sun, he should have been on the warm side. I took his temp... it was 95. He went to the potty and came out and told me he was going to drive himself to urgent care. First clue was the low temp the second clue he wasn't thinking straight was he was going to drive himself. I got him in around 2 pm. They did the blood test that shows if you are having a heart attack. YEP. Then they got a ER doctor raising cane because the cardo that is at another hospital wasn't sending ambulance to get him and their ambulance wasn't equipped.Cardo doctor is coming in this morning. I am going to go take a nap because he's been calling me every 2 hours after they sent me home.Prayers please"},
{"title": "Push to get ready for winter.", "date": "Thursday, September 14, 2023", "text": "When you are in the boonies LOL you look at food and meds, power, heat and water. We have food and most meds. Local CVS will deliver. We have probably too much of some things (zucchini and corn). I am getting pears and apples this week. Will pick up garlic (B is selling extra) , sweet potatoes, butternut, acorn and orange pumpkin... yes I have to specify as a lot of Amish in this area grow tan pumpkins. Hubby grew some in the compost pile AGAIN.Finish processing gardens. I only planted radishes as M is running us over with other veggies. She had her oldest son haul a wagon load over to E's dad to take to auction. He works the auction twice a week. There are some condiments I use that we are really low on. I ordered them from Amazon as no one around here stocks them. Post office rejected box as it was damaged and leaking. Our mail carrier said you could hear the glass, and could tell it wasn't wrapped with bubble wrap correctly if at all. Two days later FED X rejected a box from Amazon as it was leaking (not the same stuff) SIGH. At least I didn't have to deal with it since they rejected it. Amazon refunded the money of course. We will be down in Dayton in two weeks for my dermo appt. I'll check the store around the corner from there.HEAT... I already paid for the propane for the winter.  We have 4 cords of wood in barn (need 18 cords)Hubby brought this home from 309 sawmillit's almost 3 ft across. Hubby said about 1 week of wood. He went back to get more this morning and to move some things around for the Amish owner. Then he brought this home. The guy actually stopped his sawmill to cut these in sections that Hubby could handle on his own with a chain saw. Also told Hubby he had some other he needed cleared out and showed him so Hubby could come up and do it without him there. Between the two loads there is about 5 cords. That makes half of what we need. He brings wood on our property, spends a day cutting it down to fit on buzz saw, then another day cutting it to size for stove and then a day to stack it. Takes him about a week to get it done.He had E's dad H whom came over to use the phone in the barn (and then had to go back home to get the phone number that was in his coat he took off before heading over so spent a good hour on the road) check out the wood shed and advise him if there was anything else to do as we bought new siding and roofing. H said a window to let light in on the back side and to not put a ceiling back in it as it would let there be airflow due to roof being vented where it joined the sides of shed.SO Hubby went a got 2 clear plastic (not plexiglass but what they use on barns with animals). Decided since he was doing that to get the second on and replace the window on the barn at the hay- mow. THEN H  told the story over that shed. It's studier but the sides are loose, window and door was missing. N (H's younger son) used it for a wood shed the 18 months he lived here. It was here when he bought the property from AB who is M's older brother's( Which is E* N's older brother's wife) AB wanted $10,000 for the shed on top of the $$$ that N bought the property for. Then dropped it to $5000. N talked it over with H his dad. H said when you buy a property all the buildings are included. Tell him he can take the building with him. AB left without the building. IN fact has refused to stay at his sister's right next door because of it. His parents told him the same as H, when you buy a property all the buildings are included unless specified before the sale. SO he's still ticked at his parents 8 yrs later. They just shake their heads and keep dealing with him. I've started slowly changing out warm weather bedding, curtains, and clothing for cold weather. Hubby's clothing is done. I am to sweaters.... I don't need them at home if the wood stove is on, half the time I am in a tank top, I wear a cardigan if it isn't.  I've lost enough weight (not on purpose thanks to Crohn's off and on for 2 months) that even my tops are too big. I don't want to get rid of them in case I gain weight.  I am sorting in the barn rather than bringing it all in and then sorting it. WHILE sorting it, some is going into the donation boxes. Daughter 2 got tank tops as she wears the same size as me. Daughter 4 will get some old tee shirts that she can wear under uniform to save her own good shirts. Hubby checked the generator. Need to restock gas for it. We need fresh mineral spirits for the oil lamps. Simple pump won't pump water to pressure tank. Company is in Nevada. Asked him to film it while running... then it was OOPPS, they forgot to send the directions to recode it to connect to pressure tank so gave that to him over phone. The customer service there told him to call them before he starts to redo that part so they can be on line with him in case he needs more help. If he thinks I won't slap a garden hose on the end of the hand pump to pump water to house, he best go over and look at how M does water to her wash house as the water pump is in the BARN.Prayers for peaceStay safeBlessed be"},
{"title": " what we are dealing with.", "date": "Tuesday, September 12, 2023", "text": "Hubby's Dad had a cancerous tumor in his colon. It was grade 1 (lowest amt. ) no cancer anywhere else. He is recovering at home, doing decent. Started in to pneumonia due to not being able to breath deep because of wrap  around midsection that had been cut open plus a UTI probably because he still has a catheter. He is on meds for that. Staples taken out and has butterfly Band-Aid so pneumonia should clear up. Doc to remove catheter had emergency surgery. Surgeon that took tumor is trying to get him in to another urologist to get the catheter removed as he has to be sedated to have that done. Great grandbaby is still in NICU, BUT doing a lot better. She is up to 5 lbs. is now breast feeding along with bottle. They put a VAD in until she is old enough to get a shunt put in due to fluid on the brain. MRI for that was yesterday, we are waiting for results. There was some talk of her going home in October and that the home would have to be clean and kept clean , kitties can't be in her bed or where she is at due to tracking litter.  She will be allowed to pet them.   They do not have to remove the kitties from the home.Hubby is bouncing through appts. for his brain issues as he has taking to call it instead of dementia... I can go with that as they have found it started due to his loss of hearing (now has hearing aids) and the ends of the brain dying (if you don't use it you will lose it) He has one for ENT as the neurologist said he sleep apnea, I was like he no longer snores since he had throat and nose surgery 10 yrs ago. So when I told primary  that along with Hubby loses his voice almost daily in the late afternoon/ early evening  decided to send him to new ENT. That is  next month. Next week it is the Dementia doctor to decide which dementia he has and that treatment. Nov is back to the neurologist to get nerves tested in his feet and then to get a treatment plan also. Meantime his part D that starts on the 1st is great this year and really bad next year. He is calling them to see if he needs a different plan for then as our doctor does not do electronic prescriptions,  or fax or call in meds at all. He feels that is against HIPPA. AND we don't use Caremark. Been there and done that and never got meds before running out or was told we got them when we didn't due to issues at post office having stealing going on.  Meantime I need to save for replacement of Silverado. SIGH. OLD age is NOT for the meek and mild  I keep the chair covered because she likes to dig at it. She took the boxes out of it also. Probably still smells like Daddy as it was from his home. He had bought it for me as I couldn't put my feet on the floor with any of his other furniture.Well, she moved the pillow first , then stuck her butt up my armpitGlad her tail always is in down position. This is the maple sapling Hubby dug up 6 years ago out of driveway of the farm house we were rentingI'll probably will have to cut those 2 tall branches off next fall. I am 5 ft 2 inches. These two maple saplings we bought this year. They were at my shoulders when we bought them.The tallest is on the east side. Both get the same amount of sunlight.The heart garden has some flowers rebloomingYou can barely see the yellow specks of where the flower buds areI have 8 roses and over 30 blooms between the 10 rose bushes on the back fence lineThere have been 4-5 forecasts for this coming winter... NOAA  is the only one forecasting dry and warmer than normal all the rest look along the lines of this oneWe are in the Artic blast zone of Ohio. Hubby decided everything else we were doing was at a stop as he is way behind on cutting wood. I actually turned the furnace on last night at it dropped to mid 40s during the night with a cold rain today. He's at the sawmill today getting free wood in exchange for running their front loader for them. E said they (his entire family) are behind on getting wood also since the crops came in more than normal. He still has field corn to deal with in the fields behind us, about 50 acres worth. They harvest the corn by HAND. It's not ready for harvest right now."},

{"title": "1908", "date": "Saturday, September 2, 2023", "text": "was when Living on a Little was originally published. Great granddaughter is still in children's hospital. She had a VAD implanted as she's too young for shunt. She has to be 36 wks. and she's only 33. She's doing better for what she is going through. The brain bleed stopped, they will be checking again this week to make sure she hasn't started that back up. FIL is home from surgery. Still has catheter. Well be having home care to see what needs to be changed in the house for them to remain safely in the home and PT at home for now. Hubby took him home with MIL using their car. Notice FIL felt a little wobbly walking on the front room carpet so Hubby got him MIL extra walker. FIL told Hubby they don't have enough money for even one of them to go in the nursing home. The home they bought is not built for even a walker to go through the bedroom doors or bathroom door. Hubby offered years ago to widen the doors, grandson is electrician to move light switches. They said no. They didn't even want to put in a wheelchair shower. MIL has mild polio but was\" I want to soak in the tub\" mode... now she barely can get in and out of the tub to shower. Hubby came home last night and said he was thankful we made sure we could stay here and not go to nursing home due to the house. Daddy only had to move because the bathroom was not built for handicap and it would cost as much as his house was worth to change it. He lived in a poverty area in one of the best houses. Wasn't that way when he bought it 50 yrs ago.The Roma beans have bloomed again so won't pull those.Zucchini vine is half dead so Hubby said he would pull it. The cantaloupe exploded in the last down pour of 3 inches. PLUS I have new ones starting on the vines. Hubby is deciding it he want to put the exploded cantaloupe in the compost pile so they will grow there next year or the following like the freaking tan pumpkins do that we haven't planted in 2 years.The watermelon vines are starting to die.The goat's bag and ox heart tomatoes are turning red !!!! probably about 2-3 wks. and they will be done. UNLESS they bloom again LOL.The red cherry tomatoes and golden cherry tomatoes are ready for picking again.Let's see what is left in the garden....All 10 boxes of potatoes are ready to dig. Eggplant and some kale. Might be mini bell peppers hiding under the one tomato plant.We decided to plant fall garden... Hubby said he would rig a row cover over the trellis so it could go into Nov/ early Dec. He wants lettuce, radishes, carrots, and turnips. I am adding kale, mini bok choy, tatsoi mustard, Swiss chard, collards (daughter 3 requested), Chinese cabbage (Amish gave me seeds as they grow this as a fall plant),  and spinach, I am quite sure I can walk across the pasture and hand M an extra fresh veggies from the garden this fall as her gardens are wrapping up. Her tomatoes are about 2 wks. in front of mine.  I already have fall onions in.Garlic bulbs to plant this fall start coming in Sept 19th. I will probably buy some sugar pumpkins, butternut, acorn squash and apples (for applesauce and fresh eating. Honeycrisp and Crispin have held for 6 months in the frig for me.Best get at it. Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},

{"title": "First", "date": "Monday, August 28, 2023", "text": "Charlotte waiting with her Daddy at Vet'sCharlotte wanting attentionThe heart flower garden has filled in I run the dishwasher usually once a day. This is 5 gallons professional for 10 gallon water dishwasher. My dishwasher is 5 gallons so I will use half of what they say to use which is 1 ounce which is 2 tablespoons. I will use 1/2 ounce which is 1 tablespoon. SO I  have soap for 1280 loads. That's 3.5 years for us. Hubby asked for a colored tablespoon so he would know it goes to the dishwasher soap. I told him it didn't matter what color the tablespoon was as it needed to go in the dishwasher after he put the soap in... I'll be putting the soap in as he acted confused. Daughter 4 came up to clean the garden shed, she started in the 1st bay of the barn when she realized I still had not got through the last boxes of Daddy's stuff. Then she sorted the garden stuff that was in the 1st bay. While she was lecturing (admitting she struggles with letting things go), all of a sudden she stops and asks why I am having trouble getting up and down. Hubby answered, because we are old.  HUM. She offered to come up once a month if we can give her gas money and she can borrow her older son's car as he has the only car in the family that is safe to drive long distance. She has NO car as she blew her engine. That is the 3rd kid to do that. What part of check your oil and get your oil changed do they not understand SIGH. She told her dad that the idiot light didn't come on. I cleared the garden shed while she helped her Dad load the truck to take stuff to Goodwill. There is a truck load of garden pots to go to B or the other greenhouse. We have a couple tools we no longer use that I think M would take, a child's snow shovel for sure. The \"trash\" bags that need to go to trash is on the barn porch. ALL of them are bubble wrap or foam that no one around here accepts. Daughter 4 made sure I would finish the 1st bay as she put everything in front of the metal cabinets that has the toilet paper in LOL.Ten bucks with the new job she won't be able to come up at all. BUT It's a good start and I now know not to give Hubby boxes for burning as he doesn't burn them.  I told him to take the large boxes over to M that we set aside. She uses them to cover the floor when they butcher. He said he will do that later this week, if not done by Friday I will do it .He spent last night at the hospital with his Dad who had a tumor in his colon removed. They took 12 inches of the colon also. He has refused chemo. Seeing what it did to Mother at age 80, can't say I wouldn't do the same. Hubby is swinging by to see his mom and check to see if the grass needs mowed. His Dad can't do ANYTHING for another 7 weeks. No driving, no mowing, no house keeping as he runs the vacuum cleaner. NOTHING. MIL is going to be driven nuts.Great grandbaby had VAD surgery as she's 33 weeks and they have to be 36 to have a shunt put in. She is doing better as the brain bleed has clotted.  She is sucking on a pacifier so they are looking at taking the feeding tube out this coming week if she sucks longer on the pacifier.  They have a bedside camera on her so her older sister (and her parents ) can look on the phone app and see how she is doing. Older sister says baby has a boo boo and tells her good morning and good night and she loves her. Hubby has been referred to ENT due to losing his voice in late afternoon/ evening. He called our primary as he had not heard anything for two weeks. They called the ENT, they are on vacation, so he wouldn't hear anything until probably the first week of Sept unless the partner comes in and starts earlier. Our primary doctor said it's taking longer and longer to get people into specialist. A lot of them are now checking with insurance to see if they can get paid. Once we go on Medicare, it shouldn't be as hard or long.His appt with the neurologist is Nov 1st for testing for feeling in his legs and plan for his dementia. He did get a laugh , I was checking the calendar, checking my to do list and he asked what I was doing. I answered I thought I was forgetting something and was checking to see what it was.... he thought that was funny that I thought I forgot something. I did forget something, that was to finish fall cleaning the pump house. It's done now.I am wore out already and it's only Monday.Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Living on a Little by Caroline French Benton.", "date": "Friday, August 25, 2023", "text": "I am not sure which blogger mentioned reading this but it sounded interesting so I got it on my kindle... then ordered the paperback. I took it in the car while we were running errands and going to visit his parents. Good conversation for us. I usually use my leftovers for lunch the next day, she remade her leftovers for another supper and used what bits were in the frig for her lunches. Even though she only spent $1 a day TOTAL for their food (her, hubby and maid or in this case her maid was her sister)... the line of planning is even correct for this day and age.  The other day we went to check on Hubby's parents. His mom who has mild polio insisted we come for lunch. His Dad went in to surgery today to remove cancerous tumor in colon. He did fine. We usually go to take them out or visit at non eating times.His mom had bought three times the amount of groceries as she doesn't drive much and wanted to just tell one of the family she just needed eggs and milk, maybe bread while FIL recovered.  The costs worried her as they haven't really stocked anything even during the pandemic as the store is around the corner maybe a half mile away. She is going to stock up some more because she doesn't think he is going to want to go out if it's really bad outside this winter. Stocking up she got away from while working in town. Just stop at the store on the way home.  She got a boneless whole ham that was on sale. She cut it into half slices so they could either eat it as a sandwich or as the main meal. Bagged most of it for freezer. Said it came out at $1 for meat at one meal. She took the slices that she kind of messed up (her words)while slicing it with an electric knife and used the best ones for our meal. She took the end pieces, diced them in her small food processor. She pan fried the ham with a little oil (yes she knows it's cooked but FIL wants it fried) and put it in the microwave on  6 minutes on level 1 to keep warm while she finished the meal ...Now I am thinking it's going to take more than 6 minutes to get this meal together. She put the frozen veggies with a good splash of water in the pan and turned it on high. Turned the water for the instant mashed potatoes on high also. She put the diced ham in the skillet she fried the other ham in, tossed it around a bit then mixed up flour and a bit of water to make a paste and put it in, lowered that heat on that pan while waiting until the veggies were boiling. Turned the potato water down to simmer. Turned veggies off, drained the water into the pan with the ham bits and rue to make gravy, stirred it, decided she wanted it thicker, added more rue paste and then a splash of milk, a healthy pinch of ground black pepper and had me stirring it while she finished the potatoes. Turned off the microwave that had a 30 seconds left. Put everything in serving dishes and sat down to lunch. This 87 year old woman that could only make hamburger gravy and mashed potatoes at the age of 21 when she got married, now kicks butt in the kitchen. I made sure she knew it also and told FIL she was great in the kitchen.Lesson, She didn't buy anything special for our meal, she used \"scraps\" to make the main dish, used veggie water (never have I thought to use that) for the gravy. She added cottage cheese and grape jam and a jar of pickles along with bread and butter to the table.  Something I grew up with (well not cottage cheese or jam) but don't do myself. I always had bread and butter on the table when the kids were growing up but neither Hubby or I are much of bread eaters even though our doctor just told us to increase our grains (he knows I bake or we get our bread from the Amish)She texted me the next day and told me they had ham sandwiches with apple slices and baby carrots for supper and she diced what was left of ham, added it to the bit of diced ham she didn't put in gravy, chopped up the leftover veggies  and tossed it in water and when it got warm enough, she added the leftover mashed potatoes and leftover gravy and a splash of milk to make a cream soup to go with their  grilled cheese sandwiches for their lunch the next day and sent the leftover soup home with her one grandson that is single.  She told me she still struggles to not cook too much and toss it away as they don't have a compost pile like she did out on the farm. I looked at Hubby and told him what she did. He said he noticed she used smaller pans for the 4 of us that we do for the 2 of us. I texted her to find out what size pans she used.  I use 10 to 12 inch fry pans and 2-3 quart sauce pans. She uses 8 to 10 inch fry pans and 1 qtr. to 1 1/2 qrts  sauce pans. UNLESS she is making spaghetti, then she uses the 3 qrts. sauce pan.I call my 8 inch fry pan the egg skillet as that's the only I use it for. Going to be changing that.Have a good week, stay safePrayers for peaceBlessed Be  window casement windows protectedStill allows air so no mold when I open those windows to air out the basement.A friend gave me her curtains as she bought new. I will be putting them up after I get done with the fall cleaning. I am thinking front room.Hubby paid off the work truck (now called 350) and cancelled his DOT numbers. When they terminated he cancelled the business insurance. He has a refund coming and when it comes in , he can close the business checking acct. Taking longer to close it down than it did to get it up and running. Hubby bartered wood at Sawmill, their Englisher that runs the loader got his hours changed at work so he can't move wood during the day. He okayed Hubby running his loader especially since the sawmill pays all costs and maintenance of  it. It's not very often but every stick of wood for winter helps. We need 12 more cords of wood. E said there is about 1 back in the woods he needs Hubby to bring out and can have.Daughter 4 is coming up to help clean out the garden shed. Hubby is going to fix the floor and then use it for a wood shed as N and E said if we fill it, we would have enough for the winter as it's what they used it for. She might get sucked into cleaning the front bay of the barn also since she just changed jobs(got laid off as they can't get supplies in) and is short on pay. BUT she already has another job that starts Monday.We harvested all kinds of tomatoes, eggplant, cucumbers, zucchini, Roma green beans, mini bell peppers, kale, thyme, basil, oregano, cabbages, cantaloupe, watermelon, tan pumpkins and golden raspberries.  Hubby asked me to not plant anything except the garlic next month. He's tired of eating \"garden\" as he put it. NOW if I plant something that will grow into late fall... that's okay. I spent $49 at grocery store, saved 47 %. I got very small (think they were cut from a small tenderloin) porkchops marked down to $3.98. I used them that night and the next day for lunch.  We will only need milk the later part of the month.Hubby built braces for the two rose trellises at the deck for the climbing roses from scrap wood in the barn.Since I had to clean up the mess in the basement, I got rid of 4 large boxes of stuff that we donated, had some things to go to recycling tomorrow and quite a few boxes that Hubby is drying out to burn later. Charlotte's allergies kicked up and she was bloody raw from itching. We got her into the vet for her shot. Twenty four hours later she is a lot better. I had ran out of eggs so she wasn't getting her daily egg... that won't happen again because within a few days her allergies went nuts. Hasn't had that problem all summer since I put her on egg daily. Vet doesn't understand what ever is in the eggs that stops her allergies but is glad we found out it did as the shots are $150 on top of office call.Daughter's 4 daughter had her baby at 29 weeks at 3lbs. 15 1/2 inches . She had to have shunt surgery yesterday due to brain bleeds. Doing okayHubby's dad  is having surgery today to remove cancerous tumor plus 12 inches of his colon. Our primary doctor has referred Hubby to ENT (regretfully it's a 1 1/2 hrs. from us for this specialist as our regular ENT won't touch it) to find out why he keeps losing his voice mid afternoon to evening. Doesn't matter if he doesn't talk much or what ever. He had throat surgery in 2006/2007 due to polyps. Since he chewed tobacco, cancer could happen. Daddy lost his voice due to smoking even though he had quit years before he got the cancer. He feels like all he does is go from one doctor and test to the next... both his parents said YEP old age does that as both his brothers and sister already are doing the same. Prayers for peaceBlessed be"},

I thought Sh.., which one of the refrigerators or freezers took a crap and what was I going to be trying to can or pass to kids (it's okay with 6 kids and 10 adult grandkids). Nope it was the casement window Hubby forgot to finish caulking and flex sealing. I forgot I have to now check to make sure he completes jobs with his dementia, more like dealing with a teenager with ADHD been there more than once. And as big as the mess looks, the pile was my canning supplies. Tatter lids took the hit, which is nice as I can sanitize them and only lost 1 box of wide mouth metal canning lids. I lost all the empty card board boxes my  jars go in when they are empty. I am not putting anything back there until he can caulk and flex seal that window. I guess the 1.75 inches of rain we got was too much at one time.  Even with all that rain, it came down in a way the ground sucked it up.Then I dealt with this  There is 6 cucumbers under the zucchini. I got 2 quarts of green beans, 9 quarts of tomato sauce, dehydrated the golden cherry tomatoes (red cherry tomatoes got toss in with other tomatoes) . I ate the broccoli, froze the grapes in the kitchen refrigerator. I shoved the zucchini and cucumbers in the frig. Onions are curing in the barnTHEN E sent the boys over with a wheelbarrow full of cornSIGH. No room for a turkey now as the corn has taken it's spot. I got 53 meals out of this corn so we have a total of 79 meals corn. I also made corn cob stock and canned it , 18 pints for corn chowder, polenta, and mush, maybe the autumn stew from Home chef that Son 2 was doing would be good for it also.  (https://www.tastingtable.com/873145/the-absolute-best-way-to-use-leftover-corn-cobs/#:~:text=Perfect%20in%20sauces%2C%20stews%2C%20risottos,or%20vegan%20(via%20PBS). I then put the cobs on the metal table out by the barn to dry so we can use them for kindling. The sparrows have been picking at them.THEN we had a tornado go through. It hit in town. E had a little wind damage to his one barn where the door blew off, said it must not have been shut all the way as the latch was still on the barn. We get one tornado warn a year... not something that happens much.Then I did the finances and pointed out we are over budget. I also pointed out WHERE we are over budget. I got him to leave the credit card at home and we are working at him only buying what is on his list.  He did an escort for a wide load the other day, that hauler asked if he wanted a job as rear escort. He turned it down. He knows he would be gone ALL day and anywhere from 4 to 6 days a week. He would get NOTHING done here.  This week he is scheduled to go clean up the sawmill. He got the wood wagon fixed and was going to go until I told him how the weather was going to be. He didn't want to be driving a tractor without a cab hauling a metal wood wagon in a storm. Then I went down with a Crohn's attack. I probably should have went to the hospital sigh... if I had been throwing up along with sitting on the toilet for 2 days I would have. I didn't do that until day 4. FYI that's usually the day I come home from the hospital. Other than wishing morphine was in this house WE handled it. Hubby fixed me dry toast immediately and started shoving fluids. He jokes I married him because he was an EMT (retired 7 yrs ago). I got a brat patty for a meal because we don't have any dinner sausage patties, For what ever reason I can hold that stuff down.  He thinks stress triggered it... didn't help that I was using core muscles to lift a 50 lb. canner that he usually puts on the stove for me. My GI strongly suggested planks and push ups. NO sit ups as my back would have a fit over that. LOL.So we spent a lot of time of watching the hummingbirds at the feeders and dive bombing each otherIt's to rain today so he probably won't be going to the sawmill. He asked what had to be done this week... two doctor appts. and pulling zucchini and cucumber plants in the garden (I am not pulling anything) I want to do some planting for fall. I need to cut tops off onions that are cured and put them in hose  (panty hose) to hang in basement or barn until it gets too cold. Clean the front bay of the barn as I want to move the canning stuff there. No worries of water damage there. He looked at me and said , two doctor appts that's it. I laughed. I could do that onions I pointed out... nope I would side track and start doing something I really shouldn't... probably. Even when I spend the time in the hospital I struggle to not do anything (because I would do too much and retrigger an attack) the first week home. Be safe,Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},

I got yellow and orange bell peppers for 88 cents (you can barely find them around here) I picked up enough to dehydrate them also, I got red bell peppers to \"fire roast\" on the grill then I will freeze them for red pepper soup (barn freezer I already put their container in to save that room) I got celery for fresh and to dehydrate. I picked up some lettuce as there is none left in the garden and I haven't replanted it yet. I had a coupon for it. I got coke a cola on sale, Kroger chips, Frito scoops and bananas.I picked up a cantaloupe and 4 fresh peaches from an Amish standI picked up my 27 lbs. of cherries for pie filling at Country Variety  Store and Hubby picked up 14 hand pies to freeze and some whoopie cookies. I am not crazy about that type of cookie. He got 6 that was snickerdoodle and 6 of the oatmeal.At the Mennonite discount store ....I found frozen brussels sprouts. I got enough for us to have for a year since no one grows them around here. I will be planting them myself next year.I found a box of strip steaks (think New York Strip steak). For $4.10/ lb. (about half price) I got 14 steaks and they are already vacuumed bag with1 steak per bag... saved my bags. I got 2 bags of thin chicken breast and 1 bag of chicken wings, 6 packages breakfast sausage links already frozen.I also got:  12 whole cranberry sauce, 8 canned pears, 12 mixed berries jam, 4 boxes of Stove Top turkey stuffing and 4lbs of Velveeta cheese (regular price $27 I got it for $18) and a loaf of homemade bread.  In the gardens I know I have tomatoes, zucchini, maybe a broccoli, hopefully another round of Roma beans and maybe some potatoes to harvest. I need to call to see what Honeycrisp or Crispin apples start coming in.

After having 6 of the kids and grandkids come up to get supplies twice during the pandemic, we went to 18 months  as they wiped me out to 6 months and I was getting worried... there was 2 freezers almost empty. . This year I went for 2 yrs supplies on most stuff but what I have seeds to grow. Why? We are already seeing issues trying to get some foods in the area. BUT let's look at what we  use.I bake our breads/ sweets (not much) etc. unless I get it from Amish/ Mennonite. I make waffles, pancakes, muffins, cakes, noodles, wonton wrappers (just starting that), flour tortillas (just starting that), crackers (just starting that) and breading for frying. I use  on average the least 10 lbs. of flour a week. If I am making noodles, I use 20 lbs. to fill my 5 gallon food grade bucket with noodles.  So I average 520 lbs. of flour a year. I average 240 lbs. of sugar a year, 360 lbs. for 18 months and 480 for 2 yrs. This year it's up to 340 lbs. due to extra canning of pie filling and jams. Today I pick up 27 lbs. of sour cherries for pie filling. I buy 3 lbs. of yeast a year (stored in freezer) I do make sour dough bread sometimes but not often as neither of us care much for it. We use 4 pints of veggies a DAY . That is 1460 pints for a year, 2190 for 18 months and 2920 pints for 2 yrs. We use 2 pints of fruit a DAY. That is 730 pints for a year, 1095 for 18 months and 1460 pints for 2 years... that is not touching pie filling, jams, jellies and fruit butters that would add 105 pints for a year, 158 for 18 months and 210 for 2 yrs. I can 104 pints of whole tomatoes, 104 pints of plain tomato sauce, 104 pints of salsa, 52 half pints of pizza sauce, 52 quarts of pasta sauce and 100 quarts of tomato juice. for a year. I will try for 18 months this year.  I do pickles... asparagus, beets, zucchini, cucumbers, onions , coleslaw and kraut. I can chicken broth, beef broth and ham broth. 12 quarts of each per yearI can turkey, chicken, pork and beef. I do roasted red bell peppers. I won't this year as son 2 found  some on sale on base and bought me 6 jars. I dehydrate zucchini, mushrooms, onions, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, corn, herbs and mints.I still need applesauce, apple pie filling, apple butter, and apple jam. I do freeze broccoli, cauliflower, Swiss chard, Chinese cabbage, zucchini, yellow crockneck, eggplant and green tomatoes (breaded for frying). I do freeze berries. The last time I bought canned veggies was last year to make veggie soup. I canned enough for 2 yrs. I can 104 pints of chili soup a year. We also use it for tortilla chips and casseroles.I buy 2 cases of each of condense soup, cream of mushroom, cream of chicken, cream of tomato, cheddar, fiesta cheese and Campbells chicken and noodles. I have 1 Amish if they can't get to the store, will stop for 7 cans of cream of what ever soup. She makes \"pantry\" soup every single day for supper and uses it for the base."},

Hubby laughed.I have room for 1 jar of beets (won't be filled).I have a row space for some store canned fruit (might not be filled unless I find apricots on sale)I have plenty of room in the tomato section (pasta sauce, pizza sauce, plain sauce, enchilada sauce, and juice).I have one row in pie filling in case I get the cherries. Still iffy if they are coming in and if they are getting enough to get some to everyone on the list. Fruit/vegetable 22 cubic deep freezer is FULL.Pork/nuts 22 cubic freezer is taking on the over flow of fruit/veggies but has just enough to handle a couple racks of ribs, a pork loin  and 2 hams. The beef/ bread 22 cubic freezer is go a decent hole but since I know the turkey and prime rib will be going in there I will be keeping a good size home in it. All 3 refrigerators freezers are full. I need to finish straightening up the basement, hang the cured onions and figure out a better storage for herbs and spices.   I need a better way to store the herbal teas.LORD I am tired.

I am also dehydrating zucchini.I will then water the entire garden as we only got 1/3rd of inch of rain 2 days ago and the excessive heat is coming in tomorrow afternoon. I will also apply blossom rot meds (ha ha) to the tomatoes so I can quit throwing them over the fence towards the pond.Hubby has put all 15 metal beds together and started filling them with dirt. He is piling the old wooden beds to the side as E said he can burn them in his one pit he has for that type of stuff, then he then cleans the metal out of it. I need to get started planting the fall/ winter crops but it's not going to be the next two days with this heat coming in. Today he went to go pick up a wagon that has a lift so it can dump what ever is in it. There is a part broke but he thinks he can fix that himself if not there are a couple places around here that do that type of work for reasonable $. It will help to have our own wagon for getting wood from the sawmills plus be able to dump it means I am not standing on top of a pile of wood tossing it at Hubby.The guy said no one wanted it even though he had it for sale for 1/10th of the rest. He took pictures of it and measurements for Hubby. It has a PTO (Hum drive shaft to hook to a tractor to run) and not a motor. The guy is surrounded by Amish. E thought it  was funny as he would have picked it up in a heart beat and rigged it for a motor. Told Hubby he would help change it to a motor if he couldn't get the PTO fixed. It's now drifting to the back side of my arm also. It hurts to lift my arm over my head .  I caught it on a part of the 50 pound canner when lifting it up on the stove. I definitely seem to having issues with bruising easy this summer.

But I am trying to keep enough room for M to put bacon when they butcher, she freezes it about an hour to slice it easier. All 3 refrigerators freezers are FULL.I have half of the corn (frozen) I need for the year. IF I don't get any more, we will only have corn every other week. E's corn has not came in yet and he's thinking it's not going to make very good. So I might check at a couple places to see if I can find some more. I still have room for tomato stuff in the pantry.I have room for cherry pie filling (if the cherries I ordered come in, store I ordered them from said they got a phone call stating they might not get them due to damage done to the cherries). I have room for mixed berry pie filling as I am no longer getting enough of red raspberries to make pie filling so will mix them with blackberries (which the bird that nested in as done a good job of eating the blackberries) for pie filling.I have room for the green beans (M got ran over and sent enough to for me to get 7 quarts worth, she grows Jade green beans) and my Roma green beans and  yellow wax beans  is coming on right now. That spot might get ran over.I have room for applesauce. I can dry apples also as that goes in to the loft for storage. I might move herbs and spices to another loft to free up a couple shelves in the pantry even though I have no shelving to put them on in that area. The dried beans I canned to have canned beans and the meat area is FULL.Dried fruit area is FULL but I will find a place for dried apples if I dried some more. Maybe in the loft under a bed ??? The jelly, jam and fruit butter is full but I will find room some where for the apple butter as it's low. Hubby eats it on cottage cheese.When M sent over the green beans as hers ran her over, she also sent broccoli that I blanched and flash froze as they are tired of eating it.  I will vacuum bag it today. We got enough to have broccoli every other week thanks to her. I have some side sprouts coming on my own plants for fresh eating as I had already harvested and blanched the big heads.  She also sent a head of cabbage. I turned down the green bell peppers as I can't eat them. She got tomatoes off her brother in law to make salsa with them. I don't need salsa. I have to dehydrate zucchini to toss in soups and sauces. I have enough in freezer for zucchini bread pancakes, zucchini pie and fritters etc. I have to process today and tomorrow, green beans, wax beans, berries, zucchini, watermelon, cantaloupe, apples and bag the broccoli.

E yelled at me from the road that they needed help hauling hay, tell Hubby to bring tractor. The tractor goes same speed as horses and that's all the faster E wants his wagons with metal wheels to go. This is the second cutting and they got 10 times more than the first which is unusual. Even with 5 of them hauling the hay, it took 2 days to get it all up into the barns. He had one Amish come ask him to dig post holes for another neighbor that wanted to put a deck on the backside of their house. He had 3 come ask for him to weld something. He had one stopped and asked for him to come move the Loader. (fork lift) as the Englisher that was supposed to do it never showed up. Then the 350 work truck is FIXED AND HOME. I pointed out that he had a small crack from stone in the windshield so he is going to get that dealt with. Then he back up and realized the back up alarm wasn't working. He also checked the estimate list and found they were suppose to replace the ball in the gooseneck and they didn't. He is calling in the morning . Will have to run it back over but he is also taking a receipt where he had to buy a wind shield wiper as the driver's side one was completely missing. GEEZE. But that can be \"a sit and wait for it\" not leave it.  Returned the rental.  Ended up going to McD's for a sandwich. Haven't ate there in over 5 yrs. Sandwich was good especially since we both missed lunch and it was way past supper time. I canned 6 more quarts of zucchini. It's in a syrup base and has garlic, dill, peppercorn, carrot, cherry tomatoes, and zucchini.  I figured one quart a month even if we hate it we can handle that amount. M told me to just chunk it and can it with hot water. She'll add a jar of tomatoes sometimes when serving it. I started fermenting cherry tomatoes, has garlic and basil. Has to sit 5 days and then should be ready. If Hubby likes it (he loves fermented foods) I will make more. I froze 2 batches of strained blackberry puree for ice creamI froze 2 batches of red raspberry puree and some raspberries for ice cream.I froze golden raspberries as there is never enough to do anything with them besides eat them. I canned 7 qrts of red raspberry pie filling. There was 1 1/2 pints left over. I shoved it in the frig. Hubby ate part of it last night over cookies and milk and said it was good. To put pancakes on the menu for Monday.I've moved some of the pantry around to make more room as it's really starting to fill up 😁. Okay some areas are over flowing.Went to a informal get together of high school classmates for a late supper. Was nice. Hubby went to store and got me garlic bulbs as I was completely out and a gallon of milk. That is the only shopping done this month. I don't see needing to stop this coming Thursday after chiro as with the gardens coming in and he just got a gallon of milk, we don't need anything.Electric was $104 ...$71 lower than last year. We still have not turned on AC. I paid the school taxes for this year completely 6 months before they were due. Hubby said he has a couple outstanding bills to come in from the business and then he can finish closing the bank account down. He was aiming for August first, the major part of it is closed as of last week.  He said he doesn't miss it at all as the Amish have made a point of connecting to him in other ways. Everyone be safe. Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},

I think Charlotte \"scared\" it. 😂Hubby and I was talking about how he felt with closing down his business. At first he was trying to figure out something else to do with it as  it was hauling and odd jobs, he knows he needs purpose.... then after dealing with spraying the lane for weeds, mowing twice in one week, picking apples and twice helping one of the Amish, he decided he was fine with closing it down. He also after I repeatedly nagged about going up to the sawmill and ordering a wagon of scrap wood (about 4 cords would be enough to finish what we need for this winter), he stopped and the Amish owner asked if he would be interested in doing some \"cleaning up\" around the mill in exchange any wood he cleaned up was free for him. He will start next week when he has his truck back. Should be hearing something about that today or tomorrow. Hubby looked at the wood that needs cleared... said he was going to have to take the chainsaw with him and the Amish guy was going to ask the other Englisher that owns the fork lift at the mill if Hubby could use it. Hubby thinks about 2 weeks of work that he wouldn't have gotten while hauling and it's FREE wood for our stove and a discount on the wagon full he ordered that will come in this fall because the Amish couldn't find anyone willing to clean it up.HB stopped over and asked if Hubby could help him dig post holes. Hubby has a post hole digger for the tractor. Got that job done in 1 hrs. E stopped last night and asked if Hubby could use his red horse (aka tractor not the truck ) to pull a wagon with steel wheels loaded with hay. As E doesn't want the wagon to go more than 10 mph with that type of wheel, it would damage the road. That will be tomorrow barring rain. Then he mentioned I was doing 3 jobs... I asked what he was thinking of... gardening, processing the food, and finances of keeping frugal. I noticed home keeping was not on that list. We harvested the last of the peas and pulled them. I have zucchini, red and golden beets, red raspberries, golden raspberries and the beginning of blackberries harvested. I still have blueberries in the frig to do today and should be getting a call in next week or two that the cherries are in.I got to thinking, after the second cup of coffee this morning that I needed to puree 2 cups of each of the berries, put in a sandwich bag, then freezer bag to freeze for ice cream this fall and winter. I already did it with the strawberries. I use grape jelly, about 1 tablespoon in my stir fries for a glossy sauce. I told Hubby I wasn't making it because I only have a large jar of grape jelly and I knew it would go bad before we used it up. I will use it in thumbprint cookies. I got to thinking about the small jelly and jam packages at restaurants... I ordered them through Amazon.  Hubby laughed and asked if we could have a few in the \"jelly, jam and fruit butter\" pan in the frig. I have a sheet cake pan to keep that together otherwise I find half used ones with mold shoved to the back.We have not turned on the AC. Hubby wanted to a couple times at night. I told him to switch to sleeping in his \"gym shorts\" instead of flannel pjs. He's now complaining of getting too cool (use the freaking blanket and close down the window beside you.) We bought take out Chinese on Friday late afternoon (got lunch prices) we ate it Friday, Saturday and Sunday for lunch. I was either harvesting or canning 12 hrs. a day.  I have 2 cases of wide mouth pint jars left. Having to use quart jars now for everything.  Hubby strongly suggested I order more wide mouth pints.  I will have to price them first.I best get back to the blueberries, Hubby is picking apples today."},

The \"applesauce\" apple tree needs picked as they are ready. I have red and golden beets, turnips, zucchini, Swiss chard, herbs, bolted lettuce and spinach to dehydrate, red cherry tomatoes to dehydrate, Hubby already took the onions we harvested to the barn to cure. We found some huge black radishes when pulling pea vines (got enough of peas and snow peas we won't have to grow any this fall) If they are pithy I will cut them into dices and dehydrate them. Works well in soups etc. Might fry some as that works also when pitchy.I am behind on starting seeds for plants for fall planting. Have to get that started this week. I need to sort through the seeds for what I am planting (plants and seeds) and then list what needs ordered for next year. I would like to grow more head lettuce that leaf lettuce. But small heads so I am thinking bibb lettuce. Hubby had already dealt with the onions when I took these. They are in half bushel baskets. To the porch for Charlotte time LOL"},

Born at 3:02. Grandma Daughter 3 is still struggling with becoming a grandma but the entire family keeps pointing out her daughter followed in HER FOOT STEPS. Graduated, working full time and 18. Daddy is also. AND just like her mother, not married. SIGH. I would say it's a weird name but we actually had an Amish family name their baby using the initials of several family members and then had to spend a year teaching everyone how they wanted it pronounced. Since my back injections I am sleeping better, just not very long. I rest daily at 2 pm at the insistence of Charlotte. She wants me to lay on the bed with her for 30 minutes. Probably has been a good habit as I try hard to have my work down by then so when I get up from the rest it's prep supper and take laundry down and put it away.Sherm found out the Country Variety store (Mennonite store) had black raspberries so we went to get some. I couldn't find them anywhere last year. I got 46 pints . Making pie filling (quart wide mouth jars) and jam (pint regular mouth jars) . We have one Amish family that is selling a little bit of them. I'll get some from them for fresh eating this weekend. Hopefully our will make enough next year to cut down on what I have to buy. It was half of stores prices.They also had blueberries, Hubby had already bought 12 jars of blueberry preserves. But I am short on blueberry pie filling. They had a 20 lb. box for half of what all the other stores were selling blueberries for. I got it.I also ordered sour cherries, 27 lbs. to make pie filling. Hubby had already ordered those preserves also. IF I have enough blackberries and red raspberries ripe I will mix some of the black raspberries and blueberries with them and make a mix berry pie filling. They had peaches, smaller than regular and not as juicy. I okay with what we have with peaches.  I need pears though but haven't found a supply yet.Our \"applesauce\" tree is almost ready to harvest, The ones now falling are turning ripe faster than the ones on the tree. Today , Hubby is picking up the ones that fell so he can mow and is taking a bucket out with him so if there are any good he can bring them to the house for me. The bad ones Hubby tossing in the tractor bucket and take them over and dumps them at E's for their pigs. We call the other apple tree the pie tree or cider tree... because that's what the apples are good for and no one knows what type of apples they are.We bought eggs from an Amish lady that grows beets for me. We bartered 5 gallons of asparagus for her for 5 gallons of beets for us. She was at a Sister's day so her Husband had the 5 little ones and taking care of selling eggs.  Said she had tripled her flock to have enough to sell and almost doesn't really get enough. I think it's the humidity as chickens don't lay good in hot or cold weather and they don't heat the coops in the winter.Hubby got his hearing aids fixed and I had a hearing test. I am still good with the hearing but they noticed the left ear isn't as good as it was 2 yrs. ago but still within normal range. So him saying I am just not hearing him went out the window as the Doctor told him he was mumbling and his voice is gravelly. Told me to make sure I was getting B vitamin especially folic acid B 9, Magnesium and Zinc in our diet. So I checked what foods was needed to be in the diet. I know there are red raspberries, blackberries, peas, snowpeas, lettuce, spinach, mustard greens, cherry tomatoes, herbs, and maybe onions, beets and turnips to pick today to deal with on top of berries I bought. We don't have any appointments until Hubby gets his truck back, hopefully next Wed. Figure I can do some canning in the morning while the beds dry from dew, then harvest and do more canning when it's too hot/humid to be out.The last of the garden beds we ordered are in. Got them unloaded from UPS truck before the rain dumped buckets on us and the driver. Got so bad we couldn't see the end of the porch 8 ft from the door. We want to get them in within the next week so I can start planting fall/winter crops. Our primary doctor asked us how to do that as he just started last year growing any garden, first time for him and his wife. Hubby mentioned that made 15 beds... I looked at him and told him I only needed 13, he forgot he still had 2 beds in the barn... Sigh... we will be finding a spot for them. He thinks we have enough weed barrier to make another row.In the past 5 days, he has told me at least once a day, that he didn't understand what I meant when I told him something. I stopped and thought about what I said and resaid it and then asked him to tell me what he thought I said. He had it correct... that is an IMPROVEMENT as before he would just say, I didn't say that, and he wasn't catching he didn't understand what was said. I told him yesterday that was an improvement after he was laughing at my brother, who was struggling to understand the text I sent. My text was had lunch at the Inn, ran in to cuz Judy L Daddy's side and her friend whose brothers see you several times a week. She didn't give her name. Manager working floor at the Inn grew up down the street from us. You know her brother Tom P. He came back with we don't have a cuz Judy (we have one on Daddy's side and one on Mother's) He didn't know anyone working at the Inn. Manage texted her brother who just happen to be eating lunch with MY BROTHER. Hubby understood the text but he realized I am dealing with it from two sides. At least my sister in law and their kids are dealing with the issues more than I am. Some of Son2's test results have came back. He worked burn pits in Iraq for a solid 12 months. He has PSTD (I figure all soldiers in battle would have that) and mild to medium COPD. Still has more testing to jump through. His girlfriend is struggling to handle it and the changes that have to be made to be supportive of him. He said the only blessing of finding out now that her answer was to ignore him and not be there like she said she would is they are not married or even living together. He is glad he already quit smoking (again) He has a support system of us and several other veterans that live around him. Daughter 3 and Daughter 4 both have PSTD (both lost infants) and mild COPD from smoking so he's called them also.I did remind him she might have PSTD herself and not know it. Her dad was a vet from Nam, he ended up shooting himself in the car in the driveway and she was the one to find him. It could have triggered her and her not understand or know  that it did. He hadn't thought about that but he was going to go talk to her mom (she was raised by her dad) to see if she would check on her regularly,Going to grab coffee and go sit on the kitchen porch with Charlotte so I don't start rattling pots and pans and wake HubbyPrayers for peaceBlessed be"},

Don't count on me for anything else.3 quarts of heavy cream, will make cream cheese, whipping cream, ice cream and custards.2 quarts of half and half, will make gelato, and mix with heavy cream for custards and white sauce.6 lbs. of butter but ONLY if it is below $3.50 a pound.12 colored bell peppers (I can't eat green, triggers my crohn's) or 2 bags of the mini sweet peppers.6 lbs. of carrots (Mine won't be ready until fall)3 bunches of celery (Mine won't be ready until fall)4 lbs. fresh mushrooms. I use can for pizza, sauces etc. 10 lbs. of sweet potatoes. Didn't even get one to last from last year for starts. 20 lbs. of potatoes. Probably by October that will only be baking potatoes with fingers crossed mine will produce a good harvest.I will be baking our own bread, biscuits, pie crusts instead of Daddy's favorite from Aunt Shirley (which I found out was Pillsbury), tortillas , tortilla chips, crackers,  crackers flavored like Ritz veggie chip, potato chips, and Fritos.I plan to add eclairs, doughnuts (we do baked doughnuts) and cream puffs. One of the kids just gave me a scone dish and some scone mixes someone gave them . Kid took them to keep them from going into the land fill. Since Hubby is home for bfast and lunch I will probably add English muffins and bagels. Might be 2 days in the kitchen LOL.I picked more  red and golden raspberries and 4 blackberries. Hubby asked for a pie until I mentioned pancakes with raspberry topping. He thought that was a good idea.First batch of onions curing. I use 365 onions a year. I usually can only get about half of that and they store until January if temps hold decent.purple grapes looks to be making for the 1st time and rhubarb that is regrowingwhite grapes that we thought died, we won't get a lot but glad they really didn't die.Herbs, rows 1,2,3,4,5,and 6Rows 7 and 8Rows 9,10,11, and 12I have some pots of odds and ends but Hubby is cutting winter wood close by. I don't want to deal with ear protectors in this humidity. Snow peas, peas , turnips and lettuce is almost done. Any \"edible leaves\" will be dehydrated to be ground to add to sauces etc. this winter.I'll be looking at what I want to plant for fall and early winter harvests. Blessed BePrayers for peaceyellow rose #1                                            Yellow rose #2Pink rose                                                   pale red rose I walked out to see if there was any more June dropped apples before Hubby started mowing. Got another bushel for E to have for his pigs.I made a batch of caramelized onion and apple chutney using 1/2 bushel of drop apples. It's on the menu for this week.Decided against making apple pectin at this time so E's is also getting a half of bushel  that I was going to use. Hubby said something about I needed to finish processing the groceries for the freezers I bought yesterday. I told him I didn't need to as it was what we were eating the next couple days. He thought I had a lot of meat... it was cheese and that was dump the bag into the bin in the freezer.Paid the propane early, got a grill propane tank filled for free savings of $41.29 , get 5￠/ gallon off by paying in  full, got another 5￠off by paying before Aug. 1st. Put the charge on my Capital One and got $8.08 back. Total savings is $119.37.Signed Hubby up for his Plan D (premium $5.10 month and meds are less than $5 every three months) and Supplement (through AARP is $123.36). It will cut his medical costs in half.We sat on the kitchen porch and talked about cutting the budget, what to cut (how low can you go keeps running through my head). Figured it out including doing a pantry challenge for the rest of this year with limited (actually listed) buying.And saw Momma with her twin babies.OOPS Momma saw usShe took off with the babies following her but stopped at the woods to see what we were doing. Then trotted over the dip to finish grazing as E saw her as he came down the road and asked if they were up this way. Hubby brought in the mail, wouldn't you know the house insurance went up and that was after the taxes doubled. I already looked and the escrow account (required by mortgage)  is going to be short end of August so I need to put that in and that also means the mortgage payment is going up by $265.85. Our agent sent out notices to all his house insurance customers so they would have as much time as he could give them to get the extra money up. I harvested red raspberries, golden raspberries, peas, snow peas, onions for storage, lettuce, spinach, mustard greens,  turnips, last of golden cherry tomatoes, red cherry tomatoes, zucchini and beets, the beet greens went into the dehydrator. I got my appt. for my back injections including follow up scheduled .A group of our classmates is having an informal meet up that is also on the calendar. We are thinking of changing our chiro appts to Thursday since Hubby is no longer working so we can go in the morning, would be able to take Charlotte along when she is to see vet and/or meet up with a couple friends in that area. We would only go over on Tuesdays every 3 months as that is the only day Doc will see \"couples\" and that is in the afternoon. Have a safe July 4th . Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},

I will be wearing a mask when out doesn't help we have a heavy fog.  Good news...July 1st I will be hitting the apply button on Hubby's plan D. It's Aetna and CVS. If it doesn't change in October I will apply for the same plan D as it covers Humira pens pretty decent. Instead of the $12,000 , it is $1000 . I will still call the company to see if I can get a reduction. Never hurts to ask.Bad news... my lettuce is running me over and Amish next door don't need anymore since theirs is coming in. I already dehydrate and ground to powder for green powder. I even gave a quart of it to a friend. Good news is I found Kevin Jacob's lettuce soup recipe. We had it a couple years ago.  https://www.agardenforthehouse.com/kevins-lettuce-soup. Some I will let go to seed so I have fresh seed.Bad news ... we lost $1800 a month income from closing the businessGood news ... Hubby can use the insurance payment from the totaled trailer to pay off the truck and still have some to put in savings. Good news is he finally got the wrecker reimbursement and we are using it to pay for the last of the garden beds and the rest will go in savings.Bad news... I have 2 IRA accts that was Daddy's that is now closed... I have 2 other IRA's that are sitting but I don't want to use them at this point. That's a loss of $1334.Good news...IRA guy called , they are seeing a strong possibility of stocks going down a lot at the end of 2023 into 2024. They hope not as bad as 2008 but are trying to protect their clients as much as possible. Hubby listened and changed how he is invested, mine is pretty much safe as can be. Unlike Daddy who didn't listen and lost almost all of it before he got it changed. We will toss some savings into CD's to lock that interest in. It's good news when they call and warn you BEFORE it happens.Bad news.... Hubby cut the withdraw by $2666.67.  That cut the income down 50%. Now I have the shakes. I definitely told him there is no way to make extra payments on the mortgage or replace the Silverado. Eating out and take out stops. I can pack us food if we are going to be gone that long from home. We already carry water with us. I understand that he is worried of losing the house as this is triggering all the feelings he went through in 2008(which is not helping the brain issues) where we lost 2 houses, ours and the one Daughter 2 was living in. I reminded him we have a full pantry(actually has over flowed) which we didn't in 2008 and had 2 kids and a friend putting food on our table. We have 4 months of expenses in savings and what ever is left in business acct will go into savings. The truck will be paid off and that is a $800 payment. I have garden seed, I can start my own plants and we have perennials that produce food. He needs pvc pipe to make frame for row covers for garden beds this winter. I also have as of tomorrow a year's supply of OTC meds except for two. We will both be on Medicare and the cost of the rest is less than what we spend on insurance now. It will actually save us $6600 a year even after paying for my Humira. We have clothes and shoes as we just replaced some things he wore out. I replaced my shoes and clothes last year.I have the money for the propane (was going to lower what we order but since I will be baking bread more I will keep the order the same) and wood we get from the sawmill. E is also giving us some from his woods as he really tries to keep his woods healthy and growing more maple trees (he has 2 growing for every one he cuts down). We have 2 yrs supply of coal.  I need a couple things for Charlotte, will order the rest of the OTC and the garden beds today.  Now if I could go back to sleep LOL"},
{"title": "Saving money", "date": "Tuesday, June 27, 2023", "text": "I harvested the last of the strawberries and the first of the red raspberries and mini blueberries. Also got a couple golden raspberries but Hubby and I ate them in the garden. I do not take my phone to the garden when working. Blackberries have not turned. I finished picking the last of the strawberries unless them bloom this fall. They have done that before.I harvest rhubarb (another that will come back by fall) and made strawberry rhubarb pie. I have some rhubarb in the freezer as I have plenty of it as pie filling.I harvest the last of the radishes, some snow peas  and peas for the freezer, red and golden cherry tomatoes, basil, garden mint, turnips, onions and some more lettuce that is running me over. I might pull some of it and pass to M, if they don't need it they can feed it to the chickens... maybe pigs.I harvested the June drop apples, tree is on over load so dumped 1 bushel of unripe apple (it's how it protects itself from too many). I will make caramelized onion and apple chutney and liguid pectin (first time of doing that) and give the rest to M for their pigs.I boiled eggs for Charlotte. If I give her an egg every day she doesn't get the skin rash that the meds is $100 for 30 days. Vet said since it works he thinks it is great. This also had helped Wilbur with his dandruff. Since she is part boxer and Wilbur was a boxer I wondered if it's something common with that breed. What ever, it's $6.50 a month for her eggs compared to the $100 for a 30 day supple in which the rash would come back within a week of being off the meds. Hubby bartered 2 dozen for delivering 4 messages and then taking his cell phone over to the one Amish so she could talk to her brother as his wife's last living sister had died. I made a menu from what we have. We thought to eat bfast at 8 (neither of us like to eat until we have been up a couple hours) lunch at noon and supper at 4.Hubby was mowing between rains which was more of a drizzle until evening, after he finished planting the last of the trees and I was gathering the apples (so he wouldn't mow them) and the stuff in the gardens during lunch. So I fixed lunch for our supper instead. Hubby got the last check from his insurance, it was for the wrecker bill. Now it's wait until the truck is finished as he requested the insurance pay for the truck to be fixed instead of reimbursement. He will have to pay his deductible to the dealership.  We are looking at whether to invest what ever is left over or to pay the truck off. OR do we pay off the truck and then invest what ever is left. Our finance guy is talking to the rest of the group. He is thinking pay off the truck and invest the rest and let the interest it earns go on the mortgage since we are going to replace the Silverado. Hubby is thinking of trading his truck in for a smaller truck. So many choices. I need to make a grocery list as tomorrow I have doctor appt. and we will be going passed the grocery store. We will stop at our bank to get some cash (going to miss that coming from the business).  We will also be dropping off a check at another bank for E as we drive past his bank. Doing the budget today for the rest of the year.

{"title": "Hello", "date": "Sunday, June 25, 2023", "text": "This is Son2's. He has PTSD His lady bought it for him as he can't sleep in a pitch dark bedroom and blue lights bother him and he couldn't find a night light he was comfortable with since his died. She lent him hers and it worked so she bought him one. I had turned his alarm clock around several years ago(as I did my own) and then covered it with white cotton dishtowel so it wouldn't reflect on the wall so he wouldn't see the light but still have the alarm. His phone is in the kitchen at night. He is now jumping all the hoops for VA disability as he worked the burn pits for a solid year. He is not planning on quitting work but figures to get the disability dealt with now. He knows it took Pop 3 yrs. to prove and get his disability from Nam and Agent Orange.Hubby got part of the trees planted. He will be finishing the rest this week. Told me to budget the peonies and daylilies I wanted planted. Wants the north flower garden changed out also as I have some Hosta that  need moved. He wants all the perennials planted this year because he is not sure he will be able to work the tractor next year. I pointed out that he was to be teaching me this year about handling the tractor. It's been a couple years since I've ran it and he has added more attachments I need to learn how to use. He decided to dig the holes for the trees by hand, said he needed the exercise plus the post hole digger makes the holes wider at the top than the bottom unless he goes deep then he has to refill the hole. He marked in the yard with posts for me to check to see if I thought his choices were right. Then he moved the one when he stepped off how far it was to the clothesline. He didn't think I wanted apples dropping in that area. I checked, it's good where he has it marked.We are both starting on CO Q-10. I told Doc about his confusion over the dishwasher and he suggested to start it now since we both take statins. Start the MCT in August instead of now as Doc doesn't want to miss reactions and not know what is causing it. Definitely caught me off guard as he has been doing okay. I have an appt. on Wed in Dayton. Told Hubby I wanted to stop at Kroger's in Sidney on way home (we go through there anyways). He wants to stop at Menards to get a couple storage containers for the business stuff and some house receipts for stuff to improve house that Son2 will need when we die. Daddy kept his and it helped lower what Brother had to pay taxes on when the house sold.Hubby asked if we could keep appts to one day a week... he doesn't care which day since our doctors have been taking time off during the summer and floats our standard time of appts.  I am fine with that. We will still use his white board he had for business as that's where he looks instead of the calendar hanging on the wall. I told him black marker is us (which is how it's been ) and blue marker is him only as the blue was business so it should help him keep track of things. We are still trying to figure a routine of meals since when he was working he didn't eat and I snacked.Prayers for peaceBlessed be"},
{"title": "Yep I broke down.", "date": "Friday, June 23, 2023", "text": "Hubby thought she was cute.Hubby's work truck now called the 350 (it's a F350 Ford ) to separate it from the Silverado that I drive that is falling apart at the frame. ANYWAYS I sidetracked.... dealership let him know the truck will NOT be fixed before JULY 20th. Parts are slow coming in. They also let insurance know that. Insurance will extend the rental. They also are sending the check for the wrecker FINALLY as he battled them over it for 3 weeks.Hubby said he is going to start making the phone calls Monday to start closing down the business. Goal is to be completely shut down by July 31st. As it is we are losing $1800 a month without anything coming in. He already called about the pay off amount on truck. He got enough back from the flatbed being totaled to pay the truck off.I was suppose to get my last IRA check from Daddy's IRAs this month... NOPE... it was last month.  My finance guy suggested he close 2 of the small accts that Daddy had to get me the money to cover this month since he could get it to me in 2 days.. So that's $1200 not coming in for now on.  We have the same finance guy, Hubby is staying with his withdraw as he wants us to pay off the mortgage. My other 2 accts are earning almost 12 % so we aren't going to pull from there unless we have to. Finance guy suggested just pulling the earnings maybe quarterly as he knows we are trying to pay the mortgage off.I finished stocking up the condiments, scored at Aldi's in Marion, more in that store than Sidney's. Came home to what I had ordered from Amazon sitting on my porch. As we were putting it away , Hubby asked if I had ordered a couple things as there was a couple empty spots in the loft (dry goods). I checked... we are low, not out but lower than either of us like.I was in Urgent care as I was worried I had broke my foot again, no... just a bone spur that my podiatrist made a couple suggestions I could try at home to see if it would help before coming in. I am relieved it's not broke but I've had bone spur surgery on my heels as a child, this is actually at the base of my big toe, not hurting (yet) but I thought I had broke it at the joint (again). Since we are finally getting some rain *has by passed us all week*, I started moving things around in the basement pantry. Hubby came in and asked if he should hit the resume button on the dishwasher.I couldn't figure out why he was asking that. Both of us are looking at the dishwasher,  light shows it is on and second light shows it is in the dry cycle. I stopped him from pushing buttons and realized it was the brain glitch.I broke, held it together during his testing (only half of results back and they are normal), held it together through his accident (Crohn's hit though), held it through the financial crap, held it through his mother call that his dad has to have surgery to remove tumor in bowels and it might be cancer on the way home yesterday (see surgeon Monday and his sister is going with them), held it while dealing with changing the budget and still trying to pay the mortgage off . BUT totally broke and cried over him being confused over the dishwasher. He started laughing and said it that is the only thing he does that makes me cry than it's not bad. I keep in mind it was a blessing he held steady with the finances and with his the results of his  Dad's testing. He's right, if I can handle all the rest and not the dishwasher... it's not horrible. I have found he does better if I can print off directions or diagrams when he is working on something. He went out today and took grass off where the red maples are going to be planted but didn't want to do the apples and crabapple until I checked out where he thought they should be planted. He doesn't acknowledge shade when the tree has grown. He doesn't want me out in the rain, I have some congestion. He even turned the furnace back on , okay it's 68 in the house right now and the temp is to drop tonight. Weird weather for June. He did tell me that after I told him I wouldn't probably be buying blueberries as I am not paying $5 for a pint to make blueberry preserves... he ordered it along with cherry preserves. I checked what he ordered... it's exactly what I would have ordered but twice as much but that is okay. It won't go to waste.He wants to put row cover on at least 2 of the garden beds for late fall, winter crops. I am thinking maybe 4 of them. Two for late fall and 2 for winter.  He brought up that in 2007, he really was against me stocking up or gardening much and we paid for it when he went to 3 days a week for 2 yrs. He doesn't want to repeat that. SO I am thinking that since that is worrying him I would write out what we need to stock, what we want to stock including holistic and have him mark it off for me (he needs to feel useful) . Maybe he will feel more secure with where we are. He ran a message over to E's dad four times the other day and twice today, charged 2 dozen eggs for it. LOL. He knew we were low as I hadn't gave Charlotte any boiled as I was using the frozen like I do for baking or omelets. He is going to HAM radio field day tomorrow. The head guy knows he is having is having issues, they had picked up before he told them he was in testing. He assured me that at least him and 3 others would be with him. If something happened they would let me know. They already set the rule you have to younger than 60 to climb on the tower. That took the 3 that usually is the ones working on it OFF the tower. .I am thinking of taking a nap with Charlotte.Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},

A few parts are on order...sounds like back order. The Ins. lady said they would extend the rental car.Flatbed that insurance totaled out... GONE. Tow truck driver mentioned his truck was overkill since the trailer could have just been hooked to a regular truck. It was being transported to savage auction in Columbus.Livestock trailer GONE. Got a good price out of it. Still close by so Amish still have use of it but off our insurance so saving that money.Hubby is down to dealing with the legal paperwork of closing the business down BUT has to wait until the truck is fixed to do that. Hubby suggested we only turn the AC on when the humidity hits a certain level... I asked what level that was... he pointed to Charlotte and said when she is panting hard like Wilbur used to. Rascal very seldom panted but Wilbur did. Might be a boxer thing as she is part boxer.I took the stock list with us when we went to bank to make several deposits.We stopped at the Dollar General there and I got 4 items off the list.Hubby dropped me off at Dollar General in town while he went to make arrangements for the 12 trees to be delivered since the truck won't be fixed until July. Owner gave him a 50% break on delivery due to the reason we had to change that part LOL.I got 1 more thing off the list at that Dollar General.... we then went to Save-A-LotI got  brat patties, more coconut milk, a rack of ribs for July 4th  and frozen broccoli. I won't have to \"worry\" about getting broccoli for the freezer. There is enough for once every other week for $10. Rotate it with the asparagus.I checked the prices of what was left at the last 3 stores we can stop at on Thursday. Amazon had the rest cheaper except 3 . So I am down to 3 things to stock up. We will also need blueberries and black raspberries as our NEW plants won't be making those for a couple more years. I picked peas, snow peas, scallions, beet greens, mustard greens, spinach, different lettuces, basil, sage, thyme, parsley and strawberries. We have been eating from the gardens and pantry. We went to nephew's graduation party on Sunday, saw FIL also. Hubby's sister sent home a plate for our supper. We ate it for lunch the next day as neither of us was hungry that night. I am down to 2 tank tops as I've lost enough weight the shoulder straps don't stay up and I am constantly tugging to make sure I am covered. I found some for half price as they are not the current style (I didn't know that type of top had a style LOL) I checked the clothing budget and was happy to see there was more than enough in it to get some. Daughter 2 offered to give me $ for the old ones for her to wear to work. I offered to give them to her but she insisted she buy them, if she doesn't wear them she will sell them in a yard sale and will make more than she is giving me.  OKAY. We are combining errands with other appts on Thursday with the store as the last stop coming home. Prayers for PeaceBlessed Be"},

I hope they make enough for at least fresh eating though I would like to have some to can. I do have 4 broccoli plants, not sure they are going to make as it's been slow. Four is not enough to have a lot for the freezer but it's better than none. I could not find cauliflower plants. So that will have to be bought at store. There are a couple local farmer's markets that I will check later in the season.I need blueberries. I hope next year our bushes will be producing enough for us but this year like M I will be buying what I need. I need pie filling, preserves and some frozen.I would like to have black raspberries also for the same reasons of blueberries.After reading Pioneer Woman's blog of stocking the pantry. I checked my condiments and baking stuff... I am out of Arrowroot completely along with Mirin aka rice wine. Hubby was wondering how I pulled the last of the Arrowroot and not notice it. BECAUSE I store that in 2 places and figure it was in back up in the loft and it wasn't.I am low on black olives, canned mushrooms, garlic stuffed green olives, pepperoncini peppers, pistachio pesto (the only one we eat), green chilis (I use with tomatoes instead of Rotel), roasted red peppers in jar, hot sauce, fish sauce, Worcestershire, and beef broth (the only broth I don't make myself as I don't have access to the bones to make it).I have checked prices on line to figure out best price as we will be near several stores this week.Dollar General/Aldi's/Save-A-Lot/ Walmart/Meijer's/ Kroger's and Amazon.I need to refigure the finances since Hubby is closing the business plus going on Medicare that will come out of his SS.

SIGH. What is going on this week...Today Hubby is calling to check on when the truck will be done and then to see if the reimbursement for the wrecker bill is in the works. The Amish gentleman made a point of getting the message back to Hubby he had called the insurance and gave them the info they needed from him.He is meeting the young man that is buying the livestock trailer at his bank to sign over the title and get the check . I am in harvesting and weeding mode along with regular Monday of dishes, laundry, clean frigs, trash to the road and fixing meals. I will add that I will be figuring out how to start my strawberries off the runners so the winds don't blow the small pots away. I also need to pull test results from Hubby's chart from Neurologist for primary as the primary doesn't do internet.Tuesday Daughter 3 is having out patient GYN surgery. Her daughter is going to be with her since she's over 18 and a nurse. The good news is (beside this long wait for surgery is over) is while visiting with the doctor, she over heard of a job of doing computer work for medical bills to one insurance from home. She got hired and is earning 30 cents more an hour, no need to drive her car so saving $30 a week there, can take her 2 youngest to school and go get them so not paying someone else to do that. No weekend, evening and holiday work. She just has to get the daily billing done. SO she can even do it while down from the surgery as it's ALL ON LINE and she will be sitting anyways.We will got to bank, need to update POD's and such.IF we don't get rain I will be watering and harvesting of courseWednesdaySon2 has an appt. with VA doctor , he is jumping hoops as he worked the burn pits in Iraq. This is the 3rd doctor and they already told him that he would have to see a 4th doctor. SIGHWeeding and harvestingWe will have to make arrangements for our trees to be delivered it the truck is not fixed by then. Local nursery had fruit trees discounted so we stopped in to replace the 5 that died. We got 2 honey crisp apples, 2 bartlett pears, 2 black cherry, 2 red maple, 2 crabapple and 2 \"fruit cocktail\". Yes, that is what they are called because they are grafted with mixed fruit. I think it's peach, plum and pear. We spent the same amount of money we would have spent on 5 in the spring for all 12 now. Now we just have to figure out where to put them.ThursdayIs errand day because Chiro doc is out this Tuesday, he is in treatment for brain cancer (3 yrs now and doing well) so we moved it to Thursday as we have a meeting with our finance guy that day. Hubby's Dad will have a colonoscope also and get the test results of his CT scan of his stomach. We will go the to the store then also since we will drive right by it coming home.Friday Watering if no rain, weeding and harvesting.Is open at this point but I am really hoping it is bring the truck home and return the rental though I LOVE driving the rental. Saturday is Field Day for HAM radio operators so Hubby will be involved with that."},
{"title": "Sometimes you wonder", "date": "Friday, June 16, 2023", "text": "how some people figure stuff... We went to the local Medicare even though it's a bit early for Hubby as we were looking at costs. She did very well until she thought Hubby should go with an advantage plan....Hubby said no, his primary said that was bad because of the battles of getting preapproval for some tests. She pulled it up and showed all his doctors/ hospitals are in network in that plan (blew past the what about when he was out of state and needed care) and the out of pocket maximum would only be $4300. NOT INCLUDING the premium.  Her words were \" Isn't that great to know that is the maximum?\" AND she didn't want him going AARP supplement.The look of shock was priceless when we both said at the same time, no that's not great, that is horrible and no way as would he go that way as he only pay $3,000 NOW. Needless to say, she immediately stopped and offered to schedule him to come back in July when he can sign up and what ever he decides is fine.  She did make note that there was one plan D he had looked at that she knew was getting ready to go away because they weren't listed anymore. Basically he is going straight Medicare, AARP supplement AND still is flipping between 2 of Plan D. The difference between the 2 is $50 and whether he wants to get the meds local or wait over in Sidney (actually could drop meds off, run errands, go to store  and then pick meds up afterwards. Instead of drop meds off on our way home and go back next day to pick up when half the time we haven't made it the 10 miles home before they let us know they are ready.He asked me what I thought about me signing him up online instead of going back...I think I am capable since Medicare.gov allows you to enroll for plan D and I am the member (he is under my AARP membership) for the supplement... On the side note, he picked up the check for the totaled trailer today. They will pick up the trailer either today, tomorrow or Monday. Not an issue as it is sitting where it's not in the way.Truck is waiting on  a couple more parts and they hope finished by end of next week.Wrecker adjuster is still trying to get around him not having a loading bill from Amish. She finally got the company to agree to her getting a statement from the gentleman even if it's over the phone.... Amish don't have phones. Hubby asked ST if he could get a message to his brother in law who lives 12 miles from the guy to have the guy call Hubby so he could give the guy info to call the adjuster. BUT she might send a letter so make sure he didn't throw it away and would need to answer it and send it back.  Still Hubby asked our personal insurance guy if he could quote price of ins for work truck AKA 350 (since it's a 350 Ford) and he is checking on that for us. E knows of at least 2 people that would buy the livestock trailer. Hubby's goal is to have ALL of the business closed  and dealt with by July 31st. Prayers for peaceBlessed be"},

", "date": "Wednesday, June 14, 2023", "text": "Waking up at 12:30 A.M. to the rain hammering the side of the house.Apparently Hubby was already up with Charlotte and the coffee pots had beenturned on. They of course as of now  are sound to sleep.Books I have read in past 2 wks.Alzheimer's Disease What if There Was a Cure by Mary T. Newport. MDI really liked this book... some of it we did with Daddy I am using a slowapproach with the diet changes more for me as it can easily trigger my Crohn's. Since I am adding the coconut oil to the cooking. Hubby doesn't like coconut but since he can't taste it (it has no coconut taste), he is okay with me adding it to our diet.  Next month I will add MCT oil. The following month I will add coQ10. He said something to the one Amish gentleman and was told that the MIL is on all 3 of those along with eating spicy foods to help keep her metabolism up.  The End of Alzheimer's Program By Dale E. Bredesen, MD I have not started this book but was suggested by grandson's MIL who is anurse in neurology.Eat to Beat the Disease by William W. LI MD Couple of the kids suggested this. Daughter 4 has done some of it for hercancers . I am also using it for my Crohn's. It's set up that I can make small changes as we go. Hubby was okay with trying this some especially if he doesn't have to acknowledge the change. He is his father's child.Eat to Beat Your Diet by William W. LI MDThis is more of your metabolism. It's broke down by weeks and it is a strict diet. I am not sure with the work we do that it is a doable diet even for 2 weeks as it takes meat out completely and only has beans (which I can not eat daily). I will talk it over with our Primary when we see him.Hubby copped an attitude with me over exercise. Neurologist said 1 hour each day, at least 10,000 steps. He is getting 5000 and forget even trying to get him to do stomach vacuum exercises (suck your gut in and hold it to the count of 20. Do 3 rounds, 3 times a day , second week go to count of 40 and third week count of 60) Son2 did these when he was having issues and needed to deal with it quickly to remain in Army as he only had 1 more year until retirement at that time. I don't worry about him lifting weights or anything like that. You can't cut, stack and haul fire wood without that type of exercise and he's dealing with the wood 3 times a week at least and moving dirt bags of 2 cu ft. around after putting in the new strawberry beds.I am doing the same exercise and same diet... it's not like he is alone in this. I asked him why he wasn't doing a simple exercise that he could do sitting at his computer.  His answer was that I was making him sound stupid for not doing them. So I called our primary, who is also a long time friend of Hubby's and had Hubby tell him about why he wasn't doing the simple exercise. When he got to the part I was making him sound stupid for not doing it...Doc told him he pretty much was correct he was sounding stupid. Do the blasted exercises.  I did NOT laugh (while he could hear me). If Doc has said, don't worry about it or it's okay I would not have pushed it. While Doc had him on the phone, he asked Hubby if he had gotten his Plan D yet. Nope that's Thursday, but did tell Doc he was doing straight Medicare with AARP supplement and a Plan D. He found 2 that would fit where we live and what he takes but wanted to get advise on it. Doc thought that was a good plan. ( Computer is whacky this morning so it's highlighting in white for some reason)He did replace the north steps to the kitchen porch, he wants to wait for a couple weeks before tweaking them as right now they have a slight rock when you step off them towards the house. The old ones had the same but I had put a shim under the one side and fixed it. The south steps on that porch will take 2-3 days if not longer as he will have to level the area first to do as of right now it's been railroad ties and concrete blocks for 5 yrs.He was on the way to the mail box and sent me this. The day before he had pointed out that there was buds only on the zucchini. He was amazed that in 1 day with the rain they had bloomed and the one zucchini was the size on his little finger.The peas (left side) are starting to fill out... they have \"draped\" over the leaf lettuce and the radishes are on the right side. He was excited we might have peas this week as we usually have peas in May. I've has a few snow peas to add to meals but not enough to be a side dish.He figures Friday both of us will be in the gardens, weeding and harvesting and he will be mowing. Saturday will be finish what ever up and Sunday we go to his sister's son's graduation party and will see his dad there for Father's day. Charlotte is up... wanting out until she realizes it is still raining LOLBlessed BePrayers for peaceTHANK YOU FOR LISTENING"},
{"title": "Another morning wide awake, accident update and life rolling on", "date": "Tuesday, June 13, 2023", "text": "Blaze rose bud.white rose, looks almost exactly like the blush rose that has tinged with pale pale yellowHubby said strawberries would need picked today, but since it's suppose to rain all day it might not happen or it will be between showers. That there are blooms and a small zucchini the size of his little finger that was not there the day before. Looks like the blackberries and red raspberries are coming on at the same time. I don't know if I woke at 2 a.m. because I had to go pee like a race horse  or because the furnace kicked on. We turned it back on last night at bed time when we saw it was going to get down into the low 40s this morning. This weather is all over the place.But at least I am not spending 2 hrs. a day, 4 days a week watering the gardens. Normally I wouldn't water perennials but being new plants I do the first year. I baked an applesauce spice cake that we will top with apple pie filling and a no bake fresh strawberry pie making my own \"glaze\". Since Son2 brags he makes his own, I had to match him LOL.We had chef salad a couple times from the gardens. Should have more this coming week.Hubby has his Medicare stuff scheduled for Thursday. He is going straight Medicare with AARP supplement and which ever plan D they think is the best. He doesn't take a lot of meds and what he does take is generic but he worries about needing a \"higher tier\" dealing with his brain. We were trying to figure out how much his Plan D would run, I read it one way, he read it the opposite... we were BOTH WRONG and when he said something about me being wrong also. I reminded him I have had a stroke, have heart failure, cerebral palsy on top of a learning disability. Dementia is a given... he laughed really hard. Such a pleasure to hear him laugh. But did acknowledge he never has thought about my issues even though he tutored me in math in high school and know I was able to help Daughter 3 with her learning disability because it's almost exactly like mine.  He said something about dealing with these issues and I pointed out that in 2008 Daddy had started in to Dementia, but because we didn't live with him (widower) we didn't catch it. It was another 10 yrs before we caught it and HE actually is the one to ask the doctor for a test for it. His own dad has had it for 5 yrs and is in his mid 80s and is doing fine . Including he helps clean the house unlike his son.... another look of horror and he went off to run errands . 😂He has went to each Amish that he regularly hauls for and told them he is done. Even if they fix the trailer (both of us think they will total it and still waiting on that to come back as it went to a 3rd party for decision), he is done. Adjuster who is over the truck was at the dealership when they pulled the bed off. Nothing wrong with the frame so it's being repaired, just waiting on a new bed to come in for it. She did have them replace the ball part of the gooseneck hitch and both safety chains. The dealership ordered that from Amazon and then charged for delivery. Hubby called her and told her if they had said something I could have got it delivered for free. Regretfully they didn't tell her or she would have asked us if we had prime. I thought it was funny. He hasn't heard from the adjuster over the wrecker bill, said he would give her a couple more days before contacting her. He will keep the livestock trailer for another year. He doesn't think he will have much use of it as the mineral spirits he has been going after every 3 months(55 gallon barrels fit nice in the livestock trailer) is now going to come in on a semi. Three Amish communities joined together to get that shipment in. They save almost 30% doing that way. Just means we now have to pay for our oil for our lamps. BUT he is closing down the business, not a maybe or a might. He said he is closing it down and will start paperwork after the accident crap is finished. He will probably do small hauls close by where he doesn't need State numbers to run. Since he has Legal Zoom, they will help him on that side.He decided he wants to have 2-3 yrs worth of fire wood. He needs a lot more wood...E told him to leave other year's wood as timber for at least 1 yr. Then cut it. and leave it sit another. E came over and spent about an hour looking at the wood Hubby was splitting and what is going for night time wood and made suggestions. Told Hubby to get at least one more wagon of wood from the saw mill if not two and use the wood coming from his woods for night. E is clearing some so his maple trees he taps grows well. He also told Hubby he would barter wood if Hubby would go to the woods with him when the boys aren't home. E doesn't think anyone should go to the woods to cut wood alone. Hubby took large cardboard boxes to M as she uses them for the floor when butchering. She told him awhile back she had a place to store them so he cleared a good amount out of the barn in stall 2. We checked the calendar and he asked if I would put appts on his work calendar as he doesn't think to come check the Flylady calendar in the dining room. We have a lot of appts.  The 15th is his Medicare appts with Health Market. The 18th is Father's Day and nephew's graduation  party. The 22nd is chiro in Sidney then driver 1 1/2 hrs. to Marion for appt with IRA guy. Will probably pit stop at his parents and then go to Kroger's before coming home since it's right around the corner from where we will be. The 28th I have to be in Dayton for check for my back to start preapproval for injections. The 30th if we prepare our winter propane we get a free grill tank of propane. That's a savings of $25. We used 515 gallons this year. I bought 800 gallons last year so I have credit. We decided 700 gallons as if like today in June I have the furnace on due to it being 42 outside. We have more than enough money put back for the propane.He made a list of things he wants done this summer/ fall... then he pointed out if he didn't close the business , he would be always running behind and that is stress on his brain. He didn't realize what he was doing that was making it worse until now. He ran across some article about eating to kick start metabolism and increase health defense against bad crap and asked me to look it up. It's the same book that Daughter 4 read when she started fighting cancer and was pushing 200 lbs. at 5 ft 2. She's now down to 140. But she thought the book (it was a loan from a friend) really was good. I decided on a hard copy of both books the doctor had wrote. I'll let you know how that goes.My kitchen is a wreck. So today I will focus on reorganizing it and giving it a good cleaning. I think I enough hand wash of skillets to deal with since I don't run my skillets in the dishwasher.Meantime Charlotte wants to go sit on the porch.... now where did I put that blanket ???Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "I was going to sleep in plus rambling thoughts", "date": "Sunday, June 11, 2023", "text": "Yep, I told Hubby I was sleeping in. Since he only got 4 hrs. sleep himself the night before (went and picked up E and M at bus stop at midnight) and I got 5 . He thought it was a great idea for both of us.Yeah well ... I ate a foot long coney dog at supper (it's now officially summer for me)and IT decided I needed to be up at 1:00 am. SIGH... no sense trying to go back to sleep so I made coffee.  She's been good and not went and woke him up. Yes she will do that if I am up and he isn't. She won't wake me up if he is up though.Moon has an orange cast to it. Charlotte and I sat on the kitchen porch and listened to the frogs in the pond behind us. We have 1 frog and he's pretty quiet in our pond. Listened to E's horses clop around the pasture next to us as he took the two from the pond home yesterday.Our \"personal\" insurance guy gave me an estimate of what it would cost to put the work truck on our insurance if Hubby shuts down the business.  I input it into the budget and then showed Hubby. I am pretty sure he is going to shut down. He even brought up about asking a couple other haulers if they wanted to buy the livestock trailer. I figured he would keep that because he uses it when Amish go get mineral spirits for lamp oil 4 times a year which means free lamp oil for me. I might bring that up... he uses it to haul horses 4 times a year... it mostly sits...which might be why he is thinking of selling it. It is covered by insurance when on the personal truck under the farm insurance so it's not costing anything extra  except when he has to replace tires. We talked about getting a smaller truck (used Ford 150 or a Chevy Silverado) and a Nissan Armada (used) that would last us about 10 years.I am not willing to be without a truck. We use a truck a lot on the personal side. Went with out for a year and I got tired of renting uhauls to haul crap to the dump, Supplies for the gardens and helping the  kids, etc. Both vehicles have to be able to tow... MY requirements. I agreed we should be looking at something that will last at around 10 yrs. We got all the gardens weeded, harvested and watered. Should be getting rain starting around noon that is supposed to be a soaking rain and last over night. We need it. Strawberries will be ready to pick again, lettuce, onions, cherry tomatoes, spinach, mustard greens and maybe a few more radishes and turnips should also be ready after this rain.Since we have been talking of diet changes or really going back to our old diet which was a lot healthier. Hubby asked if we could cover the colors diet (aka Rainbow diet) without going to the store. We couldn't but I could pick up some of what we don't grow ourselves through the Amish and fill in at the store. Like pumpkin we get off ST, I buy 3 at Halloween and then cut them up , cook them , puree them , dehydrate them and grind into powder. A 50/50 mixture of powder and water and let sit becomes puree. I add it to bread, cake, pancakes, waffles and soups.  Just a FYI, an Amish pumpkin pie is not orange, it's more of a pale orange almost tan and it doesn't taste like canned pumpkin at all. That was a bit of a shock when M sent the first one over. She just laughed when I said something. Libby's pumpkin is actually a Dickinson Squash. https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/what-is-in-canned-pumpkin-articleI can buy acorn squash and butternut (2 that almost all Amish grow). Amish do a bulk order of fruit and we have a local (okay it's 40 miles away but we pass it when we go to appts.) that we can order bulk fruit also.  I told him I would make a list. I need to go back to growing garlic. I picked up some last year at A and B s but she told me she wasn't going to have as much to sell this year of it. Might make that list today and let Hubby start checking to see who is growing what for sale. Give him something else to do with purpose to \"protect\" us financially. I will have to check the pantry of what is needed. I really hope the Roma green beans and yellow wax beans start growing as I've planted them again.I planted Yukon gold, red skin, purple and russet potatoes... they look like they are going to do decent. My sweet potatoes rotted so I didn't get starts off one. Couple other Amish said they had the same issue and had to buy starts. I will have to order them if I don't find a homegrown sweet potato between now and fall.Guess I will go get another cup of coffee.Thanks for listening to me ramble along.Blessed bePrayers for peace"},
{"title": "Frustration", "date": "Saturday, June 10, 2023", "text": "Hubby has hair past his shoulders but it is very thin like his mom's. I hate to see him pulling it out while dealing with insurance over the wreck. He has 3 different adjusters which is bad enough. Thankful that they specify which part they are working so he can keep them straight. One for the truck, she told him that she had the dealership pull off the other fender and that would be covered to be replaced as she wanted to see if the axle was messed up and that she would be in the dealership when they removed the bed to check the rest of the frame Monday or Tuesday. They didn't have an opening  to do that when she was there. Once the bed is off.. if no damage then it's more of waiting for the new bed to come in. If the 30 day rental is not going to be long enough she will have insurance extend it. IF totaled due to frame, she will have the pay off to the bank and balance to him in 10 days. Okay... that is a good time frame even though it took them a week to start getting things around.One for the trailer, the adjuster is pushing for it to be repaired but thinks they will total it. He thinks Hubby will get an answer in a week. One for the wrecker bill... this lady does not understand Amish don't do load bills like Englisher's do. Actually questioned the cop that was behind Hubby that saw the accident of whether there was a load on the trailer. Questioned the wrecker company that picked it up off the freaking road and delivered to the Amish it was going to. Hubby told the other two adjusters and they are trying to help deal with it.  IF the insurance company had told him, and they admitted they just assumed (we know what that makes us when we do that) that he would always need a load bill . He could have generated that himself. They knew he was hauling for Amish as it is stated in the policy.  We can't afford to eat $5300 wrecker bill but I am willing to hire a lawyer to push the issue and I made that clear.Hubby has done well handling it A couple of the Amish had told him if the insurance refused to pay him for that to let them know and they would help cover it. I doubt he would do that. He did a few odd jobs that has been sitting on his to do list for awhile. Actually stopped without complaining for lunch. He asked while we ate for me to help him figure out a propose and what socialization he could have if he wasn't hauling. He knows that lack is what caused Daddy to go down hill fast.To me that is a huge step for him to think about as he has always been a fly by the seat of his pants. Off the top of my head, he could go back to work in the winter for the state as he does have a CDL He could go to work for the county, he has a friend he made while working state that does county in the summer. He could add to the gardens and grow produce for the Amish auction like we did with asparagus this year. I pointed out that during garden time both of us are busy plus he will have more medical appts. we will have to deal with. During summer and fall, he needs to deal with cutting wood for the stove. In spring he will have to focus on resupplying the wood to have it cure. We look to have a cure of 2 yrs. before we burn the wood. During winter every other day he takes 2 hours to reload the house of wood. He plows our driveway and the 2 widows' driveways so E doesn't have to do that any more. He can go help E in the woods when the boys are in school as E won't go to the woods for cutting wood without someone with him. He can still deliver messages. He can still take them shopping over in Holmes county especially if we replace the personal truck.  There are still some punch list things needing done and that could easily take him until next year to finish as it now takes him a month to do a job that took a week. He could repair some furniture we have in the barn so we could sell it.If we could buy something like the rental we are driving and put a tow package on it, he could do local small tows as we have a small trailer like hay or straw. We could make the rounds to see the kids and his parents more often since he wouldn't be working 4-5 days a week. We could go see some friends that also are retired.  I told him he could actually do some of the house work and start decluttering the barn.  I also suggested that he start doing some of the cooking or figuring out menu. The look of horror made me laugh. He is okay with cooking or menu but he hates housekeeping would hire it done in a heart beat and knows the barn clutter drives me crazy.He is back doing crossword, sudoku with paper back books and playing pool on his computer. Doc thought those were all good. We just need to get past this mess with the wreck to make choices. Though I think he has chosen to shut it down but isn't saying so in case the insurance causes him issues that way."},

Some more (I planted 12) have buds, some have nothing but are firm to ground so maybe next year???Our rental car... that if I had the money I would buy... maybe next year if the old red truck holds up Nissan Armada 2021. Drives like my 2001 Ford Explorer and inside is like Son2's Chrysler Pacifica . I sent the pic to him as he is on the hunt for a new car also.Update on wreck... Hubby has to get proof he was making a delivery ... do you understand that Amish don't do paperwork or have phones... was his question to the insurance. The cop that was behind him was wondering why his word that the equipment was on the trailer wasn't enough. HUM. Won't pay the wrecker tow bill until he can give them paper work, that is $5300 we can't afford to eat. So he is jumping hoops.Adjuster for the truck basically just went to the car dealership where we dropped it off to go over it with them to make sure everything is fixed. Truck worth is at $40,000 damage is at $18,000. They are taking the bed off on Monday and if nothing is wrong with the frame underneath it, it will be repaired. IF frame is bad, it will be totaled.Second adjuster came to house to check out trailer. The young man was here 6 hrs. He spent 2 hrs. looking the top side over, another 2 for the underside and 2 hrs. on the phone figuring things out.  Trailer was worth $18,000 Repair is at $14,000 because the entire bed has to be replaced due to scrapes that will allow the bed to rot. He said it will most likely be totaled. Personally he would rather fix it but the cost of wood for that floor is through the roof. Hubby said he is thinking of shutting the business down whether they fix it or not. I would prefer that but I know this is not only his purpose for something to do but his socialization.  When he asks questions I will answer but I am not pushing either way. I did tell him the stress of worrying about making enough to meet the bills is a negative on his health.Speaking of his health, he got his EEG done. Results will be Sept 20th due to not being able to get in to the doctor that does that. We were warned when we saw the neurologist it would take months. They did say he needs to eat healthy, lose at least 1 lb. a week and exercise 1 hr. a day. Working in the gardens, pushing the lawnmower and cutting, stacking and hauling wood counts. They also want to me track when he showing the most confusion, what he is eating and when since he only drinks black coffee, unsweet tea and water along with how many steps he is getting. Back to the gardens... got lettuce, onions, radishes, turnips, mustard greens, strawberries and golden cherry tomatoes today. Tomorrow it's the perennial gardens to be weeded, harvested and watered. Hubby decided after harvesting the strawberries that he needed to get the new bed up. Said they were starting new runners. So I am not going to deal with it when he is working there...even though it was tempting to hose him with the garden hose. I behaved 😈😝. I still need to repot some rhubarb for MIL, basil and wave petunias. Herbs need cut and in dehydrators also. But that is for another day and I am done after getting up at 3:30. Blessed BePrayers for peace"},

LOL I will say it's going to take a lot of sacrifices to get back on track after . Hubby lost 3 weeks of work in May due to trailer brakes malfunction. He is going to lose probably the same due to getting truck fixed. July is always very slow due to factories shutting down and not needing the pallets that he hauls. He has 18 more payments on his truck that he has been using the business to pay but. He can make enough to pay regular bills, central billing, insurance, truck payment  some on legal stuff. BUT I know if he isn't hauling he is going to lose socialization (a loner).  He already has close to $10 K out of pocket to get everything back on the road and home. His business insurance had him file through the app. so she could get things rolling to get his money minus deductible back asap. Since his Social Security will be covering the bills (again) for the business. Mine and the IRAs will be covering the home. No worries there since the debt ceiling passed.THIS MONTH NEEDED DONESchedule and set up his Medical, supplement and drug coverage. Schedule with lawyer to update will and legal crap.Schedule with funeral home to figure out prepaid funeral arrangements like Daddy did.Make sure we get all his testing done. His EEG is tomorrow and his nerve testing in Nov 1st. His Neurologist is doing that testing himself so we are only making 1 trip for that. There was mention of sleep study being done, just as a check as Hubby was taken off Cpap machine after he had throat and nose surgery. We haven't heard anything about it being scheduled...yet.I have Ortho appt first thing in the morning for my leg/ fake hip issues. Probably more muscle and could be coming from the bad back but back doctor won't do injections until hip is ruled out since the pain in more in that area. We have chiro between my appt. and Hubby's appts. Thankful they are all within 30 miles of each other. Time wise it sucks a bit between the first two. Might hit Menards and Lowes to check out garden stuff. We will have enough time to eat between chiro and his EEG which they want him to eat 2 hrs. before the testing.We usually go to the store when we go to chiro. I am by passing this time. Garden is coming in and we can have lettuce sandwiches just like M served to her family last night. Strawberries are coming in, so pancakes, waffles and French toast will be good or chicken salad with strawberries. Have a good weekStay safePrayers for peaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "UPDATE ON ACCIDENT", "date": "Friday, June 2, 2023", "text": "Wrecker company cleaned up everything, hauled trailer in and loaded equipment on their own flat bed... offered to take the equipment to the Amish gentleman since he wasn't that far from their shop for free since the tow bill was already pushing $5300. Yes... $5300. They even had parts of his fender for him. Not that it can be reused but what ever. He tossed it in the back of the truck.He had to get a new tire and rim for the trailer, wiring harness for the connection to the trailer to the truck that runs lights and brake system. He had to by hydraulic fluid for the trailer. The wrecker guys helped him \"pump\" the brakes to get the fluid back to where it should be. He wants me to write a letter for him to send to owner about how great his workers are.   He got all new tie down straps, even though the wrecker guys picked them up also. Amish gentleman whose equipment got tossed to the road side, said he thinks nothing is broke. He will be testing it in about a week or so. Ins is working with them, know that they are mostly in the field getting crops in and hay off so it might be longer than that. They have dealt with Amish before in the area.Insurance agreed that Hubby could take the truck HOME for repairs and use whomever of his choice as long as they are a business. We have a repair shop 1 maybe 1 1/2 miles from us that he has used a couple times for the personal truck. Hopefully they can get him in quickly. E stopped in and let them know he would be coming for estimate as he has done some work for the owner.E already put the word out that Hubby would not be hauling for the coming week. He need time for truck repair and insurance paper work. E also arranged for their church to go in and help ST's boys that was putting beans in. Came over and asked if I needed anything done. M had been over and asked that morning, did I need one of the kids to come over and deal with the gardens... anything I needed. Our home and car insurance agent CALLED the business ins to make sure things were rolling. Called Hubby to make sure he was okay and his rider was okay. Gave the business insurance co  my email as I do the paper work most the time. He has been a great agent for us. ST and Hubby loaded ST's equipment yesterday morning. They left at 11:30 pm and are not going through Chicago. Hubby doesn't think he can handle that stress at all.I got 3 texts, when they left. Again when they stopped for fuel, break , check tire pressure and check straps on load, again when he finally got his truck dash GPS to load the map (pulled over and screen shot it and sent it to me). ST had been reading the paper map I had printed off until then. He thought the atlas I bought when Hubby started hauling was neat. Told Hubby he wasn't going to nap because the GPS might quit working. Hubby told him he would wake him up if it did and he could go back to being the GPS. I am still trying to get a majority of HIS chores done before he gets home. Will leave lawn mowing for him as he finds it relaxing. Will push that he go see his parents this weekend. He should be back around noon to ST's and 1 at home unless he just leaves the trailer to get later... possible at this point.Ps.... trailer was basically scratched up from being dragged upside down. Truck is going in to shop. Hubby wants the frame checked as he doesn't know if the frame of truck got bent or if the truck bed just pulled away from cab. IF the frame is bent, it's the insurance decision of fix or replace truck."},
{"title": "Both okay.... ", "date": "Thursday, June 1, 2023", "text": "When Hubby didn't text or call when he should have arrived to their destination. I checked the map. There had been an accident that had a road close for a couple hours that I thought probably slowed them down..... yeah it slowed them down all right. Since it was Hubby's truck. I wish I had screen shot the map. The bed of the truck has pulled from the cab some.He used his finger to point to the blown tire LOL. Since he had just had the brakes done the tires were checked also. Especially when the repair place knew he was going to hauling 10 tons. They had even checked the hydraulics for the lift tail. The end aka tail of the trailer goes up and down so you can drive fork lifts etc. up on the trailer. Everything was good. ST told the cop that Hubby had checked the tire pressure every time they stopped. He thought it was a little weird for Hubby to do that. Cop told him it was a good practice and asked if he was taking a long drive with his buggy would he check the horse's hoofs when he got there... he said yes. Same thing. I thought it was kind of funny that ST actually said something to the cop about it then realized he was trying to figure out why it blew when Hubby had been checking them. ST told his wife that the cop that was driving behind them told him that Hubby was great at handling it as the majority of the time that much weight (10 ton) usually flips the truck part also. That he didn't slam on the brakes which would have slid the trailer on up into the truck bed possibly into the cab since it is a gooseneck and hooks in the bed of the truck not the bumper on a hitch and possible harmed them. That Hubby would definitely be sore.  ST's wife made sure I got that message even though it was close to 10 by time it was delivered as the Englisher that brought the message went to E and E come with him to tell me since I don't know him. E let him know Hubby had talked to me but they still came to tell me. I think it was midnight before I went to sleep. Still with what is going on with Hubby's health, I was glad to hear that he handled it correctly. AND I will push for no more long trips. I'm okay with him going across the state line to get mineral spirits for oil lamps as it's actually closer to us than us going to the kids or a couple doctor appts.  Ten tons is what he limits the loads to even though he can legally haul up to 12 ton.He is calling the business insurance today. He has these pictures (cop told him what to take for insurance) and the State police report. Said he needed to repair the wiring harness that runs the lights from the truck to the trailer. Someone went and got him a tire on a wheel. He is using his credit card to pay for this. He couldn't remember his out of pocket amount. He is worried again about the financial hit. I told him I was more worried about him and ST needing medical and not realizing it. They are spending the night with ST's brother in law with Bishop's approval (Englisher's staying in the home over night is not the norm) and said ST's Mom showed up to check them out.  Reminded him of E's mom.I let the kids know.... last night. I will let his parents know this morning. MEAN TIME I will be checking finances and transferring money as I know he doesn't have enough to cover his deductible for the business insurance since he just paid the trailer brake bill."},
{"title": "Saving money end of May", "date": "Tuesday, May 30, 2023", "text": "In no rhyme or reason... Weather has been iffy all week but I still turned the furnace down to 60 from 8 am to 9 pm. and up to 70 degrees from 9 pm to 8 am. Hubby has issues if he wakes up cold.  I got up this morning and told him the temperature in the house was 75... if I get up the rest of this week and it's the same I will shut the furnace off completely. I let the late sunshine come in to warm the house to hold the temp up during the night. Week is suppose to be pushing 90 for 3-4 days so I can see that furnace being turned off.We harvested from the gardens: strawberries, rhubarb, scallions, red and golden cherry tomatoes, radishes, turnips, spinach, mustard greens and lettuces. We got a rhubarb pie from M. M isn't getting extra eggs so we bought eggs from Amish bakery. Cage free organic brown eggs $2.50 a dozen... extra large eggs they were.Used digital credit (earned by changing delivery days with Amazon) to buy the 3 books that Neurologist and a friend suggested on Dementia. So no out of pocket there.I ordered 2 elderberry bushes using my Chase points. Doc took Hubby off B complex vitamin, I will use them for myself .Used Charlotte's drinking water on kitchen porch to water 2 of the small plants on the kitchen porch. The inside water to water the mint and daylilies at the mudroom door. I froze all leftovers that was not going to be ate.Used \"Ever Lasting Meal\" cookbook by Tamar Adler for using up some odds and endsTook buttons off Hubby's work shirt that is nothing but thin rag now. I think I might get a few pieces that I can make patches with otherwise it's in the rag bag.I made French toast with 2 loaves of the bread I got on sale. Now in freezer. Also froze another loaf so we only have 1 loaf to eat now. I replaced the plants that died when we got that late freeze. Since it's at the end of planting season I was able to find replacements at 2 Amish greenhouses that were starting to clear their stock to make room for fall crops and flowers. Nice discount and got the flowers for the family's graves at 25% off also Sold 4 lbs. of asparagus at produce auction for $4.50/ lb. Had a $10 credit on Hubby's TSC card, he got dog food which gave him another 5% off since he bought it at TSC.Used the garden meter while watering, Hubby over waters and I underwater. This keeps things water correctly. Made snacks for Hubby's trip Hubby is going on an over night business trip. The gentleman going with him knows about his issues and the Neurologist okayed the trip to Wisconsin since he will not be alone. Hubby looked at 5 different maps and every single one of them had him going through Chicago (I have yet to find a trucker who wants to go through Chicago). He was getting upset about it.  I texted Son2 and asked how to get around it since he has for years had to go Fort McCoy Wisconsin.He sent back this map. Hubby printed it off, took it to the other guy and they both felt it was good. It means 30 minutes more travel but NO CHICAGO. It goes south of Chicago on a road that both Hubby and the other gentleman have been on. It also means NO TOLL charges which was going to rack up to around $400 total. Hubby also loaded it to his phone that he can hook to the truck display so they can see it without picking up the phone. They are loading the trailer today... packing over night clothes (and Hubby's meds in original bottles) and some snacks, water and black coffee. Should be at destination at lunch time since they are leaving at 4 AM. Will drop off the load and reload then call it a day. The other gentleman is making the overnight plans.  Plan to leave when they get up (probably around 3-4 AM knowing these two men) and head home. I will be getting texts at gas stops etc. so I know where they are.He will make enough to meet the bills for June so that is a relief with all of the automatic bills that come in on the 12th. He reminded E yesterday when the family was over here fishing the pond that he would be gone. E agreed to check on me so Hubby could feel more at ease. Hope it goes well."},
{"title": "if I started crying ", "date": "Friday, May 26, 2023", "text": "I am not sure I would stop and I need to do for Hubby first.... a roller coaster week for sure. Apples are starting to make. That's a good sign.Hubby's trailer is fixed after almost 3 wks. of losing work...$3200 later SIGH. He used his SS to cover the bill to the Mennonite company that did the repair (they don't take credit cards) and the bank let him do extend a payment for the parts he bought on his credit card. Mennonite arranged for him to get their \"discount\" since he drove a total of 4 hrs. to go get the parts for them. Finding parts was the hardest part. SO it the govt doesn't cover the debt ceiling and they don't seen SS checks we are going to be hurting bad.The strawberries and black raspberries are in bloom, should be getting strawberries in a week if it gets warm like they are forecasting as we had a cool down with mornings in the low 40s and highs in the 60s, low 70sI will now only go get groceries once a month with a pick up of milk two weeks later when Hubby is getting fuel as the medical bills will be through the roof for the next couple months. I did save $81.11 on groceries this past week, a bit over 20%. and Hubby saved a bit over $5 using the Kroger's fuel points. I now have $12 in Fresh Mode points and over 500 pts for fuel for June. We will have to start buying eggs. Free range, organic is running $2.50 with the Amish. M isn't getting enough to have extra with 12 of them at the table I understand that completely.Hubby had a change in behavior followed by not processing things. I brought it up to our primary and he scheduled an appt. with the neurologist who ordered a MRI, Primary ordered extensive blood work and put him on B complex vitamins, thinking it's a vitamin deficiency.   Blood work is in. Back off the B complex. He is not deficient in anything. He does have low thyroid and metabolic syndrome plus the A1C is 6.1 (both of us for over 30 yrs have had this number).Went to see the neurologist, The MRI showed brain damage BUT the brain is NOT shrinking at this point. He has no feeling below his knees. Was told to stay off ladders since he doesn't know where his feet is (he pointed to them and told the doctor they were on the end of his legs. Even Doc laughed).He couldn't do simple subtraction (he tutored me in math in high school and tutored the kids and their friends), broke my heart as I hadn't picked that up. BUT what I did pick up was he wasn't remembering what we would decide on or what I said to him about things. The nurse while testing him gave him a sentence that he was to repeat back to her exactly as she said it. He said the reverse. Specialist gave him the sentence ... go to second traffic light, turn right, the house is the 3rd on the left. Hubby came back with , go to the light , turn left and it's the 3rd house on the right. Specialist looked at me and said...it's not you, but he isn't going to repeat back what you said. If it's important WRITE IT DOWN. Hubby asked me if I write it down in the memo pad he carries to write it in red so he knows it's important. Specialist made it clear he has to have a routine (hubby admitted he battle me on this), he has to eat healthy (berries in any form daily) And if he starts hauling at 7 am , and he isn't hauling that day, he needs to do work around the house starting at 7 AM. Meals need to be close to the same time daily. He has to do physical work 1 hr. every day including Sunday. Push mowing the yard, splitting, stacking and hauling wood counts if he is doing it by hand or wagon, not tractor. He has to have at least 10,000 steps a day. He gets about 7,000. He told Hubby that he was lucky as usually by time he sees the patient the MRI shows the brain has shrank. My noticing the change in behavior and didn't blow off he was forgetting due to old age is going to make a big difference on how it progresses. Hubby told Specialist that he worked 3rd for 40 yrs even when he was farming and that he could always float his lunch time so he made sure the diabetics ate when they need to even if it meant he was eating lunch  30 minutes before clocking out for the night. He will be scheduled with neuropsychologist to pinpoint what caused the damage, could be chemical from farming,  from working with aluminum, rheumatic fever, motorcycle accident, hearing loss, eyesight loss, or dementia. He will also have a sleep study to make sure the sleep apnea is not back and testing nerve testing for hand and feet. He has to eat a brain health diet and told him to eat 1/2 cup of berries at least twice a week, daily would be better in any form as Doc knows that berries are expensive... We both laughed and told him we actually grow all sorts of berries and two types of grapes.  Hubby did tell him that he had been copping a nasty attitude towards me because he thought I was lying to him. I got an apology from Hubby and the Specialist made it clear that I was doing very well, to keep that type of watch over him. If something improves he wants to know it along with what is getting worse. He definitely will NOT be doing the finances. We did decide, I wrote it out and he signed and dated it, that we would tell his parents in person he was having issues, that he had brain damage and being tested to find out what caused it. When we do that I will let his sister in law (retired nurse) tell his siblings as they live in her area and see her daily so they can question her instead of the parents. We will do the same with our kids except Son2 who is our caretaker if something happens who we told on the way home. ON THE OTHER ENDI have hurt the right leg that the fake hip is in and I am now waiting for a call back to see if they want me to come in to see them or if they want to order a test to see if I messed up the hip  or muscle. I am limping, can't take my normal stride in walking and the knee has gave twice now on stairs.  I am hoping for pulled muscle and NOT follow Daughter 1's footsteps of breaking the stem to the leg bone that she did TWICE.Prayer for peace and sanityStay safeBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Freaking tired", "date": "Monday, May 22, 2023", "text": "I want a nap... whine whine whine. Over the last five days I have walked enough steps to have went 60 miles. All the winter stuff has been washed but not put away in the barn... I want a nap.Hubby's hauling trailer had a brake lock up and heat up. He got it to release but drove it straight to the repair shop. He decided since it was already in to have the trailer completely gone over and all 4 brakes replaced. He ended up going after the parts after it took them a week to find them and they were clear across the state. Delivery would have been more than his fuel to go get them AND saved 5 days coming through the mail as it was Ascension the next day and that store is ran by Mennonites. STILL no trailer. Repair guy said they must have all heated up because they are being a bear to fix. Better than being in Wisconsin and having it happen like he will be next month. Meantime he lost 5 hauls due to trailer being down. SO he won't have the money coming in to cover the repair job nor to cover the regular bills so we did the money shuffle. All the household bills are paid to the 8th so gives him time to figure out if he needs to use his SS to pay the business bills or if he can pick up enough to cover it. The Wisconsin job could be moved up. It won't cover everything but it would help a lot. He wired the solar pump backwards and it drained the batteries connected to the solar panels and pump. So with help from the dealer he got the issue found and corrected. Hopefully nothing was harmed but we will find out later as we can't run the pump until the batteries are charged. He showed E what he had done wrong and E showed me. He was mowing the yard with the push mower with a can of gas sitting on it right against the motor and then thought I lost my mind when I stopped him over it. Mowed over my lilies thinking they were weeds also, they hadn't bloomed so he didn't think they were flowers. He won't mow weeds if they have bloomed either.He turned the AC on even with the house only being 68. I turned it right back off and told him we would check it again when the house is 80. I asked him if he had been taking his meds... he said yes. He usually takes them first thing in the morning but I noticed today he was taking them mid morning.I counted the pills when he went out with E (who knows about the issues) the answer is NO he is skipping the one, it's for his shakes. He has nerve damage due to accident. I went out to the barn to give it to him and found almost a case of unopened bottled water that he was supposed to be drinking and didn't the past week. Pinched the back of his hand and E pointed to it and told him he was dehydrated so he wouldn't think clearly. E told him they do that test when in the woods hunting or cutting wood. E got him to drinking the water. E is working with him for the afternoon and the boys are too making sure everyone is drinking their water.New rule, he has to drink the water in front of me when he is out in the barn. Funny thing is, when he is hauling, he drinks water all the time and when he is in the house he regularly gets water to drink. After spending 6 hrs. with his parents, I can say he acts like his mom...AND neither would drink anything while here. His dad is into conspiracies (thank heavens I am not dealing with that from him... that's a couple of the kids), still very angry he lost the farm when he was gambling the money away, blames the gov't because they wouldn't let him roll it on the farm loan and is sure that certain members of congress are trying to take his title of his house. Hubby's mom always rolls her eyes (maybe I should learn that) and then talks of all the things she sees on media and it must be true it's on media (SIGH) and they blame each other for the spam, hack , break down of their phones, computers, iPad etc. I texted Hubby's younger brother and told him their phones were not right and he dad thought someone was trying to take the title of the house. He said between him and the 2 grandsons' that work in that area, they mess things up daily and he has their legal stuff dealt with to protect them from title theft etc. He wasn't sure but he thought his Dad applied for a reverse mortgage and his mom put a stop on it needed both their signatures so that triggered the \"someone is trying to take my title because he couldn't borrow against it.\".  Hubby mentioned his dad was drinking sprite with orange juice when at home. Another text went out to his sister (nurse) and she went and took it out of the house. He is on insulin and is NOT to be doing that. So now they are being checked for what is coming in the door. I can vouch they could be in the nursing home and still getting food that they aren't suppose to have due to visitors (my brother and nieces giving Daddy candy ) and the ones eating at the table with him giving him their puddings or what ever they didn't want to eat. Daddy didn't believe in throwing any food away ever.Hubby asked what we were going to do when he couldn't have his choc bar with peanut butter or me my coke... NOT BUY IT just like my Mother did when Pop couldn't have stuff due to his health issues. I cut way back on the coke anyways 20 ounces lasts 3-4 days unless it's with pizza which is maybe once a month.We have back to back appointments this week at least he's not trying to juggle doctor appts between hauls. PLUS I need to use my coupons and points before I lose them. So grocery store is added in there. Have a wonderful week....I need a wonderful NAP.Stay safeBlessed be Prayers for peace including peace of mind"},

Mother had gave him this LEAD crystal pitcher (he doesn't remember using it ever) It might kill off the orange roses but what ever. I got them for $5.Son 2 also sent me this.He asked about where we were with updating our will and crap (his words) as he was updating his. Since I am his next of kin and he is our executor... it followed his thinking.Then he brought up stupidity in DC (retired vet with working as civilian on base) over the debt ceiling . Could we make the bills without SS since we have always focused on making the bills only on SS.  I spent 5 minutes while he yacked about VFW (he works 2 jobs there) and Combat Vets (works 1 job there) I did said he was a work alcoholic right? Plus helping his girlfriend with her teenage daughter whose own dad doesn't make the effort.  The last time this crap hit I was paying his gas for him to go to work as ordered but not getting a paycheck.YES we can either live on 1 IRA or on both SS with medical from Daddy's IRA that I inherited. ALSO know that's WITH the mortgage. Mean time we decided to put extra money back in savings instead of on the mortgage incase crap hits the fan. Then if it doesn't hit the fan we can just send it to the mortgage. The Amish lady I was buying herb plants from , waited on an Englisher (what Amish call us) who was telling Mrs. Y all about where she was going shopping with her friend. When  I stepped up to check out, Mrs. Y told me that the Englisher comes up from southern Ohio, a 3 hr. trip one way, once a month to go shopping at several stores with her friend. Mrs. Y had asked if the stores near her didn't sell what she was shopping for. Yes they do but she gets to go to more stores with her friend. Mrs. Y who very seldom offers that kind of conversation continued with \" let me offer some thoughts,  more stores you shop, the more money you will spend because you see what you think are good deals. Deals you really could go without.\" I asked how often she went to the store, bulk or English... not even once a month.  But she acknowledged she had chickens for meat and eggs along with a milk cow so have milk, heavy cream and butter. I asked if she need to do other work, I wanted advice to help save money and eat healthy. She said she had the time for me.Eat from your garden (or in season if you don't have a garden). Eat what you process yourself or get at farmer's markets. Leave boxed food on the store shelf. Make it from scratch. Buy canned goods or frozen if needed. She would add pasta if on sale cheap.   She pointed out I just over ran 5 Amish families (actually it was 6) with asparagus, one actually sold it at the produce auction and gave us the money. Everyone else's asparagus is just now coming on, ours is done. We ate it daily. I have 3 more meals of it in the frig and 26 meals of it in the freezer. Hubby would like to not see it on the table since it was on the table nightly for 5 wks.She asked what would come in next. Rhubarb is ready now, strawberries are in bloom. Peas are just starting to come on, might end up with peas and green beans at same time.  She nodded. Eat that, and use what you already have in pantry.She also told me to have Hubby say something to J at feed store about what cheeses he brings in from Holmes co. I pointed out that Hubby is hauling someone every other month to Holmes co. She strongly suggested he get his cheese then. Men must talk about eating cheese when Hubby is hauling them LOL.I asked if she did pantry soup like E's mom. She said no, she does scrap soup or casserole. What ever is left over the day before goes to soup or casserole for lunch.She asked how often I go to the store or shop Amazon (yes Amish shop Amazon through Englishers)  Twice a month store, once a month Amazon, but that was stock up of medical supplies including the dog medical, that I couldn't find local. She suggest to cut in half... or even down to one with just pick of milk and eggs.  She pushed  to every 5 to 6 wks. when she realized they had started going to the store on average of every 10 days. They were already in town, let's stop. When she quit that and pushed it to twice a month, the bill dropped by 25%. She pushed it again to once a month, it dropped another 25%. Now she is at 5 wks. and looking to push it to 6 wks. She's spending 1/3rd of what she was. She does put her gardening supplies in the grocery budget.... as she put it...it's food right? It was an interesting conversation from a woman I barely get any from."},
{"title": "Let me tell you a story", "date": "Friday, May 5, 2023", "text": "We can start with last night's dinner that is off topicHubby mentioned he missed going to a steakhouse and getting surf and turf. I pulled it from the freezer and picked the asparagus fresh . Grilled it and called it done. Last time we had that meal at a restaurant it cost us over $100.Now to the story In 2007 Hubby was telling me his plant never laid off, he was working 7 days a week 10 hrs. a day for a solid year as they couldn't hire enough to work. We had the old homestead that we were refinishing to sell and then decided to move Daughter 2 in to help pay those bills and help do the work. We bought a smaller 3 bedroom one story. I, for the first time in years, had no garden and no more than a month's worth of groceries including paper products and personal care. BECAUSE Hubby made him feel we were poor and that I was saying he couldn't take care of everything.   Within 1 month in 2008, not only did the plant lay off over half the workers, the ones they kept (mostly maintenance like Hubby) was cut to 3 days a week. The plant did that so they could keep them covered with health ins. and we were grateful for at least that.Daddy lost over 50% of his investments due to not moving his money when his finance guy told him to and had to go to living on SS only. We actually gained money in our investments.  Daughter 2 lost her income and moved, we lost both houses and moved to an 800 sq ft rental a friend found for us. I started stocking when I could afford it. We ended up in slow pay bankruptcy. The judge refused to take the 401(k) like we wanted to just pay everything off. At the time I was ticked over that choice. Bankruptcy was for 5 yrs. Our kids and a friend were putting food etc. on the table for a solid year.Hubby was still dealing with the shock of everything when I sat him down and told him, I was taking over the finances. In 4 yrs. instead of 5 I had the bankruptcy paid off. Every single extra dollar that came in or was not spent, went on that bill. I sent a letter thanking the Judge for not letting us use the 401k to pay it off as I don't think I could have got Hubby to start saving.We moved to an old farm house a coworker was renting out. Daughter 4's ex moved us and told her not to worry as I had enough can goods stored under furniture to keep us fed for 6 months  We lived there almost 10 yrs. I saved up enough to come up with the down payment for this home. I went back gardening and canning.As all of you know, if you have read this blog much at all. I have grow a huge garden. I stock pile everything. I have helped our kids , grandkids and neighbors . We have an emergency fund (lower than I like but it's there). We are able to go off grid if needed.Hubby told me to stock for at least 2 yrs for everything and to get the emergency fund up to 6 months at least. FYI we are at 4 months, 5 months if I count what is sitting in checking. I asked what he saw on tv or read on the internet. A lot of things from what he explained that he doesn't believe they are being completely honest because they don't want to trigger a big freak out. Just like 2007-2008.Just a FYI , average time of recession is 10 months according to Dave Ramsey.Daughter 4 had texted him she had her 40 hrs. plus / week job at Amazon (within 30 miles of us) cut to 15 hrs. She was going for an interview at another place.  The grocery store that was coming in locally, has backed out completely. Feds once again raised interest rates.Two more banks are up for sale (and that's after our own put out they bought Union Bank)He is seeing less work hauling pallets and knows the one company that he used to haul for has closed due to lack of orders. The company that buys used pallets, isn't getting much in either. He was watching on the internet some financial guys and one of them mentioned that Dave Ramsey had commented on his site that recession is like a hurricane. You don't know how hard it's going to hit or exactly what it is going to hit. When it hit him, that between world issues and political issues and banks going down... the hurricane has started. He didn't even bring up the crap in DC about the debt ceiling with possibly not getting our SS.I did Dave Ramsey's debt snowball when my late husband died leaving me with $65,000 in debt and no income. Was it hard? Yes , I posted the debt on the wall and the kids learned where the money was going and on what. We celebrated not only paying that off but bringing a $33,000 one step before being condemned house up to $56,000 paid OFF. That was before Hubby and I married.This morning I checked out Dave Ramsey's site for recession info.He said put the 4 walls first: food, utilities, shelter and transportation. Follow that with stock pile cash with the assumption you already have 3-6 months emergency fund. I inventoried medical first, then medication, then over the counter vitamins and such. I even did the dog.  I made the list of what is needed and how much for 2 yrs.I inventoried cleaning/personal care/ paper products including office products. Might need ink for printer before 2 yrs. but I felt what we have is fineI inventoried the pantry. Since it's going into garden season, not real worried as I have grains, sugars of all sorts (honey, molasses and maple syrup in this area) I have yeast but can make sour dough. I have salt which comes from my Grandpa on Daddy's side telling me how they couldn't can one year because they ran out of salt. I am writing out what is needed so I don't lose focus during the season and miss I need more green beans like M did this past year. Utilities/shelter is current and I keep focusing on reducing those costs.We are selling the motorcycle. We will run the red truck until we can't (frame rusting out) and Hubby has 18 more payments on the work truck.We have 4 months emergency funds, 5 with checking.   We both carry some cash as Amish are always asking if we can \"break\" their $20s. When he gets home today from hauling I can sit him down and show him where we are with everything and hopefully calm his fears. It can make things worse with his mild dementia.Stay safe, prayers for peace (and brains that actually are logical?)Blessed be"},

I hate taking the meds as they just whack out everything else. It's May 1st  Ohio... you can see the sleet against the barn. I know I have lost several plants that will cost plenty to replace. Just weird weather for Ohio. E came over to get Hubby to take him and a couple of the boys to go get some motors that finally came in. Way to rainy, sleety, windy (gusts up to 40 mph with temp at 35 to help Hubby fix downspout on barn or unload wood from wagon.I called the one place we had several people tell us that was good to go to for figuring out Medicare etc. They asked a few questions and came back we really didn't need them as I had 98% already figured out. Not only that but they specified they didn't provide all plans as they limit to the ones they SELL.  She did check about the prescription coverage thinking we should flip to Walgreens (40 minutes away from us 1 way) but came back with NOPE. We would spend almost twice as much going the way they were thinking.   They did suggest AARP Medicare supplement since we are long term members. They also said to wait until end of June or even the first week of July for Hubby. I won't be until Oct. If we wanted to come in to go over it to come in late June.  The widow next door came over and asked when we went on Medicare (she already is on it). Her niece just opened a business in town that helps people find the best plan. They check around 200 plans, they don't sell any of the plans. Just do a small fee to help the headache of dealing with it. I called the young lady, Hubby goes in mid June. One headache at a time.I took a strong look of what we need to restock for the year in the pantry. Weird crap LOL. Like vinegars for salad dressings.  I went to 4 stores to find parmesan and only could find the powdered stuff ... sorry but my Italian grandmother's voice was in my head over that. Ended up ordering jar from Amazon. Son 2 thinks he can get me some from his area. I want a block or round I will shred myself. I was down to the last box of Gas X  cherry as I can't stand the other flavor... of course that was to be found no where in store, was told I could order on line... okay but they wanted to charge $$ to ship, got it through Amazon and the box was even less than ordering through the store. GEEZE. I finally found some wintergreen tea as I am totally out and it's the only \"mint\" tea I can drink. I can do my home grown garden mint (that's what the Amish call it) a little if I don't let it steep longer than a couple minutes. I need corn for the freezer that will come from E or one of the other Amish. I need Italian green beans (wide for one pot meals), regular green beans (Jade beans grow best here) and yellow wax beans.  I need peas (planted , but if I don't get enough for freezer I will replant in the fall) I need tomatoes. If I don't get enough I will buy them from 3 different Amish. M had to buy some canned veggies at the store this year so she is definitely expanding the gardens and not giving any away (I usually get zucchini and tomatoes from her when she was ran over). I'm not sure what else as I've not done the spring cleaning yet.Stay safe, prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "When the question is \"how can we save more ....", "date": "Wednesday, April 26, 2023", "text": "I brought up finances to Hubby while we were driving to doctor appt. yesterday.  He didn't think we had anything except the mortgage to save for.... sigh... Yes I know that's his mild dementia so I just added that I thought we talked about it while he was working on putting garden beds together. Then it came back. He guessed he didn't realize how many  things we needed to be saving for.... which is why I do the finances or he would going out getting loans. We want the out of pocket for Medicare to be in the money market in full by Oct 1st when Hubby goes on Medicare. I can tell you unless things changed a lot, Hubby has NEVER met his out of pocket of $3200 from employer (who covers the insurance until he is 65). I can also say according to all our doctors our insurance is weird because the CO PAYS count in the OUT OF POCKET. That will be the hardest change for us.  I on the other hand usually have $3200 spent by March.... that hasn't happened in past year. Crohn's is calmed down and I didn't have any surgeries. Friends that worked at same place said they had out of pocket (including Doc offices) of $14,000 between the two of them. She is on biologic IV every 6 weeks. I am not a candidate because I only have 1 good vein in one arm but that goes on part A as she has it done at hospital.  But basically they have the same doctors and same health as us. There are some things we noted to ourselves that they could have saved money on that they won't ever do. Everything has to be brand name as I watched their sons and their wives roll their eyes. Plus they didn't get Medigap when they should have.SO ... #1 . We need to save more for the Medicare out of pocket. We decided to double what we have now should be okay for his Oct. We will definitely get Medigap. Except for my biologic, all meds are generic.# 2. We need to save back up maintenance fund by $2500. #3 The garden shed needs resided and a new roof. Metal shop said they could get white metal for siding and any shade of gray metal roof to make it look more like the house. Hubby is measuring this weekend to get the estimate costs. E said either he or his oldest 2 boys could help. We pay them $10/ hr. It's mostly going to be the roof. I would like to change it as it's over a loft and I don't use the loft so that would drop it down. Hubby said if he could rent the lift like he did to install the wood chimney he could do it with just 1 helper to lift the sheets of metal up to him. We will see as that will mostly be a fall job depending on the costs of the metal.#4. We need to save $6000 for the rest of the garden beds and soil. Less if we can find it on sale as I based it on full price. #5. We need to increase emergency fund.#6. We WANT to pay off mortgage as quick as possible.#7  We WANT to replace red truck (one I drive) BUT I haven't found anything I would spend THAT kind of money on let along have a down payment for. The dealership we bought the red truck from told me that $5000 down would cover anything he has and he does a buy here pay here and he doesn't sell anything he wouldn't have his mother (mid 70s) in to drive. Mother would have made 7 savings accounts and divided what she had left at the end of the month by 7. She was a spender. She had 12 savings for her funeral. All of them had $100 . SIGHDaddy would have started with emergency fund, then out of pocket fund and moved on from there. Daddy was a saver. I will have to think about this for a couple daysBlessed bePrayers for peace and strength"},

Freeze warnings every morning... got one morning of frost warning and then back to freeze warnings. This CRAP is late February, early March weather.   I turned the furnace back down and we started the wood stove back upYes I know the ash door was still open. It had just started rolling. We have learned to wait to shut it until the smoke is coming out of the chimney outside. Asparagus is under row cover, M's oldest girl had Hubby show her how to move it so she could harvest. They were short some for Church supper. We did pick some before we covered it and E's Dad took it to auction for us. LOL. It sold for $3.50 a pound . Wow. He asked if we had more. Depends on how much his son's family eats and he asked for at least one more batch for him and E's mom.We planted 12 roses, 2 elderberry bushes, 1 bee pollinator bed, 1 butterfly pollinator bed, 1 hummingbird pollinator bed, apple mint and orange mint. My peas in my hanging pots are starting to come up... they are now in the house ... not only for the cold but the birds thought they were a buffet . LOLI cashed in Swagbucks and got a $25 card on discount and a $5 card. Both for Amazon.I made waffles finally with the Belgian waffle maker. I did level 4 instead of 5 for darkness. Could have done level 3. Hubby said 4 was good in microwave but a bit hard with toaster. He wants me to label at what level they are cooked so he know which way to reheat them. We both liked the batter. I'll have to use the other waffle maker next time and a different batter.We took Charlotte to the vet. She was limping. Nothing in her pads, got her toenails clipped. Taking the same med that Rascal took. Charlotte's mom started with arthritis at this age so it could be that. Athena, Charlotte's mom is on CBD oil and had done well. Doc said he could do an x ray to make sure that is what it is if she still is limping in a month. I made a extra payment on the mortgage that was equal to 7 months of the principal payment (no interest). Between it and the gardens and maintenance, back fence as the two pastures went bad. Looked like deer had ran into it and broke it in several areas. We put up cattle panels with metal posts. E told me to get some orange tape/ribbon and tie on the top and it would help stop that as they will see the ribbon and know to jump over it. He used in on the widow's next to us and it hasn't been broken in 6 yrs. I've seen deer run through her back yard so they will jump over it.... Anyways... we went over budget but not as I had been putting $$ back for those types of things.  Now it's back to savings and hoping for warm weather so I can start getting more food out of the gardens to put on the table. Though I will admit eating asparagus daily for a week was plenty. I do have enough to have it twice a month thru the off season aka late fall/ winter.Prayers for peace (and Sanity) Blessed be     IncomeIRAs $6800.78Social Security $3634.Son 2 payment on loan $100Business income $2600Interest $89.98Cash back from credit cards $100.05Daddy's annuity $76.67Swagbucks $30 (bought 2 Amazon cards)CVS $10Dentist $11 for paying cash Savings at Kroger's including Fresh Mode $125.61Back pay from Daddy's Annuity $ 2453.44 TOTAL INCOME $16031.53Out goIrregular expenses $2389.56Down grid / maintenance $1327.90 (back fence to 2 pastures)Automatic savings $180Dog food/treats/vets $52Household expenses $2543.55 Business expenses $2522.26Medical/OOP $1085.29Garden $5228.73Extra payment to Mortgage $3028.11( same as making 7 months of principal payments)Extra to savings $780 (local bank has not increased interest so we moved a good part to our money market that is paying 4 %.

I don't think she scared them at all as they wandered around the side yard and the driveway before actually going back across the pasture.   Lousy weather. Got past this, then last night and this morning it was rain (we needed it) but the freaking cold came with it. Temps dropped over 20 degrees.M's girls will pick the asparagus late  afternoon so that's not on my list. Hubby  said we would cover the asparagus and pollinator plants late evening trying to give them as much sunshine as possible. Next 4 days will be cover plants at night and uncover when the temps get above 40 during the dayI gathered stuff yesterday to go to the Township clean up today. Widow on E's side gave us her stuff a couple nights ago. E was over last night asking if we could take his as he was at a horse auction this morning. Hubby had a good size load as I cleared out part of the garden shed and gathered some nonworking appliances (heater, AC, humidifier amongst others) that he had scattered through the barn thinking he would remember where he put it.  I saw it and piled it in the front bay right where he walks. Second pile was in front of the 1st stall barn door so he had to move it to go out to his truck and the third pile was by garden shed by the trailer.  He just text me and said the hauler said they would have charged $300 for what was just ours and $500 for everything. It was FREE sort of since it's part of our township taxes. Might as well use it. I guess I can go play with finances or go read.... Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "How we get it all done", "date": "Friday, April 21, 2023", "text": "we will be uncovering this today and recover late Sunday for the frost/freeze coming in on Monday. We are watching the weather to see if it comes in earlier.These are the 12 metal garden beds that make 8 ft long beds to replace the wooden ones that are falling apart. They were to come in on Saturday. They came in early. They will be put together by mid May when it's time to plant \"summer\" cropsHow do we get it done? We are up between 4 AM and 6 AM. We don't set alarms. Hubby will set an alarm if he is hauling. Both of us are usually asleep by 9 PM.We ONLY watch the evening local news 5-6:30 and Nora Roberts 6:30 -7. At 7 we get things around for the next day. Plan meal, what we are doing at what time and which of us needs help. Hubby is doing a LOT better with the 3X5 memo pad and ink pen in his pocket. At 8 I head to the bedroom with Charlotte to read and Hubby sacks out in his recliner (has to sleep at angle). He tried to sleep in bed, ends up laying flat which is not good.We start the day with coffee.... I drink 3- 6 ounce cups ,medium blend, he drinks 1- 22 ounce cup of dark or French roast. We snack for bfast, not big bfast eaters. We talk over what needs done this day vs what we like to get done this day. Needs done gets done first. IF errands are needed for supplies like this morning, one of us goes while the other one starts the day. We had a gate damaged due to winds, but instead of another gate that we don't need,  Hubby is picking up more cattle fence panels and fence posts. By 8:30 AM Laundry is done and either on the drying rack or on the clothes line. I will do some computer like now, and then some during \"rest\" times. I work a solid hour and the take a 15 min break to spend time with Charlotte. Charlotte has arthritis in her front legs. Neither of us have social media on our phones. (FYI over half our kids and grandkids have left social media due to violence and lies in posting and what they said was wasting their time). Hubby said twice he had to tell his mom when he was helping her do some weeding to put her phone down and leave it alone as she would hear it ping and look to see what it was and spend 10-15 mins. scrolling. His dad took it from her and put it in his pocket. He only uses his phone for calls .Our family and close friends know if it's important to CALL us not text us. I spend 40 hrs. a week in the gardens,  Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Mondays are usually 4-6 hrs. as I do a lot of in house work that day. Sunday we try to keep as the day of rest.  Tuesday is errands and appts. That will change some in the summer as Hubby will most likely be hauling some to Tuesday Amish produce auction. Hubby gives about 20 hrs. a weekIn summer and early fall, those hours can easily jump to 80 hrs. a week for me (30 hrs. for Hubby) with Tuesdays being half days before or after errands. We still try to REST on Sunday. I bought bigger canners to cut down on the time and fuel needed to can.My walk to the mailbox is also to pull weeds daily. I have Stihl clippers, hedge trimmers and pruner saw. What used to take me 4 hrs. now takes me 1 hr. Tools make a difference. Hubby was a single parent of two and quickly realized if I didn't work outside the home he would immediately save $$ between child care, housekeeping etc. I was working 3 part time jobs as a single parent and I wasn't paying child care as the oldest could watch the younger ones for the 30 minutes difference of my job and them getting home.  Since he wasn't great with the finances (paid credit cards before his mortgage and home bills), I took over the finances when we got together. With in a year he realized not only was he saving what he spent on childcare and housekeeping, he was spending LESS on clothes, groceries, utilities etc.  I cut back to 2 part time jobs at the same time.  Hubby figured out basing on 160 hrs. each month like he worked I was at $10/ hr. (not counting what I was earning doing ironing and housekeeping) which was more than the wages at that time for work I would have done with a full time job.Right now he has me \"earning\" $28.02/hr. He has it at earnings... I have it as savings.I would normally say back to the gardens... but it's starting to rain and I really hope we get at least an inch.Prayers for peaceBlessed be"},

I got 1 that will take some for their smoothies. Green Ice lettuce is allowed to bolt and go to seed so I can replant the next year. I have to be careful to make sure I get it before it goes to seed because about 10 yrs ago I had a yard full of it LOL.Radishes are ate fresh or fried (just like a potato) when they get pithy.Beets are ate fresh, roasted and canned with water or pickled.Carrots are ate fresh, stored in second (or third) frig. I have canned them, froze them and at one time dehydrated them (such a pain to do that)Peas ate fresh or frozen. I will let some \"dry\" on the vine to either make pea soup or if heirloom to replant the next year.I grow snow peas for fresh eating and freeze for stir friesGreen beans. I grow Jade for regular green beans fresh, seeds and canned. They grow the best in this area (I used to grow Ky. Wonder). I grow Roma Wide Italian beans for fresh, seeds and canned for green beans potato and ham meals. I grow long green beans green and purple fresh and frozen for stir fries. If they are heirloom I will save some for seed. Wax yellow bean fresh, canned and seed. I also mix half green bean and half wax bean in pints for 3 bean salad. Hubby floats which other bean he uses as we save a bit of the \"dry\" beans for that.Eggplant for fresh eating and frozen \"breaded\" for fried, canned in ratatouille.Turnips fresh (silky sweet and Toyoko our favorites for fresh) I cook and can purple tops turnips. I either slice them like potatoes and fry them or cube and boil them to mash like mashed potatoes. The greens are in salads or cooked or dehydratedRutabagas and parsnips are cooked like carrots or turnips and canned. They have been mashed like mashed potatoes. The greens are cooked or dehydratedKohlrabi, ate fresh, cooked, canned, with greens in salads, or dehydrated.Collards, kale, chard, spinach and mustards are ate fresh, cooked and dehydrated. Well not the collards, if I have extra daughter 1 and daughter 3 will take them. Daughter 2 will take the spinach. A few times the English widows will take them if it's enough for 1 to have a salad.I grow dried soup beans, some I just leave as dried,  others I soak and then can so I can make quick meals. I make sure I save some for seed.I grow cucumbers for fresh eating and picklingI grow asparagus for fresh eating, pickling and freezing.I grow Chinese cabbage for fresh and frozenI grow red and green cabbages for fresh, frozen, red with apples canned, green as kraut or canned coleslaw as Hubby likes it better than frozen slaw.I grow onions for fresh, winter storage and dehydrate. Yellow, white, red, Candy onions, scallions and walking onions. Can you tell we use a lot of onions?I grow garlic, fresh and dehydratedI grow peppers, sweet orange, red, cayenne, banana and pepperoncini for fresh, dehydrated and pickled.I grow broccoli for fresh, if I get enough some frozen.I grow brussels sprouts for fresh, if I get enough some frozen.I grow cantaloupe for fresh.I grow yellow squash and zucchini for fresh, frozen and pickled.I grow tomatoes, cherry, roma, pasta, goat bag, and ox heart... fresh eating, roasted or not, canned as whole tomatoes, diced tomatoes, pasta sauce, pizza sauce, tomato sauce, and juice. I also dehydrate tomatoes and I dehydrate tomato skins for powder.I grow pumpkin, butternut and acorn squash. I will not be doing that this year as one of the Amish is doing it to help pay off their medical bills. Means I have 2 garden beds for other stuff . I freeze butternut and acorn squash. I cook then dehydrate then grind pumpkin. I grow potatoes (white, golden, red and purple). I have grown sweet potatoes (didn't get any slips to plant😢 this year) So I will have to buy sweet potatoes but Hubby is going to ask one of the Amish if we can have 1 sweet potato in the fall to grow slips for us. I grow blackberries, red raspberries, golden raspberries, strawberries ,rhubarb, and apples. Fresh eating, canned in water or juice, pie filling, jam, jellies, and fruit butter, frozen and dehydrated. Purple seedless grapes and white seedless grapes... fresh, frozen, jelly or juice. We have a Bird deposit of a concord grape that is now 2 yrs old. If it lives through the summer we will transplant it for juice only. We have small cherry and peach trees. This is the 2nd year in a row a freeze hit after they started blooming. I doubt if we get anything off them. I grow thyme, oregano, garlic, apple mint, orange mint, garden mint, winter savory, basil, rosemary, lavender, lemon balm, marjoram, dill (weed and seeds), cilantro, sage, chives, garlic chives, parsley flat Italian and curly. We added elderberry bushes (covered from freeze) and rose bushes(also covered). Roses produce hips (if you don't pick the roses) that have Vit. A and C. We also added horseradish and more rhubarb(covered from freeze). We added blueberries and black raspberries also safe as not planted since we knew the freeze was coming in.I sometimes plant Lady finger popcorn when we look to run low. I keep my popcorn in the freezer in pint jars, then move them to the frig. I only put out what I am going to pop about an hour before we want popcorn so it comes to room temp to pop better.  I get my corn sweet white for fresh eating and yellow canning corn from E.We eat a lot of roasts (beef, pork, and chicken) with root veggies whether fresh, frozen or canned. I use a lot of frozen veggies in off season of fresh with pasta, casseroles and soups.  IF what I grow doesn't make I first try to get it from Amish or farmers markets before going to a grocery store. Cauliflower is one that is usually from the store.The Amish buy bushels of different fruits from an orchard over in Columbus area so sometimes we order some of that. Last year was peaches and apples. There is another Mennonite store we go to that sells bushels of fruit also that I can get some from. I am adding bee pollinator garden, butterfly pollinator garden and hummingbird pollinator garden this year.Also replacing some herbs that died for herbal garden and a \"medical\" herb garden We want plants at the doors to help keep mosquitos and flies away. Hubby wants some sunflowers as he likes the seeds but I am willing to bet the birds will get them first and I want my heart garden to have flowers in it.I am doing better by tracking that we eat our \"colors\" (red, yellow/orange, green, white/tan, black/purple/blue) on a daily bases."},

Candy settle right down.We got half of the weed barrier and trellises up for the berry vines. I planted 12 rose bushes, 2 elderberry bushes, 10 horseradish, and 4 rhubarb. Hubby laid more weed barrier down for the pollinator gardens. They are laying there but no soil.I picked half bushel of asparagus to process today.Blanch, freeze on cookie sheets, and then vacuum bag.Sunday through Wednesday morning the weather SUCKS. Cold (almost to freezing in the mornings) wet, rain , wind and today SNOW PELLETSSIGH... Hubby is in barn putting together 2 more beds as it was too bad for him to even drive fence posts in.He is now carrying a 3x5 inch notepad and pen in his shirt pocket. It's helping with the memory issues. I had to draw a diagram of how I needed the berry trellises and weed barrier after he installed 3 trellises backwards.  We will have to buy more posts to add support as he made it clear he wasn't digging the posts back up and moving them.  I saw him sitting on the end of the trailer with his head down and E came over to check on him. Sat down with him and talked a bit and they both went over to the trellises. E put zip ties where the extra support would be needed. Hubby wrote it down in his notepad the zip ties is where the extra posts goes. E made a point later to let me know also.Hubby also let the Amish know he would not be making long trips without one of them riding with him. He is doing well with GPS on his truck (dash board not on his phone) but feels he needs that extra \"we need to stop for break\" person. Couple of them asked if their kids could go (16 and older) to let them see outside the community. We both thought that was okay. Adults seem to fall asleep on long rides where the kids stay awake.We updated my to do list. Nine a day SIGH.... The 12 garden beds that was to come in next month will be here this week. SO Hubby ordered 220 of 2 cubic raised bed soil to be delivered Saturday. Well worth the $79 to have it delivered than the 3 hrs. spent going after it, picking it up and bringing it back NOT touching UNLOADING it. This way they will unload it right where we need it to be.I am waiting to plant the last of the berry vines since he doesn't have that area done. I can after this crappy  weather gets through put soil in the pollinator gardens and plant it. Hubby is going after mulch for the roses and elderberries later this week.I need to plan menu and prep meals...AFTER I finish the asparagusBlessed BePrayers for peace and patience   Our 1st meal of asparagus. I have enough up that we gathered a meals worth for a friend. It went well with the bacon sandwiches we had for last night dinner.I planted different varieties of lettuce, onions, beets, carrots, turnips, radishes, peas and greens yesterday. My fake hip and lower back are letting me know I wasn't supposed to do all of that in one day LOL. I took breaks a lot but should have stretched more than I did and used my tens unit pain doctor got for me before bed. Lesson learned NOT.Hubby went to do a couple hauling jobs... told me to take it easy and then called me as he sat in the driveway and asked me to put some of the smaller garden beds (pollinator beds) together so he would be able to figure out how much weed barrier to put under them tomorrow.

I found them on sale $166.23 and was able to use my cash back credit card saving a total of $550.19.  I was able to order 12 (half of what I need) which kept the costs in the amount I budgeted for this month. We went to grocery store. I saved $51.98.  I didn't get a couple things on my list but will check in 2 wks. Hubby got fuel at Kroger's and used my points saving $6.02 on fuel.We use LED night lights (in Christmas candles).There are 13 of them through the house. We decided to stop using 7 of them. I am leaving the curtains/blinds open where they were and the security light in the yard is giving enough light for those areas. Hubby wasn't thrilled with leaving curtains/blinds open until I asked E if he could see in from his house one night. He went over and looked and said not really.

I thought this \"just before\" the sun came up looked great.Since we are expanding the garden we made a list of what we need.  Hubby looked it up and ball park figure was $2500 with taxes. We watched for sales and got it all for $1408.10. That included onion sets and the majority of plants and seeds for the pollinator gardens. I will have to completely redo the herb garden but I knew that last year and have been putting $$ back for that.I am watching sales as 26 of the 32 beds need replace  with in the next year. I am buying metal beds when I find them on sale. Not looking for everything to match or like that.The hall humidifier and the front room humidifier are off and unplugged. We have ate from home the whole week. Even though Hubby said he almost called when he was getting fuel for the work truck and ask if I wanted gas station pizza at $11. It's decent pizza. He decided not to even offer to be supportive of our(ok, mostly MY) choice to focus on getting perennials in and then getting the mortgage paid off as quick as possible. Our waffle maker died... we held off replacing it, waiting to see if we missed waffles. The second time I bought Eggo waffles , we agreed to buy a new waffle maker. Now I have to figure out a homemade waffle mix as I am trying to wean Hubby from Bisquick. Though I will admit I like it for cheddar biscuits.Since it is light out longer, we are not turning the lamps on until an hour later.I planted apple mint in the one grow tower and orange mint in the other. I am not sure where I want them yet so this will work.I planted 4 varieties of dwarf peas in hanging baskets. I can't remember where I saw it at but they looked good so I decided to try it. On the 8th , I told Hubby I figured out my \"work\" for the month so I wouldn't trigger anything. April has 30 days minus the 8 days already past, minus 4 Sundays, 2 Tuesdays that are appts/ errands and 2 days to go visit the kids and his parents. Leaves 14 days for work. I have 28 \"work items\" on my list so I need to do 2 a day. Maybe I will be frugal with my time???Prayers for peaceBlessed Be  We eat it fresh through the season. DO you know how tempting it was just say\" EAT IT\"??? 😋 I needed the laugh.  I can (water bath canner and pressure canner), freeze, and dehydrate for when not in season. I used to \"store\" 2 yrs. of food. During the pandemic I ended up way too low after helping kids, grandkids and a couple friends. Two of the kids are now growing small gardens. Hubby told me to aim for 3 yrs. (I do first in , first out) this time as we have 3 that might not get paid (but still have to report to work ) if the debt ceiling doesn't get taken care of. Been there and done that the last time that happened. AND 2 that are having female surgeries this summer.Heart.org says you should eat 4 servings of fruit and 5 servings of veggies a day per person. What I usually serve is 1/2 cup servings. That is 2 pints of fruit and 2 1/2 pints of veggies a DAY for the two of us.That's 730 pints of fruit and 912 1/2 pints of veggies for a year. In my case I can 1460 pints of fruit (we don't eat the same fruit 2 days in a row) and 1825 pints of veggies for us for 2 yrs. That is not counting  the pints of, jam, jelly , fruit butter, pickles, relish, pie filling (for pancakes, French toast, waffles, cakes and ice cream), salsa, tomato sauce, whole tomatoes, or broths.That's not counting the quarts of meat, beans, broth, soups, pasta sauce, tomato juice, grape juice. Or half pints of jams, pickled onions, pizza sauce and that types of things. Hubby asking for 3 yrs. Would be 2190 pints of fruit (minus what ever is left in the pantry) and 2737.5 pints of veggies (minus what ever is left in the pantry)Since I freeze and dehydrate along with canning and I have large canners I can handle the increase. Plus he has no problem using the burner to the 3 turkey fryers to heat the water bath canners or sitting in the swing while watching them and timing them. Been and done that 5 yrs ago.I would say most people don't think about how much they buy of anything when it's not done by season. MIL just told me Saturday that FIL asked why they have a case of green beans and a case of corn. She told him it would last 3 months... he didn't realize they ate one of week of each."},

{"title": "Better but not well... ", "date": "Monday, April 3, 2023", "text": "Hubby said he used to see Rascal do this when I was sick but it's the first time he has seen Charlotte do it. He was surprised she didn't turn and look at him so he figured she was sound to sleep also.I ate 3 bites of grilled chicken breast, 5 cooked baby carrots and 1/3 cup of mashed potatoes and retriggered the stomach SIGH. But reality is I HAVE to eat.  At least I am not \"living\" in the bathroom.😁  I actually walked around the perimeter 3 times in one day VERY slowly but I did it. Today I hung clothes on the line by myself... tummy a bit upset over the movement but not triggered much. LORD PLEASE.  Since I couldn't do any manual work, I did paperwork. Budgets are redone, to do lists .. Hubby's, mine and ours (what takes both of us) is updated. We even tossed some future ideas around when I asked how we were going to mow if there is no way to get fuel. Hubby's first thought was E using his horses... that will work for the pond but since E mows our pond because we mow his small pasture as he can't get the horses turned around with the mower (mower is to the side not straight behind him). That thought isn't going to work especially if Hubby isn't picking up the horse crap after E mows . We might be able to \"rent\" his push mower and kids to mow around the yard. He is got that on his \"think about\" list.  Since most of the garden is above ground... I don't have to think about that.   I had already went through my kitchen appliances to figure out what I would have to do instead of using it. Though we did talk about more herbal and flowers for holistic and food. He asked if I would try growing sunflowers. We talked about how we used to get 5 colors of fruits and veggies daily and our grains etc... and why we don't now.  I showed him what I had written on the calendar which of course we haven't followed since I have been sick. He definitely pointed out we were doing a lot of stir fries (one sheet baked), 123 pasta(1 onion, 2 cups protein and 3 cups veggies), loaded pizzas and almost always had salad with the pasta and pizza. Snacks were fresh fruit in season with cheese and crackers.We canceled see the kids, then we didn't go to baby shower on Sunday. We did check on everyone as tornadoes hit close to some family and friends. Everyone okay... some got roof damage but not bad.I saw this and thought >>> WOW. why did I not learn this in school? Brother who taught history said that kind of stuff was kept quiet. He was \"speeding\".Be safeBlessed Be  Business income was up, interest was up. I counted cash back since it was up so high. We got a new credit card at the local TSC to get a discount on a  purchase. It actually pays more back that our other credit cards for general stuff. Irregular expenses were down along with down grid/maintenance, dog, and business.Medical/oop was up , garden was up and since we are doing a lot of changes to make it easier for 1 person to deal with, we put it in it's own category. Household was up due to grocery/eating out budget being up. We will not do 4 days straight of appts again if we can avoid it. Another out go was I cashed 2 CD's and then bought 2 other CDS with better interest rate.Over all I felt it was okay.... Hubby was disappointed there wasn't a big amount paid extra on the mortgage. He also is very worried about losing money like we did in 2008. I showed him how the budget would be cut (already have some but he didn't realize that) and where money would be to help pay the bills. That calmed him. I did remind him that he can't go to the store and just buy what ever. He needs to stay to the list. If he sees something on sale that he needs... he needs to CALL me and see if it's in the budget. Tractor Supply CO (TSC) is where that happens a lot. I still don't know what he bought twice, he didn't give me the receipt and he can't remember. It is in his trip log he stopped there so he was in the work truck. But he put it on the home CC not the business CC. Since there are several small projects he is working on, it's hard telling what was bought but it racked up over $100 between the two.Stay safe Blessed Be"},

I will either write the food down or just cross off the color it was. I used pencil for white/tan.I cashed in 2 CDs and turned around and bought 2 more that are paying 1.5% more in interest. I got an annuity from Daddy... Man has been dead almost 3 yrs and they just let brother and I know it was sitting there. I got the back payment and then will get a monthly payment. It's not a lot but it would have gave him some spending money for the month. As it is Brother and I get 50%. I was talking to older cousin on Daddy's side about what to do with such a small amount and about gardening. I mentioned Daddy growing roses which seem weird as it was after my stepmom died. She remembered Daddy talking her mom, his older sister, into growing roses as the rose hips help with inflammation and have vitamin C. Hubby and I talked it over as we were already planning to put in more perennials. I figured this would be where Daddy who grew his own veggies until his late 80s would like his money used this way. I have or have ordered a dozen different roses (rose hips have vitamin C plus help with inflammation )to go along the back fence at the pasture behind the barn. It needs the fence replaced. So that's where the back payment can go on. I also ordered 2 elderberry bushes (helps with immunity) because right now I either get it from friends that get it from other friend or I have to order it. I ordered horseradish  as what we planted last year did not grow. I have 5 blueberry bushes in and 2 on their way. I have 10 black raspberry bushes (helps with inflammation, nausea and mouth sores) ordered.  I still need to replace some herbs that died and find apple mint  also. We have another large medical bill coming in as our eye glasses will be in.  Our federal, state and school tax refunds are in. I hope to put most if not all of it back after paying off this year's coming school tax due. I would like to see the budget cut by at least 10% BUT AND have 3 months savings incase something happens to one of us and the other doesn't have access to moneyHubby wants to pay the mortgage off. I'm still dizzy enough to not try to work on that.Blessed BePrayers for peace Until I got sick middle of the night Sunday we stayed on point with eating the protein on this calendar.  IncomeIRAs $6800.78Social Security $3634.Son 2 payment on loan $100Business income $2992Interest $87.45 (2 CDs cashed)Cash back from credit cards $242.49TOTAL INCOME $13856.72Out goIrregular expenses $1040.15Down grid / maintenance $241.15Automatic savings $180Dog food/treats/vets $0Household expenses $2448.46 Business expenses $2444.64Medical/OOP $2349.40Garden $1284.23New CD $1000TOTAL OUT GO $8543.57IN BLACK  $5313.15Considering Hubby didn't work for a solid week we were surprised he was able to cover his bills. He lucked out and was able to double up 4 small jobs and then had one job hauling out of state. Which definitely put the business in the black this month even though not by much.  I saved money by calling my GI instead of just showing up to the ER for my Crohn's attack. After answering what seemed to be a million questions, the PA asked if anyone around me had the stomach bug that is going around. I didn't know so I called the kids I had been around.... Daughter 4 said it was like having hard labor while sitting on the toilet and dry heaving in the trash can... HUM... Called PA back and he said the treatment would be the same but they would run a CT Scan with contrast to see if it was Crohn's or stomach bug. Not putting my veins through that or spending that kind of money to be treated the same. Plus 3 hrs. of driving and the gas money.Hubby said we saved 2 pots of coffee and 4 pots of tea as the only thing I could keep down was water... room temperature water. Last night I ate a grilled cheese sandwich with crusts removed (Charlotte love it as she got the crusts). Kept it down but still spent 2 hrs. in bathroom.Last night was the first night since Sunday night I slept in the bed. Charlotte has been sleeping beside me on the bathroom floor. Rascal used to do that. She was happy to be back in her rocking chair that she has made into her bed. I got about 3 hrs. of sleep at a time with 30 minute bathroom break. BUT hey, I slept in bed and made it to the bathroom every time. Lots of improvement there. We saved gas as we didn't go see the kids and after I told my symptoms none of them wanted me any where near them. I got a lot of I love you BUT ... Hubby took a lot of short hauls to keep the money rolling in but still be able to check on me. He has a long haul today but different Amish along with the kids blowing my phone up will be checking on me. I get tired easy... not surprising with out eating. It took me 3 days to do finances that normally take me an hour.

They noticed that Charlotte kept jumping at the door and barking... they thought at first she was barking at them until she ran to the other window and barked. So they were able to figure out where he was and get him back home. Since they got cookies for bringing the rooster home, they brought over two cookies for Charlotte for helping them. LOL.A friend screen shot these to meHe thought it was interesting as he has always told his wife to pitch it after 6 months and they fought over it more than once. I just wanted to bang my head on the wall... or maybe his if I was close enough. Four days of medical appointments has been a drag, both of us are worn out from it. Hubby said we got 16 mpg with the work truck, we get 15 mpg with the other truck that we now only drive local as it's rusting out and we don't trust it to not hit a pot hole and frame break to drive it very far.  We saved 20 cents /gal on the first tank through his credit card with the gas station. Then 30 cents/ gal with Kroger's. We ate out once (instead of the normal every single time). We had lunch at friends home on the last one. I took a side dish and they did the main meal. It was a nice visit that we haven't had for a long time. They let us know they bought some elderberry bushes to grow and if they had extra they would share. I had already ordered some myselfOn Wednesday I told Hubby we needed to not do the 4 days straight with appts as it is a killer and he wasn't able to work. As soon as  I said it his phone ran. A 144 was needing a load hauled Friday. It's on the calendar. On Thursday A B  called needing scrap hauled Sat... junk yard is not open on Saturdays so it's now on Monday. But Hubby told him he would bring the trailer over on Saturday afternoon so they could have it loaded. J. A. B. called right after needing to have stuff hauled to his in laws on Saturday. So Hubby dropped the trailer off after A 144 so J.A.B. could load it. When done hauling it this morning he will drop it off to A B. Monday he will haul scrap to junk yard, then drop trailer back off to J. A. B to reload for lumber for barn that is going up at his in laws and Hubby will pick trailer up on Wednesday.Add in there we are driving 2 hrs. (4 hrs. total)to do pit stops to drop stuff off to kids on Tuesday evening. N... E's brother and whom we bought the house from stopped last night to see our stove as he is thinking of getting a new one for his wife. I told him to have her come over to see if she liked it.I know she would do the warming closet on the top that I don't have. He also needs 47 bunk beds he made hauled on Thursday. That's an all day trip and he is going with Hubby as there are a couple stores he wants to stop at. Hubby did tell N to remind him to drink his water as he is dehydrating and it's making other health issues worse. N has no problem with that as he said he has a worker that he has to remind also. Trailer is going to N on Wednesday night. As N was leaving I closed the window on my screen door. It has a retractable screen... N thinks he wants to change his doors out to like that as it would help during the winter when the wood stove is running them out of the house as his wife doesn't want to leave doors open with the little ones.I bet ten bucks that A 144 and/or D P  most likely both, calls with a load on Friday.  I am glad Hubby thought to ask Doc if he was okay for still hauling.Hubby had to stop and get a piece of pipe and 2 fittings to finish the solar pump connection to the pressurized tank. He was upset about it and I just told him to laugh it off as it's ALWAYS something  PLUS he was able to pick up new leather gloves for us ON SALE and we wouldn't have been there if he hadn't needed to get the last of the items. He calmed down after that. He got upset when he went to make popcorn and couldn't remember where I kept the popper for the microwave. Told me that he wouldn't be able to make popcorn if something happened to me because he couldn't find it. Asked me where it was... small appliance cabinet... still a blank. I pointed out he would do what he has always done... get a skillet, lard, bacon grease and butter and pop the corn on the stove... He laughed until he cried because that's exactly what he would have done. I did tell him even if I label the cabinets when I spring clean (May, no sense doing it as long as we are using the wood stove off and on), I didn't think it would help him. Because I would put general list like small appliances.I need to work the budget for April.Blessed BePrayers for peace."},
{"title": "Hubby MRI results, planning for the future.", "date": "Wednesday, March 22, 2023", "text": "This was Hubby's fortune after we ate at Hong Kong before we got his MRI results. Even our doctor who is a friend laughed. Doc told him he has to write down stuff that is important, to pull over and input jobs when they come in while he is driving (he has hands free but has twice forgot he agreed to jobs when I was in the truck with him). He has to have a set routine. He has to lose weight, exercise and eat healthier. IF he doesn't want me to nag... he is to do it... other wise I have doctor's orders to NAG.He has small vessel brain damage, enough to be causing problems but not enough to stop him from working as a hauler at this point. He sees the neurologist May 25th.  I will give Doc credit, he knows Hubby well enough that if he had said you have a type of dementia and it's the kind that lowers survivor rate, Hubby would go into denial and I would be battling daily.  When Hubby went to check out, Doc held me back, he said he was surprised I caught it like I did as it is in the early stages. Which means we can slow it down. He is at a higher risk of stroke especially when he had rheumatic fever as a teenager. I caught because I know what to watch for. Both parents and step dad had it. Hubby's grandpas had it and his Dad has it now. I first thought ADHD because he easily sidetracked ... then worried it was his heart since he had rheumatic fever. Then the migraines came back after years of not having them. The change in his personality, though slight was enough to send warning bells off. He cursed using the F word and loud enough for E's children that were playing in the pasture to hear him. That is not him and I knew it. Especially when I said something about the kids and he cursed me.Since I just had my own brain MRI (It was good), we can be thankful it's only one of us and not both like Mother and Pop before they died or like Hubby's parents now.  I know I can't put off or let him put me off of learning to deal with the tractor. I even said something today and he started to put me off when I reminded him I have a learning disability and it takes me awhile to learn to do something. True statement as he tutored me in high school. The tractor is the only thing I need to learn to deal with this home. Finances need changed a bit and the will crap needs updated (again). We talked about getting things around for cremation also. AND were already dealing with this before these results.Daughter 3, daughter 4 , and Son 2 know small vessel damage is dementia... they both have worked in nursing homes/ elderly care.  The other 3 not so much but I am okay with that as Hubby hasn't clued in to it. He thinks vitamin deficiency or his migraines is messing with him. He can go right on thinking that... I'm okay with it. Means he is not stressing or worrying about what will come. He did mention getting longer welding sleeves so he doesn't get burnt on his arm again on the wood stove.  I wear one already when loading or cleaning the stove. I know I need to make a list to not miss getting something done. But I've always made lists LOL"},

He lives in city so doesn't see the sunrise unless he is working (part time at high school as he is SUPPOSED to be retired) . He loved it. I also sent him these two.I am not sure if it is the same two geese that was here when we bought the house but every year we have 2 or 3 come. They spend the day here and then go somewhere else for the night. Probably will be not visiting so much when the little ones come along LOL. Temperature is hovering around 32 but the wind is blowing around 10-18 mph. Keeps the pond from freezing but definitely cold. I was surprised they didn't take off when I walked up to the fence to take the pic... they are so used to Charlotte that they ignore her when she barks at them.We finally saw a male and female robin. We have seen some wrens.  Hummingbirds are due to come in this week. Purple Martins should be coming in around the 1st of April. Four days this week we have appts. One changed times to a later hour, not real thrilled but it is what it is. As it's either the later time or 2 weeks from now. We made a list of what the errands are and then Brother texted me that Daddy had an annuity that just popped up. GEEZE, Daddy's been gone 3 yrs this coming July. You would think that places like this would clue in when banks accounts are closed. Brother thought it was part of the financial group we have but it's not.  I got the paperwork to get notarized only to find my name was misspelled. What a pain. SO more paperwork to fill out and get notarized. I am glad the person I am dealing with was willing to wait until we were already out this coming week.I handed Hubby the break down of where our money went last year and the fact I cut the budget by $59,000 last year.(We spent $200,000 bringing this home to wheelchair accessible for our old age). He couldn't believe I was able to do that (taxes showed I did, if you don't pull it you don't spend it and it was out of my retirement not his). He was still upset when he saw he \"blew\" $15,000.  He has canceled some memberships he doesn't use, called his business insurance and got a reduction of $200 a MONTH.  I did show him that we might next year cancel Prime... right now it saved us $1000 in shipping and he watched the free shows. This year might not be worth paying for it. He also agreed to call me if he out buying something and wants buy something not on the list. We still have medical bills out, his MRI included. Eye appt. is Wed so we will know how much that is. We need to update wills etc. We need to have more in each of our own savings to cover monthly bills if something happens to the other one until estate would be settled. Hubby's is almost there but mine is lacking. Going into spring, I have 6 new strawberry beds, 3 new pollinator beds to fill and 1 heart shaped bed that I think will just be pretty flowers in the back yard as there is NOTHING there but the driveway to the pump house , barn and deck.Have a great weekPrayers for peaceBlessed Be"},

I prefer standard time right along with the Amish. Monday, did Saturday's and Sunday's laundry, reloaded wood into house, cleaned out the frigs, organized the kitchen frig using cheap sheet cake pans and took trash to the road. Caught all the dishes up. Tuesday drop off to bank for 2 of the Amish, drop off to our bank for Hubby's business. Got lunch at sit down restaurant and was proud we only ate salad bar and sandwich. LOTS of veggies and fresh fruit on the salad bar. I brought home half my sandwich. Stopped at CVS as I had coupons and saved 33% there. Still need more burn pad/band aids. Went to chiro, Hubby got fuel while I was in Kroger's. I saved 25 % using Fresh Mode, coupons and sales. Hamburger and chicken breast ended up costing $1.25/lb. Got salad items, baking potatoes, and a bunch of flowers on clearance.  We had to stop at CVS here in town as Humira was in. NO extra trips to go get it . Amish paid for the drop offs for their banking. Hubby said it paid for 1/3rd of the fuel.Wednesday we went to H&R and paid for our taxes and picked them up and dropped off bank stuff to the 2 Amish. At 10 pm our time (9 pm Amish) M came over and asked if we could make a trip to Walmart as her school kids had just remembered to give her a note that on Friday they were to bring finger sandwiches for a \"gathering\" at school. Thursday we went to Walmart to get M's stuff, dropped that off and then to A &W enterprise as Hubby forgot to stop when he was dropping off bank stuff in that area. We need a 2nd floor mat for the wood stove and he was supposed to have ordered it. Friday we are home. Lots of rain and wind coming in.  Saturday will be pick up the limbs that come out of the trees into the north gardens if not to wet from the rain. No since stomping through the mud.Sunday is the day of rest.Monday I have doctor appt 2 hrs. away one wayTuesday Hubby has doctor's appt for results of his MRI, we also will stop at Menards for some odds and ends since it's within a mile of appt. Wednesday both of us have eye appts. Both need new glassesThursday  We have chiro and as Doc is on vacation for 2 wks. and lunch at friends home.I am hoping for a quiet Friday.  that little pinkish purple stub is an asparagus coming up. There is two in the patch. The patch is 4 ft by 100 ft.  We had some Amish dig some out last year to make it only 80 ft long... It grew back SIGH.  I told Hubby he might be taking some to auction to sale ... he responded with blackberries also. LOL"},

LOL) we moved in.While waiting for Hubby to go in for his MRI with contrast we talked about how we felt about the home. Was it set up to deal with one or both of us down? Would only one of us be able to maintain the property? We do not have buyer's remorse. Do not regret any of the extra money we have put in it even when things get really tight because of it. Don't regret the money spent on down grid. Hubby still needs to hook solar pump to pressure tank.We could take the couch out of the front room and move a small table and the printer and put one or even two hospital beds in that place. French doors and front porch ramped. Sidewalk goes from front of the house to French doors to barn is 3 ft wide. Doors in house are 3 ft wide. Would have to move humidifier and clothes hamper if you were taking a wheelchair to the bedroom and move the bed over 6 inches to get back out the other door but there is enough room as is to turn wheelchair around and go back out same door. Our carpenter brought his late wife's wheelchair down to make sure it could be done. I had forgot about that until our HVAC guy was down in this area and just stopped by to say hi and see what else we had done and had mentioned that the carpenter is now in the wheelchair from drinking and driving accident. HE was the one drinking and driving. No one else was hurt. He will be recovering for at least 6 months. We decided we are as close as possible to be able to stay in our home even if we need help taking care of ourselves. We need to work saving more to cover finances if one of us dies and have to wait to get all the paper work done to get money flipped around. I would like to change the gardens to an easier maintenance  with no mowing between the raised garden beds like it is in some areas. Metal or cedar beds instead of painted plyboard or composite board . Hubby is agreeable even though that means $$ spent.  I would like more perennials, pollinator gardens for bees, butterflies and hummingbirds along with more herbs. I already ordered black raspberry bushes. I am hoping the fruit trees fruit this year at least for some fresh. We might add more fruit trees. I hope the apple trees don't get bit with frost this year like they did last year. At least we got cider out of it with sharing with E.   We picked up some puff speltz grown locally. Think Honey Smarts or Golden Crisp without the sugar. We were told that it's good with warmed honey over it. We had it plain and thought GOOD, then put butter over it and thought air popcorn. This 5 lb. bag costs us $10.Daughter 2 said that is about equal to 4 large boxes of cereal that sale for around $5 each if you don't buy name brand.

She moved and now needs to transport the youngest 2 to school and the older two are either at work or already at college. Financially she is okay with the reduction, but decided to put in a garden. We strongly suggested to start with pots as they are easier to weed and water since we both know her ADHD will flare and she will abandon the garden. Her landlord told her it was okay to till it up but if she didn't maintain it her rent went up to cover someone coming in to deal with it. Sounds like he's had that issue before.Daughter 4 is working as much as she can get since she will be off for a week without pay at the end of the money.Son 1 got brochities... he hasn't had that in years. Ended up in ER over it.Son 2 is back to 4 jobs as he is working at the AF base, then as secretary to Combat vets' , and inventory for the food/drink section of the VFW when the commander of the VFW had a heart attack so Son 2 is now filling that position also until he returns.   Hubby's parents are starting to struggle with their home as the doors to the bedrooms and bathroom are too small, you can't get a walker through let alone a wheelchair. They are letting the oldest decide whether to change size of doors (which is what we would do) and change layout of bathroom (which is what we would do) and call it done. Enough help to redo it in the family that they would only pay for materials.  The Oldest let Hubby know last night he is also thinking of just moving them to his old house that he rents out as it's already handicap accessible including bathroom. He and his 2nd wife were going to move into it but they have horses now and there is no room for the horses at his old place.   He would let us know which way it goes but is hoping that with the physical therapy their mom is getting (she had polio as a child) that it keeps her on her feet for awhile longer. His parents had to change their power of attorney to lasting power of attorney due to changes in law. We unloaded the wood wagon almost 4 cords of wood that took ALL weekend 17 hrs. without the last cord being stacked. Hubby will have to restack the last 1 1/2 cords as he knocked the pile over when he stubbled. THEN told me we have another one coming... not sure when... but I definitely didn't know whether to cry or laugh but was glad I kept track of the manhours of the jobs as this time we had to have the wagon back today and that meant we worked over half of Sunday. Which neither of us like to do. E was butchering so his boys and him couldn't help. Taxes are being done tomorrow. I know we will owe school taxes plus taxes from the business. I am happy I am not doing the taxes with having the business.Hubby made us eye appointments for later in the month.He has a MRI of the brain on Thursday. He is worried that his problems are dementia and not just vitamin deficiency or dehydration. He brought up that he always planned to by my caregiver not the other way around. How could we deal with this. I pointed out that catching the changes early is a big plus. It could be Idiopathic dementia that surgery could correct, it could be something from the migraines he has since he had rheumatic fever when 16. He just needs to stay active, eat healthy, drink his water and use his brain. His dad has had Alzheimer's for 5 yrs and has NOT gotten worse and is still driving safely and his mom has mild dementia and is doing fine also. I can definitely say he had some dehydration going on and if he isn't driving it's worse. As when he is in the truck he will drink water while waiting to be loaded or unloaded or waiting on someone. At home he doesn't want to take a water bottle to the barn. SO I took his old work lunch box out with refilled bottles of water and placed it where he was working. He came in that evening and said that worked as he drank all 3 bottles and then refilled them at the water hydrant in the barn.  I really didn't understand why he didn't take it with him to begin with as I carry my travel mug with water to the gardens all the time. Doc added B complex vitamin to his Meds.But since he is dealing with health issue, he is not fighting me over updating the will crap or saving more money. SILVER lining in the storm."},
{"title": "wood ", "date": "Friday, March 3, 2023", "text": "We were down to this on wood... definitely under estimated amount needed. We thought 4 cords would be enough. Had more soft wood than hard wood. Soft wood is good during 50 degree days. By the stoveWhat is left of what we storedWe used 20 bags of coal... Coal is good for when the HIGH temp is no more than 32. Even the Amish that use only coal said they were struggling to not over heat the house. Buying coal to replace what we used is OFF the list.Hubby kept all the wood from pruning and projects we did through the summer.Including all the scraps of crap. When E saw what we were down to he dragged up some trees that a person had cut down but never came back for( upset E as he doesn't like waste of any kind), plus a few he cut down to help keep his woods healthy. They just transplanted over 2 dozen  2 yr. old hard wood maples .So Hubby cut those up since they are cured about 2 yrs, we can use them now.Hubby felt we would be okay to get through this spring.  He was just finishing cutting the last of this when he got a call to come to the sawmill and haul wood.When he got there, he found it was OUR wood. We had moved our name on the wood list to put E's dad in front of us so wasn't expecting any wood until end of March, maybe April. We won't be unloading it today as we are expecting 3 inches of rain and 30-50 MPH winds. It's under the barn over hang with a tarp with weight covering what little isn't covered by the over hang. Plus Hubby thought about wind driving the rain under the over hang.  E's brother N who sold us the house, said he would fill the garden shed to the rafters with wood and have 2 cords of wood up by the house.  The garden shed is 12 by16 by 10 (to rafters). That is 4 times the amount we had figured. But we definitely need to make sure we keep the hard wood separate from soft wood."},
{"title": "Frugal plans for March", "date": "Thursday, March 2, 2023", "text": "We have 9 \"errands/appts etc\" in March. I hope to combine 4 of them to save on fuel.On this calendar I listed what protein we will be eating. We followed it 10 days in February. I just add what ever sides needed ate from the frig first and fill in from the pantry. Goal is to only buy dairy, bell peppers, mushrooms and lettuce during this month. We are still too cold for planting. Grocery budget set at $150 which is a reduction of half.I ordered 2 varieties of black raspberry plants. The honey raspberry is still struggling and the red raspberry just started good last year. The blackberries run us over but M said she would send the girls over to pick if they get too much for us. I ordered a couple varieties of peas and a variety of green beans that a friend and  I was out of using a discount code,  picked up a seed tape for carrots that was marked down to 25 ¢ from last year from another store.  Hubby picked up two varieties of early peas from the local Amish green house that had them marked down. The owner's wife charged him $1.00 for 1 lb. of seed just to clear her bin for this year's seed.  I am going to try to plant some dwarf peas in flower pots to hang instead of buying so many flowers. She told Hubby if it worked to let her see a pot... she would like to do that if it's looks good.Hubby drinks dandelion root tea for his gout. I googled it to see how to make our own. Decades ago I used to make dandelion wine for the elderly gentleman that was a neighbor and make dandelion jelly for my kids. We do eat the greens in salad. Amish neighbor said I needed to try it with gravy over potatoes like they do. Propane is at 33%...so we saved $1626.93 PLUS enough to cover the expense of buying coal and what little we paid for wood as most of our wood was given to us. Our furnace guy said we could let the tank go down to 10 % before refill and the furnace would be fine. Since we are only using it a couple times a week instead of the wood/coal stove, we might save another tank full if we wait until it's that low. Summer fills are cheaper than winter fills.Temperatures are up and down. Seems like every Wed/Thurs we hit high  50/60s and then go down to low 40s for with mornings below freezing. Blessed Be Prayers for peace"},
{"title": "YEA!!! ", "date": "Wednesday, March 1, 2023", "text": "We ate 10 meals out of 10 from the menu....first ever in our married life LOL.🤯Instead of listing the whole menu, protein, veggies, fruit and grain... I listed protein ONLY. We eat what ever sides need finished like the frozen asparagus as we will have fresh in about 2-3 months. The salad that wasn't enough for both of us and the last of the applesauce. I think we have finished a jar of something pickled every other day. I know I finished the black olives as snack instead of the chocolate bar. Didn't stop the want for the chocolate bar. All the bills are paid until March 9th. Groceries are in and we don't need milk. We have the medical outstanding bills yet but the money is in a money market making as more than the regular savings account. So I count them as paid since I am not hunting for the money to pay it.We had 2 medical appts that were 2 hrs. apart not including the 1 hr. of driving between them and two hrs. back home ). We dropped off Hubby's prescription at local CVS. Drove to Sidney, made drop off to Goodwill, then to the bank (our branch closed) and then to chiro. After chiro we got diesel fuel for 34¢ LESS per gallon than what it runs here. Hubby was happy. Then we drove closer to the next appt. in Dayton area and got something to eat. We did a sit down restaurant so we could get veggies that are not deep fried (drooling I am going to miss my deep fried veggies). I had a strawberry salad that I can make at home and just change out the berries when in season. Steak and lobster (got my seafood LOL) and a loaded baked potato that came home. Hubby got steak and shrimp, mixed veggies (carrot, yellow squash and zucchini, boiled but still crunchy) and rice. They messed up and brought him a baked potato also. He brought home the potato and most of the rice that they brought out. He ate his potato last night. Went to the next medical. GI appt. for my Crohn's. I am doing good, no hospitalizations due to Crohn's.  PA was not happy and a little worried when I told him the phlebotomist said I only have one good vein and I am not a candidate for infusion therapy. When I go on Medicare next Jan.  I won't have insurance to pay for my Humira. I've already called the company to see if they have something... they do but it depends on a lot of other stuff and they were hoping that the gov't would include biologics in the reduced prices.  I am not going to stress about it. I will focus on life style to keep it steady instead. We drove home (2 hrs.) picked up Hubby's meds. I had some extra bucks and coupons to get some things that was on the wait until on sale list. Pharmacy made the comment \" I see you are shopping so I am printing off your receipt because more coupons came out today\"  There was only 1 coupon I wouldn't use. I got shampoo, conditioner, 4 kinds of toothpaste (I know the kids will be raiding that ), 3 body/ hand lotions,  children allergy meds for Charlotte (vet told me to), allergy meds for me (ouch $44 before sale and coupon), scar med with sun screen for grandson that got hit in face with tree limb while cutting down tree and was off work for 3 months, pain rub as GI want's me off meds by mouth as much as possible, and Aleve for Hubby's Mom.  Sales saved me $44.96, coupons saved me $44. The register had a fit about it and the lady running it said it's because I so many coupons and sales and just laughed. Manager dealt with it and she laughed. Said it happens every day now days. I got a $5 extra bucks that's good to the end of March and will get 2% back on my credit card.  We then picked up Charlotte when we unloaded at home and went over to deliver a message to H and B about B's medical appt. Hubby confirmed it for them so they don't have to come over and use the phone. I found 39 ¢Hubby decided he wasn't tossing the volunteer concord grape vine that had sprouted up last year. We started growing seedless grapes as we just don't drink that much juice or eat that much grape jam. He was trying to figure out where to move it. I suggest the back fence that is needing replaces anyways. He could transplant it when he does the fence and it will have support as it grows.  TO finish this off.. H said maple water (known as sap to Englisher's) is running more this year. Already have over 2000 gallons of maple water and that's the 1st \"run\". E said it takes 40 gallons of maple water to make 1 gallon of maple syrup. E got two of his wheels off the road by cutting the corner too sharp pulling out of his lane and the road was wet so the horses couldn't get a good enough \"grip\" to pull it back on road. Hubby went over with the tractor and pushed the wagon to get it on the road. I have to write up this month's to do list so we don't miss anything. Blessed BePrayers for peace"},

{"title": "All in a week", "date": "Wednesday, February 22, 2023", "text": "with so many clouds I was surprised to be able to see these 2 evening stars... I am thinking Hubby said Mars and Venus was to be showing. He heard it on the weather news. It got warmish. Enough for Charlotte to want to sit outside and expected me to sit with her.It's fine when it's 2 p.m. and she is nudging me to go take a nap with her on the bed. Hubby finally broke down and bought a wood splitter. He was going to buy used and I insisted on buying new. Another guy bought the used one and a month later it had broke down and needed $500 in repair. Between the cost of buying it used and the repair he could have bought a new one and had a 4 yr warranty. Hubby was glad I insisted, especially after splitting a huge tree in 2 hrs. E said it would have taken a 2 days to do it by hand. Which is why he dragged it out of his woods and dumped it at our gate at the pasture. He was clearing some paths while working the maple trees for sap aka maple water as the Amish call it.Next Tuesday we have 2 appointments so won't be able to go to the store due to timing and distance. So we went yesterday. Took Charlotte to the vet for spring allergy shot and nails clipped, she's at 61.5 lbs. For the first time, even though she was shaking with fear, she let a cockapoo pup sniff her without her barking or growling at it. Vet said that was a good sign that she would be okay with us getting a pup by summer.Hubby went and got fuel and took a nap in the truck with Charlotte while I did the grocery shopping. All that is left on the list is Chi Chi tortilla chips that we can only get at Menards. I got everything on my list PLUS a 7 lb. roasting chicken for 99¢/ lb., very seldom find anything over 5 lbs. and a pork butt for the same price. I got thick sliced bacon for $3.39/lb. instead of the price of $7.99 I have been finding. I got $2 off my pot stickers, $3 off my pizza rolls (yeah I know how bad they are for me, but sometimes I can eat them on the run). I also got $4 off Velveeta, $1.50 off yogurt, $1.75 off cottage cheese, $1 off sour cream, $1.50 off each of several cheeses, 2 pineapples for half price ($4.50)$1.50 off oranges, $2.50 off coke a cola, $1.50 off tricolor bell peppers , $2.11 off strawberries, 50 ¢ off potato chips, $1.50 off mushrooms, and $3 off because I bought $15 of meat. Total I saved $68.43. Better yet I won't be back to the store for 3 wks. the soonest so Hubby will pick up milk as needed. Junk food aka chips etc. will last 3-4 months. I limit \"junk\" food chips, pizza rolls etc. to $80 every 3 months. Chocolate is a different category, it's $60 every 4-5 months. I can stretch if I make brownies, choc ice cream, choc chip what ever. Hubby does chocolate bar with peanut butter every night other wise. Blessed Beprayers for peace"},

AND no account is completely broke. Hubby actually sighed. EVEN his business bills are paid.How can she sleep like this ?  laying beside me on the couch with her head hanging down? LOL.Hubby picked up the last of the plumbing for the solar simple pump to connect it to the pressurized tank to come directly to the house. Yesterday we had it running by solar to send water to the pond , the pump has to \"set\" in and that takes a total of 6 hrs. of running. We are doing it one hour a day. Since the pond is still low, it's good to run it that way. Still waiting on the buzz sawblades. The guy stopped here yesterday and thought they had one (we ordered 2) and found it wasn't quite right, Hubby sent the other blade with him so they could measure it correctly. The guy offered to sharpen our blade for free since the two blades are coming in almost a month after they were suppose to. It's $50 to sharpen this blade since the Amish guy that used to do it moved out of the area.So after the sighs of relief and I am thinking we can take a breath.Hubby brings up redoing the gardens.So much for that breath. GEEZE. I told him we were going to focus on perennials and heirloom plants. I had already ordered some black raspberry starts, would love to find some elderberry starts (I get elderberry honey from friends so many they can get starts from where they pick berries) and look at more herbs that are used for medicinal. We need to set up the new beds we got for the strawberries and transplant them (I think I will just get starts off them and plant them in the new beds)  I ordered some wide Italian green beans, I will plant them in the old potato beds. I picked up some more peas as I was almost out of seed. I got heirloom this time so I can save seed. I saved the seed from the last baby butternut we just ate to plant also. But first it's pay the taxes. March 7th."},
{"title": "Little things add up", "date": "Wednesday, February 15, 2023", "text": "Grandson asked how I make my toothpaste last so long.... he is by himself and his mom told him I make 1 tube last a month and I brush my teeth after every meal (yes I had braces, can you tell ? 😏) I asked for him to take a picture of his toothbrush (I had to promise to not post it anywhere, he is not much into social media) after he put the toothpaste on.... I then sent him a photo of mine... he had Mount Rushmore and I had a nice size pea. I told him to ask his dentist. Every dentist I have said PEA size not the 1 inch most toothpaste directions tell you. Then I got wondering how much I was spending on toothpaste (I stock that too and I grew up with using baking soda mixed with salt)www.omicalculator.com/everyday-life/toothpasteI used the current FULL price which I never spend when buying toothpaste. BUT coupons are getting less and less and sales sometimes are not really sales. So I went with not sales or coupons.Numbers are based on me using the toothpaste once a day. Colgate Renewal 3 oz should last me 15.22 months with the cost of 44￠ per use Sensodyne 3.4 oz should last me 17.24 months with the cost of 35￠per use ( I use this twice a day so it would only last me 8.62 months)Crest 3D white (since I won't bleach my teeth) 3.8 oz should last me 19.27 months with the cost of 19￠per useCrest Densify 4.1 oz should last me 20.79 months with the cost of 24￠per use.I spend the most $1.14 (highest amount) and 89￠the lowest amount per day. I am okay with that amount unlike Grandson who has been using a tube every two weeks. Since Grandson like to feel foam when he is brushing, I told him to ask Son2 as he is the same way. From the sounds of it, he now has an electric toothbrush, water pic, which toothpaste is the best for the money and Son2 sent him a photo of what the toothpaste should look like. Grandson asked about other things.Dish soap is a very small amount... I use blue Dawn. I buy 56 oz bottles as I use it for other things. Helps keep bugs off Charlotte also. I also add about 18 to 20 oz of water to it before using it on anything. I use 1/2 tsp to wash my hand wash dishes. That is over 2 yrs of dish soap for washing dishes. https://mykitchenmates.com/101-uses-for-dawn-dish-soap/I hand wash pots and pans so I don't fill both soap cups up in the dishwasher.Shampoo and conditioner about the size of a quarter, I have thick hair to my hips.Body wash.. bar soap last longer if you take it out of package for a week before using... use a bath pouf or wash cloth to clean more... you waste more than you think just putting it in your hand. I use a drizzle to a nickel.Face lotion. a dime during summer and nickel during winterbody lotion about a nickel per area.Grandpa was a barber, he said to always wipe your razor with rubbing alcohol after using. It would last longer and you wouldn't get razor burn. I have done that and found while the daughters have to replace their blades 3 times more than I do.I have found that most people (like Hubby used to) just dump what ever cleaner/soap etc. and not really read the amount they should have used to think to try less and see if it still did the job. If you want to save money ... you have to think about that type of stuff... especially in this economy and if you are looking at living off social security with very little else.Prayer for peace Blessed be"},

She had to pay $900 (well, I did as she doesn't have any money saved) for her share of the surgery. Better than the $9000 her insurance wanted her to pay since they consider her cancer precondition. SIGH  The doctor that did the 1st surgery removing the ovaries wanted to take everything but her insurance wouldn't allow it.I loaded her up with food last week, so she could save her grocery money for her April rent.

He now has everything inside and has 4 more \"steps\" to do to complete it. He didn't think it would be this much work to do but glad he has done it. He is videoing what he is doing to a friend that is an electrician. So far he is doing the wiring correct.

AND then told us they talked to another Amish that was willing to make sure they would have eggs for us if we let them know on Mondays and they would keep enough back (they sell eggs) for us what ever day we wanted eggs.... it's cold, chickens don't lay much when it's cold. I have eggs in the freezer for noodles, scrambled/omelets and baking and such but Daughter 4 wants them boiled for her lunches. E's youngest brother came of to E's for wood that he had cut and left to cure in the woods... told E that he found 2 more trees that the other guy was suppose to get last fall and he left them to rot(this guy won't get any more wood from E) in the back side of the woods. E and his brother came over and got Hubby to show him where they were at. Hubby has more wood to cut now for free. Youngest brother got help hauling his wood to the his wagon.Englisher called Hubby as he knew Hubby had ordered saw blades for his buzz saw. He is going to be at that place next week or so and offered to drop off the check and pick up the blades for Hubby to save us the trip. Hubby will be calling to verify the blades are in and total for the 2 blades. One of the Amish mentioned to the guy Hubby was still waiting on the saw blades. Didn't see any use of Hubby driving an hour one way to get something that is at a place he will be at every other week until April.I called my dentist to reschedule my appt. that I had missed. When she verified my address she asked if I was close to E as they forgot to send him a reminder of the kids' dentist appts that are Friday. I said no problem and I would call them back to let them know he remembered. Since they are butchering today I knew he would be up at the house and not in the fields.  Confirmed (he had forgot but M hadn't) and called dentist back. Got a $5 credit for the message delivery LOL.Never know where the conversation is going to go around here.Prayers for peace Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Snow, sleet, rain, deaths and sickness and budget AGAIN.", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2023", "text": "when temps are at 32 SIGH.. what a day. Hubby is out in it as he is making sure the two widows can get their cars out. He cleared off both of our porches and the deck along with the sidewalk to the barn. Plowed our own lane and cleared mailboxes for both widows , E and us after the township plow went through.IT was a bad hair day on top of catching pneumonia. SIGH. Urgent care was cheaper than driving to primary and him sending me for x rays.We had more deaths in the family, heart attack, my cousin's son, cancer, from another cousin and old age with a grand parent on the eldest's other side. My brother let me know his wife lost 2 on her side from old age. Still hard even when their are of \"that age\". The guy around the corner (we can see his cabin across the field from our porch) house burned down. Completely gone, possible damage to foundation. Has been working on this for 3 yrs. and was getting it finished this week to move in Feb. 1st. Outdoor furnace got to hot, and the pipe from it got too hot and was too close to cabin that was dried pine logs. Rumor is his insurance told him the furnace had to be 100 ft from the house. It wasn't even 10 ft. He was working in the upstairs bedroom and smelled smoke. Went out the window over the front porch roof to get out. He was not hurt. Did say that was the fire escape plan so he knows that works well as both bedrooms have way to get off back and front porch roofs. He is planning to raze it and rebuild.I am in the house dealing with the changes we have decided on... again... some more......This is the south loft. The two side walls are done except for the 2 attic doors needing built and covers over outlets and the light switch. I want to put an edging between where the ceiling is and the wall starts. We will be looking for that on Tuesday.  The window wall will have the same bottom but some where in the barn is dark paneling cut to fit for the top part of this wall. I took it off when we started on this room 4 yrs ago. YES 4 YRS.AGO.  Put it in the barn in the big bay. I went out to where it should be and Hubby had buried everything I had put there with broken doors, scrap lumber from the basement ramp etc. Frustration as I had that area organized and now it's not. What I get for not walking through the WHOLE barn instead of just the loft and front bay. He was going to pull the \"crap\" out but couldn't figure out where to store the \"crap\". So it sits.  Barn decluttering starts when it gets warmer which is NOT THIS WEEK. That is okay since I am just getting over the walking pneumonia.We changed the budget. Hubby wanted to live off our social security... until he heard the estimate of what we would be paying for health insurance.  THEN he had the panic attack.  I told him it just meant we needed to be more frugal let the social security pay the medical and live off our investments and what ever we can earn. THEN he got his stuff around for taxes and realized (DUH) his business lost money last year (which didn't help the panic attack). I guess telling him I covered bills from the household budget didn't click he was losing money due to diesel fuel costs. About a month's income but I was able to cover it with being frugal. Eighteen more months and the work truck will be paid for in full, that is 6 months ahead of time. If he hadn't had to pay the legal fees he does for hauling out of state he would have broke even. I divided that out by 12 and put it in the freaking  budget... it's actually less ( about half) than if I covered the work truck payment or it's insurance. I feel like I got the lesser of the evils with that low of a payment. The one Amish company he used to haul for and quit as it conflicted with other hauls he had first. They have pretty much closed down from lack of business. A lot of the Amish in that area are moving as they don't like the laws that passed that affects them having outhouses on ground. This county allows it if the outhouse is on a septic tank system, 1 line of running water into house is required also.  The Amish guy we bought our house from had 3 lines ran for his wife. One to the kitchen sink so she could have water there (and it drained to the septic line), one to the stove for the reservoir to be filled without her hauling water and one to the wash room for the stove there and for her to have cold water for the clothes washer. If the family doesn't want to put in a septic line, the \"Church\" has okayed porta potties. Some have them out in their field or at businesses, close to a drive so they can be dealt with by what ever company owns them. We didn't remove those lines, figured if we even had to use the 650 gallon water tank(above our water pump and pressurized tank) that is connected to those lines, we would be ahead of any issues. Propane. We over paid for this year, lucky our provider allows carry overs. IF we can make it 6 more weeks on this tank, we will have enough already paid for to cover the next heating season with adding 1 tank full as long as the price with tax is no more than $3/gallon.SO the budget is getting cut there as I had budgeted 4 tanks. We switched to coal this morning. So far it's burning good and the benefit is I don't have to keep feeding the stove as coal is pretty much 3-4 times a day if it runs right if that much. We have enough coal already for next year, but decided to buy another 2 tons this summer when the cost is lower for back up. That is already in savings.E asked Hubby for help as he had a couple trees down but with the limbs his horses could not pull it. They were cut down by another neighbor wanting them for fire wood and then never came back and got them after 2 yrs. E doesn't like waste especially cutting down trees and letting them rot. Offered to split the wood in half if Hubby would trim the limbs off. Ended up giving all of it to us when Hubby found 3 maples left also there. This wood is cured. Plus E asked Hubby to help him clear the property line and we could have ALL the wood since he had told us he would deal with it when we bought the house.  . Daughter 2 said a cord of wood in her area is $800. Her boys' dad got her a couple cords for $600 total as he is a landscaper. We have a cord still coming from the sawmill... we are 5th down on the list, we were 4 but found E's Dad H was 5th so we had the sawmill flip us with him. We still had 1/2 cord of sawmill wood when E gave us some, we passed it to E and he took it to his Dad. His parents are our age but his Dad is handicapped and his Mom B just had her knee replaced. SO we won't be buying any wood but fuel for the saws cutting the wood. E told us fuel costs for 1 cord is $15. He has the same saws as us. AND we should have 6 cords of wood if we are not burning any coal. That is $90 for \"wood heat\" for the season. The property line has about 2 dozen trees to deal with 2 of them are half way down due to storm damage.  We shouldn't be buying wood for awhile. BUT Hubby is going to be busy cutting wood. Maybe that will make hauling jobs come in... seems like if he is busy at home, he gets ran over hauling. We need 28 garden beds and 6 strawberry beds replaced. Hubby built slab wood beds last year for the potatoes... they didn't hold up as well as he thought they would but I can use them for lettuce, spinach and such this year. We priced what we would like to have Cedar wood beds... that came to about $20,000 with out soil. Not happening. I found metal beds for 1/3rd of the price that is suppose to last 15-20 yrs. and bought 2 just to see if they would work for us before spending all that money. We will be sifting soil and compost to refill to save on that part of the budget. I figured a year to replace all the bed and hopefully the strawberry beds also. I brought up the mortgage to get back on track of getting it paid off early. Adjusted propane/ heating budget. Played around with what can go into savings for a down payment of another used truck or SUV.Checked, double checked, and triple checked that the household budget could cover the business costs without any business income (that has not happened in 3 yrs even during the pandemic) and NOT cause a problem with paying household outflow) Would have to drop extra off mortgage but that was it. We didn't go to store .... Hubby grabbed a gallon of milk when running errands and I yanked the last loaf of bread out of the deep freezer. Down to hamburger buns. Prayers for all and peaceBlessed be"},

He got a kick on the oil lamp by the laptop instead of me turning on a light.  Amish neighbor on our other side came over this morning to move the wagon and helped with chores and let me know he took care of it and another should be over tonight. The oldest daughter of the another Amish neighbor is going to stay at the house and take care of the younger kids while the older ones are in school. She will stay until M and E get back home. They are rotating who is coming to help with chores since so many have went to the funeral.When it hits 77 degrees in house with only wood stove heating, I open windows and doors. Took 2 windows and 2 doors to get it back down to 72.  Several now have had pneumonia in the Amish community. Hubby has hauled 2 of them to the ER. Since I started running a low grade fever yesterday,  I went on aspirin and onion juice immediately. Onion juice helps with the lungs. E did the same thing. Aren't waiting until we have to go to ER before dealing with it. E's mom said the stoves are getting the homes too warm and then they walk out into cool damp weahter Weather has been a roller coaster from mid 50s to mid 30s for our highs. We call it pneumonia weather because of it. I am better this morning. Not well but better. I can take deep breaths without coughing or struggling. We \"celebrated\" my birthday by staying home. I added onions, bell pepper, mushrooms, carrots and ground beef to the pasta sauce, made extra sauce as Hubby wants manicotti next (sauce froze now)  and made 2 servings (go me!!!) of spaghetti. Make King Arthur birthday cake , yep that is what it is called. More like a coffee cake but only makes 9 servings so works nice for us.I will probably replace the cocoa line with cinnamon next time. Maybe put the cocoa in the cake batter instead of the \"filling\" batter.We tried a new recipe for our loaf bread. It made two loaves so I wrapped and froze the one.

They haven't put out the name of the gentleman that died yet. I imagine if I went into the village, I would hear who. It took out the pizza shop (no injuries, everyone got out) and the old bar and former village kitchen, neither were doing business any more. Over half of the businesses are closed in this village to begin with. REALLY hard hit. It started in the old bar or the apt above it where he was using propane space heaters to heat with. I did an inventory... made a list of what was missing. Mostly condiments, medical supplies and  weird crap and then released I had it on the list and if it wasn't in stock or was too high in price I didn't transfer it to the next list but tossed it. Went searching for the best prices. Saved 30% on one order not including I got free shipping. Saved 12% on another not including free shipping. We need fresh veggies and some dairy also.Got 20% off the order of the cheese press and ice cream maker (non electric) Got 15% off a still for making essential oils. Something we are having a hard time getting around here that is LOCAL. Got a small one a homesteader recommended that she uses all the time for her essential oils. Electric bill is in. They increased the security light charge from $10 to $11 and distribution went up $3 (thanks to cost of poles, conductors etc went up)  when  A year ago we used 1434 kWh , this year with MORE lights we used 600 kWh. We were a lot under budget. The propane is at 50%. Wood stove is being cranked back up Tuesday night. Summer fill is May 1st. Not sure we could make it to the summer fill but we have already saved 2 tanks of propane with tax it's close to $2000. Tomorrow we are doing all the errands, car tags, bank, pick up a new chainsaw (E has 3 trees that are down that are too small for his usage so offered to Hubby, we just need a bigger chainsaw as a 12 inch blade is too small for that) Menards for odds and ends, Kroger's for fuel and groceries, CVS for meds, chiropractic appts. and stopping to eat as we will be leaving at 9:30 in morning and won't be back until after 7 pm.

{"title": "I DON'T WANT TO !!! DAY ", "date": "Wednesday, January 11, 2023", "text": "It's cold enough the \"rain\" coming in is very small snow that won't make a coating on the grass. Still Hubby insisted that I not be out in any \"moist\" weather with pneumonia going around. I understand the concern since awhile back I had 3 different pneumonias back to back including walking pneumonia through the winter. I was wanting to trim the blackberry and raspberry bushes. He was wanting to burn the asparagus ferns that are dead as we don't salt the ground of the asparagus like the Amish do.Since it's going to be in the 40s and 50s today and tomorrow, we are letting the wood stove go out so I can clean it. It takes 4-6 hrs. to cool down enough for me to scrap the areas that ash and creosote gathers. We don't get much creosote as we use a chemical twice a week the helps prevent that from happening PLUS we have a gauge on the stove that warns us if the stove it dropping heat to that level or too hot. We would have been getting the 3rd winter fill of propane... we are still on the first so that is another savings of $600. So we have broke even with what we have spent on coal for the wood/coal stove... in fact we have part of next year's coal included in that since we picked up more. We would have to go to below 32 for 90 straight days to use the coal up. E told Hubby that he dragged 2-3 trees that are a bit small for his stove up to the equipment shed out of his woods thinking maybe we could use it for night wood. In exchanged Hubby is going after a thirty foot I Beam that E needs as they are expanding the kitchen tomorrow and will be finishing building the new wash aka laundry/ mudroom room in the spring. E told Hubby to NOT split them (like I said) to leave them ROUND as they would burn longer and to only use them at night or if we would be gone the whole day. That will be a cost next year, though E said if Hubby would bring his saw over when they were cutting wood next year he could have some wood for free. We will see as most times when they are cutting, he has hauling jobs.Hubby has found himself snacking if we have a broth soup and asked for more stew like or a milk based soup or sandwiches with the soup instead of just a salad. I did offer a soup, salad and wrap as he eats more tortilla wraps instead of bread or buns.I did finish up the spread sheet for Dec. We came in under budget by $306.50.We have a few more left to come in for Jan. Usually by mid month all the bills are in. We started looking for a replacement for the truck (not work truck).

See another roller coaster of it coming at us. Hauling wood, feeding the stove and hauling more wood. We decided to wait on using coal as it gets warm within a couple days and stays warm. I really don't want to put wood plate in and take wood plate out every couple days as it makes a mess.My brother and I dealt with a mess with a cousin that tried to forcibly move in (along with her boyfriend and son that were just released from prison for gang activity) to the home of another one of our cousins that is disabled. Disabled cousin called Brother , he called the law and his daughter called me. I will give the guys credit, when cousin said no, she was selling her house and moving , the guys walked out and sat on the porch even though they knew they weren't suppose to be around each other.  I dealt with hauling brat butt cousin out of my cousin's home over my shoulder after she tried to hit me and I broke her nose *yes we gave her a rag to hold her nose with *. Cops saw her swing at me.  Parole officers where notified  by cops and had all 3 arrested in violation of their paroles. Found out they were looking for the 3 as they had tried that crap on another cousin and her 3 siblings.  Her older brother showed up and just laughed. He told the cops she must be either high or plain crazy as the family has always brought up about me knocking him out when he was 15 and I was 10 for hitting his stepmom. I totally forgot about that. My parents taught me to defend (and how to fight dirty) the weaker ones. News made the rounds with in 1 day and I don't think any of the other of the family is going to bail her out AGAIN. She was not raised that way at all and not one of her siblings do drugs or drink. I did mention to her parole officer that mental illness runs in the family and he didn't know that but would make sure she was tested for it. Cops mentioned it was nice to see someone younger defending an older person with disabilities. Then didn't understand why we were all laughing. Cousin is a lot younger than me. She was not happy about the comparison LOL. She has brittle bones. I would rather have my heart failure, cerebral palsy and Crohn's than that.Took me 2 days to quit shaking. Adrenaline rush does that to me. I am glad I got to my cousin before they hurt her. I don't think I would have stopped with just a broke nose if she had been hurt. I've been praying over that one.I fixed mushroom wellington (Sam, coffee, money and Thyme) Hubby was glad there was extra filling as he used it with leftover mac and cheese and then I put it in omelets. Was more than filling.Then my cell phone quit working on making calls or incoming calls... of course the company want me to call them so they could back door it GRRRRRR. Son's boss suggested I reset it . His went down a week ago same way. Different providers and types of phone... it worked. Son took him a 6 pack of coke a cola as a thank you. On a the calmer side. I wore the earrings the kids bought me for Mother's day 1989They all got a kick out of it that I still had them. Daughter 2 has the pair I got her when she got her ears pierced in 1992 at the age 13. Hubby and I went through our supplies. California having such sever storms I can only imagine it will affect the supply chain (again, some more , what ever).We are down on condiments that is mustard based and medical supplies. Gelatin... really, I went to the store and couldn't find lime, orange or lemon. Amish bulk store said they only got in strawberry, raspberry and peach (which I got some of). I got it ordered at Amazon. I made sure we had food that would help keep us healthy. I focused on only buying what I can not grow or find amongst the Amish. We decided to replace only some of the garden beds this year unless prices come on down. I want a medical garden on the north side and move the strawberries to the south side.  We will see. I am trimming the raspberry and blackberry vines this week even though that is early. I can see them starting up late Feb with how the temperatures are going. Hubby made enough with the business to not have to take it out of the house budget. It's a worry with work being so slow. Amish have had several deaths... old age with pneumonia. It's been a worry for those of us in our 60s let alone late 70s and early 80s. This type of weather makes it easy to get it. Hubby caught the one elderly man needed to be checked when Hubby took the wife in for pneumonia. They were thinking just a nasty cold or the flu going around. They shut down their school for a week (not something they do) and the school house and out houses got scrubbed down good. We donated Lysol to help with the germs. The teacher is now spraying every night when she leaves. I pray everyone is well and safe.Blessed bePrayers for peace."},

It's usually around 6 inches in February but they were worried it would get warm and stay warm or we would get a lot of snow which makes ice mushy. We ordered more coal thinking it wouldn't be in until Jan. It's in so maybe we will go get it tomorrow when it's 50s and not raining like the rest of the week is to be. Supplier said it went up and another raise is coming in Jan. So instead of the 1 ton we got 2. I checked the budget. Couple areas we were over budget... way over budget and in others we were way below budget. BUT over all we were balanced. We even have more in savings than we did at the end of last year and the IRA's are at the about the same amount also as they were last Dec.  Lots of big ticket items, wood/coal stove and solar well pump. Second order of coal and the on property fuel tank also that we saved for.Next year's big ticket items... gardens beds along with dirt, replace my truck, 4 tons of coal and odds and ends on the porches.

The other 5 agreed it was the best present for me and all got a laugh. She also got us some off grid stuff, travel mugs that we can take out side and a wood rack to put on our porch so her dad won't have to go to the barn to refill as often and to put what is in the barn in the wood rack at the end of the season so we have this year's wood separate from next year's wood.We saw most of the kids by making the loop only going 10 miles out of the way of a 2 hr. trip one way on driving to Daughter 2's to see her son in on leave and having Christmas with him. For the 1st time in years we only saw the daughters. Son 1 is coming up on the 30th when the weather is good and we will see Son 2 on the 2nd though we did drop his gifts off as he was out of town. I got kitty time with my 4 legged grandkids though. I took appetizers made from what I had on hand. The 2 legged grandkids got a kick out of the dollar store regular envelopes I put their Christmas cash in and the advanced birthday cards of the ones in Jan and Feb. Most the evening was answering questions on how much to save, how to save, and being getting back up for the grid going down. One made the comment he would be packing his cats and coming to live with us if bad crap happened, Daughter 4 told him to wait and she would drive pass so he could follow her as she would be heading this way. Hubby told them to plan on living in the barn since only 1 of them has a home over 1200 sq ft, they could do that as the barn is over 8000 square feet. As we were leaving they yelled see you in March, that's when the next round of birthday cards would be. All of them asked about how much to save for retirement about half of them are self employed and know not to count on Social Security to support them.We came home a different way (10 miles shorter LOL) and saw more Christmas lights.  I cut the Christmas eve prime rib so we had some Christmas eve, put the rest in the freezer  so can roast the rest on the 30th for Son 1 instead of buying another roast. Actually it was better as I have only enough leftovers for 2 small Philly steak subs and a pizza for the two of us. I checked all automatic payments making sure they had the correct information and would continue as automatic. Son 2 had 2 stop last year because he didn't confirm his info. Was a mess I donated to the food pantry in memory of Mother, Salvation Army in memory of Pop as they raised him when he was put on the street at age 12 by his parents and Seed Savers in memory of Daddy as he was always a gardener until his late 80s.We ate appetizers made from what I had on hand for two meals.I baked 2 loaves of bread. First loaf was used for bread on Christmas eve along with croutons for the salad. Then into bread pudding. Half of the second one was  French toast (got free eggs from M).I transferred $2.96 cash back to the card and then took the same amount and put it in savings. During the 35 to 50 below wind chill temperatures I closed off the two lofts and the basement. Kept curtains closed, only turned on Christmas lights on Christmas eve and day to help with power grid . We didn't lose power thankfully. Still needed to turn the furnace on to 65 even with wood stove to keep the south end of the house from freezing pipes. Found one window that allowed snow through it and then had ice on the inside. I covered it with an old towel. Will be researching windows for sure. Hubby checked the propane tank level as we turned the furnace back down to 55. We are at 59 % so we only used 2% during the week of sub zero. Not bad at all as the last time we had that type of weather we used 15% . I used the wood stove to cook and bake instead of using the propane cook stove. We are sitting down today and talking of goals/plans for the next year. We do know we are decluttering/downsizing. Blessed bePrayers for peaceBe safe and healthy (as I cough my lungs up LOL)"},

Means we can be arrested if on the roads without reporting to essential work or going home from essential work. Personally with it a negative 31in temp and gusts over 50 mph... we are NOT going out. Got 1 kid without heat, furnace went out. or water pipes froze, she forgot to let them drip when she lost heat. They got space heaters and bought water as they can't get anyone to fix it until Jan. She's planning on the pipes being busted so turned the main water off. She rents so notified her landlord what happened and he brought her some water and a space heater he had.Another kid had their car go down while going after one of their kids' whose car went down. Son 1 will not be up due to weather. He is coming up next weekend when it's suppose to be in the 50s (pneumonia weather).We might not be going Christmas day to drop off Christmas and to daughter 2's to see grandson in from deployment, he thinks he is being sent back to Italy which he loves. That sucks we might not see him but we went through the same thing with son2, so even though it tugs the heart, we know we need to stay safe and a 2 hr. drive one way might not be safe as the wind is still causing white outs and drifts not to speak of windchills if you break down.E came over and checked the thickness of the pond. The kids want to skate on it and he wants to go ahead and cut ice for the ice house as he is worried about it staying warm after this. Normally it would be 2 1/2 to 3 inches . He won't let kids on it unless it's at least 4 inches. It's 6 and will be closer to 7 on Monday when they skate on it. Tuesday he will be cutting ice. Even though it's Christmas eve, the day runs the same, feed the stove, feed dog, feed stove, do laundry and hang on drying rack, feed stove, feed us with a couple drag dog out on leash to potty as she won't just go out. She did get Hubby through the night to do business...on the steps to the porch but at least she was out. Prayers everyone is safe and warm.Blessed beMerry Christmas, Happy Yule, Happy Holidays.Prayers for peace"},

Hubby picked up $11 gas station pizza one night.I cashed in my pinecone and swag bucks for gift cards. Matched amount went to savings.I used Menards rebate to pay for a couple items Hubby needed for the solar pump. Matched amount went to savingsHubby used a TSC rewards, matched amount to go to savingsI used 4 coupons at Kroger's and 10 cents off gas... matched amount when to savingsI bought thrift bakery buns (amount difference compared to Walmart went to savings) and used the condiments we had at home for the HAM radio group dinner. There was no horseradish cream to come home. We are using the Christmas lights as our lighting in the mornings while we drink our coffee and talk over the day and oil lamps if needed. Hubby uses a task light at his computer and I use one when reading.I found a total of $1.20 in coins that is in the coin jar I paid off the last of the school taxes that were not due until Feb.I went back through our subscriptions, if it's not saving us the amount it is costing us it got cancelled. I will not renew one and the other 4 will be continued.I am using the clothes line to freeze dry and/or the drying rack for laundryAll the bills that came in that was lower than budgeted amount... the \"extra\" $$ got transferred to local savings so if they come in higher during winter the money is sitting there but making us some money while doing so.I broke even on my IRAs. I earned the same amount I lost.Hubby made money at the shock of our finance group when most were losing 10-18%. We are hoping this coming year things settle down.I figured out that we could use 22 bags of coal a week to equal what we would spend on propane. Our coal provider let us know that with what is coming in we would use 4 bags a day and he isn't getting the next load of coal until Jan so we went back to wood which mainly is FREE. It's just we do have to feed it during the night and load it like night time if gone over 2 hrs. I just turned the furnace up to 62 so if the stove goes out, Charlotte will still have decent heat along with the plumbing.Today we are going to doctor's appt. Since I am not going to run around in horrible weather I combined stopping at dentist office to drop off info, drop Christmas cards at post office, getting dog tags, doc appt., picking up prime rib on way back as we pass the butcher shop (it's 10 miles outside of town), getting the last of the groceries and milk that I will be out of today for holidays , Hubby will get diesel while I am getting groceries and then hopefully my meds will be in for me to pick up.Hubby ran (since Amish don't have phones) his business errands this morning to confirm what jobs he was doing this week since he will not haul during the bad weather. He was able to shift some things around and one of the Amish won't be ready for him to pick up a load anyways due to flu hitting the family. He wasn't even willing to open door to talk so not to pass it. I had enough in local bank savings to move to our \"savings\" bank that has better interest (negative is it takes a week to move it from one acct back to checking acct. but that definitely makes us think if we want to go through that or not).We have a money market 3 % interest set up for medical. We now have 50% there *25%  is in another savings as we will be paying co-pays again Jan 1st .SO only need to save another 25% and then start saving for 2024 on Medicare.We have a 12 month CD 4.15% interest (no minimum to open)We have a 11 month no penalty 3.5% interest (no minimum to open)   It's been a long time that my savings didn't out earn CD's or I had to have a large amount to open one.I set up monthly spread sheets to track outflow and income. I set a separate one for savings . Hubby is now listing what category on receipts so I know what it is for besides how he paid for it.Daughter 1 is doing better since surgery on her wrist. Back to work as floor  manager of Walmart. Her family is fine, all 5 kids working, and grandkids are starting to come along at a steady rate LOLDaughter 2 changed jobs after 19 yrs would have been 20 in March. Server and bartender... She is now custodian at a local school with solid 40 hrs. a week, benefits and retirement. She is working Saturdays at the old job and willing to be on call for fill in on weekends. Things seem to have settled down some with the job change. All her kids are working, one in Army is to be home this week and she is expecting another grandchild.Daughter 3 is working steady, has her 2nd child getting ready to move out on their own (I've gotten lots of texts of her struggling to deal with the child being old enough even though the kid is a nurse working full time) The other kids are doing well.Daughter 4 got her cost estimate for her surgery as it's pre existing she has to pay a chunk of it. Thinks she will have enough before her doctor tells her it is a must for surgery. Son 1 is working and doing fine, said he is just dating around. Son 2 is still celebrating retiring from Army. Loves his job at Air Force (civilian)  and is doing well in his relationship with his lady as her focus is raising her 13 yr old and he is fine with that. It's nice to know going into the holiday that drama and health is good. We will probably all come down with some bug or another after Christmas which seems to be the norm after 50 yrs (Lord the oldest is 50 LOL)Blessed bePrayers for peace"},
{"title": "SIGH this is why", "date": "Monday, December 19, 2022", "text": "I get frustrated with HubbyThis is how the coal fire looked when I went to run errandsnice lovely fire, not full but a good amount .One hour later what did I come back to???I grew up with coal stoves and I told Hubby to not load over the full line and not load a lot at one time think of thin layers. Coal burns from the bottom up so there has to be air coming up through the bottom. To NOT poke or stir up like you would wood..He closed the air off to the coal, then added 40 lbs. (way too much at one time) and then stirred it thinking (not thinking to me) it would help it. THEN he moved the shakers (the vents in bottom) to the point he had a ash tray full of hot coals and the shaker (what controls the vents) stuck open with lumps of hot coal so nothing was staying in the fire box and he couldn't get the ash tray out with the hot coals being bigger than the door way of where the ash tray is. He did say he was sorry he complained I bought 3 buckets for the stove as he used all 3 and the ash tray after he got the coals out of it. He didn't know what he would have used to carry hot coals out. I suggested the bottom of the fire pit that is on wheels and could be rolled in and rolled out and not burn the wood floor if he didn't have buckets (that he made sure was on the fire protector on the floor).SIGHAFTER spending 2 hours cleaning up the mess as there was dust everywhere and reloading coal from those buckets as I'm not throwing coal away and getting it going, he went to run his own errands. Saw one of the Amish that burns coal and said something to them about what he did. They asked if he ever burned coal before, nope just wood in fireplace. Asked if I did. Yep  and I had said blah blah blah.... The guy asked why he didn't listen to me . Hubby said he thought he knew it all since he was a guy. Just FYI he really isn't that way most times. But it gave the Amish a laugh and was advised the same thing I had told him AGAIN and don't need to add fuel every hour either as coal is not like wood at all. He still struggles on not loading it every hour or two (coal can burn 10-12 hrs.)usually around 3- 4 hrs.  is good to load, you don't want it on the low side and you still don't want to dump a lot on it as you will smother it."},
{"title": "Planning for 2023.", "date": "Sunday, December 11, 2022", "text": "Planning to declutter and organize the house, garden shed , barn and property. WITHOUT paying extra to get rid of it. Tempting to hire it done just to not deal with it ????We kept a lot of stuff, everything from cabinets to dishes to to tools to crafts and to what ever through the years . I have Daddy's, Mother's, Pop's, late Husband's, Hubby's grandfather's, and things from all 6 kids and a few things from the grandkids that their mother's passed to them that they don't want now either.TIME TO GO.Son2 is doing happy dance over that plan as he is in charge of our estate and us if we need care. EVEN though we have put in the will to have an auction (noted for him to go to E as E's dad deals with the auctions for the Amish).He would rather see it gone before we get to that stage of old age or die and stick him with it. At least he no longer threatening to just burn it down.I found on This Old House an idea of knee wall dresser. Knee wall( Hubby calls them half walls) is a wall that comes up to about your hip and then goes into an A frame or like ceiling. There was a built in book case also. Both thoughts would help in the loft bedrooms. I can't even put all my bedroom furniture in my bedroom but the dresser is too tall for the knee wall loft bedrooms.In the old homestead I had a cabinet that was my baking center. That cabinet is now in barn surrounded by other stuff and not being used. BOY do I miss it when I have to hunt for what I want as my baking stuff is now in 4 places.I decided we had to have a list and broke it down to 40 areas ( I multiplied it by 3 for 120 as it's 3 parts to the whole) and a plan of when to get it done as we decide to declutter, organize (what will make it easier to take care of also) and clean. Hubby's first thought was how to get rid of it. April our township has a clean up day and we can take \"trash, non hazard stuff, to the township hall and they will haul it for FREE. Our trash company takes 6 kitchen bags a week. Our usual is 1 a week so that's 5 more bags that can be gotten rid of without extra charges.We have a Habitat Restore in 3 place near us, 1 Salvation Army store, 3 Goodwill and 1 Fish thrift shop and several churches also taking donations.My thoughts went to time to get it done.IF I started now (even though we said we would do nothing until Jan 2nd) and did 8 to be done by the beginning of April for the township clean up day.If I start Jan 2nd I have to do 10 IF I start Jan 2nd and focus on doing 1 area and do all 3 parts in 1 wk. I would be done Sept 30.  Which means we would be storing some things that can't be ran through regular trash until the next April or we would be paying to have it hauled. Cardboard boxes (not used to cart stuff to thrift shops) and paper items can be burned in burn barrel. Bubble wrap goes to the one thrift store along with extra plastic bags that the Amish don't take during the winter months. Amish use them for their veggie market stands. Couple grandkids said to not get rid of any kitchen stuff as they plan on going out on their own next summer. I am okay with holding stuff like that. We are flipping it back and forth how to do it but by Dec 31st the choice will be made. Blessed BePrayers for peace"},

Son2 bought me a dozen mixes even though he knew I had yellow and white cornmeal because he was thinking of his Grandpa. He also has always used Jiffy as it makes only 6 muffins which is enough for him. He also uses Daddy's bean soup recipe using smoked hocks instead of ham. He has a butcher shop around the block from him so he can get them pretty easy. We had baked oatmeal with apples I had kept from canning.We had pork chops (from E) sweet potatoes and green beans we grew. I made custard pie (eggs were from M) and will put raspberry pie filling on top of it. Had to buy that we didn't grow enough last year. So far the only thing we have bought at the store is milk twice.Hubby had bought powdered buttermilk at an Amish store a couple months ago (he used it when he was single parent) that I have been premixing and let sit until thickened to use in the Irish soda bread I make as it's just flour, salt, soda and buttermilk. Sometimes I  add dried raisins or cranberries to it. Saves the yeast plus if I float between different types of bread, it gets ate before it gets bad. I like bread pudding but not with store bought white bread.We got the electric bill, it's $75 LOWER than this time last year even though we have had the Christmas lights on when usually we don't turn them on until Dec 1st to be on only one month's bill. Part is it's a bit warmer but I know that our furnace fan costs us $50 a month as I have ran it full time instead of automatically to help hold the heat steady. The wood burner has a non electric fan that is run by the heat coming off the top. Even the lofts which has always been below 50 degrees fall- early spring is at 72. E says it won't be that warm once the below freezing weather comes in and stays.At this time last year we had our second propane fill and we are at 65%. Hubby considers that a savings of $550 as that what it would have cost to fill the tankI boiled eggs, made frittata, custard pie and fried eggs for meals as the eggs are free from M. We focused on eating the menu we made. We had 7 off the menu along with 3 of them repeats as leftovers and bfast twice for our lunches /suppers. We had lunch out once when out with appts and errands. Got 2 sandwiches and split the French fries and drank the water we took with us.  Blessed bePrayers for peace"},
{"title": "weird", "date": "Thursday, December 8, 2022", "text": "It feels weird to not be figuring out how to get the canning done or what needs canned first LOL. I did get most the Christmas cards ready to go out tomorrow, I have 5 that I want to include letter in.Hubby spent the day working on the solar pump for the deep water well. He got the hand pump attached which is the most labor but still needs to install the solar panels and the batteries. Thought it was kind of funny the morning before he started on it we lost power and my first comment was I have no water to do laundry. I have water for 3 days for regular uses but that wasn't the point when the solar pump had been on site for a month. He immediately went to install it. Did not think it would take more than a couple hours to do it completely but if necessary he can hand pump water. I grew up doing that at my grandfather's and aunts... 860 pumps with a hand pump for a wringer washer and rinse pan.  (UPDATE) he found it was going to be harder to install solar panels as he thought they went one way narrow side as side and longer side as height and it was the reverse. E is going to help him install them after he braces the walls they will hang on the pump house.) AND the electric went out 6 hrs... not big deal as I had already pulled water for the morning and just put off laundry until the next day.We are changing the times we eat since Hubby is not hauling as much (slow season) plus he needs a snack around 7 pm or he munches through way too much (1/2 gallon of caramel popcorn that was suppose to be for me and I got none of it). I made the mistake of suggesting cheese and crackers... he ate a pound of each SIGH.... and he realized that wasn't good when the next day Doc was on him for gaining 6  lbs. in 3 months when it took him 9 months to lose it to begin with. I eat at 10 and 2 and eat light meals or snacks and dinner (supper) was at 5. Hubby wants to eat dinner/supper at 4 to 4:30 and have a snack at 7 as he is usually asleep by 8:30. I think the oatmeal bars I used to make for the kids' breakfast would be a good snack for him at night. Since he told Doc he was getting hungry a couple hours after eating supper. I just have to make sure he doesn't munch through them like he did the caramel popcorn. He drinks over 1 gallon of water a day not including his 20 ounces of coffee or 20 ounces of dandelion tea (for his gout). We went and got fuel additive for the generators , lawn mowers , tractor and both trucks. When it clicked none of that was written in the budget... nor was the fuel for the tractor, lawnmowers or generators... SIGH. Nor was the grandkids moving out on their own money that we give them. Back to redoing that budget.We haven't had sunshine for almost a week. Drizzle , foggy  and dreary.The sun came out but the wind was above 25 mph. Charlotte doesn't like wind in her ears but wanted the sunshine. Kept going out , getting in her chair and then coming right back in . So I moved the dog bed into the sunshine  I spent the day , moving the bed with her on it to keep her in the sunshine. Hubby just laughed. Hope you are well and safeBlessed be Prayers for peace"},

I've checked on him a couple times. He is doing fine just very slow going. The guy in charge of the Christmas dinner for the HAM radio group sent Hubby an update of what is coming so far. He is bringing a ham (wants us to bring bread and buns for it). Someone is bringing lasagna for those tired of ham. Sounds like some sort of salad is coming. Hubby is going to pull the list up when he is done for the day . It's a small group of about 30 with families included(that is less than us with the kids and their families). The other ham radio group Hubby used to be in was closer to 50-60 people with families included.We are bouncing some thoughts on goals for next year around also.I am heading for a nap as I just took the meds for the RSV and now I want to sleep LOL"},

We don't count savings as we always will want more there.We went over the punch list... over 1000 when we bought this house four years ago. Was at 188 Jan 1st 2022. Been averaging 37 done each year. BUT we changed which way we were going and really cranked through some of the smaller items and it's down to 56 and that includes windows and siding to be done in a couple years down the road. We spent Thanksgiving at home with just the two of us. The only left overs was the pumpkin roll and the turkey. Turkey is being frozen and broth is being made with the bones. SIGH. I really don't need broth but I just can throw it out, seems so wasteful when I know not \"simmering\" the carcass doesn't get all the meat off the bones. We were going to go to Walmart to replace a couple outdoor pots but I got up coughing my lungs up at 3:30 this morning so I am home.

I will pick up some baking potatoes (ours didn't grow big enough) salad and shrimp for shrimp cocktail ( I use leftover shrimp for shrimp scampi).

I will make a cranberry custard pie for sure but not sure what else as I told Hubby to tell the guy in charge we would bring what he needed after he finds out what everyone else is bringing. One year it was salt and pepper and butter.We wrote out menu thoughts. We have 3-4 days we will eat else where.Christmas eve we will have prime rib, Christmas appetizers.

First time she's went anywhere near the stove. Wednesday, we turned the furnace on and let the wood stove go out. Mornings have been in the low 40s and high's in the 50s. No sense burning the wood and opening doors and windows to cool the house down. Next Wednesday night we will most likely fire up the wood stove and turn off the furnace if the forecast says the same as now.We had Thanksgiving for 2. Two of the daughters had to work and their kids went to their dad's side, and the other 4 kids went to their other side. Which is why we used to have the family Thanksgiving dinner the Sunday before the holiday until kids said to quit as it was becoming too much for them. Since it was at our home , we quit, didn't have to say something twice especially when it came from 2 of them that NEVER agree on anything. Now they are dealing with their kids \"other sides\" and grandkids and wonder how we got it done. Daughter 2 has Christmas night as that's when her son3 comes home from deployment. Not all will make it then either.We have decorated for holidays. I made a cross out of plastic hangers and outlined it with lights for our new decoration for this year and Hubby hung it on the house. I try to add something every year. We love it that the cross shows right through the light tree.I ordered the prime rib roast for Christmas eve (Son 1 will be here). I got a discount for ordering this month. This is the only thing Hubby ever asks to have for holidays. His grandma on his Dad's side always served it when it was her turn to have Christmas eve dinner.Hubby's business has not been doing much this week. So he used the time to cut more wood and do a couple small repair jobs he's had on his to do list forever. There has been several deaths in many of the families that require them to go out of state. Rough as it is since they automatically bury on the 3rd day of the death. With the weather being decent, I have washed the Christmas table linen and odds and ends and hung them on the yard clothes line to dry. Don't usually get that all done in one day since I usually have to use the drying rack at this time of year. It was really nice to have that completely done.We are going down to Son2's tomorrow for lunch. I am ready for a mini break LOL"},

Hubby asked why I didn't run the water first. Because then the dishwasher is pulling the cold water instead of me running twice as much in the sink to get hot water to wash the dishes.Hubby stopped at Save A Lot and got sausage. They were having a sale buy 2 for $6 of their brand which is 16 oz.  A friend checked at Kroger's and they only had mild in their brand of sausage for $2.99. The only spicy/hot sausage was from $3.49 to $5.49 and a few were only 12 oz not 16. I told Hubby get a dozen, meaning total of both together. He got a dozen of each. Guess that is okay at that means we eat sausage twice a month and I have a couple new casseroles that calls for sausage. He also picked up Save A Lot's brand of thick sliced bacon .  I have plenty of bacon in the freezer but he wanted to see if he liked this brand as I usually buy Wright Brand thick sliced bacon and only buy it when it's on sale.  Maybe we will have it this weekend. It is priced what I would buy the other bacon for. We had a wood handle break on the wood stove. E's dad is going to fix it for us as he's known for that type of repairs. We were heading over to where he was at anyways as they were sitting up for an auction... lots of things I would have bought years ago... now it's just pretty to see but not have to deal with taking care of it. Hubby scheduled the winter tune up for the lawn mower, saving 10 % on parts  and reduced labor price for doing it now.

Top darker than we like but it was not burnt and was soft.  I will definitely be watching the whole wheat or speltz or rye. E said it looked good as M had burnt the top of 4 loaves that day. I was supposed to bake it to internal  temp of 210 degrees and I pulled it at 205. My other recipe it's supposed to be 190.  Charlotte needed her shots and nails clipped. Doc suggested that since she is 5 that we look at getting a pup to keep her active. I will look at that in the spring. I am not into house breaking during the winter. We had talked about a pup since the boys died.  Since we were in Sidney we went to Kroger's (we don't have one). SAVINGS!!! Kroger's had a coupon for their turkey to be 49 cents/ lb. (got 21 lbs.). if you bought $25. I added, another turkey that was 69 cents/lb. (got 20 lbs. ), dairy and a pork loin that was half price to cut into pork chops ( 9 meals now in freezer). I didn't realize I still had another coupon $4 off meat on my Kroger's card so instead of the $100 after coupons and sales that I was aiming for for fuel points. I had $98 and change SIGH but I saved $49 !!!! I can always get dairy next week after our appts. to make the fuel points.Then after we got home and I was prepping meals. (Yes the two turkeys are thawing for me to can) I sliced up the pepperoni I bought last week. Nine meals(pizza or subs or with cheese and crackers) of sliced pepperoni and 6 of diced...to go with sausage for pizzas, calzones, and pasta casseroles. I went to the freezer to get the sausage to cook it today and found I was down to just what I needed for the pizzas. I could have got more at Kroger's and had the fuel points. MOAN GROAN.. worse was I didn't realize we were down that low. Checked the pantry inventory and yes that is all there is as I was hoping it was in another freezer. Hubby is stopping tonight after hauling as he will be refueling right around the corner from Save a Lot to see if they have sausage. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. If they don't, I will put it on the list for next week.We were gone 5 hrs. Wood stove had just barely dropped to creosote stage. House was 72 degrees. Hubby had put less wood than I would have. But he did say he might put a \"nighttime\" piece of wood with the rest the next time.Hubby said he is no longer leaving a night light on in the front room as the firelight shows right where he walks to go to the bathroom. Our security light out back lights up his bathroom. Works for me"},
{"title": "How we saved Money we didn't think about", "date": "Monday, November 14, 2022", "text": "First, a pretty early afternoon with Charlotte. I am glad I moved my head back before that tongue came out LOL.The laundry is on the line, dishwasher has ran, the empty jars are waiting to be taken to the basement and put in boxes for storage. I will have to move things around in the barn to store the empty jars as that it starting to cause some clutter in the basement.We were coming home from a funeral and got a phone call to deliver a message to an Amish... worked out great as we were going to be driving right by his house ( so no driving 10 miles , yes he gets paid for messages)but we knew he was at a wedding and wouldn't be home. Hubby wrote a note and I had him put it in the freezer bag we keep in the truck (Amish get car sick and that's what they use for that so it can be gotten rid of nicely) and he used a clothes pin to attach it to their clothes line in front of the front door. W said it was nice as she saw it before she got up on the porch at 2 am. The one boy wrote on the bag he saw it but left it there for Dad. LOLI cooked taco soup on the stove with cornbread muffins... we ate it twice with the second time with rice that came from the microwave. So no propane used for that meal. Today Hubby went to add softener salt  and checked the filters to the furnace and the cold air vent... HUM guess we won't be using as many filters either as none of them needed changed. We are guessing that will be cut in half so that's a savings of $125 a year. Something we hadn't thought about.We are keeping track of what we save so we know when the \"savings\" paid for the stove and chimney. Since the wood stove oven is holding pretty much at 350 (thermometer on door) I will be baking the bread in it. Part of the bread dough will go for a deep dish pizza that my Nonna used to make .The pumpkin apple soup is simmering on the stove. Hubby isn't much into soups but liked that there was soup on the stove so he can eat it any time instead of looking at snacks as he is trying to lose weight.  I have ground pork patties to go on the grill and a huge sweet potato that will be baked in the oven also plus green beans that can be heated in the small pot on the stove... no propane for the meal again.We also realized that the electric bill will not go as high as the furnace doesn't come (set at 50) on so the fan is not running. I know last winter the electric was up $50 due to the furnace fan running as a circulation fan to keep the house more level in heat. We turned off the ceiling fan and the rotating fan in the front room as I got the stove to be steady and not run us out. Hubby still struggles a bit to NOT throw several pieces of wood on at a time. Sunday being a day of rest I had him watch me take care of the stove. He said this morning it was great as he didn't have to add any  wood from 10 pm to 4 am when he as up anyways. Large hard wood is good for night time . I also told him to think about what wood he is putting in the stove. Soft wood (like cotton wood) burns fast but oak, hard maple will last longer and you use less wood. You can tell what is soft wood vs hard wood as hard wood is heavy and soft wood is light weight. He picked up some wood the other day (we only paid $70 for 4 cords (4x4x8 is a cord of wood) of wood and $40 of it was for E's 4 sons that helped unload on the one trailer). He put the word out he was willing to take scraps and slab and they almost over ran him. One asked if he could haul wood to their mother( just widowed) in exchanged he would reload the trailer with the scrap from cutting her wood. He would have hauled it for free but it worked.E asked if we could figure out how to put a phone out in our barn as the other neighbor is getting rid of her landline even after he offered to pay for it as he knows since her husband died she had to cut costs and a half of dozen Amish were using it. She was charging them 75 cents a phone call. Since it's not adding any costs to us to have it, we put the extra phone and charger in the barn in a metal file cabinet to keep mice from messing with it with note paper and pencil and taped the number to the top incase they needed to leave a call back number. Added a metal lawn chair and a light on the wall in case they don't have their flash light. We just put a donation bowl in the drawer as we really didn't want anything since it wasn't costing us... I think we repeated that a lot. It actually is better for them to have it in our barn as they park the buggies and horse at E's sawmill. They aren't parked along side of the road like they were with the other neighbor. Plus E's youngest brother thanked us as he can bring the kids with him and let them play at the barn or sit in the buggy as he is way off the road . E made it clear everyone was to park their buggies at his sawmill so we aren't dealing with manure. We told our kids we were on a phone party line with the Amish. They thought it was funny. I can add, it's been busy as \"donations\" have paid for 1/3rd of the bill and it's been only a week. H said doctor appts, confirming feed deliveries and business calls will be the majority. Death in the family if needed. Hubby gets some of those on his cell phone anyways. I ordered some specialty flours and used a code that was for that day only that I just happened to run across. Hubby told me to use the savings to order the extra's I would like to have.  I noticed he tires quickly of the same bread on the table. I started paying attention to what type he buys (not white sliced) as I just tell him to get some bread and don't specify. He is more of ciabatta, French and Italian and some rustic. He likes tortillas and sometimes flat bread or pitas. I like Irish soda, pumpernickel, rye and rustic. We both like oat breads. I think we should try potato bread.I found a penny then a dime and then a dollar bill. Hubby brought home a pie, one of the Amish ladies gave it to him for helping her get the milk cow back in the pasture and off the road as she was home alone. He was going down the road to another Amish when he saw the cow and her. M sent over a pan of caramel cinnamon rolls after I shooed their colt back over into the pasture.  He had rolled under the barb wire when he was sleeping. His Momma wasn't too happy with him but she was waiting for him at our gate so it was easy to get him back to where he belongs... unlike the one last month that was across the road into the corn field kicking up his heels. E is slowly (because there is a supply issue) changing the barb wire to solid metal pipe. Horses are rough on wire and they lean across it to eat on the other side.Blessed Be everyone Prayers for peace."},
{"title": "Text from Son2 and wood stove", "date": "Saturday, November 12, 2022", "text": "I got the text..WE DID IT....I first thought he went and got married to his lady ( no they are not engaged) because he has always said when he got married he would call me and say \" Listen Mom I DO\". Nope, but this is definitely a WE DID ITWe are proud of him because there were times he thought about giving it up, sucked it up and continued on. He thanked us for the 21 years of taking care of his finances, home, and cats while he was away on duty.  Now he is a civilian working for the Air Force... looking to work there 20 years . It has turned cold, highs in 30-40s and lows in low 20s. SO the wood stove is on3 doors and 5 windows were open trying to keep the heat in the front room below 80 and the bedroom on the opposite side of the house from 75.That with the stove temp being right in middle of the sweet spot to stay out of creosote and not to hot to cause damage...  E said something about Welcome to Amish world. LOLI got it figured out this morning. Only 2 windows edged up an inch and doors are closed. Front room is 73 and bedroom is 72... the dining room, always the warmest is 75. What did I change?We never had heated the lofts... I opened the door to the staircase for north/soft lofts and took the curtain out of the stairway of the east/west lofts. I turned the ceiling fan in the front room OFF. Lofts that are usually in mid 50s to 60 are now 70. The house is pretty much the same temp through out (front room has always been 5 to 10 degrees cooler than bedroom which is closest to the first furnace vent)Since the wood stove was on, I had decided on spaghetti with meat/veggie sauce and cheddar bay biscuits. Turned out to be easy... need to doing prepping all at once and then take to stove. Since the stove is in the front room and the kitchen is over 30 ft away.Need to open the oven \"valve\" sooner as it took almost 20 minutes to get up to 450 and it border lined being too hot for the stove to run. BUT I didn't burn the bottoms or sides as I had used my temperature gun to check for hot spots before I put them in. I did not boil the spaghetti there. I was not going to carry boiling water 30 ft to a sink to drain it. I did order a roll cart for those issues. We have solid wood floors so no carpet to try to roll the cart across.We did run into an issue of Hubby pulling wood from the wood wagon on porch instead of the wood box beside stove so when the wood box became empty after me stoking the fire all day... there was no wood in the wagon. and of course he had left for the day. He also didn't check where the fire was in the stove before leaving (before I got up) and it was in creosote level when I got up about 3o minutes after he left and almost completely out.  We' ll work it out but I really didn't think we had to have the rule if you empty the wagon, you refill it immediately ,not later"},

M also has Sunday clothes (black) hanging on the porch. She doesn't hang black clothes in sunlight as it fades the color.Yep, it keeps going  There is about 20 ft before it actually stops. I just couldn't it in the photo. E said it's 250 ft from the porch corner to the top of the maple tree he hooked it to. I can tell you she has several lines up in the house, Dawdy house and basement. Family of 12 and washes every day except Sunday. She has 4 wringer washers, uses 2 for wash and 2 for rinse. Runs them with Honda motors. She has a small wood cook stove in that room (calls it the wash room) that has water reservoir to heat her water. Uses that stove to bake her bread so she's doing more than one thing at a time and not wasting fuel. Has done canning and cooking a meal at the same time. Talk about multi tasking.Daughter's 4 biological grandpa died. We all will miss him but thankful God took him home as he has fought heart issues for 20 yrs and diabetes for 15. He was in so much pain and tired all the time. He served 21 years in Air Force and is being buried today on Veterans Day. We saw several old friends there that said they were going to come out and see our home... we both doubt that but it was nice for them to say so. Good newsE is coming over this morning to help Hubby get started installing the solar well pump. This is the last of the \"grid down\" stuff unless we decide to add solar for electric later. We have talked about it. Our electric company offers help on deciding on that.We are STOCKED. I have 2 turkeys in freezer to can, and the kraut to can BUT WE ARE STOCKED. Dairy and a few fresh salad items.... every other week shopping. Probably will pick up odds and ends on medical side. I just stocked vitamins and toothpaste. Hubby said his scissors and forceps is missing from his First aid kit he carries. He thinks he left them on the trailer when he bandaged one of the Amish. He laid them on top of everything. I keep mine on the bottom as they are the least used. We decided we would MAYBE pick up G & R bologna if we ever go over to get a sandwich. It's right down from his parents but he is not visiting his parents as they have been sick. Texts daily, couple calls to make sure, checks with his one brother whose sons check daily as they go right pass the home when getting off work. Said they are not going in as they are not sure  what it was but they both had doctor appts. Doctor thinks stomach bug (I had it for a week and then took another week to recover).We are done for this year on punch list. We will start back up next spring to continue on...it's nice to take the break and look to see if we still want to change things like we thought when we bought the house.We are a bit over budget.... due to $1800 in medical for Hubby over his gout. That won't be an issue next year as I will have the FULL out of pocket in savings by Jan 1st. I already have a CD that will pay for the propane, might have to add to it but we will know in the spring how much the wood stove will save us. Those are the two biggest issues we deal with. I will start saving for another car/truck since we know ours is dying due to rusted frame. I really hope we get some decent rain. Pond is getting really low . I am also hoping for a good snow fall this winter. Snow provides the water for our wells as it feeds the underground streams etc. Plus gardens do better when we have decent snow.Blessed be Prayers for peaceStay safe and well"},
{"title": "Planning frugal.", "date": "Monday, November 7, 2022", "text": "Winds over 30 mph with gusts 50 to 60 mph... Most of the trees lost their leaves. We had very little raking as what stayed in the yard was in the basement ramp. Hubby raked them into the tarp and hauled it to the hay field that E is disking this week. Hubby took the leaves what he had from along the gates to go in the compost pile and then turned the compost pile. JUST FYI, this is where the roof was I prop my feet on. Hubby is cutting more free wood. One of the Amish brought over a 1/2 of a cord of scrap wood that needed cut up. Couldn't find anyone to take it and he burns coal. Hubby took it.  He had told several of the Amish he sees regularly that he would take scrap wood and they had passed the message along at church.The propane furnace is on, right now it's way too warm (high 60s to mid 70s) so we have the furnace on 68 during the night and turn it off in the morning Nights are low 50s if not 40s. About another week and we will have the wood/coal stove running again as the high 40s and lows in the thirties which is normal for us is returning. We will turn the furnace down to 50 when we fire up the stove again.I canned 11 pints of tomato juice finishing the last of the tomatoes.  I want to can the kraut  in the crock and some turkey if I find it cheap enough.We rewrote our to do list for this month. Keeps us on task with essentials. I added Christmas decorations as I know that takes about a week between in home and outside. Hubby found an old tomato wire cage he thought he got rid of in the barn and brought it to me so I can turn it upside down and wrap the green LED rope lights I got on clearance around it to make a \"Christmas tree\" for the porch or deck. I also have a cardboard Santa that Mother hung on the staircase door that he found a sheet of paneling that I can attach him to. My Santa is not in good shape but I am not tossing him away yet.I ordered through The Prudent Homemaker's site (Brandy's) toothpaste at Amazon. I was down to 2 tubes. I checked 3 stores here and they didn't have what I use. I can't use colored toothpaste. You would think white would be easy to get for sensitive teeth. But not here.Hubby has pretty much wore his work pants to threads. He kept checking TSC which where he gets his work pants. They were wanting over $20 a pair and didn't have his size.  I found carpenter jeans at Rural King in his size for less than $12/ each so I ordered them on my CC that is cash back. Even with shipping it's less than TSC.E's Mom B gave us a large white sweet potato she had grew. Said her vines were great but the potatoes were on the little side and not very many  of them. But since I took over baby butternut squash (theirs rotted) she was happy to give us this.I ordered gaskets for my small pressure canner. I noticed when finishing the tomatoes it was dripping a little at the lid. Had family tell me their friend tossed a canner and bought a new one. They pulled it back out of the trash can, cleaned it and bought new gaskets since I said something about you could buy gaskets and get the canner checked by the local extension office.  I ordered a rubber leg for the grate on my gas cook stove.  A friend has the same stove, mentioned her rubber leg also fell off and she couldn't find it. Ordered a whole new grate... I asked why... thinking there was something wrong with the cast iron grate... nope, she didn't think to check to see if she could order just the rubber leg. SIGH. The \"English\" (that's what the Amish call us) neighbor on the other side of E is now a widow. Since she is losing part of her income, (she's get her Husband Social Security and hers will end as his was the larger check). She is cutting expenses. Usually the Amish make phone calls from her house as her husband had a landline phone in the garage. E said he offered to pay the whole bill including her internet etc. She orders stuff for them off and on also. But she said no, she can get what internet she wants on her cell phone. He mentioned it to us. We had already thought of putting a phone booth HA HA in for the Amish but since her husband and her were already set up we didn't do anything. We now have a phone in the last stall of the barn. E told everyone to park by his saw mill to keep the horses from coming up the driveway so Hubby doesn't have to deal with buggy and horse when he is parking and Charlotte barking every time someone pulls in. He said they pay for each phone call... even though we wouldn't charge a thing as it's not costing us  anymore to have one out there than it was sitting upstairs in the guest bedroom. I just put a container with is and wrote donations accepted. E said he checked it out and thought it was good. A place to sit, file cabinet so there is pencil and paper along with the phone and donation bowl (cool whip container LOL) and a light so  they don't have to hold a flash light while trying to dial in the dark. That is where Hubby plugs  his truck in and keeps the power washer for the livestock trailer so not using more electric that what was already being used and helps in the community.We are eating from the pantry. I am back to baking (need to bake bread though).Fruit crisp, brownies, cookies, lemon cake( I will freeze part of it if we get tired of it),  Beef stew, chili, bacon, eggs and hash browns, pot pie (leftover beef stew with leftover beef roast with extra carrots and potatoes we grew).We pretty much stayed on the menu each of us would have ate if I had went to Son2's. This coming week we are planning to eat from the pantry also. I will be baking bread and corn bread. I might make corn meal mush since I make corn bread from scratch. I have planned smoke sausage, mac n cheese with peas, taco soups with nachos, rheuben casserole in crock pot with rye bread, chicken broccoli and rice casserole, brats/hotdogs ( I don't eat brats) with baked beans and canned cole slaw, Cuban black beans with rice (Bren Herrera recipe), pasta with salad and garlic bread, Salisbury steak with gravy, mashed potatoes and corn, Nonna's deep dish pizza ( bread dough crust in a sheet cake pan with pepperoni, sausage, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, black olives, turmeric banana peppers and lots of cheese.) with a salad.Are you planning to be frugal?Blessed BePrayers for peace"},
{"title": "Hubby spooked ... girls having issues.", "date": "Friday, November 4, 2022", "text": "Daily break time with Charlotte. Nice and sunny, I don't care how weird it looks or the laughs the Amish get when they go by and I am sitting like this.I'm with Charlotte. It's been a year since we lost Wilbur and Rascal. I still miss them daily. So glad to have this time with her. Plus the roof was warm and my feet were cold LOL. Hubby was agreeable to the 2023 budget, then he noticed I cut it so we are mostly on our social security and my IRA.  HE spooked when I said I was starting it NOW. If we can't do it NOW, we are going to struggle when it's fact. I calmed him by reminding him we were still going to be pulling from his IRA. It will also let us know BEFORE he lowers his pull if we can actually do it. IF we can do it, then he might be able to go even lower on his pull. I have to pull from mine. Inherited IRAs have to be gone in 10 yrs.I was going to do some decluttering, cleaning and last of tomatoes along with my NANOWRI today... BUT it's going to be mid 70s so I am washing bedding, throw blankets and furniture covers today. Not on schedule which threw him also. But I usually do that kind of stuff on Saturdays but they are forecasting gusts over 40 MPH and scattered showers tomorrow. It's a pain to put that kind of stuff on the drying rack or kitchen porch clothes line. It was nice to look across the pasture and see M had her bedding out on the line also.We had gas station pizza the other night (it's decent pizza). Couple Amish paid for it  as their ride didn't show up to take them home (just got off the bus at the gas station) so he let them use his phone to let the late driver know he had them. Driver admitted he forgot about them. All of them happy Hubby was there for fuel.We have been eating from the pantry. I actually caught myself thinking I don't want that, was on menu for Hubby and what I would have took to son2's so both of us would have ate it. Was enough to realize it can't be what I want or don't want. So we had what was listed.We have enough beef stew left that I think I can add the leftover roast beef that was in freezer for Hubby while I was gone to make a large beef pot pie for us. We can eat the leftovers tomorrow as we are both home. I'll make taco soup for Sunday with corn bread. I need to make bread tomorrow also.Daughter 1 is back to work but having issues from her carpal tunnel surgery. So back to the doctor for that.Daughter 3 had her new neighbor move in Monday and died yesterday. They think sugar as he was a diabetic and he was found in the front room but his insulin was in the bedroom. Her oldest girl (in nursing ) heard  a loud noise and went over to check to make sure he was okay. She could see him through the window he was on the floor so called 911 when she found the door locked.Daughter 4 got a call from her younger son's grandparents that he has been living with, his dad had custody of him when he died (both him and his brother died from inherited kidney disease with in a year of each other)  and he passed the custody to his parents as Daughter 4 at that time was bouncing around from home to home. She wasn't happy with it but since they didn't have anything in the paperwork stating he was to go back to his mother she agreed because her son said he wanted to live with them. He has failing grades in 2 classes (in high school) and blamed her (didn't bother to get him tutoring nor ground his butt when the first note came him from teachers about the low grades) and then tossed him out, didn't even let him wait in the home until she got there. YES COPS GOT A RECORD OF IT. The grandfather (step grandfather) did gather up most of his clothes and stuff  when she pulled up in front of the house. She filed of emergency custody. Glad her new job has legal insurance that she bought. Her health insurance wants a second test ran to see what stage the cancer is at for the hysterectomy. Her doctor had already told her he runs 2 tests a month apart as he has seen false negatives and positives on the tests.   Daughter 2 said ( I already knew but let her vent) her son 1 and his wife were separated again (4th time) And Son 4 was looking for his own place as he shares with older brother. Son 2 is better and released to go back to work and Son 3 in Army is only able to connect once a month now. Was in Italy the last she heard but his unit was on the move.Son 1 and Son 2 remain stable and calm. Hope things are calm and stable with you and yoursBlessed bePrayers for peace"},
{"title": "2023 budget.", "date": "Tuesday, November 1, 2022", "text": "I turned and thought she was sitting on Hubby's deskShe's not. She is on the arm of the love seat we have always called dog seat because every single dog we have had since 2002 has claimed this seat.Our IRA guy gave us a heads up we needed to come in during Dec to decide what we were pulling from IRA's next year and that our investments are where we want them. We want to have a pleasant retirement not one of fraught with we are going without. We had set our goal to live mostly on our social security (after Daddy lost most of his IRA in 2008 and had to drastically change his life style to rebuild his retirement). Social security is meant only to replace 40% of your income. Something to keep in mind before you go on social security. We are only over budget by $2000... that is the mortgage (not including ins and property taxes) and the truck payment.  Mine is set, I am happy with the investment and the amount I am pulling from my inherited IRA.BUT we agreed Hubby's pull is too high for where we are now and he is not sure about a couple of his investments as he changed who was handling his IRA a couple months ago.So I pulled up the budget with added inflation. Hey things are not going to go down a lot so might as well budget for it. I added 15 % over the 10% I just added a couple months ago. IF they don't go up that much , the money goes to savings. STILL ... do not need what he has been pulling. I had even moved his truck payment into the household budget in case the business can't make the payment. That might end up being for the replacement of the family truck that the frame is rusting out of.I asked him for the financial priorities...He rattled off a half of dozen...and then off and on would add something.I changed the wording and asked for the essential.Definitely changed how he was thinking and what he wanted to focus on. Essential 1. To be able to live in our home instead of assistant living/nursing home.What is needed right now? Decluttering and organization. We just need to refigure what we have for organization which probably would clear half the barn and what the need is.We don't need to drop pedestal sink in wheelchair bathroom or drop the sink in the mudroom. We don't need a wall oven or cook top at this point. All of that would be needed later. We have options on how to access the basement where the pantry is. 2. Having a better savings including 2023 medical out of pocket and some towards 2024 medical out of pocket. I have half of 2023 already.I already have listed what we need to save for and the amounts needed/wanted. He did acknowledge that he hasn't been clearing it with me before buying stuff.( I brought up usage of his credit card) When he went to an auction last week I had gave him a list with price point. Said that helped so I made another list of what is on the to buy list and those price points to carry with him. SO if he does see something on the list and the price is matching or better lower, he knows he can buy it.The budget for electric is $200/month. If it's lower the extra goes to savings. If it's higher then it can be pulled from saving of when it was lower.I think every 3 months I will transfer from the lower interest rate savings to the higher interest rate savings. It's 3-5 days to get the transfer completely through.3. Pay off the mortgage before we are 93. I already have got that down to age 88. BUT he wasn't acknowledging you have to cut somewhere else or pull more $$ to do that. He is now.  4. Finish getting stuff for the grid that included 2 new blades for the buzz saw.The saw blades for buzz saw is already in savings as they are ordered and come in during Jan. I transferred what I didn't spend on propane over to it figuring it would be in the heating budget instead of propane budget to cover both.I have 1/5th of what is needed already in saving. I just need to keep us focused on ESSENTIAL instead of priorities that sends us off the track somewhat.5. Cut what isn't essential to cut what he is pulling from IRA. He started pulling his IRA in 2017...It's been reduced every year. This year was 50% LESS than that original pull. Every year we have cut it by 10%. His old financial guy was shocked as most increase the pull or stay the same. Hubby agreed to reduce what he is pulling by 32% for next year's pull from this year's amount.   Little scary to drop that low that fast but we have definitely turn what we need to run the home and get the essentials done to a lot lower amount.Blessed be Prayers for peaceI found 1 dime and 1 nickel and 4 pennies. It went in to the change jar as the Amish have been buying our change so they don't have to go to the bank that is over 20 miles from them.We do all the daily habits, open curtains for light, keep furnace low, use wood stove when highs are in 50s (was nice to hear the Amish complaining of having to open windows because they need the stove on to cook but it's warm in the afternoons LOL), use the oil lamps (now the decorations saving on oil as it's a bit hard to get at the moment and we do have the option of electric where Amish don't, E ran out Sunday night and came over to fill a lamp. Hubby goes after oil on Friday with H) and clothes line. Hubby stacked more wood in the barn and said he is down to 1/2 cord to cut and most of it is kindling. E's dad H told Hubby to focus getting the scraps from A. R. or J.H sawmills as is saves gas from cutting.  I  listed the items we needed/wanted to buy...then I list the prices I am willing to pay.... then I go hunting for them. I make sure I think about sales tax or it can put us over budgetOn the to buy listhearth board with spacers for the wall behind the wood stove. Budget $100 plus taxhumidifier and filters if not like what we have. Budget $400 plus taxFour fire alarms as the ones we bought for here is starting to act up. Budget $80 plus taxLighters (we have a burn barrel, wood/coal stove and oil lamps) Budget $6. plus taxBottled water. Hubby carries a case in the truck so if someone needs water to drink or wash with he has it. My brother does the same. Budget $20 (we planned 3 cases) plus tax* went to 4 as they had dropped in price.*Two bags Chi Chi tortilla chips. We get them the cheapest at Menards. Budget $ 8 plus tax We figured $614 with 7.25 % tax  would require  a total of $658.52  We saved $675. Went to Menards (11 % rebate this week)  got everything on the list and some candy, hard caramels for Hubby to carry in truck, caramel creams (we only get around Christmas so being saved) soft caramels (use to cookies and ice cream) candied peach rings (me) and our standard Hershey plain and almond bars (we put peanut butter on them) and Reese's cups. Figure what ever was left in the $675 budget could be used on the candy that will last us through Christmas if not until Feb. We had $104.44 in rebates.  We were able to get $84 in candy. I split it up so Hubby is not tempted as he was raised and to this day his parents(diabetics) have a LARGE bowl of candy on the kitchen table. Not happening here. We will be getting back $56.82 in the 11% rebate.On the stock up list (still) turkey (less than $2/lb.), pepperoni ($7/lb. A pound makes 12 pizzas) and G& R bologna We pay what ever they want as it is a special blend just made for them. Additional Prime rib for Christmas is a question mark still. I was suppose to go to Son 2's for two weeks while he was at Annual training. His last before he retires officially December 30th. It was canceled. Since I had wrote a menu of options for Hubby and brought it up to kitchen frig. freezer, we are eating from that. I tossed small potatoes from our harvest and brussels sprout I had froze in a pork roast and only enough veggies for 1 meal. Hubby loved it. I split the pork roast into 2 meals for the freezer. Both will probably make 2 meals also.  We had Autumn stew (chicken I canned (store bought chicken frozen chicken breasts), onions, garlic and butternut squash along with the dehydrated beet greens from our gardens) , ate for dinner and lunch and then with our hamburger sandwiches we had last night 1 pint going in freezer. Tonight is beef stew from the freezer with the apple cider bread I baked that isn't going to last through this week.  I still have tomatoes on the deck table turning red, should be canning those by Thursday or Friday as it's getting into the 70s (not our normal 50s) I still have 1/2 bushel of apples to dehydrate and 1/4 bushel of apples for fresh eating and baking besides the 1 full bushel in the frig for this winter.I stocked up on vitamins and a few medical supplies that was on sale.I put up some LED lights decorations for Halloween and fall. Hubby remembers to unplug the one set in the front room and I do the one in the dining room. We leave the one over the sink on and not plug in the night light we have there. Both use the same amount of electric but with how I hung the lights on the curtain rod , it gives more light off than the night light. Hubby thinks he would like it to become the night light if I can figure out how to make it look decent and not just a strand of LED lights hanging on the curtain rod (which has no curtain as I hang the windchimes there during the winter)We have said no to a couple outings to lower the use of gas. As we know of at least one funeral we will be going to. Daughter 4's grandfather on biological side is dying. He has battled heart and diabetes for 20 yrs. We had our farm/car ins agent come over and recheck the place to make sure our coverage was up to were it should be. He added the stove and chimney, of course. AND advised us to start tracking how many miles we drive a year as we might be able to get a discount on that besides our ages. I had laundry on the line when he pulled up, he made the comment we had the same brand of dryer our neighbor had... M had her laundry out also. And then noted his mother never had a dryer until he was 10 and he is the middle child of 9.We went through clothes, Hubby needs \"dress\" jeans and work pants. Dress jeans come from Rural King, work pants come from Tractor supply. Both places had jeans on sale so it worked out well. I bought 4 dresses at half price, one has no sleeves but I have different sweaters or shawls I can wear with it. My dresses are hanging on me but I will pass them to another family member that can use them. She is passing her clothes to one of the grandkids. Sale prices of jeans and dresses are 50% lower than budget.We have stuff for the small projects we need to get done. I am going to need wide mouth pint jars. SIGH.Hubby will be scheduling the winter maintenance for the lawnmower and the tractor. He will get a 10% discount for doing it now until Jan 31st. Slow time for the two businesses. Books I am readingDecluttering your home in a Year or Less Workbook by Kai M.

But I will check turkey and ham prices tomorrow while we are out for chiropractic and picking up meds.My potato bin is doneI transferred $$ to the savings. I made a spread sheet to keep me focused on what we want to save for and the amount.I canned 8 qrts. and 6 pints of chicken.I  flash froze then  vacuum bagged 18 meals of Swedish meatballs, 4 meals of Chinese cabbage and 11 meals of Salisbury steak (done last week and I side tracked due to grandson and forgot to vacuum bag them).Kraut is made... a little salty for us but I can rinse it. Might can it if the area it's sitting in gets too cold. I don't want a busted crock.M gave us 4 dozen eggs. We had pancakes twice and eggs twice for supper to keep from ordering or going out for meals.Propane is in. All the bedding (5 beds), furniture covers and throw blankets were dried on the yard clothes line.I pulled from the stock up to refill meds, OTC and odds and ends. No running to the store due to being out.Depending on the week, Hubby is either over ran with jobs or doesn't have any at all. Since he had no work he was able to cut more of the wood we have here. I loaded the garden wagon that is now called wood wagon, then reloaded the wood box and then reloaded the wagon. We now have 3 garden wagons... one for the garden, one for wood and one for coal. Makes it nice I can roll it up the ramp and pull it in the house. After I clean the stove (in 70s) I will \"lay\" the wood in the stove for the next fire by going out to the wood pile instead, use part that needs to go to barn anyways. We have 3 cords in the barn and probably another cord sitting by the garden shed. About half of it doesn't need cut just move to the barn as it is \"pallet'' scrap from the one Amish that is cutting wood for the other one to make pallets. They just sell the scrap to whomever wants it.The bad.We were supposed to go have lunch with Son2... he got called in to work due to a broken water pipe that the water came through the ceiling. I am not sure we will get to see him until he gets done with AT. At least he can drive back and forth to home if he wants. But that means we won't see him until middle of next month. His lady is going to check on his cats but I will go down and also get a kitty fix.I got dirt in my left eye and have been dealing with a blocked tear duct... it's  better but still an issue.I still have 27 items on my to do list for Oct. Today and tomorrow are the last of the 70s weather... only suppose to drop down into mid 60s .... at least it's not the high of 47 like we had last week.The Ugly...Daughter 2's son2 is self employed  landscaping. He was working with his dad and 2 others trimming a tree. One was in the tree getting ready to start cutting branches and the other 3 standing down below... A branch that had already broke off that they didn't see fell out while the guy was climbing up and hit grandson in the left eye. Knocked him out... His dad thought he was dead. Even when he threw his hand (which needed stitches)  out to block it from Grandson. Grandson had surgery, metal plate and screw in eye socket. Said his dad probably saved his eye sight by blocking it some. He was out for 2 days, tube down his throat due to blood clots. He is home, not working yet but home. I had a short visit with him. Said his parents are a wreck so I made sure I talked to both of them and his stepmom (owns a business so she understands self employed)... third time his dad has seen one of his sons almost die. His mother, Daughter 2 does not understand when you are self employed you don't get workman's comp nor do you get medical time off with pay. Even though I explained it several times to her and know some of her friends did also. I love her dearly but she is a flake at times. Both of them nailed his butt when they found out he didn't get health insurance like they told him to. He applied while in the hospital.  ROLLING EYES. Daughter 4 is walking him through getting help for paying the bills. Daughter 4 is now jumping hoops for hysterectomy as she has a small amount of cancer cells in that area. They found it during her 2nd yr check up from the ovarian cancer. NOT enough to get chemo or radiation. Her doctor told her he was putting the info in to insurance to get approval. She said she checked she will get 60% short term disability but needs to have the out of pocket saved up and extra to cover what the 60% doesn't cover. She is back to Door Dash besides her \"day job\" I told her to call the hospital, and doctors that will be involved and ask their billing what her share would be. She didn't know she could do that as she is used to NOT having insurance.Blessed Be Prayers for peace."},

Won't be the end of next week as every morning is to be at freezing or close to it.Not a good pic but my brother wanted to see the flames. We have learned that Hubby can start a camp fire in a heart beat but I am better at starting the stove. We only kept it going for the day, give it time to burn off factory stuff (didn't get any smell, I scrubbed it pretty good like M told me to) and figure out how to control the oven temperature. Wood box in house is full, kindling bucket is full, starter basket is full. Humidifier pot on stove is fullBetter picture at 2:30 this morning when Hubby and I both were up checking the fire. It was 84 in the front room at his recliner where he sleeps. It was 78 in dining room, 76 in kitchen and 74 in the bedroom because I woke up HOT. Opened 2 doors and a window and got it back down  after 2 hrs. to mid 70s. Stove was running at correct temperature. We were supposed to be in the 30s this morning but the cloud cover kept us from dropping and we stayed in the 40s. GEEZE I might have to get the summer clothes back out for wearing in the house. At least with the furnace on 60 I don't have to worry about propane. I did tell Hubby he is still short a cord of wood and he doesn't have all the wood cut that is here as it is. BUT at least he wasn't like E who had to go to his woods Saturday and cut logs to cut into firewood as M was down to the last at the house.We decided to run to the bank over in Ada. On the way there we passed a small local grocery store. Hubby asked if I had the stock up list with me... yep... so we stopped on the way back. They had Brussels sprouts. We now have enough to have them once a month. I can float them between peas and asparagus. They had hamburger for $2 off a lb. IF you had their loyalty card. I mentioned at the meat counter (they grind their own hamburger) that I wished I had Son2's card. Told me to say something at the checkout. She had me fill out the form while she ran me up, scanned the paper and let me know the card should be to me within 2 wks. IF not call and say something. PLUS I got 10% off the total. I got enough  hamburger to make a dozen meals of Salisbury steak and Swedish meatballs and 23 meals of taco meat(because I wanted tacos that night LOL)Coming on back into town we decided to stop and get our flu shot. Since the crap is starting to go around through the Amish.Then I went in Walmart while Hubby got fuel at Walmart (cheapest right now). I got an 18 plus pound turkey for $1.60/ lbs. If I don't get any others, we have Tday turkey that will make at least a dozen meals for us and broth. I got a ham butt on clearance. So that's in freezer for the week after Christmas (we do prime rib at Christmas). I got 2 -10lb bags of frozen chicken breast on clearance. I tossed them in the freezer until I have time to can them.  I got 5 bags of Fritos for Hubby.It was a good day.Hubby went to an auction on Saturday, cold and windy but sunny. We had highlighted what we were looking for if the right price.  He was able to get a wooden chair that is a glider and stool with cushions (that look new) for $75. He knew we paid over $100 for the girls. THEN he had 3 Amish ask if he could haul stuff home for them since he had taken the trailer with him. One of them went with him to help unload the others stuff. The pit stopped at the Amish farm store to get dog food, the guys chimney was in so Hubby and him loaded also on the trailer. By time he was done, he got paid enough to cover his fuel for going and coming home AND the glider and stool. Today after I take a nap as I never went back to sleep from getting up at 2:00. I am starting the humidifiers, taking the hummingbird feeders down (haven't seen one for awhile) and making Salisbury steak and Swedish meatballs for the freezer. Laundry was on the line by 6. Blessed bePrayers for peace."},

Like Cookie , our other husky mix, she is laying on the heater vent.E came over and helped Hubby put the chimney up. We have another section for just incase. It's the right height etc. but E said it's more of how the wind comes through with our barn being taller than out house. He had to add another section to his. Said we would know about the second time we lit the stove.Stove needs 2 small pieces on it's chimney and it's starter up. Hubby is trying to get it done before Thursday when the rain comes in and brings the colder air. Looks like these few days are our Indian summer. Today I put 4 meals of ham in freezer and canned 16 pints of ham broth. I have a couple friends watching for sales for turkey for me. I loaded the dehydrators with celery, zucchini, yellow zucchini and crockneck squash. We ate from the menu until last night when I made Philly steak subs. We will be eating the rest of it for tonight's supper. We have been using the oil lamp in the morning and trying to make sure we eat supper before it gets dark. Another month and it will be dark and hour before we usually eat. We use mineral spirits aka mineral oil in our lamps. It doesn't trigger my asthma. We have noticed we automatically eat red, green or orange veggies and fruit. Yellow and blue/black/purple are not usually on the table. At least we are improving.Need to bring the laundry in off the line.Blessed Be everyonePrayers for peace"},

Hubby suggested we wait and he would bring food home but I was NO as I pushed for us starting to eat from the pantry Oct 1st Bfast and lunch we are on our own.1st: Chicken soup for me, home canned chili soup for Hubby Pumpkin roll2nd: Leftover chicken soup for me, scrambled eggs with odds and ends from frig for Hubby. Cherry pie from M3rd: mac and cheese, smoked sausage, peas, cherry pie from M *** M and E's kids named the baby Ruby. ***4th: today... shrimp scampi, green beans, mushrooms and diced onion, applesauce.5th: Baked ham, baked sweet potato, baked apples , spinach for me, yellow hominy for Hubby6th: Baked scalloped potatoes with ham, baked carrots and pickled beets, blueberry crisp. 7th: Beef roast with potatoes, carrots and onions and leftover crisp.

I will add a veggie plate with dip and the cake I bake the day before.9th: Leftovers that haven't been frozen. This is doable even with me being down. Multi dishes in the oven which will also help warm the kitchen dining area. Other frugal done.I priced iron on patches, baking powder and baking soda. I ordered through The Prudent Homemaker's site at Amazon which was 20% cheaper than any where close to me for the bulk amount I wanted. I wouldn't have caught I was low in this area if Hubby hadn't been reading Prepper's pantry and asked. Oil lamp on table is lit every morning. Curtains not open until the sun is up. Laundry on clothes line or drying rack, sometimes finished on drying rack. I made laundry soap.Furnace is now set on 68 from 8 am to 9 pm and 70 from 9 pm to 8 am. We have used 1 % of the propane in the past week. That is really good.Tuesday is errand day... no errands for us ... no need for even milk or anything else."},

He said the best came from the store bought one... you know the ones you forget you have and they start growing. Not sure we will grow potatoes again. I like the variety but they take up a lot of room. E checked them out, said his produced a bit bigger but not as much. His sweet potatoes made ours look like wimpy. Speaking of E... M delivered a healthy baby girl last night. Midwife didn't make it in time so E delivered the baby. M was in labor 1 hr. Hubby went and got E's mom to check the baby and M out. She retired from midwife 2 yrs ago. Not sure her kids got that memo. Baby weighed 8 lbs. 11 oz. Letting the other 9 kids name her so it might be a few days before they settle on a name. Said it was the fastest deliver she has ever had. She said she didn't mind it not taking the usual 1-2 days. Her niece is coming down from Michigan today to help take care of the younger kids and finish the canning which most of it is done anyways. I think the gathering of the last of the tomatoes and squash is it as she told me she already had her apple pie filling and applesauce done and that' usually the last of what she cans.I am still sick... not allowed to touch produce (doctor's orders) until Friday and only if I have no symptoms SIGH. Might end up making pear butter from the pears in the frig. Apples are on the porch but it's only in the 50s. Hubby said there are a few crockneck and zucchini he needs to pick (and pull the plants)and he would cover the onions and carrots that are still growing. Yes I am whining about not being in the gardens or processing food.😷I miss eating....I am thankful that I have bone broth and juices canned. Hubby is glad I have meals he can put together for himself quickly. But I miss eating. Blessed Be Prayers for peace"},

For the first time she felt she needed to sleep with me and was willing to cuddle (that was Wilbur)... AND she went and got Hubby who was asleep in his chair. He thought she wanted out but she guided him to my bathroom to \"show\" him I was sick. THEN when I finally went back to bed... she went and got him again to show him I was in bed. We had a laugh over it. Rascal would do that when he was alive.At least it's not Crohn's nor is it COVID . We were thankful we just had that shot. We get the flu shot in Oct. I know a friend whom had the flu last month he thought it was worse then when he had Covid. I am not as bad as he was but I haven't had Covid and don't want to. MEANTIME... sigh... since I can't process any food. Hubby went out and finished harvesting the potatoes by himself. I started reading A THOUSAND WAYS to PLEASE a HUSBAND. With Bettina's Best recipes... been very interesting as it first was published in 1917. Then I started playing with our diet/meals.I did a spreadsheet of colors of veggies and fruit. I was looking at the varieties not how much as that is on the inventory. We will have each color once a day. We have 30 varieties in the red color. We have 27 varieties of yellow/orange color (is banana white or yellow? )We have 19 varieties of green color. I was surprised at that but realized I only counted green beans as one and not the varieties of Italian wide, French cut and regular or stir fry. I didn't count the green chilis or the green jalapenos that are canned. I didn't include fresh lettuces/greens either. We have 14 varieties of blue/black/purple.We have 13 of white/tan. Onions are on the table in some form almost daily but it might be a red onion or yellow onion instead of the white onion. Mixed colors...9  that is home canned veggies soup, cole slaw, ratatouille, Russian salad, giardiniera, 7 bean soup,5 bean soup, 3 bean salad, tropical fruit blend and fruit cocktail. Daughter 4 suggested we pick our veggies and fruit first, then our protein and grains. AND  add quinoa... that was backed by Son 2. We talked about starting eating from the pantry now Oct 1st (TODAY) since we will get the turkeys at Thanksgiving. Even though I still have tomatoes, 2 different apples to process and carrots and onions in the gardensHubby still wants us to \"eat out\" once a week and rotate thru our local owned restaurants to be supportive on them  Pfeiffer station on Wed (meatloaf) or Thurs. (beef and noodles)Belly acre, Michael Angelo's, Ralph's, Royal Buffet, En Lai Chinese and Marathon gas ($11 pizza and good sandwiches. Neighbor's family works there).I agreed to Pfeiffer on the week we don't have appts with rotating which day. The others will rotate on Tuesday when we have appts and are out anyways. Pfeiffer is 1 mile from us.I also realized I am in a rut of what veggies I serve together. Green beans and corn, peas and carrots, white potatoes, yellow onions and carrots (with any roast), cauliflower and broccoli.... then white potatoes and white onions with any beans, ratatouille with pasta, spinach with hominy. Kraut with mashed potatoes.I need to switch it up. Daughter 1 does Hungarian cabbage rolls with tomatoes.Daughter 2 does green beans with onions and mushrooms (she only eats fresh mushrooms).Daughter 3 tosses greens with tomatoes and yellow or orange bell peppersDaughter 4 does brussels sprouts with red onions and yellow bell peppersSon 1 does V8 fusions as he hates the texture of veggies and fruit.Son 2 does butternut squash with red onion and kale... he tries to get purple kale if he can. They sure didn't get those combinations from me.

The husky in her is showing. I stayed out with her about 30 minutes. Long enough for me.Since I am recovering from getting my bivalent booster (mild, really mild but the fatigue is strong and a sore arm) and Hubby is hauling across the state. I decided to finish dealing with the \"eating\" issues. Sunday was a nice day to be outside. So we sat on the kitchen porch with Charlotte and talked about the biggest problem we have in our life right now... eating healthy. Doc has been on us about some low numbers in our blood work. Mostly for Hubby. Hubby is one that was raised on big servings of meat and corn, was not made to eat their veggies as his dad hates veggies and most fruit, and potatoes was seldom on the table. They were farmers and raised beef and pork. Sunday's meals was popcorn. Cereal was their breakfast, lunch was the big meal of the day and usually a roast of some kind. Supper was leftovers.I was raised on very little meat, potatoes are every meal (Grandpa grew them) and half the plate of veggies. Eggs, potatoes, bacon and canned biscuits (or toast) for breakfast every single day. Mother never fixed lunch for her or us two kids. Daddy got a bologna sandwich every day (just like his Daddy). Supper was a small piece of meat, half a plate of fried potatoes and a little bit of corn or green beans that Mother cannedWe had fruit in season and Hubby had applesauce during winter. I didn't.Our eating habits SUCK. We decide to do what Hubby's former employer had us do one time (got insurance for free if we did it , boy those were the days). Eating a rainbow diet. You can google it to get all of it but general guidelines of eating veggies/ fruit for each color group a day.White/tanGreenRedYellow/orangeBlue/black/purpleSince I am in process of inventorying the pantry/freezers. I set the spreadsheet up to list under the colors.We also decide to rotate through what the main dish would be each dayBeefPoultryPorkSeafoodEggsCheese/dairyBeans/lentilsSoupsPasta/polentaNeither one of us is much into eating bread daily but need grains to stay healthy. I struggle with grains flaring my Crohn's. BUT we need grains daily so I need to get that in.FarroBulgurQuinoaRice (over a half dozen different ones)Cornmeal: yellow, white masa and polentaWheat: white, whole wheat, speltz, cream of wheatI do have rice flour, semolina, and almond flour.Barley: flakes and pearl, cream of bulgurOats: steel cut, regular and instantGrits Millet Grapenuts... I use it more in desserts as a layer in parfaits than a cereal Hubby's calcium is low... So we have cheese, yogurt, sour cream, heavy cream, half and half and milk (plus dried beans will help also). We decided to list main dishes, then figure out which colors of veggies and fruit, grains and dairy to add by day. Hubby thought the color blue/black/ purple would be hard to keep in the diet. Some sites say beets and cabbage fall in this. I think beets are red but I have raised purple radishes. My \"red\" cabbage is more purple that red. Depends on variety I think. Here is the list we made sitting there. I went back through the inventory and added a few things we had like pizza burgers and breaded tenderloin.Green beans, potatoes and ham one pot with corn bread (my favorite but it was the first thing Hubby thought of)Ham steak, scalloped (or au gratin) potatoes Sausage gravy and biscuitsPotato soup (I have purple, yellow, and red potatoes I can leave the skin on)Baked pasta (lasagna, manicotti, stuffed shells)Pasta with salad Aunt Dolly's oven meal casserole (1lbs cooked ground or shredded meat. carrots and potatoes with condense soup of choice for \"sauce\" bake.Hamburger pie (or Chinese pie or shepherds pie depending on which child I am talking to)Frittata aka big egg to HubbyRoasted chickenRoasted beef roastPrime rib roast (Christmas only unless he finds one cheap)Loaded OmeletCuban black beans and riceRed beans and riceJambalayaDried beef and gravyScrambled egg with potato O BrienShrimp stir fryShrimp pasta  Salmon patty and mashed potato cakeMackerel patty and boiled potatoes with peasMac and cheese with smoke sausage and peasGrilled cheese sandwiches with carrot saladGrilled lunch meat sandwiches canned cole slaw Cheese quesadilla with refried beans and salsaApple rarebit with saladCountry boil Reuben casseroleBaked beans with ground meatChicken and noodles with mashed potatoes, canned cole slawBeef and noodles with mashed potatoes, canned cole slawBean soup (white bean mostly) fried potatoes with onions Pork loin roast (leftovers go to BBQ sandwiches)Pork butt roast (leftovers go to mock Brunswick stew)London Broil flank steak (leftovers go to stir fry)Smoke or oven brisket (leftovers go to ragu over polenta or beef and barley soup)Baked round steakPork ribsBeef ribsUncle Ed's cube steak sandwichesBratwurst Brat pattiesPhilly steak subsPhilly steak pizzaTaco pizzaNonna's pizza *bread dough for crust and deep dish...

I have added liquid to casseroles to make soups. Amish elderly lady told me she will grab 2 jars of veggies and 1 jar of protein and calls it pantry soup on a regular bases through the winter. Serves it with pie or a cake with fruit instead of frosting and of course homemade breadI still need turkey for the freezer and Hubby wants Fritos which he forgot to buy yesterday while we were at the store. I sighed as they were on sale and it was the last day of the sale.  We each had a cart and our own list as I got the perishables.I will get fresh cabbage and brussels sprouts off and on through winter. Not often on the cabbage as we are making kraut (fingers crossed it's good as it's in the crock).  I put buy 3 on Hubby's list for brussels sprouts... he only got one as he had his finger on the number. I'll have to pick up my pepperoni in 2 wks. Hubby forgot to order the bologna (special made) from a restaurant we grew up around so we might not be able to get it. Blessed BePrayers for peace and common sense and GOOD MANNERS"},

Our prescriptions should be ready so we can stop and get them and then go to Walmart to get my glasses fixed and Hubby get arrow aka bolts for the cross bow he got at an auction. E said the bow is worth about $1000... Hubby paid $25. AND while on way home we can stop and ask H what time he wants picked up tomorrow morning to go to Holmes co. Hubby is also bringing home apples after his hauling job this morning . He got them off the guy he is hauling for so no extra trip to get them.The dealer that sold us the solar water pump let us know it was being shipped and should arrive by Friday. We harvested more potatoes, crockneck, zucchini and peas. Tomatoes are slowly ripening on the picnic table. I got enough ripen to make 16 pints of pasta sauce. That is done completely. Next batch (will be tomato sauce or juice), will be done Wednesday, as it looks to have enough turned for a canner load. I separated pears for pie filling (never have made pie filling of pears before) and just pears (which I have down off and on for years).Hubby cleared more of the garden and finished harvesting his last 6 pumpkins so I have my compost pile back. NICE.As I've been putting the scraps around the pond yard part and around E's hay field with his permission. No squash seeds allowed  as his kids last fall tossed the pumpkin seeds in his hay field and now the whole acre is covered in pumpkins. Said he got enough out of the pumpkins at auction to buy the hay and seed for hay but barely and now needs to replant the hay.Winter curtains are up, windows are locked closed to keep drafts down. Furnace is set on 65 during the day and 70 at night. Curtains open during the day will bring the house up to 72 to 74 as we get sun from east, south and west without the furnace running. Hubby got the lamp oil and filled the lamps. We have used the dining room lamp in the mornings. I try to have supper by 4:30 so we don't need the \"light\".Dishwasher is ran only when it's full. We combined errands either when we are both going or when Hubby's work takes him close to what ever is needed done.We made a list of meals we haven't had in awhile, compared it to the pantry inventory list and added a few more meals to use what we have.  Leaving to run the errands.Blessed Be Prayers for peace"},

Next chance is next Thursday. Hubby pulled all the tomato plants including cherry tomatoes. I have a couple small cherry tomato plants in pots we can get a few off at a time. The crockneck and zucchini are still producing, slowly. Peas are still producing slowly. I have 2 heads of winter lettuce. I have some green onions. Both I will need to pull this coming week or cover.Carrots are really slow. We might end up covering them with straw to keep them going.I had already started the potato harvests. Yukon gold was done( 5 meals) and started on the russets (3 meals).I got Purple majesty harvest doneThis will make at least 5 meals for us. Red luna is done , Another 5 meals.German butterball are doneat least 4 meals, might be 5.We went back through the sweet potato beds.smaller but almost doubled what we had pulled the first time. With both harvests we have enough for 30 meals.I harvested more peas. Another 2 meals in the freezer. I will be harvesting again this afternoon. I have dehydrated peas to add to soups and such. I would like another 8 meals for the freezer but know I will be lucky to get another 2. I need Brussels spouts. I have zero of them and Hubby really likes them. I have pears to can today. Thinking of  vanilla bean pear pie filling. Have never ate pear pie filling. Zucchini to peel and shred for freezer for zucchini pies through this winter which we both love. Zucchini and crockneck squash to chop up for freezer. Cantaloupe and watermelon to put in freezer.Tomato left over skin and seeds to grind that I put in dehydrator yesterday. Should be done to grind.Tomato juice to cook down to sauce to can today.Broccoli I blanched (stems diced and blanched for soups) that I flash froze to be vacuumed bagged today.Cauliflower needs blanched and flash froze today, and vacuumed bag tomorrow.Tuesday I have 1/2 bushel of red delicious apples coming in to make applesauce and 1/2 bushel of golden delicious apples to make applesauce or pie filling. I will use the cores and peeling to make apple butter. In October there should be fuji and honey crisp apples.I might pick up more pears. I will know after I can this 1/2 bushel. OR I might just pick up some canned pears at Aldi's.I washed all the summer bedding and curtains and line dried them and then packed into rubber maid. I have 1 container to take back to barn.I washed and lined dried all the winter bedding and curtains. Beds are now made with winter bedding (except one that Charlotte decided she wanted to take a nap on, so that's for later) I NEED to finish washing the windows and hang the winter curtains. I did lock them so there is not much air coming through them (old windows).We are out of bread but still have tortilla wraps. I can make corn bread or biscuits if needed as I won't be baking bread while canning.  Days keep rolling, to do list gets longer. We write what we think about needing done down but right now it's more of \"what HAS to be done today?\" mode.Blessed be Prayers for peace because insanity is running wild."},

Miss I don't want anything to do with Nonna unless she's giving treats.Sucks up when I came in to drop Son2's and his lady's birthday cards off along with the magazine he had lent me. She ran straight to the cabinet where the canned cat food is (that's a treat). I split the can between them and figured I would get a chew out for giving it to them since they are on diets LOL. But didn't. I had a doctor appt at noon, almost 2 hrs. drive SOUTH  so routed everything to do the following: Stop at Meijer's as we don't have one near us. Got coke a cola and sprite on sale. If I do what I used to ...divide the amount of each bottle into 3rds. I have enough to go 162 day... I can add the Vernor's ginger soda (the only canned pop I drink) to stretch it farther.  I also got broccoli and cauliflower on sale.  I drove across the street and had the doctor's appt.Then drove to Son2's...15 min. drive a bit SOUTH of my appt. Dropped off his birthday cards (he is 40 today and next week his lady turns 43)and gave treats to the 4 legged grandkids.Then drove NORTH 25 mins. to Daughter 2 and dropped off bday cards for 2 of her kids(26 and 22) as she will see them this coming weekend. Gave me a chance to see her also even though she was at work (bartender) and give her a hug.Then drove NORTH 25 more mins. to Daughter 1's to drop off her bday card (50 SIGH, not sure which one of us is feeling that more).Then drove NORTH 15 mins. to the Mennonite store and got a half of a bushel of Honey crisp apples and a half of a bushel of bartlett pears Within 10 mins of being home Hubby let me know to pick up a prescription and Subway sandwiches.It really worked out at I only went out of my way of coming home by 10 miles. The guy that was ordering saw blades for him let him know it wouldn't be in until Jan but ordering them now froze the cost so he ordered them. If his blade on the buzz saw breaks... he will be using the chain saw again. We started taking down the gardens. I have zucchini, yellow egg zucchini, crockneck squash, poblano peppers, yellow wax peppers, cantaloupe, and tomatoes to process.Autumn is arriving in full force on the 22nd... morning temps in low 40s or high 30s. I am getting the winter curtains and bedding washed and dried HOPEFULLY today. I won't worry about clothes until next week.Blessed Be Prayers for peace."},
{"title": "Sunbathing ..grid down update and gardens", "date": "Saturday, September 17, 2022", "text": "Charlotte... At least she waited until after I brought the tomatoes in from the deck table so I didn't have to step over her.I showed Hubby these pics I took while walking the perimeter. It's our east maple tree. Usually the west maple turns first on the south side. It's still green completely.If we go by old timer's weather, we will have 20 snows (we had 20 fogs in Aug) and a colder winter as the apples skins and corn husks are thicker. Waiting for Oct. 9th, if it's sunny the winter will be very cold, if cloudy then mild. Hubby is hoping for cloudy as it's his birthday also. BUT with Alaska getting hit with Hurricane type weather we can see that affecting what comes our way and when we get hit with colder weather. I am definitely not ready for the weather to turn. Looking at the Weather channel and seeing I have about 10 days before the weather goes down to the 70s. Nights are already in low 50. Slows down tomatoes ripening. We don't usually see orange leaves until after the first frost which has not happened yet but the nights are cooler than normal. A mini celebrations... The solar water pump batteries are in  and less than budgeted.The jumper boxes for the truck (so you can jump the truck/car without another car) are in and less than budgeted.Oil for lamps is in so Hubby can go get that. It's under budget also since he is the one that hauled it he knows what the price set is. He forgot to take our can to get filed. Not a big deal as E's dad is the one that sells it along with the guy we ordered our wood/coal stove from.2 sawblades for buzz saw (Hubby uses to cut firewood) is being ordered today so that cost should be in later this week. Another English driver for Amish offered to order them and pick them up when ready as he is in the area of the dealer every two weeks. Saves Hubby the trip across the state as they only do in person orders. The Amish gave Hubby estimation of the costs as they buy that size also.  The wood/coal stove $$ is in Ally savings earning interest where our local bank interest rate sucks but I like my checking local( or should say was local as they closed that branch but we can use the one every 2 wks. when we go to Chiro) and not online only.I have 1/3rd of our 2023 medical out of pocket/co pay in Ally also.I reworked the budget. Our electric average has raised $25 due to increase of kWh costs. I just bumped everything to costing 25% more than it does now. Still will be able to reduce pull from Hubby's IRA. We started clearing the gardens. We have more baby butternut squash curing. Sweet potatoes curing. We pulled 1/3rd of the tomato plants. I have a 6 ft round patio table full of  green tomatoes and very few ripe tomatoes. Hopefully today when we go for just the ripe ones, I'll get enough for a canner load. We have more crockneck, yellow egg zucchini and green zucchini to eat. Peas are starting but not getting much... maybe 1/3rd of a cup was ready. I'll take what ever I can get since I freeze them.  M sent over a pumpkin pie (Amish pumpkin is NOT orange, it's tan when cooked.) She makes a meringue and adds cooked pumpkin... she doesn't use much spices and she forgot the sugar this time... We liked it... wasn't sweet at all. She called it squash pie. It ended up a good laugh. Also let me know I could leave the sugar out of our pumpkin pies LOL.Sitting down today and figuring out what still needs done before we get hit with autumn weather. Blessed Be Prayers for peace"},
{"title": "In a day", "date": "Wednesday, September 7, 2022", "text": "I found 2 gift cards we had bought 5 yrs ago... didn't completely use... $24.64 lost due to cards out of date. I need to put gift cards in a different spot in my wallet so I see them when I get in my wallet.I hung laundry on the line even though the day before was not dry yet. Now I have laundry hanging on shower rods and drying racks. Told Hubby I was not washing until it dries. We had 2 fogs back to back that didn't go away until almost noon and then no sun until after 5 pm. We went to CVS. I bought $119.41 and between coupons and CVS extra bucks and only getting what was on sale and had the coupon. I paid $63.77.Hubby needs a \"lift\" to finish the chimney and he wants it for the weekend (E is helping) that wont' happen until the end of this month or going into next month between their work schedules and when the lift is available. WHICH is okay as Hubby found he was short 4 pieces of the connecting pieces. Won't rent lift until those are in. BUT he at least has the price.While out he checked at 3 places about his hauling.We bought 2 meals from our small local store. Scalloped potatoes and ham with a roll. Fed us lunch and dinner. Hubby added a bit of the ratatouille to get more veggies in. Owner told him that she sells out on Wed (meatloaf) and Thurs. (beef and noodles) and Sat is always some sandwich (buyers choice) but the rest of the time she almost has leftovers to figure out what to do with.After eating I wiped down the pasta sauce jars and Hubby took them down to the pantry. My cerebral palsy is flaring so I am stumbling.We dropped off the propane contract for winter fuel. So that's off the to do list and to pay list.Then while he went to deliver messages to Amish ( he now charges for that) I harvested. The chimney bill will be in by Saturday for Hubby to pick up. He asked if it could be ready Friday as he would be in that area then... they were okay with that so he wasn't making a special trip for it. Hubby also harvested 6 tan pumpkins. AND there is at least 6 more out growing in his compost garden. Cherry tomato vines are breaking when you bump them. A&W called about the stove not coming in until Nov. But the coal was in and the next load would be more expensive. So Hubby arranged to go get it after supper as A isn't home until after 6:30  our time. We ordered 1 ton... A had extra come in and was expecting another semi to come in with more next week with more expensive coal. Asked if we would be interested in taking 2 tons if he gave us a discount, took 15% off. Yep we took 2 tons (4000 lbs.) of coal. Then had to unload it off the pallets on the trailer BY HAND as our tractor will not lift over 500 lbs. REALLY need a small pallet jack. Especially when the stove comes in. A offered to loan his as long as Hubby brings it right back.Wasn't bad until Hubby dropped a 40 lb. bag of coal on top of the back of my right hand. He thought I had already adjusted the bottom bag and was in the move up pick up, turn and drop. Terrified he broke my hand... just really smoushed... not even a bruise, just tender this morning. He told me to make a fist and then decided he didn't want me to do that because I might use it on him LOL.Since A got us a discount on the stove since it's not delivered like promised ... we have the total saved for it.SO the only things we need to save for NOW is the 2023 medical and down payment (or total payment ) of what ever we buy to replace the truck . Everything else is either paid for or the money is in savings. To keep from spending money I shouldn't... When we ordered something on the credit card that is off the grid item,  I wait until I see it has been sent, then I go in and transfer the money to the card as a payment. No worries of getting hit with a high credit card bill and no worries of spending money on one thing when it should have went for something else.Plans for today.... shred squash for freezer, make eggroll filling for freezer. Might make egg rolls if I make the dough up. Can red cabbage and apples, start pizza sauce as I have enough tomatoes to finish that and what ever is left I can add garlic (the only difference between my pizza sauce and pasta sauce) and can more of that. Back to work for me. Have a blessed dayBlessed bePrayers for peace (and common sense would be nice also)"},

Wood stove delayed", "date": "Tuesday, September 6, 2022", "text": "I got 12 jars of plain tomato sauce, 12 jars of BBQ sauce and 12 jars of pasta sauce over the weekendI still need 34 jars of tomato sauce, 17 jars of pasta sauce, 25 jars of pizza sauce and 12 jars of tomato juice. Also at least 16 cups of summer squash,10 cups of peas, 26 jars of applesauce , 42 jars of pears(probably won't happen unless E ends up with extra from someone else)... red cabbage *with apples (what ever I get as I have 4 red cabbage) eggroll filling (using the last 2 green cabbages) along with noodles, eggroll wrappers and dumpling wrappers. Ham and Turkey... chicken thighs if I ever find them.I have potatoes that are cured that I need to brush off and put in baskets so I have room to put the next batch to cure. I have herbs to be cut and dehydratedWe took a walk out to the fruit trees in the rain (off and on all weekend actually made me feel cold) that are in pots as Hubby is going to transplant them this month and on the way back to the house we toured the gardens and it took both of us to carry 4 of the tomatoes (they would almost make half the pizza sauce as I can 6 oz jars). Goat bag tomatoes are turning red LOL. Peas are blooming. Hubby point the blooms out and that he needed to go ahead and pull the Brussels sprouts and kalettes that did NOTHING. First time that happened. Depending on price is I buy any Brussels sprouts. for the freezer. Sweet potato vines are starting to turn yellow so it won't be long that we will be harvesting them.The last piece of chimney is in. Hubby is going to find a lift to rent so E and him are safer that standing on a ladder or the roof reaching out.Chimney came in under budget so did propane so the \"extra\" will go to the medical fund for next year. The manufacture let A know the stove was waiting on 1 piece to come in, since it's the piece to hold the top , it's kind of can't go around that issue.  Won't be in until Nov.  I rechecked for the millionth time where we would be with propane. If it comes in before the end of Jan (worse possible in my mind) we would be okay. Worse would be we order more propane and pay the going price. We could use a gas buddy heater in the pump house instead of the propane on the main tank. Will lower the thermostat more than last year.The coal is in and ready for pick up. A said to come get this load not wait until stove is in because it will be increasing by 10 %. This was also under budget at we figured the inflation would have already been added in.We have 2 things Hubby had not ordered that I told him to order now. The stove is going to be the last to save for instead of the medical and these last 2 items.Other orders for grid down items has came in UNDER budget ( I would rather over budget than under budget) that money WAS going to be shifted to medical $$. Now I am finishing paying for the items not ordered and transferring the medical to savings and then finish saving for the stove since I have 2 months to do that.Now to go to CVS and use my extra bucks before they expire."},

Campbells Fiesta nacho cheese soup and Campbells cheddar cheese soup. I noticed it when an Amish lady mentioned she was going to have to change her pantry soup because those two were hard to get. So I checked .... none of the stores around here have it...said it is on back order and it's through the roof in cost on Amazon. It's not HERE WE GO AGAIN... it's more of HERE WE ARE STILL. I know we will have a bill from the Urgent care for Hubby... but it should be the last bill we have to pay out of pocket, being the first time he has finished paying his out of pocket deductible. I can imagine what the Xray and lab will run let along the Urgent care bill BUTSolar water pump is paid forThe money for the chimney, coal, wood/coal stove, propane for this winter, 2 jumper boxes for trucks, 2 solar pump batteries , and 2 saw blades for the buzz saw are now in the savings.We STILL need to save for next year's out of pocket. The company Hubby retired from puts out the health ins for their retirees mid Oct. about the same time Social Security puts out the COLA raise. So we will also know what we need to pay for health ins.IRS is trying to change how those that inherited IRA's 2020 and after withdraw the money. If that changes I will have to withdraw more...and that is okay as Hubby will just not withdraw as much. End of Dec 2018 Hubby retired, three months later we bought this house and as of Jan 2019 was pulling enough to cover doing this house  (Amish no electric, running water or heat) to ADA wheelchair accessible with propane, electric, running water, water heater, and internet. IF money gets bad we could slap plastic up on the windows in winter (like AMISH HA HA) and call it done.At the end of the 1st year starting 2020 we reduced withdraws by $2000. Even with supporting Daughter 4 while fighting cancer.2021 we cut it another $1000. 2022 we cut it another $1000. even while supporting the business when the work wasn't coming in and buying the off the grid items.2023... even with adding 25% increase in our costs as things are already up 10%( we aren't pulling more) and our financial guys are worried it will go up another 15% next year ... we will be cutting the withdraw by $3000...worse will be cutting by $2500 if we have to replace the truck sooner than later. Mainly it's only being used once a week if that. We really try to make everything on the Tuesday our chiro is on. I am down to needing ham and turkey for stocking.I am finished as of today with BBQ sauce. I still need 26 of pasta sauce. 26 pizza sauce, 26 tomato sauce and 12 tomato juice. Garden is still coming in so there is plenty of tomatoes to gather. and it was weird to drive Hubby to Urgent care (this is Wednesday)He thought he broke it at joint of big toe, I thought gout. NP thought both.Was neither... still don't know. Put on steroids and to call his primary who he had called but couldn't get in to.Primary got him in after hours on Thursday... thinks it's the beginning of gout so put him on gout meds. Hubby started them today(Saturday as Primary warned him they cause diarrhea and hubby is hauling during the week). It's only meds for a couple days. We think.... too low of carbs triggered it as it helps flush uric acid out of your system. He was eating less than 100 grams instead of the 225 he wasn't to go under. Daughter 4 went to Urgent care for stomach pains. Found she had fatty liver , Type 1 diabetes, and gallbladder on top of her lupus. Her cancer screening results(test is the 14th) will be in Oct 21st, the day before her birthday. She had surgery for the cancer ON her birthday....said it was the gift of healing from herself. Diabetes runs thick in our family.  Her job is working with her right now, figures crossed they will continue to do so. Helps she works 2nd and can get appts done in the morning. BUT  it put a hold on her getting a promotion in the dept she is in (welding)."},
{"title": "Frugal post...instead of what I did", "date": "Tuesday, August 30, 2022", "text": "it's going to be what I am going to do. Garden is coming in. Monday harvest orange tomatoeszucchini, yellow egg zucchini and yellow crockneckRest of the harvest that Hubby helped gather.Lots of food to process. I have a list of what I am low on. I did pull the last of the jade beans, roma beans and yellow wax beans and this is the last of the cabbage. I am canning the red cabbage with apples. Not sure what to do with the other cabbage as the kraut crock is already full. Might make more canned cole slaw. Email my IRA guy to make sure I am pulling the correct amount of RMD from my inherited IRA since IRS made it clear over the past week they weren't clear how they wanted the money to come out. He is on vacation so it will be sitting there for him when he gets back.  The original rule was it had to be taken out in 10 yrs... so most finance suggested leaving it there. Now it's you have to take a certain amount out each year which is what they meant but didn't say. SIGH. No sense costing me with a penalty from the IRS. BESIDES... if I am not pulling enough I will of course pull more but that means we pull less from Hubby's IRA.I won't say no to any food offered to me even if I am buried in it from my own gardens. This is with the acknowledgement we might not have much of a garden with having to rebuild most the beds (lasted 4 yrs) next year due to costs of building raised beds. M just sent over a bag of corn. Believe me I don't need any more corn as I now have enough corn for 2 meals a week for a year. We didn't grow corn this year. I didn't say no to cucumbers, beets, zucchini or corn. I now have canned goods in the north and south lofts as over flow from the pantry.I am almost out of Bunn coffee filters. Son 2 bought the first Bunn coffee pot for Hubby 7 yrs ago. Hubby bought me one 5 yrs ago (we don't drink the same strength of coffee). Both are going strong with a cleaning every 6 months. Son2 splits cost of the filters. I automatically went to Bunn website to order the filters... store filters are too short and allow grounds to come over the top. THEN decided to google the filters. Found them at Amazon for the cheapest. So went through The Prudent Homemaker /Brandy website and ordered them saving $. AND it helps Brandy. Errands are Tuesday. We will drop off bday card to Son 1 as his bday is the 10th of Sept. and we won't be back over there before that. Grocery list is milk... I will check to see what chicken thighs/wings are running. IF in my price point I will get that also. I might get coke a cola and sprite if that is on sale. PLUS a couple of 2 liters of store brand 7 up/sprite for doing apples and maybe pears if I find them. We like them better if I soak the apples/pears in the pop before canning or dehydrating. Chicken thighs and wings, ham and turkey is the last of the meat to stock. I might pick up bulk sausage later this fall which is when the ham and turkey prices should be the lowest. I do check freezer depts for turkeys as last year I found some for clearance for half of the normal price. The rest I need to stock is coming from the gardens. EXCEPT apples and pears. I will be canning most of the ham and turkey.Hubby noted the only things he is tossing in the compost is odds and ends from where I am canning/freezing/dehydrating. Mostly tomato cores and ends of peppers. E offered to add manure this fall after everything in the gardens are done. I reminded Hubby his garden was there so I wasn't tossing much on it. E's hay field has gotten some of the \"compost\" items LOL.The only \"night light\" we have on now is the basement light with that door open so we know/remember that Charlotte is sleeping there. Otherwise we shut the door and she scratches the crap out of the door as she won't bark to be let out or in. Wilbur would bark, Rascal was more of a scratcher. I am using the grill to \"blanch\" tomatoes, actually I just cut the core out and toss them on the grill, light the grill, wait about 3 minutes, turn off the grill and wait another 2 minutes. Put in bowl and cover, Usually the skin comes right off (and gets dehydrated) after they are cool enough to touch. I will be reworking the budget. Had a couple finance people tell me to figure on 10% increase of everything this year with a possible 15% increase on top of that for next year. That is on top of possible colder, snowy winter. We have debated of how much propane to order. Wood/coal stove was supposed to be in and got bumped a month. We decided to order less than last year.... and if the stove doesn't come in we use our emergency heaters if necessary.I ordered faraway cages for computers, ham radio, vehicles, and phones. A faraway cage protects from EMP and solar flares. The house already has a protector at the breaker box... Won't be my fault if Hubby loses stuff due to solar flare if he doesn't put his stuff in it. He is a Ham radio operator and part of a home land security in the local area. They try to prepare for the worse and then avoid it.Have a good week. I will be buried in produce LOLBlessed bePrayers for peace"},

We might not need that cord after I get done cutting the limbs that have been sitting for over a year.Hubby was going to lower the ceiling in the pump house but now needs that height for the solar pump so that job is off the list. We are going to put some cabinets in it as its a good place to store some veggies like potatoes, squash and such.Hubby still plans to replace the steps on the front porch and kitchen porch and add a set of steps to the south end of the kitchen porch (railroad ties are there now, E will take them afterwards). All of it is here.The paneling is here to finish the south bedroom loft that will most likely be a winter job We were going to fix the garden shed... now that's for next year as we are debating on tearing it down or fixing it. On next year's list is windows... highest cost is $16,000 as they would have to be custom built to fit in the same space.Building and buying what ever to organize the barn. Redoing the garden beds. I want to redo strawberry beds also. Blackberries need extended fencing.We are still debating on a dormer shed over the north/south lofts. Will depend on costs. IF we decide to do that ..insulation/crawl space will get bumped a year.The following year is to be foam insulation  and crawl space encapsule. I will have another energy audit done before we add insulation. We were doing decent on the first one, but we've done a lot of gap closing since then. The following year is siding.Somewhere along the line we will have to redo the wood floors. We will either build more closets or buy a couple more wardrobes.A lot will depend on money. I do have certain windows that need replaced so it might only be replace the bad ones and make due."},

{"title": "Hope you are doing well.", "date": "Tuesday, August 16, 2022", "text": "She woke both of us up itching at 4 A.M Monday morning.Days are flying by....Monday, Charlotte got her nails clipped and a different shot for her allergies. The vet had noted last year that the injection she got didn't do as well as hoped. We forked out the higher $ to get a different shot. She slept solid on the hour drive back home and then curled up on the same chair as pic and slept another 2 hrs. Came in, ate, went back out and played, KNOCKED ME ON MY BUTT AND INTO HALO BUSH, gave kisses to make up for it, came back in and slept from 8 pm until 5:30 this morning. Hubby said she woke him, went out to potty, came right back in and went back to bed. I ordered some items on the stock list I keep on the frig going through The Prudent Homemaker's site at Amazon and used my cash back points to pay for it. We are now set for winter with filters.  I got popcorn and breath right strips also. There is enough points left to pay for my monthly kindle charge.I ordered my FLYLADY calendar (2 ...one for household the other for pantry) through Amazon instead of Flylady.net. Saved $20 on shipping. I ordered File It calendar through Calendars.com that I use for finances. Keeps the bills together. Daddy and step mom and Mother and step dad used this type of calendars for the bills.I baked bread (need to bake again) made wonton wrappers and some dumpling *pot sticker* wrappers for the freezer. I refilled everything in the kitchen, started to reorganize it and found what I thought would work , made it worse so I will have to undo that this week. I took stuff to the pantry, realized I didn't have a place for it so had to move stuff around.  I mylar bagged my corn meal , one bag for  2 lbs. and put it in a 5 gal. food grade bucket with gamma lid. I put the odds and ends coming in from the gardens into a freezer bag I call the stir fry bag. I will use that for stir fry and 123 pasta. These are goat bag tomatoes. Very slow at ripening but when they are ready it won't take many to fill the jar. We went to a friends' annual summer get together. I made almond flour pastry cups (friend has diabetes) filled with orange and red tomatoes and a pinch of cheese, I took a loaf of bread, and made pinwheels using cream cheese mixed with a pinch of garlic powder and small dices of cucumber and tortillas and  bowl of cherry tomatoes. All was in house so no buying anything. M gave me a crate of cucumbers that I canned but had a few left.While at friends' get together, they were complaining of how high their electric bills was. Figured out that their electric price went up and they were talking about buying electric from one company and having the old company just transfer it. I pointed out that they would then have 2 bills and the old company would be charging distribution charges. That them might find that the distribution charges were what raised more than the actual kWh price.  When the husband sat down with me with his bill. I pointed out my house is twice what his is, my kWh is double what he is now paying with the increase.  That almost 2000 kWh   for that house was way higher than it should be. They said they had cut back on what they had one (just the two of them) and walked me through everywhere. I pointed out several things that was on and no one was using them. Phone chargers, tablet chargers, 2 tvs that no one was watching, desktop computer no one using, a laptop no one was using,  several garden water features, that wasn't where they would actually sit and enjoy them.... THEN their younger son walked through and pointed out that the garage fluorescent lights... all 6 of them was on and had been when he pulled in at 9 am. It was NOT dark in the garage. They have a pump on the swimming pool and the pump and heater on the hot tub. Their 2 sons started about they use the dryer for a iron. They use the oven to reheat leftovers instead of the microwave. .... We left, I figure the sons were going to finish back through the house as one is worried he is going to end up with them living with him as they run through money like tomorrow is never going to come. I did a thank you from the sons and the Husband for sharing our electric bill. He realized that high of a bill is NOT normal and that he hadn't thought about split billing. His electric company told him this morning that the distribution charge would be the same and that was what had went up not the actual cost of electric and they warned everyone 3 months ahead of that bill. Guess they didn't bother to read insert or notice on internet bill.Going to doctors this afternoon and then store to use Menards rebates.Blessed Be Prayers for peace"},

Now there is a good area at the garden shed for the 1 ton of coal to be stored since it can sit out in the weather. So he got 3 things done that was on his list for this week as he picked up 2 out of town hauls that will take all day.Daily: laundry with clothes line or drying rack.            dishes including pots and pans that don't go in washer           harvesting, weeding, and processing from gardens. Should have jade beans,             roma beans, yellow wax beans, banana peppers, poblano peppers, orange                 tomatoes, red tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, dill seed, basil, red cabbage,                     kalettes, and some other herbs. MAYBE white pumpkins.            COOK LOLThis weekBake bread. Make and dry noodles. Make and freeze wonton wrappers, eggroll wrappers, and dumpling AKA pot sticker wrappers.Reorganize pantry... fill in items low in kitchen... take things to the pantry (looking at 22 jars of pickles on the roll cart amongst other stuff)Mylar bag cornmeal and take to pantry (5 gal food safe bucket)Finish cleaning east loft bedroom and move the last of the furniture out of front room moved up there to make room for wood stove.Clip and store shallots that are curedClip and store onions that are curedIF I get that done I will check the get it done list. Had pot stickers and egg rolls Saturday, homemade pizza Sunday.Tonight is pasta as Hubby getting home time is iffy. Wednesday will be frittata as that is another iffy night of what time he gets home. Tuesday, Thursday and Friday are still up in the area. Probably a BLT  at least once.Saturday we are going to an annual get together that I am taking odd and ends for our share of the meal. The hosts provide meat and a couple sides from their gardens. Blessed be Prayers for peace All day Friday I kept telling Hubby I wished Saturday was Sunday. Friday and Saturday was harvest between rains. Friday and Saturday in the pantry/freezers16 lbs. Lg elbow mac.  7 meals of breaded zucchini5 meals of breaded green tomatoes4 meals of broccoli1 meal of broccoli for soup (stems only)4 meals of banana peppers3 meals of corn on cob5 meals of shredded zucchini mixed with yellow crookneck squash (fritters, pancakes, cake, bars and dessert ... cake like )7 qrts. dill pickles7 qrts. bread and butter pickles8 pts. spicy pickles.Refilled the bowl on the table with cherry tomatoes we snack on.Sunday was the day of rest... which was good since my readiness score on my Fitbit was 1 meaning I over did it.. today is 3 but it's raining so I won't be out in gardens until they dry up a bit. We spent most of Sunday sitting on the kitchen porch watching the rainYou can just barely see the violet on the inside Then Hubby noticed the reflection in the pondCharlotte decided it was Sunday nap time.

Last night it was down to 27...my allergies are really affecting my breathing. Doc is at wits end as I have never had them this bad. Limited on what I can take as a good part of allergy meds triggers my Crohn's and shots don't work for me.Hubby's garden is growing 3 varieties of pumpkin, a cherry tomato plant and a muskmelon. And some type of squash that isn't far enough along to ID. He had one of the Amish he hauls for that grows veggies for the auction to come over and look and get advice. He was told to level the hill off after harvest and have E bring a load of manure and dump it on it. Don't turn until next spring. The green pumpkin should turn orange but if not it is still edible.The white pumpkin is almost ripe, it will be like a butternut inside.  Blackberries have finally ended. I have 2 gallons marked to jam making this coming fall. Jade green beans are cranking down, Roma green beans and yellow wax beans are cranking up. About every 3 days I get a canner load.Hungarian peppers AKA banana peppers are every other day. I need to process today. I have enough pickled so am slicing what isn't eaten and freezing. Should work well on pizzas and subs.Cherry tomatoes are running us over, froze a gallon of them, will be roasting some with olive oil and garlic powder to put in freezer today along with going out to pick more.The baby butternut squash is making babies... lots of babies LOLThe Yukon gold potatoes are almost ready for harvest and curing. I need to finish cutting the tops off the onions that cured to make room for the potatoes as we have 59 bags/crates planted of different varieties . We ate a cantaloupe that was a volunteer... the wildlife ate the other one. I harvested and froze our first harvest of white grapes. I think the birds are going to eat the purple ones before they get ripe.I hope to have enough red tomatoes to can today. I have orange tomatoes that I can do 2 pints.M gave me 6 zucchini that needs to go in the freezer also.I found chicken breast on sale putting it in our price point range . We got the limit. I need to vacuum bag them today. IF I find another  sale I will pick up more but if I don't , it is okay we have enough for once a month for a year. I found ground pork for less than $2/lb. Got the last 5 pounds they had. Now have 7 meals of cooked crumbles, 6 meals of patties (need vacuum bagged) and we ate one pound that I used a DIY Bob Evans sausage recipe. I regret there was NO grease so I couldn't make sausage gravy with the left over 2 patties. I have tricolor rotini to change from the box to jars to put in storage.The good news was we were paid back from a friend  so we have all the money for the grid down items and was able to stock... we thought KEY WORD THERE thought all we had left to save for was health ins out of pocket for 2023... WRONG.Took our personal truck to get it's 6 month check over by our mechanic. Thought we had a brake messing up as we heard a crunch, grind noise. NOPE THE frame is rusted almost out and we need to replace the truck, probably by winter. We already learnt the lesson of buying something just to have something (hated the car but Daughter 4 loved it so bought it off us). We know we need a truck as we haul a small trailer behind about half the time and we don't want to use the work truck for personal use(nightmare with taxes).  Hubby said something about used... I checked those prices and decided we would save for new. If we don't have enough save when the truck goes down, we might settle for used. BUT I am thinking if we can manage it I would rather buy one that is 1 yr. old so we are not replacing it for 10-20 yrs. We will see how this one goes."},

{"title": "UGH. ", "date": "Thursday, July 28, 2022", "text": "I told Hubby I was tired. Breathing was messed up through the night, probably allergies since I spent 8 hrs. each day in the gardens yesterday and the day before.He told me to take the day off . THEN as he walked out the door to his hauling job, mentioned the dishwasher still needed unloaded and reloaded and he had 2 items needing pretreated before they were washed and they were on the floor of the laundry room and we were out of boiled eggs and he forgot to put the blackberries in the freezer. Work done this week:Helped widow two houses down with charging her dead battery, spraying her driveway for weeds and going through so legal paperwork that was confusing her. Hubby dealt with the battery and weeds. Since I dealt with that paperwork before (I was widowed in 1989) I got that part. She was making it harder than what is was. I updated our finances and we went over the get it done list.Cleared 2nd wardrobe so we can take it upstairs from front room.I canned green beans, broth, turnips, and beets and froze blackberries, angel food cake and a handful of red raspberries.I loaded, dehydrated and unloaded 27 trays twice.I put over a dozen dill heads (for dill seeds) in paper bags.I harvest and have curing 50 onions.I planted 50 more onions.Hubby checks his \"garden\" daily. He thinks pumpkin, maybe a zucchini and he's not sure if the other is cucumber or a different zucchini. He doubts if the corn does anything unless the field across the road in corn pollenates it.I harvested, weeded and replanted 32 (actually 34 as 2 are 16 ft long instead of the 8 ft of the others) garden beds . I watered all of it (will have to water daily where I planted carrots until they are up) and the 59 potato bags/crates.  We got 5 very small (golf ball size) peaches. First time our tree fruited. I fertilized 2 dozen pots of flowers, herbs and cherry tomatoes.Hubby spent so far 20 hrs. removing cow poop from our pond. E feels horrible and would love to help but Hubby is using a trash pump (think septic tank pump of a smaller size) to remove it. He has gotten it clear 3 times now and then it rains and brings more up from the bottom. E said he will never put a cow anywhere near a pond or stream again. We are trying to get it clear so they can use the pond to cut ice for their ice houses. Otherwise several families are not going to have ice next Jan/Feb. when they usually cut. I would add the geese, duck (first time for that) and heron have been in the pond fishing... that's a good sign.I have one room completely deep cleaned. I thought maybe 4 hrs. since it's a small room... took 2 days. SIGH . Old age sucks.  Still needed to be done:I have grapes to harvest, zucchini to deal with, cucumbers to deal with, cherry tomatoes and a few red oxheart tomatoes to deal with.  A large head of cabbage was given to us that I need to deal with. I need to blanche the last of the broccoli. Our cauliflower did not make so I will buy some and process it for the freezer. Apple trees took a really bad hit with the freeze that came in after the blooms were on so we will need to buy apples.I rechecked the need to stock list. Instead of getting sausage dinner patties I want to get some ground pork to cook up for eggroll in a bowl. I can use part of the cabbage we have in that along with the carrot I already have. We still need chicken thighs, breasts, and wings. Still need turkey and Jif peanut butter.How is your week going? Blessed BePrayers for peaceStay safe."},
{"title": "done this week", "date": "Wednesday, July 20, 2022", "text": "She makes sure we sit outside with her every morning... we are wondering if this is going to be a winter thing also and need our insulated bibs. It's nice to see the sun rise and enjoy coffee just looking across the land and not really thinking about what needs done like the pond needing another cleaning of cow manure. E is trying to borrow a small boat from his brother to help get it cleaned out since it was HIS COW.  Which is a lot of stuff to not think about aka house work, garden work, yard work, cutting wood. 😏Windows are open and the AC has been off. That will change tonight with the humidity being high along with temps and Hubby putting in a 600 mile trip tomorrow hauling so he definitely needs a good rest tonight.I harvested broccoli, cherry tomatoes, leaf lettuce (that came where I cut the head lettuce) green tomatoes, green beans, banana peppers , a small handful of red raspberries and a couple cups of blackberries.  I am trying to not use the veggies and fruit from pantry or freezers except for meat at this point. Makes for so weird meals as I did a quick stir fry on cherry tomatoes, banana peppers, and green beans with onions and garlic. The night before it was cherry tomatoes with ramen pasta and diced up shrimp in garlic butter sauce.We didn't go to the store on Tuesday as normal after chiro since the truck was making creaky noises we went to our mechanic instead. Truck goes in Aug 2nd for work. We have blood work, chiro and voting that day also. Friday will be grocery day including stopping at Amish road side markets.This week I have read The Puma Years (Kindle Unlimited) by Laura Coleman and 3 books by Ted Riley (Kindle Unlimited) Grid Down Situation, The Prepper's pantry and When Crisis Hits Suburbia.  FYI, Hubby is HAM radio operator, his group is connected to Emergency Services and Homeland Security. All the \"solar flares\" that NASA is warning about does trigger anxiety some what it could take out in the Emergency Services. I think the grid going down for almost a week just east of us taking out phone service along with the power also has  bumped up the concerns. Speaking of Grid down.... The Heco 520 and the 1 ton of anthracite coal  is to be delivered mid August. As of last week we had the final amount put in savings to pay for it. HUGE sigh of relief.The chimney for stove ordered and money in the savings.Solar deep well water pump will be in during the last of Sept. It's paid for but the batteries for it not ordered yet. When that amount is in savings then Hubby will order them. Propane due in Sept. We decided to cut the propane down to 800 gallons, might bring that up to 1000 if the Heco stove doesn't come in during Aug. That money (even if goes up to 1000 gallons) is in the saving as of last week.Hubby thinks he has enough wood for this year. He just has to finish cutting it.  We wanted 3 cords hard wood and 1 cord kindling (soft wood and twigs) . He hasn't had much chance to cut wood with the rain. 1 cord is 4 ft by 4 ft by 8 ft or 128 sq ft. Any time the temperature goes down to 32 degrees and holds there we will be burning coal. We have paid $40 for the wood, the rest of it was free. Going rate around here is $300 to $500 for a cord of seasoned wood cut to order. The oil for the oil lamps will be in also in Aug. The money is in savings. The guy that will get the stove and coal will have the oil also.Finances got a lot easier when a person owed us money finally paid it back. I put the money back to pay what we ordered plus extra for emergencies.  We are staying on the grocery budget and keeping the stock up separate with extra money so I pulled cash for the stock up so it's not tempting to get more than we have Then we looked at the stock up list that was a want if we had extra $$. I got pasta we were low on. We will be checking prices on chicken, peanut butter and dinner sausages (or bulk sausage to make dinner sausages since we don't eat a whole pound in one go) when we go to the store.I rechecked the pantry to see what I have coming in and what I will still need to process, I will need to check with a couple of the Amish ladies about beets. I probably should have had Hubby plant them in the compost pile LOL In the garden... tomatoes have bottom rot, treating that and it seems to be getting a lot better. I think I caught it before it got bad. Second planting of green beans are blooming, some of the potato plants are blooming, the baby butternut is blooming , cabbage is doing good. I hope to make kraut this year. The red cabbage is slower but it seems to be doing good. Don't think the cauliflower it going to do well. There are blooms all over on Hubby's garden aka compost pile. The majority is definitely winter squash of some type.Blessed BeStay safePrayers for peace"},

Now we have several squash vines that could be pumpkin, acorn, butternut, zucchini, crock neck, watermelon or cantaloupe. There is he thinks a cucumber vine.

He replaced his saw to cut the wood for the wood/coal stove.... It's a buzz saw that has connects to the tractor ... the tractor is the \"motor\" that runs the saw (like his tiller, back hoe etc.). It will cut his time spent cutting by 75%. He is going to set up a table so he doesn't have to cut wood in half and can run it like a table saw cutting plyboard.He has learned that you don't lean forward and to have a good grip on the guard He was thankful it didn't really cut the nose(nasty scrape) or break his glasses... It didn't break his nose. I kept my mouth shut as E was giving him the lecture of why you don't use that type of saw without a second person with you and he checked Hubby out. Lesson learned (I HOPE)"},
{"title": "Changing focus on groceries", "date": "Friday, July 8, 2022", "text": "It's Friday...After talking about the budget for gas. I brought up to Hubby that I was stocking for 2 yrs as I didn't know if we were going to be able to afford to redo the gardens next spring even with us sifting dirt. We would have to buy more weed barrier to use slab wood as Hubby has found potato plants growing out the sides of the slab wood potato crates he made. Or buy plyboard (not particle board like he did the last time) and paint it to seal it. I finished cleaning, defrosting and organizing the 4 deep freezers( barn will need done again this fall).We decided to have 2 yrs of main entrees for bfast, lunch and supper. That is 2,190 meals... Hope you were sitting down and not walking while reading this on your cell phone. We are set for beef for 2 yrs if I am careful. I even have the prime rib for Christmas eve. I might have to buy one for next year. I have a few steaks that can be for Hubby's birthday in Oct.We are set for pork (except for sausage patties) for 2 yrs if I am careful. I want to buy dinner sausage patties but they haven't been in stock from the butcher shop we get them from. I will only need bulk sausage if we run low on chili. I think I have enough chili canned to go 2 yrs. I can stretch that if I make white chili. I have brat patties so we might just go with out the sausage patties. I have 3 pork butt roasts that were in the bottom of the freezer that I didn't know I still had that can make several meals. I have enough canned fish for this year. We don't eat it a lot. I don't \"stock\" this up for more than 6 months at a time. I will have to get frozen shrimp (or go without) at holidays.I have cheese for 1 yr. I am not willing to fill the freezers with more. LOL. I do have Velveeta cheese pouches that are good for 18 months. The blocks go bad on us before we get them used. I have pasta, we will run out of our favorites but we can suck it up and use other stuff. I make my own noodles and since Son 2 made his own ...  plan to make ravioli.I have 6 dozen eggs that have been beaten up and put in sandwich bags then freezer bags. Half in 2 eggs/ bag the other half 1 egg/ bag. I can use them for baking, egg sandwich, frittata, quiche and omelets.  I usually get 2 dozen a week FREE from M but when her chickens don't lay in the winter, I don't want to head to the store. I have 11 different types of beans, some are dried and some I canned for quick meals. Plenty for 2 yrs.What I don't have enough of is POULTRY. I have 3 meals of chicken breast (me) and chicken thighs(Hubby) . I have 2 meals of wings. I have a quart of turkey meat in the freezer.  I have 3 roasting chickens. Those can make 3 meals each as they are not very big ( I prefer 6-8 lbs, these are 4 1/2). I will get at least 2 turkeys (maybe more depending on price) Not sure about chicken at this point with the prices.SO what is the plan to have enough? Bfast: I have oats (steel cut, regular, instant) that can be porridge or fried, cream of wheat, grits, barley, millet(never had but Daughter 4 likes), bulgur wheat, corn meal (polenta and mush) and assorted flours for pancakes, waffles and fried bread dough (Daddy called it knee bread as his sisters would take bread dough that had not raised yet and stretch it over their knee and then fry it in the skillet) Eggs of course... fruit pie, custard/custard pie and cake will also be there. I have oil for pie dough (like Daddy used) if I run out of butter (not likely as M is now sending that also) Lunch is iffy as if he is hauling he is not at home, I just pick either left overs or cheese and crackers( have some in pantry, will make them when I run out). Might be good to make room in freezers for personal size pizza as I have cooked sausage and pepperoni ( I dice my slices to make it go farther) I could use for that. He will eat what ever I tell him to. 😉Dinner we will rotate beef/ pork/poultry/ fish and eggs as Hubby isn't a fish eater/ cheese (think grilled cheese, cheese soup with broccoli or something, cheese and crackers, mac and cheese etc. /beans/ soups/vegetarian and pasta.So what does that leave me to buy (besides chicken, sausage patties, and fish) Milk/ half and half/ heavy cream. Biweekly.Celery/ carrots (might try bucket growing next year) tri colored bell peppers/ fresh mushrooms once a month.I make our own bread. I will start making tortillas, bagels and English muffins.  I will also try crescents,  croissants and popovers.I set the food budget for $50. Should cost less than $40 but I can see once in awhile picking some thing up like onions at end of winter or potatoes.(Fingers crossed ours does well and hold through the winter). I have $300 back for the rest of the meat.I need to pick up speltz (50 cents a pound)  and maybe peanut butter at the Amish bulk store.  IF we eat from the pantry we should be able to pay cash for wood stove, chimney and propane. It will be close with having to by a buzz saw (Hubby's saw died while cutting wood and 2 of the Amish who was going to cut it for him... broke their own saws) and batteries for the solar water pump.  This is hard wood that Hubby is cutting up for our wood stove. It is about 2 cords. We have been advised to have 5-6 cords even though we have a propane furnace also. Stove guy said the stove and 1 ton of coal is coming in August... might be the first or the last part of the month. You never can tell now days.Son 2 and his lady and a couple of friends of ours met at the Hong Kong buffet. Been about 2 yrs since we did that. Son 2 paid for our meals and left good tip for the lady for keeping the glasses filled and the table cleared.We went to Kroger's before eating. We were out of tortilla wraps... the ones I make mold within 3 days. Granddaughter found one that is supposed to do well even if frozen that makes a small amount. So that should be the last time I buy tortilla wraps.We usually get Mission tortilla wraps... I am not paying $4.52 for tortilla wraps so I got Kroger brand that was $1/each.  I got a package of bagels free (Kroger coupon) and found thin bagels (haven't found them in 2 yrs) on sale and a package of English muffins on sale. On the way home we got gas ($4.67 here, got it for $4.27 on way home). Hubby asked what the budget for fuel was... I said WAY TOO LOW. I had actually changed a doctor's appt for a couple months due to gas budget this month. We have one more doctor appt for both of us, depending on weather we might use the motorcycle. Just so we can stretch this tank to the end of the month. Savings for the wood/coal stove, chimney, and propane is holding  but not increasing. Hubby switched who had his IRA and that payment might not come in on time to pay the mortgage and health ins from it so it might have to come from the savings. Going to have to rework the budget due to fuel. Hubby just increased his rates for hauling. Amish didn't bat an eye. Blessed be, pray for peace"},

{"title": "FRUGAL JULY", "date": "Sunday, July 3, 2022", "text": "https://www.frugalwoods.com/2022/06/23/join-me-for-the-july-2022-uber-frugal-month-challenge/I have joined this challenge for years and she usually does it twice a year.I told Hubby we were doing it again. We are 1/3rd to having what we need to pay off the grid items and  next year's health ins deductible. I moved money to savings after paying the bills. Left only a couple hundred in checking and Hubby decided to leave his personal credit card at home. He has to carry the business one as he usually gets diesel once a day if he has worked all day hauling. He handed me a list of two things we might need to buy , batteries for the solar pump that he hasn't even priced (update... $1000 for the 2 batteries) but will need when it comes in and a new saw (his table saw died so he is using a small chain saw) to cut the wood he is bringing home (update...hasn't found anything that will work better) . Groceries will be, milk, heavy cream and half and half.  Dog food for Charlotte. No stock up bought. It will go on a list for later. Will do  celery, carrots, fresh mushrooms and tricolored bell peppers(I can't eat green which is actually not ripe bell peppers) once a month. Grocery budget is set at $200. He frowned when I said NO EATING OUT. He said he noticed more and more of the Amish men are eating what he calls a lettuce sandwich, the lettuce has replaced the bread and there is only 1 lettuce leaf. We have plenty of lettuce in the garden at the moment LOL. Instead of spending $300/cord of wood (going price) he is lending an Amish his small trailer to haul wood (not cured yet) to the Amish's dad and a widow and reloading the trailer with leftover slab wood from his saw mill which is CURED hard wood. Means we don't have to stack it twice, once for curing, lots of air needed etc. compared to cutting and stacking directly in to barn . We won't need much if any kindling wood and we can get that for free from E. We should get another load in a couple weeks from the other guy. Gives Hubby a chance to catch up with cutting it.(Side Note, E has offered to come over and finish cutting slab wood since he borrowed his brother's saw to get some of his own wood cut) Hubby signed the papers to have his IRAs transferred to the same place I go. The other place said Hubby need to have 10 % on federal taxes (I said 15%) My guy had me call who did our taxes and she said 14% average is good ball park figure. Do not want to owe a lot but don't need to give the gov't an interest free loan of our money.  We would have owed over $3000 in federal taxes if he had agreed to the 10% federal tax.  Hubby called them and let them know he was transferring his money. He also told them the 10% would have cost him over $3000 in federal taxes as it was an incorrect amount. The office manager called when she got back from her vacation and told him she would have never let it go through as she knows there is other income in the home and that changes the rate of taxes. She had the corp. send notices out to ALL to not base taxes only on what is being with drawled but on total income of household. Glad we said something. My place charges 1/5th of what Hubby's place charges plus it's 25 mins. away AND we can go see his parents at the same time. That will also save us $125/ year in gas AND 10 hrs. of travel time. Even with it being hot we have still kept the AC off. ONLY if the house gets 85 do we turn on the AC and then will shut it down when the outside temp drops below that. Harvest from the gardens. 1 tomato, several cherry tomatoes, lettuce, turnips (greens dehydrated), scallions, red raspberries, and blackberries.Given 4 zucchini, 6 dozen eggs, and a raspberry pie.I made angel food cake (had peaches and mixed berries as options to put on it) and peach ice cream. Meals were:fried egg sandwich with saladHomemade pizza TwiceBLT wrapszucchini bread pancakes  Lunch meat wraps (finished lunch meat)Frittata"},
{"title": "HUBBY RANTING", "date": "Thursday, June 23, 2022", "text": "This is NOT normal !!He called his IRA guy 6 wks. ago and asked about maybe changing how he was invested, how the account was handling the withdraws etc. Guy told him everything was okay, don't panic etc. As the account was lower than we liked we were iffy about things being okay... after all we LIVED through 2008 when Daddy lost 75% of his money and had to go to living on Social Security (which wasn't much after Medicare came out).Last week we got a call to schedule coming in. Didn't think much of it since my IRA guy had already scheduled my bi yearly appt. Talk about someone being in a panic attack. Hubby's finance guy was \" you need to change how you are invested since you are at 85/15 ... pulled out the papers and found Hubby had suggested 75/25 and the guy TOLD him 80/20 would do us better for what we were trying to do and then he cranked it up to 85 (at one time it showed 90). We were pulling far too much .Hum, it's our money and we are okay if we run out of that acct. and made that clear when we went in. AND then suggested I move my IRA to them.... I firmly told the guy No never. I was staying with who been there for my dad for over 30 years including 2008. My acct. was making money, even with how the market was doing. He said I was too comfortable and confident in my people. The young man did suggest then we move Hubby's acct. to ease dealing with two accts two hours away. Mine is 30 minutes. We didn't think about distance as we focused it was closer to our son who would be handling the acct. when we died.Hubby told him he had things to think over. I could tell he was doing his best to keep his mouth shut. As we got in the car to drive an hour to our chiro (and again to drive home from chiro) he cut loose.We see my guy on Tuesday for my bi annual meeting. He is asking what it will cost to move his money in Dec... or should he move it sooner. He has lost confidence in the company. Called the guy who recommended them as he was with them and his parents were also. He said he was changing (to the same people I go to) due to how they were all about employee and not about clients. Mean time I am looking to see if we can live on Social Security only in 2023 instead of 2024. Going back to The Prudent Homemaker and reading How to Cut expenses when you think you have nothing left to cut."},
{"title": "What can I do today to save?", "date": "Monday, June 20, 2022", "text": "Has became the daily question.Saturday we found pork butt and pork loin marked down. I sliced the loin into pork chops and froze them. The pork butt is now in quart jars in the canner...the scraps and bones in the oven roasting. I'll pick what ever meat is left and use it this week when the temps hit above 90 and heat indices are in the 100s again. We also got some smoked sausage links the size of hot dogs. Works nice for a quick sandwich that Hubby can take with him while working or sliced into 123 pasta (one onion, 2 cups of protein and 3 cups of veggies with 1 lbs. of pasta... sauce is what ever).  Those are now in the freezer .  We haven't turned the AC on since Thurs when the heat wave went down to 85. That will change probably tomorrow.I harvest peas, lavender, mint, dill , onions, cherry tomatoes, turnips, radishes, lettuce, spinach and basil from the gardens. PLUS a few red raspberries that  the rest should be turning by this weekend along with the blackberries. Some of the potatoes are getting blooms.The electric bill dropped $15. I think that is because we are making sure the fans are not running when we are not in the room and opening the windows in the morning until it's 80 before Hubby turns on the AC. He also agreed to set that temp at 78. He prefers a bit cooler but since we are saving for the wood/coal stove he is willing to be warmer. LOLWe have started our mornings on the kitchen porch with coffee so often Charlotte now goes out and get a seat and waits for us. If we don't come out she comes back in and woofs softly then goes back out. We now have 3 chairs for the 3 of us LOL.I have been using the laundry of the day to block the sun out of the kitchenI did have to add an old shower curtain to block the very end. It is lacy so we can still see through it. M sent over 2 1/2 dozen eggs. I beat them up and put in freezer in 2 egg measurements. Apparently her chickens are running her family of 11 over in eggs.We found country style pork spareribs on clearance. I let them sit in homemade BBQ sauce and a bottle of coke over night, turning the bag they were in when I thought about it. Hubby grilled them and we had 3 meals from 6 ribs. We had \"salad\" from the garden every other day. We haven't gotten rain since last Monday so I will be out tonight watering the gardens.For what ever reason she has decided she needs to lay in this potato bed. She isn't on the plants them selves so I am at least thankful of that. Hubby will be adding straw to it in the coming week so maybe she will stay out of it then.But she's done this since we put it out and planted it. She won't sleep in a dog bed. She is weird LOL"},
{"title": "GRID DOWN ", "date": "Thursday, June 16, 2022", "text": "Not ours but our family. Central Ohio has been without electric since Monday night between storms, tornados and the heat wave with feel like temps 105 to 115. It has been horrible for those going through this. Some still don't have electric and it's a maybe for tomorrow. A lot of nursing homes, assistant living  and hospital are on emergency power and can't open windows for what little breeze there is. Hubby's brother and sister lost everything in their freezers and refrigerators. I can tell you that is a financial hit big time for his sister who is already on a strict budget on low income. His parents are on generator on their propane so the frig and freezer are okay but they can't run their AC on it. They were thankful they grew up without AC and knew what to do to keep the house cool. Gave advice to several of their grandkids. ( Our kids didn't grow up with AC).Most home insurance policies will not cover much of lost food unless by fire. Some won't then. SO you might want to check your policies. Hubby's parents thought we were stupid for preparing for the grid to go down... they don't now. BUT I did point out to Hubby I needed to be canning more of our meat. I have froze snow peas, peas and strawberries though the majority of the berries are in pie filling and jam. I am now dehydrating the last of them. I should have the last in the dehydrator today.It made us stop and think if we were preparing enough to be off grid.This is Charlotte at 7 A.M. as I was putting laundry out and Hubby was making sure E's two cows' water barrel was full.One of the ways I am keeping the house cooler so the A.C. doesn't run as much.side purpose is to dry the laundry. ;)Tonight is salad with what ever we can use without me turning on the stove so no boiled eggs or pasta."},
{"title": "I will admit ", "date": "Monday, June 13, 2022", "text": "We are both dragging butts. BUT we knew this week we would be under a heat warning so hauled butt last week through the weekend to get the outside work mostly done. We can work inside the house this week since we are moving furniture around due to wood stove coming in during August... figures crossed as you never know is something is going to come in when they say it will.Hubby bartered the use of his small trailer for a cord of seasoned hard wood.I only bought what was on my wish list (actually it's a need list but not immediate need) when it came on sale and I have points I could use. I pulled the snow peas and garden peas that were dying. I have 4 more varieties of peas yet blooming.  I harvested strawberries... we might have one more round to pick it the bunny and birds haven't gotten to what few were left over Sunday. Lettuce leaves are daily now, a few radishes left and we have plenty of scallions. I don't have tomatoes but the Amish around the corner does so I will be pit stopping there to get some for this week. I have blooms but not tomatoes at this point.I finished planting the summer crops and most likely will run myself over at harvest time. I do have 6 square pots I want to plant with \"salad\" stuff to try to keep it on the table through the heat of the summer. I just need to figure out where I am going to put it. I am watching the sun light in the area between the house and the deck ramp thinking it might be a good place.I checked the IRAs, check where we were for saving for grid down stuff. Checked about replacing the garden boxes that are falling apart and got our propane contract early and was pleased to see it less than $3/ gallon. I decided on 1500 gallons for winter contract and will pay for a summer fill if we need it.I am really trying to limit the propane use from the main tank by using the electric water kettle for hot water instead of running water until I get hot water. We don't pay for water as we have a well but we do pay the electric to run the pump to get the water. I was still able to drop the electric bill another $10. I think it's mostly that we are outside  so not running the ceiling fans. Curtains open in the evening so not turning on lights. I imagine it will go up when the AC is on this week with 110 heat index.  Then I had a sit down with Hubby over finances. I pointed out how much his IRA has lost (mine hasn't that much as I am more conservative than him) and that at this rate he would be through his IRA in a couple years (I had this talk before). I SHOWED him what we could do to not draw as much (like 1/3rd of what he is drawing now) and be okay. No we would not pay extra on the mortgage for the remainder of this year or any next year. No we would not be buying willy nilly. Like the whole house insect system he just wanted at $1500. No that does not take in any income from his business or me earning it from the gardens or work. It's not something we can count on. We would have to use the slab wood for making new garden beds or save it from extra income if it is there. We would be sifting a lot of dirt to reuse, I have some fertilizer that we can add to it to improve the soil. I am sure E would give us manure if needed. BUT it would give time for his IRA to recover since he is changing how it's being invested this month. One way to stay out of the sun , is to lay under the lilac bush.Spying on the Amish neighbor while he runs his saw mill just incase he has his dog Pepper with him that she hates. She is standing on the back of the old love seat that we call the dog seat as all the dogs used it to either sit on or sleep on. Hubby is sitting at his desk doing paperwork.Sweet baby needs a nap and made herself a bed on my bed AFTER keeping me up half the night due to rain (not storms) coming in. I think if I had a cot and slept with her in the basement she would settle. Wilbur used to do that with her."},

I harvested mint and red raspberry leaves for teas.Love my peonies that have bloomed. I can sit on the deck and smell them. Reminds me of sitting at Daddy's and Mother's bedroom window where Daddy had planted them for Mother.SIGH, well at least she didn't dig the potatoes up that is planted in that box. Hubby cleared the drain pipe he has stuck in the small lean to on the barn hoping she will lay there instead. Otherwise those potatoes probably won't make.The summer curtains are up so that's off the to do list. Deep freezer #1 has been cleared of bad food (not much but I do need to stay with vacuum bags instead of freezer bags), reorganized and inventoried.  I now have only the other 2 deep freezers to do. The last 2 days has been finish planting potatoes, harvesting spinach, strawberries, lettuce, scallions, radishes and a couple cherry tomatoes. WEEDING... LOL Catching the yard work up since it is now dry enough as we got almost 3 inches of rain in 2 days. We got 7 items on the grid list done, 3 on order and paid for (wood/coal stove, solar pump and chimney for stove). We have 5 left to to get done. Have to save up the cash for those.I've been hanging the wash on the kitchen clothes line so it blocks the sun from heating up the house. We have been opening the windows in the mornings to get the coolness in. I opened the skylight and the floor vent (old fashion cast iron floor vent) in the lofts to have the heat go up to help cool the 1st floor. We run the ceiling fans while sleeping if too warm. AC and box fans have not been on yet even though we hit high 80s the humidity is still low.Meals are light and from the pantry. Left over water from dog bowls, glasses etc was used to water flowers. If flowers didn't need it I poured it in the drain off the kitchen porch that goes to the pond as last year I was having to run the well pump to keep enough water in to not have a fish kill on my hands.I reworked the budget since the \"grid down\" stuff whacked out the get the mortgage paid off. ADD on top of the stock market hitting the IRA's. It's nice for both our IRA guys to call and keep us up to date with what is going on, how they are handling it and what we can do on our end to help keep things stable.I want to tweak it a bit more for setting it in stone. Blessed Be Prayers for peace. Stay safe"},

F came with Hubby to unload it  and set the time including having it go silent during the night and winding it etc. He also picked some asparagus ( almost done with it). We also made the final payment for the clock.F also helped Hubby load Son2's cabinet into the back of our truck.Next day we took cabinet to Son2's, spent time with him, his lady and her daughter and Son2 bought us  lunch at a local restaurant and then gave us a gift certificate for our local Chinese restaurant. On the way home we did some errands and then ate leftovers for supper.Sunday, I updated the \"down grid spreadsheet.\" Since we spent less than we budgeted for the solar pump, I moved it over to the odds and ends needed for the wood stove like chimney thermometer, ash bucket, companion set that has shovel, brush etc. through Amazon. Used my cash back points, a discount and a coupon saving 50% of that costs. Any amount that is not used gets moved to what still needs to be paid for.I caught up the laundry and used the clothes line. I worked on #1 deep freezer in the basement.

{"title": "Frugal moments", "date": "Thursday, May 19, 2022", "text": "Furnace has been doing short cycles. Our HVAC guy suggested new thermostat. I love the new one as I can read it from across the room and don't have to touch it to see what the temperature is. BUT that didn't solve the problem. Another HVAC friend suggested we check the intake and exhaust pipes and we found a birds nest in the intake. We thought there was screens on the ends but if there was, there isn't now. Hubby got the nest out and let our HVAC guy know and to see how to make sure nothing got sucked into the line and to stop it from happening again. Our HVAC guy doesn't charge for calls or texts for information (we had one that did).Since our weather has been mid 70s to almost 90 and then down to low 60s. I turned the schedule off on the furnace and only run it when it gets down to 68 unless the sun is shining and it's around noon. After noon we get a lot of sun from the French doors in the kitchen/dining area so we don't bother to turn the furnace up. The house heats up by a good 3-5 degrees.I have started checking as Hubby forgets to turn the ceiling fan off when he leaves the front room.I am monitoring how much rain we get. If we get an inch of water in 7 days, I do not water. M sent over 8 red oxheart tomatoes and 4 goat bag tomatoes. Last year both varieties only took 1 tomato to fill a pint jar. I have never seen a tomato get that big.Asparagus is almost done. We have a year's supply between the freezer and the pickling of them. We have shared with E and M and 3 other families. We both are tired of having asparagus every day. Even M said her family is getting tired of asparagus. Chives, garlic chives, spinach and rhubarb are ready also. Peas, strawberries and blackberries are blooming.We have limited how much ice we are getting in our glasses. I told Hubby if he had ice still to not dump it in the sink but in the dog's water bowls. He mentioned he probably didn't need to get that much to begin with. Charlotte, our dog has one water bowl in house and one on the kitchen porch. Out of habit I have always did this. It wasn't until the other day I saw him dumping his ice in the sink before putting the glass in the dishwasher that I realized he wasn't.I am using the family size tea bags to make hot tea (water kettle ), then letting it cool for ice tea... both of us are starting to just drink it as room temperature. I also use the bag a second time and just let it steep longer.MEALSFirst we had Arby's thanks to an Amish family Hubby did some message running for. From the pantry:bacon, eggs (free from M) and asparagus. cheeseburger with spinach instead of lettuce , last of the French fries, asparagus smoked sausage with fried onions , mac and cheese, asparagusleftover mac and cheese with spinach saladpork chop, rice and veggie mix of onions and bell peppersleftover porkchop, rice, onions and bell pepper turned into stir fry.Last of turkey and ham lunchmeats into tortilla wraps.pancakes with homemade peach pie filling instead of maple syrup( from M), eggs(from M), homemade potatoes O'Brien. I had some friends give me a heads up  about a possible salt shortage..https://www.tridge.com/news/celestun-producers-forecast-salt-shortage-by-2022#:~:text=Surely%20by%202022%20there%20will,one%20of%20the%20main%20producers.I am not out but will be by mid summer instead of waiting I priced my local stores and then a couple over in another area that one of the kids live in and Amazon was the cheapest. I made sure I have canning/pickling salt, sea salt and table salt. I also ordered pepper as it is the last spice I have on my list.I can not find 5 lbs. bag of yellow corn meal. I even asked a couple bulk stores. they said it's on order but said they were iffy because most grains that are coming in are on a limited bases. I found some on line and ordered it. I am down to 16 oz of yellow corn meal.Unless I get speltz (Amish spelling) which I can get locally , my grains are or will be in stock by the end of this month.I had a friend give me an e-gift card from King Arthur that I used.

Son 2 has put in his retirement package and just went to the range for the last time. He doesn't think they will send him to annual training. He is hoping to get completely out (normal time out date is 6 months from putting in package) in Sept when he turns 40s. First time we have had a Baltimore oriole here. This is a male, the female flew before Hubby could get his phone out. Hummingbird was not happy he was sitting there.I was asked about storing winter clothes in our barn and mice. One we use Rubber Maid containers that mice are not fond of eating through. Two we have a gizmo called Pest Repeller (Amazon) that have worked wonders. I have noticed hawks and Amish barn cats visit our barn off and on in the back stalls where the horses used to be kept when this was owned by Amish. Off season items are in barn enclosed loft.Cutting the electric...Hubby asked how I did this also. It's little thingsPhantom aka vampire power users is horrible. I unplugged all extension cords that had stuff on it but not being used  and power strips that have a on button light that not being use.Full freezers and not packed to the gills refrigerators do better energy wise.I unplugged the DVD player in the front room (I would not turn off or unplug cable box or phone modem, most updates are during the night)I unplugged cell phone charger station and got in the routine of charging the cell phone while watching the news and not leaving it charging over night anywhere. Hubby has started charging his when hauling and only charging in the house when he doesn't haul which is usually Sunday and Tuesday.I put the second tv, radio, my laptop etc. on a power strip (that does not have a on button light) and turn it off when not using.We turn the coffee pots warming plates off (yes, pots as we don't drink the same strength of coffee) after second cup of coffee. Hubby cut his coffee consumption in half so that cut that power in half since he is only brewing every other day instead of daily. We don't have issues with leftover coffee. That also cut the amount of coffee having to buy.I cut the amount of from 4 to 1on night lights ,even though I am using holiday candles that use LED lights. I don't close the curtains completely on the side of the house the security light is. It helps as a night light.I turned the furnace down, it's propane but has electrotonic ignition so  it's not coming on as much. I stopped turning on the water with my left hand... that's the hot water and 9 times out of 10 I wasn't needing hot water. Propane instant ready water heater , still electrotonic ignition plus it would pull propane. Saving the propane also. In the past week we have used less than 1% propane.I run shorter cycle of the clothes washer and the dish washer. Don't use the dryer on either, except maybe every 3rd month. I only run full loads in the dish washer. Since I dry clothes on a drying rack or on the clothes line I do laundry daily with cold water.I put the radio in the barn on a timer other wise all sorts of lights flicker on it while plugged in  and Hubby doesn't think to unplug it or turn the power strip off... pretty electric vampire is what son 2 called it and since it was HIS , he should know.I told Hubby that within 30 mins. of him getting in his recliner to sleep that he is passed out. I've turned off light by him and tv several times. So now he is trying to set the tv to go off in 30 mins. instead of the 90 mins he was doing and turn off the light as soon as he is done setting the timer. Blessed BeStay safePrayers for peace"},

Sent email. They immediately sent lid and weights... even  though the lid and weights were wrapped good and the box was not damaged. The lid was broke. I am guessing since the weights could shift in the box, they hit the lid. Company is sending new lid and credited my credit card for the issues. Hubby told me to just pitch it and let it go. Nope that is not happening.Turned off 3 nightlights.Turned off all the grow lights (10 bulbs).Cut the electric bill by $35. BEFORE turning off the lights. Washing and drying on yard clothes line the summer bedding for 5 beds. Furniture covers will be next and I am hoping to get the summer curtains done also. I doubt if the warm weather will stay long enough to get the summer clothes done. Might do the winter bedding and curtains before the clothes as they can always go on the drying rack if things turn wet. Have plants to go in the gardens. Hubby is not working Friday so that will be planting day.Son2 had to go out of town, his friend offered to take care of his cats so I did not drive 4 hrs. and lose two days (as I would stay over night) in the gardens. I got my back injections on Monday. Instead of eating out like usual we have cheese and crackers and water in the parking lot before driving home.Tuesday we \"pit stopped\" at a friends' house to drop off eggs and asparagus then we had 2 doctor appts, drop off of meds to the city police that I don't take any more, stop at Dollar General for 2 graduation cards, furniture polish and heavy duty foil and then went to Texas Roadhouse using a could gift certificates Daughter 2 gave us. We now have enough leftovers for the next couple of days.Which is good since Hubby doesn't know when he will get home. He was suppose to haul 1 load on Wednesday, got a call at 8 am. and it became 2 1/2 loads. Got another call and it became 4 loads... possible 5 which means part of it will be done Wednesday and Thursday as the company that is getting the deliveries closes at 3 pm. Ran by Amish that has chores to do before supper. Hubby actually likes they are that way because that means he is home by 4 himself instead of 7 as the other company is open to 6 and is an hr. away. TNo groceries bought though we will need milk... Amish selling milk for $5-$7 a gallon. NON GMO, fresh etc. Have to sign a waver to buy it. Some require you to buy a share of the cow. Depends on the laws in that area. I am not spending that at this time.I am keeping track of costs for the \"off the grid\" stuff. Keeps us on budget for sure.AND the get it done list is growing by leaps and bounds."},

{"title": "How our childhood affects our adult lives.", "date": "Wednesday, May 4, 2022", "text": "First I need to share what Hubby did.This is the small trailer we used to move everything here 4 yrs ago. These are the sides Hubby built for it to protect our furniture. This is  1.5 cord of wood, maybe a bit more but it's not 2 cords. He got it for $30 because the Amish guy wanted it hauled away or he was going to burn it in the field as it's scraps from his pallet shop. Hubby gave the boys that loaded it with him $10.Hubby grew up on a sharecropper farm. I wouldn't have called it that but that's the term he used. Their bills were paid by the owner and they were able to write checks for what ever else they needed. The \"money\" came from a loan. IF there was not enough money from the crops to cover the loan in the fall, the owed amount just got rolled over... but it did not affect their lifestyle. The owner they worked for  was the one that had to cover the debt. When Hubby was about 25, he was working for the same owner. It all went down that year. He not only lost his job, but his home. The owner actually moved in to his parents house, as theirs was auctioned off and they moved in with his grandpa. He got married to his first wife at age 21. For the next 10 yrs he continued to get loans and run up credit cards. When we started dating he owed almost a half of a million and was losing the house his ex and him still owned together. (She had the same upbringing).I was picking up glass bottle and lose change to help pay off the mortgage at age 4 so we could save for my brother (age 14) to be able to go to college (grants etc weren't common then). At age 6 I was still doing that and doing odd jobs to save for his college. We did it as a family. Daddy and Mother always paid in full for a car. We come from opposite ends. Twice Hubby has had to file for bankruptcy because he did not learn as a child to think about the long term cost of something.  The second time was during his divorce and I went with him to the hearings. I had mentioned to his lawyer he needed counseling to learn to handle money. His lawyer brought it up to the judge and the judge did order it.He still struggles a lot. I run the finances because he forgets to pay the bills, doesn't check to see if the ones on auto pay have ran through. Forgets that the amount at the ATM doesn't show what hasn't ran through (Daughter 2 was bank teller and said this was common and probably worse with kids growing up on a card that they don't put money in for(I am not sure he knows how to keep a checking account register as he won't and I do mean WILL NOT even list a written check in the register let alone something on the debit card.I know he has talked to his friends and even some of the Amish about his struggles of not really paying attention to money matters. He even brought it up to his parents... and his mom said she now take care of the finances and his younger brother will do it if she dies first. His dad did tell him to think of the costs of not doing something or doing something first. Take a list to the store and if something he wants to buy isn't on the list to call home. He quit his bus driving job 3 months before he qualified for health ins during retirement. He is thankful MIL could put him back on her health ins even though  she was retired.I am not being disrespectful when asking the price of him doing something or not doing something. I am working with him on where he wants to be in the manner he can deal with it. I think he has ADHD, his doctor is now looking at prodromal dementia aka MCI or does he have both. Prayers for peaceBlessed be"},

Everything he does something he shouldn't have, I ask how much that choice cost us. He is now focused on those issues. AND he wondered why I put everything in a wish list at Amazon for 3 days before ordering. The apple trees, strawberries, grapes, and chives are blooming. Asparagus is running us over. We picked up our 12 hanging baskets and 6 flower pots from B on Friday. I added some small plants to cover what I had that didn't make. Not the only one struggling to get seeds to grow. Three of the local green houses had issues also.We ordered a Heco wood and coal cook stove 520 series.  I got glass doors as the wife of the Amish seller said she wished she had gotten the glass doors. I was going to get the warming closet until she told me that she had been burned a couple times leaning in to reach the warming closet. She is my size. It should (ha ha) come in sometime in August. MEAN TIME. We need to get wood to get it cured in time.   We plan to order some coal for heating but use wood for cooking. Will have to clean out the firebox when flipping what we are using.Firewood especially hardwood (think nut trees) is running $300 to $500 a cord. A cord is 4 ft by 4 ft by 8 ft. We got hardwood scraps from one of the Amish building pallets  4 ft by 4ft by 7 ft for $40. E said he had softwood that was good kindling or a quick fire in the summer for cooking that was cured we could have for free.The only thing from the grocery store has been a gallon of milk.I did order vitamins that we were short on through Amazon as it was the cheapest.We did order a solar cube... that should come in this week.Hubby is hunting for a solar water pump for a deep well that will connect to the pressure tank.Amish have let us know that they are switching to spelts from wheat flour.  About half of them now are growing it. It's like whole wheat flour. Prayers for peaceBlessed Be"},
{"title": "On the not frugal side BUT", "date": "Monday, April 25, 2022", "text": "could go under the \"grid gone down\" budget since it is wind up.When we had decided  to buy a house we decided to have rewards when the mortgage hit certain goals we would buy something that we wanted instead of needed.  First one was a restuarant that is expensive (we ate leftovers for 3 days from it).We usually go either for Hubby's bday or our anniversary one or the other not both.Second one was buying Son2's used motorcycle and sold ours which actually paid for Sons'2 we bought as he only wanted what the pay off was and gave us a bike 10 yrs newer than we had. I guess we shouldn't have counted it as it was a break even purchase/sell LOL.This is the third one.I've priced what we wanted (Hubby picky over the wood and I am over the chimes). The prices were running $5000 to $8000... way more than I was willing to pay at this time. Figured we would just get something else CHEAPER on the buy list. Hubby found out a young Amish man \"F\" that just got married and moved closer to us this spring is building clocks so he stopped in thinking maybe a \"mantel\" clock even though we have no mantel. It's not quite like this one but this was the one he had a paper of. He wanted $2500. The chimes alone are $1000 as he shows the receipt he has so those ordering know he is not padding the bill and it will be exactly what we want, not settle for.  We will be moving furniture to put it in front room around and since we will build a closet in the wheel chair bathroom. While there Hubby asked if he clear coated other furniture. He said yes. COOL. As the other Amish guy \"H\"  that just finished redoing Son2's cabinet that had fell apart needed to have a clear coat and the other Amish \"N\" that does spray clear coat is the one whose barn burnt so he is already WAY behind on his other work. We went back to \"H\" and picked up cabinet. He mentions he had enough wood left over from repairing the cabinet that he could make a bread, onion, and potato bin and he was willing to do it for $20. He is putting a food grade sealer on it."},

We are at payment 43 almost to payment 44. Hubby has 26 more payment to the work truck, the business pays for it so he figures he won't \"retire\" from the business until that truck is paid off. So he will be almost 66 when he stops .I don't believe he will stop but that is okay, he is planning it that way. We have no other debt.We pay off the credit cards every month. I am using the cash back from our credit cards to pay for the \"grid goes down\" items. I put utilities, medical, supplies on the credit cards, then pull the $ from savings as it sits about 3 wks before the credit cards come due from the time our $ comes in for the month. On the advice of Hubby's parents, we did separate when our IRA's come in so we get Social Security one week, my IRA the middle of the month and Hubby's at the last part of the month. We have the money in the savings for the propane. Took some work to scrape it up now. Put off the \"grid down\" buying but it's there so I won't be stressing about it. Put off a couple projects we had planned to do on the house.Hubby asked for the grocery list... milk, half and half, heavy cream, 6 lbs. of onions that should get me through until ours is growing or I can get the walking onions. They are kinds of squishy in the winter. Prayers for peaceBlessed BeOur internet went down and Hubby was thankful he has \"hotspot\" on his phone as he was in the middle of doing work on the computer for gov't stuff needed for his business. Which triggered him to asking where we were at on the \"grid goes down\" emergency list.I also found out what triggered him to tell me to stock up NOW instead of this fall. Several of the Amish bulk stores are having issues getting supplies in and it's more than just the ones in Ohio having issues.I listed the following on our grid down list.toilet... we have an outhouse, needs some repair this summer , but usable even if we don't get the repairs done. It sits on the septic tank that is connected to the septic tile so it's no going into a hole like my parents and grandparents. I would like two windows that have screens in it instead of a Plexiglas that you move if you want air... then the birds come in if you don't close it.We have a deep well... Amish have told Hubby what to get to enable us to get water from it. There is a pump that is solar charged that would connect to the pressurized tank so we would have running water in house through our plumbing. You can also \"hand\" pump it if there is not enough solar. Ohio is #3 of being the cloudiest in the USA.We have a cistern and a handpump at the mudroom sink. Big thank you to N for leaving us  that when he moved so we could at least wash our hands while doing construction. I use it to water my indoor plants.I would love an ice house (we would have to buy/build it) but could very quickly convert the pump house to a spring house like many in my family had. I would love a root cellar even though I have a basement.I already can and dehydrate. M and B offered to teach me to can meat when I get to that point. I have canned some meat... mostly beef.We would need heat plus cooking. Hubby asked Amish and they pointed him to exactly what would do for us. One that has a home the size and layout of ours told Hubby how wood or anthracite nut coal (not the coal I grew up with that was nasty to deal with) it would take a year. Said to make sure we got a reservoir so we would have hot water to wash with. LOLWe have an open floor plan, would need to be able to close down some of those doorways to keep the heat in the primary living areas. I have fabric and extra curtains so I can make that up. Would need more blankets for the beds as the bedrooms would not be heated. Can make quilts from the fabric I have.I have needles and thread to mend and Mother's old button can that I add to .I have All Clad cooking pans and some cast iron so I won't have issues there.I ordered 2 wash tubs to wash laundry or bathe... wringers is on back order. I actually have a wringer washer that Hubby thinks he could hook to solar (got a portable solar for camping bookmarked) to run. Again I think of our ranking on cloudiest states. I got 2 wind up pocket watches (Hubby just broke his) and a Big Ben wind up alarm clock that will definitely stay near Hubby because I am well known for tossing them across the room if they are within reach when I am sleeping and they go off.Hubby is asking about grain mills. Might find someone that would just grind for us as that is common here. He is also asking a young Amish that just got married and is making clocks if he can make a key wind up clock.I need to learn how to knit/crochet socks etc. Hubby said his buddy that is Emergency management for this type of stuff suggested some solar and a wind turbine or moving our windmill to the pump house ... that's on the list but at the end. He felt MY list pretty much covered it since we already use oil lamps and have a big supply of candles. I can get tallow or lard to make candles if needed.Actually all I did was write down what was at Grandpa's house that only had 2 outlets in the whole house when I was a child. One for the refrigerator and one for the tv in the corner of the front room. There was NO running water, heated and cooked with coal that we got off the side of the mountain that they were mining. Kerosene lamp on ceiling of kitchen and one by Grandpa's rocker in the front room. Aunt Hazel had a small candle for her bedroom. Grandpa slept in was what the dining room. Daddy and I dug outhouse twice. I love mine is sitting on a septic tank connected to septic tile. Mother had outhouse, ice box but very seldom ice for it, kerosene lamps, they had running water and the cook stove was coal and had a reservoir on it. It helps to keep that knowledge."},

We had ham steaks from the freezer and asparagus fresh from the garden rolled in tortilla wraps. Hubby is trying to lose weight and found he does better with small meals 4 times a day than larger meals. Almost like a diabetic which is good as it runs in both our families. We stayed home for Easter and just sent messages as our families seemed to be out and about and we didn't want the kids to have to make choices of what side to see. We have been thanked more than once through the years of not making them make choices. My parents always celebrated off holiday since they had to travel so much for Daddy's side and then when they divorced. Also by staying home no new outfits were bought. Something our parents did every year.We won't be planting sweet corn or popcorn as I found enough in the 3 frig freezers and the barn freezer I have sorted and organized. Only 3 more deep freezers to clear, defrost and organize. I told Hubby the seed would be best kept for next year.I won't be getting a top off on the propane. The manager of our propane company looked at our balance and usage and thought if I was careful, we would do better to leave the \"balance\" until a NEEDED fill. He thinks we might get at least mid June. A fill then would put us in to Nov or Dec. instead of needing a fill in Aug. Keeping us to the lower amount of 4 fills a year instead of 5 plus 100 gallons. That would save us at least $1000 at the going rate. I won't be stocking up any more. We should have all we NEED especially since one of the kids who took my supply of lemon lime koolaid has ordered it to be sent to me.  They also are sending Wild berry lemonade for Hubby as they know he gets it when we eat at Wendy's. I do need to replace the \"emergency  like grid down\" stuff as we used it up through the winter. I am still pricing it out to get the best deal.I didn't mail the birthday cards because we will be in the area of all the kids on next Sunday due to great granddaughter's 1st bday party. We will be wearing masks. Stamps for all the cards would be $9. That's about half of what the gas is going to be to go to the party where they will be anyways if they aren't working. I can pass the cards to parents if they have to work.We got the septic tank taken care of. I wrote a check instead of using credit card as he gave 10% discount for NOT using a credit card. He charges 5% to use the credit card since that is what the credit card companies charge him for accepting them.We didn't eat out. I used leftovers out of the freezer in the airfryer or microwave instead of the stove that uses propane. We have several garden beds of painted plyboard needing replaced (4 yrs old). We decided to accept the offer from E to use the slab wood for free *he just wants it gone* for them also instead of using it just for the potato crates. We have had snow, graupel (frozen snow) and around freezing temps.

I'll check to see who is in May and take theirs also. None in June of the kids or grandkids or great grandkids. Hubby's mom is June. As our norm we combined our errands with our chiro appt. and we took a grocery list from M for Aldi's. She wanted us to get her 10 pounds of bananas and cream cheese as she always wants 24, with 11 in the family I can understand it. She used to ask for it every month, now it's every 6 wks and a bunch of celery.First we stopped and made Hubby's truck payment that isn't due until the end of the month BUT we won't be running errands until the day after it is due.Then we dropped off some old meds to the police dept as they have a box in lobby for that kind of stuff.Then we stopped at our bank (as they closed the branch here)to made deposit for the business.Then we went to Menard's and got filters (had to order 1 as they don't carry that size), we got Chi Chi tortilla chips (the only ones Hubby likes), big bag of Fritos (can't find them any where else and we use them for spinach dip or chili) and candy bars that was on sale and 9 boxes of Puffs tissues so we don't need to stock that up any more. Plus got the wood strips to put on the kitchen porch ceiling where the seems of the paneling is gapping. WAS paid in full by rebates. We are good with working the rebate system ... We paid for a grill, smoker, the deck material, kitchen porch material and half of the front porch material with rebates from buying other stuff when remodeling this house.Then we went to Kroger's fuel to use the points, I had couponed a double points two weeks ago so we used that up. Kroger's just happened to be the lowest cost in the area also.Then we went to Applebee's for lunch. Got the \"bowl\" meal, leftovers made supper so it figured $12.50 a meal for the two of us. Then we went to Chiro. I still have an out of pocket so we had to pay for both of us.Then to Aldi's, I got celery, peanut butter, catsup, lemon's ,limes, oranges and onions. Hopefully I won't need to buy onions after this. Hubby got celery and bananas for MThen we went to Walmart on the way home for M's cream cheese.We dropped of M's stuff along with the 2 egg cartons I hadUnloaded truck, played outside with Charlotte who decided she needed the box of tissues off the bfast bar (not chewed on but on the couch) and my GasX off the table (also not chewed on but on the couch) means I need to double check to make sure there is nothing that can harm her.  She knew she had been bad... was giving lots of kisses and nuzzling. Since supper was leftovers it was a YEAH ME for not having to cook.Hubby checked his email and found a online lecture about grid failure. A friend of Hubby's is an Emergency Management Director had just been in a seminar for this so was allowed to share it. I asked if this was why he wanted stocked now. He said no , he was hearing that sources the Amish use was not being able to supply them like normal or supply at all. But this definitely made he start thinking about stuff. Peas are up (will cover this coming weekend due to 32 degree ). Prayers for peace. Blessed be"},

He did mean EVERYTHING. He wouldn't say what he heard but he was clear we were going to be totally stocked up by May unless it was something for the gardens. It was worse than I thought in the maintenance stuff (thought we had until Aug  and were out in two areas) and was better than he thought (he is the one that forgot to tell me we needed furnace filters). I did several orders at Amazon (covid going around again on our area) and the 12th when we go to chiro we will do a pit stop at Menards for filters for the furnace, water etc. and use the rebates we have to pay for it with mask, gloves and sanitizer in hand. Starting to see limits on a few items I went to the grocery store (masked up etc.)and stocked up. I saved 32% and got double fuel points. I picked up ground beef . I made taco meat, ground beef crumbles, sloppy joe, hamburger patties and froze it along with bacon, Canadian bacon and sausage links. Today will be making meatloaf and freezing it on old cookie sheets to make meatloaf patties. Plus meat balls precooked and put in the freezers. I got frozen Gordon's fish patties. We went the Friday the week before for fish dinner at the local restaurant and they didn't get any in. Horrible during Lent.I spent part of Thursday evening visiting with an Amish lady (my age). She is growing sweet potato starts for the first time in decades. Her youngest son (her husband and her live in the Dawdy (grandpa) house) who lives in the house connected to her is doing potato starts that he has not done in years. They have bought from other Amish that are now trying to feed their own.  She was talking about how cash flow was tight (several medical bills and 3 fires , they share those costs in their church) and how she was making things stretch. Growing more basic foods for storage. She was worried about canning lids ( she uses about 3000 a year for the two of them, remember they can their meat also and eat 3 meals a day) being an issue again. Said they (meaning everyone in her church) had placed orders of lids for twice of what they usually use. Hoping to get a bit ahead. I already have mine as I ordered in Jan. Due to their ages and health she said they eat a lighter breakfast (6 am)  now, just toast and egg and not the white potatoes. Dinner at noon is now their main meal. What ever is left over from dinner becomes pantry soup for supper at 6 pm.. She adds a can of cream soup and maybe a hand full of noodles. She doesn't add broth as that is for cooking noodles without anything. But will thin the soup with water or tomato juice. She makes 1 qrt of the soup and serves it with bread. They are trying to eat healthier foods. She laughed when she talked about going from a 12 inch pie to an 8 inch pie but still cutting it in 8ths. Was an interesting visit.I got an eye infection, it's a lot better but one of the things doctor told me was to pitch any makeup INCLUDING face cream that I had been using. I knew makeup but didn't think about face cream. Wasn't much to pitch of either.Water softener company let us know the price of delivery was going up *not a lot* as we have them deliver when they are already in the area so no extra trips. They carry the salt down to the basement also so we don't have to figure out who to ask to do it for us.Electric company has let us know rates will be going up but they didn't know by how much as they are trying to change some things to off set the increase. We have a co-op.Propane company let us know that propane has already doubled since last year*it had increased by 30 cents last summer right* and they are guessing that it will hit $3.259/gallon by August. I am thankful we already had insulated well enough to cut it by 2 tanks but STILL I need 2400 gallons $7821.60 plus tax of $567.07 for a total of $8,388..67 IN FULL by Aug. SO that has to be put back out of the budget as we are not pulling from the IRA's for it. I am thankful we have already had an energy audit and I completed most of it. I do have some caulking around baseboards and insulation foam pads on outlets to do yet."},

E said the maple sap is still running a bit so he might get a bit more to cook down for syrup. Researched making cheese as Hubby really want this ... until I figured out the cost and how much cheese he would have to eat so it didn't go to waste. He decided we would just go to the cheese stores over around Holmes co like the Amish here do. Since he is already over there every other month anyways but I did mention it could be a good day trip for us to get away from the house and we could pack a picnic for lunch.Dealt with an attempt to hack my phone AVG caught the malware and then a threat to wipe out my computer... Glad Son 2 talked me into getting Norton as they dealt with it on the computer.Got a list of what the gov't thinks will be in short supply... they are adding to it each day it seems.Anything in plastic, metal cans or glass. That takes in bottle water, sodas, booze, coffee (again that comes in plastic )Biodieseltoilet paperpaper towels (I guess maybe feminine products will be next on that list???)dish soap/laundry soapClorox, Lysol etc. wipes shampoo and conditioner/deo. cooking oilsyeastoatscheese* especially cream cheese* after reading how it's made I understand it.milk (probably all dairy)sugarflour and mixes made with flour... pasta, bread, cake, pie crusts... anything made with flour like cereal also... gravy mixes... some salad dressings.corn ... corn products *corn meal, corn starch etc.Beef, pork, poultry and eggs. They eat wheat or corn. dog food (made with corn, wheat etc.)Imports will be slowed down most likely also.Instead of inventorying my pantry, I just wrote down what was missing and how much. I am still working on that and trying to figure out where to get it if we don't grow it.I ordered toilet paper as I was already told it's next to nothing around around here.I will get sugar tomorrow when we are at doctor appts and running errands. I will also pick up Vernor's ginger soda, coke and sprite. I usually don't pick that up until closer to July 4th but with shortages looming I will get it now.I dehydrated the last 2 pumpkins and ground that up for powder. I made apple sugar (dehydrated apple sauce with no sugar).I still have some apples from last fall in the frig to deal with this week.I ordered a butter crock. Hubby doesn't like \"softening\" his butter in the microwave and we use real butter. So I ordered what my grandmother used and Nonna used. I went through The Prudent Homemaker sitehttps://www.amazon.com/Original-Butter-Bell-Tremain-Collection/dp/B000H47H0A?th=1We were  starting to work on moving stuff around in the freezers so we could start defrosting them as we are getting ready for garden to start up. I freeze peas, snow peas, corn and asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower and some carrots and some cole slaw. I freeze strawberries, black berries, blue berries, red raspberry (hope to get black raspberries this year), jams  and some fruit for mixed fruit pies.Had several of plastic bins, paper sacks, cardboard boxes, cloth bags etc. bust on us so after a day of researching and another of pricing we ordered wire bins. We are starting with the barn freezer to see how we like them. Lack of organization in the chest freezers bugs the crap out of me. Hubby just digs through and doesn't put things back in the container it was in so everything ends up jumbled together and it's a hunt and find every time. Hubby decided he wanted a list on a clip board of what was in each freezer. I went with a clip board per freezer. AND then to mark the top of each freezer of each meat. Like freezer one be pork, freezer two be beef, freezer three be poultry. Leaving the barn freezer out of that line. He thought that was great. And then the rest of the freezer be fruit and veggies etc. Maybe cheese and nuts in the barn freezer... he decided he wanted to keep track of the pantry also... I told him that meant HE had to mark off stuff when he went down and got it NOT just tell me. He is still thinking of that and started looking at Excel sheet to do that. I will be transplanting some of the seedlings from the grow cart later today. How is your week going?Prayers for peace.Blessed be"},

I started using an electric water kettle to make tea (pour the hot water into another kettle) and when making rice, pasta or boiled eggs. I have found I save 2 hrs. of propane a week. by using the kettle. Electric is cheaper here. Not reliable enough as losing electric happens  with storms and accidents.I used kitchen twine to tie up the grape vines and berry vines.Hubby got more slab wood from E for free to make more potato crates.I moved the utility bills to a cash back credit card that paid more than the other card.Hubby wanted a different table for his HAM radio instead of the tv tray . Which I hate to move to dust mop the floor.Sunday I took him out to the barn and we went \"shopping\" through all the furniture (Daddy's Mother's Pop's, late husband's, 6 kids LOL) and found a table he is trying before we refinish it and buy some wheels (to make it easier for me to dust mop the floor).While shopping the barn:I found a tub of place mats and cloth napkins that had been Mother's. They are now washed and hanging on the yard clothes line.Hubby found a metal stand he used to use by the swing...which made him put out the swing also. Then he decided to bring out the outdoor furniture so he cleaned that. The stands needs refinished but he can do that later this summer. It's still damp and cool here.We found a dresser buried under boxes that can be refinished for an upstairs bedroom. H, Amish neighbor on the other side can do that later this summer as he's already behind doing Son 2 cabinet LOL.I found small pots that I can use to transplant seedlings into from the grow cart that can go under the bigger grow light  upstairs. He found a wicker hamper and decided he wanted me to repaint it so he could have it in the front room for throw blankets storage plus be able to use the top for a stand next to the love seat as the top is flat. We found 2 birdhouses, one was for a wren and that was hung up. The other needs a repair and then it will be put up.I mentioned there was several cabinets I could use in the basement for dishes and appliances or even storage for boxed goods and the metal shelfing units it would replace could be used in the barn when we set up the summer kitchen (that I was calling canning area). AND there was also cabinets that we could set up a work shop for him and he wouldn't be constantly looking for stuff. OR having to buy it because he needs it NOW and can't find it. After walking through it he admitted that he defeats my decluttering when he takes what is supposed to go to the trash or to the thrift shop and it just gets shoved here and there in the barn since I always look to the left of the door in the first stall instead of INSIDE the barn, for what is supposed to go. Which means I as it's very seldom we, have to re-sort things .Since I am not willing to pay $100 a month for a dumpster. We will be working it through the normal trash that has a bag limit on it per week, recycling and thrift shops on the Tuesday we have errands and appts. I down loaded the Goodwill list so we don't take anything there they will just dump. I also brought up we could start donating some things to Habitat ReStore that we are not going to be using... like the kitchen sink that  a friend gave us and two bathroom sinks along with cabinets the kids passed to us.  I keep checking to see if there is a township clean up or a hazard waste clean day in our area. Last year both was cancelled."},

It's really not a surprise but a heads up. We are looking strong at the budget and seeing what we can cut to only live on social security which means not paying extra on the mortgage to start with.We have friends that their work place payroll got hacked... they didn't get anything for almost a month and now are getting about 1 day a week for 5 days work. The company hopes to be back on schedule and everyone's pay be caught up by April. Another company that Daughter 4 was working for got hacked also. Her paycheck came in 2 wks later for less than what she made by hour even though she worked 80 hrs. They said that wasn't a full pay check (gee really?) but just a test to see if things were working. She had already put her notice in as she got back in to the company she had worked for a long time ago. They had called her and are paying more than where she was working AND it's closer to home and more stable hours.Hubby's business has decreased by 50%. He is still making his bills as long as he doesn't take any wage, no profit, but worries about any big out lays with repairs. He does have a business credit card but prefers to pay it off in full and not waste his money on interest charges.I had a credit card hacked... the credit card company caught it and denied the charges so at least I don't have that headache. Been there and done that. I had to go in and change the auto pays I had on that card. Might be a blessing as the card I use (that I got the in the mail the day of the hack) now gives more cash back on than the card I had on the bills.We had an audit of the home to see if it would be worth getting solar power. Three different estimates, first on the barn roof and then just out in the yard, all 3 showed it would not be a break even point on the money side for 15 yrs. At our age, that's not worth it. It did show there were a few places that needed caulking and that replacing the windows and adding more insulation(wrap insulation if we were changing the old siding) would help. But for electric use we are on the low end for 2 people even with a grow light cart and heat mats. We are on the low end of using water also which the softener company told me we were saving about $16/ month between saving on salt and saving on changing the whole house water filter. Since our outside water is NOT ran through the softener that saves even more. We are on the low end of using propane for the size home (including pump house heater) we have. We only have one internet company in our area and they just lowered their rates by 5% without me calling and asking."},

Hubby first asked why he thought it was a hobby... because it's not a real job from a real employer where taxes are taking out of the paycheck. And it wasn't a real farm because we have no live stock (makes you wonder what he thinks of the farmers growing grain for that bread he buys at the store).Hubby texted buddy's mom and told her he was sorry her son didn't think she worked taking care of the home and him and his brothers when they were growing up AND included the message from her son to Hubby. Made sure they knew he had not asked for the opinion or even had been \"talking\" to his buddy about anything.  His buddy not only has his mother on him, but his dad, wife, both of his girls and his son in laws on his butt.  Hubby said if he had asked for the opinion it would have been different . BUT since it was just because his buddy saw a post from Hubby's mom about the 150 seeds I planted Friday, his buddy thought he should text Hubby and tell him. I have a few family and friends that just got over covid. Two told me they were warned they could develop dementia/Alzheimer's 20 to 30 yrs sooner than normal and it will be worse with those that already have mental illness like bipolar etc. AND since the Buddy just got over Delta covid it and is in his 70's ...it made me wonder about his mental health. She is watching the bunny in E's field.

Sunday we turned it off as it was warm and forgot to turn it back on before we went to sleep. I let Charlotte out at 1 am and realized it and turned it back on.I opened the windows and increased the humidity in the house from 31% to 62%.I ordered humidifier filters for next winter. They were on sale for 40% off. I have found if I get supplies AFTER season it's cheaper than BEFORE season.The buzzards are back(geese came in early also) means it is spring here. It's a bit early. But since they are back and it was warm I went to clean up the gardens. North flower garden, north gardens with  100 ft asparagus patch, 6 strawberry beds and the blackberries, red raspberries and the honey raspberries rows, south garden beds including trimming all the herbs back and the flower hill at the mail box are done. Usually that takes 1 week if not more and recover of 7-10 days. Hubby spent $$ to buy me a Stihl pruner and clipper. I would replace it tomorrow if it broke. IT was that great. I had some soreness but pretty much the next day was FINE. I still have the lilies and mint at mudroom door and the lilac and Halo bush at the kitchen porch. Hubby said it was a frugal buy since he isn't dealing with me being down with recovering after cleaning up the gardens and him having to do the work instead. I made taco seasoning , Cajun seasoning and seasoned salt. We ate leftovers I had frozen from the freezers. The leftovers are now making leftovers as I am now tossing what ever is left in eggs (frittata), pasta, rice or in a tortilla wrap. Hubby made more potato crates using free slab wood from E.Hubby got clothes line marked down as it was 100 ft and most only want 50 ft so the store sold it to him for 40% off plus he had a coupon for 25% off one item. I ordered some spices I was low on thru Brandy (The Prudent Homemaker) at Amazon that was on sale (on my wish list) using my cash back to pay for it. I have found by putting what ever I want on the wish list and then only spending what my cash back is keeps me reined in.Prayers for peaceBlessed Be No one was hurt, well, the wife sprang her ankle jumping over the fence to get her husband to tell him the barn was on fire.N(E's brother and the man we bought this house from) lost the milk cow and 6 calves, the smoke got to them. They lost 2 dozen chickens.  But got out their 5 horses. Buggies are usually in that barn but the wife had decided to clean all 3 buggies so they were up at the house. Hubby hauled the 5 horses to F's barn until the barn can be rebuilt Saturday night.The fire marshal thinks that a bird took something in the barn that must have caught a spark from the chimney on the sugar shack (maple syrup shack). They know it didn't \"blow in\" even with the high winds we had as N had closed up all the doors on the side of the barn that was towards the sugar shack because he didn't want the smoke to go in the barn. Over 10 ft tall of hay and straw, even wet it was smoldering.Trying to see if there was anything left useable.Light from fire truck so everyone could see. They still was there at midnight. Fire started at 3 pm. E said the hay/straw stack got spread out around 9 pm and they just kept spraying water on it as they knew higher winds were coming in the next morning around 3 am.Fire department had to take water from the pond 2 doors down from us. We offered our pond if they needed more. E said they stood around (no work on Sundays) and decided what the battle plans were for rebuild . Eighty percent of the cement block foundation is useable. SO today they have a group of Amish going to a woods that an Englisher offered if they could use any of the trees for lumber. They have to use their horses to pull it out of the woods after they cut it down. E got a line of someone that could haul the logs to N's and another of someone to haul 2 saw mills (just the saw and stand) to N's also. Hubby is on stand by after he gets his hauling job done today in case they need something else hauled. N is hoping to get at least 1 stall put in his other barn so he can have 1 horse for his buggy for his family other wise they are \"car less\" buggy less , stuck at home and have to walk miles for anything. Prayers for peace.Blessed Be"},

I have some orders sitting at Amazon, I get notified when it runs through my credit card. My credit card is now giving 24 hr. notice of when something will actually be ran through so I have time to check to make sure it's for what I ordered. Hubby said his business card is doing the same. At first I was like crap... now it's like \"this should stay\" so I have time to STOP it if it is fraud. Fighting fraud on your credit card sucks... been there and done that. Son 2 is helping as he went through this about 7 yrs ago when  the govt shut down and he still had to go to work without a paycheck coming in.I have one that the landlord is working with them but the utilities didn't care even though the company gave it's employees  a letter on company letter head with a number to call to confirm the person is employed with them. So we helped with utilities. One just needed gas money for the next few weeks (they get every two weeks) and their company is hoping it gets it fixed. Kid was like\" if they had waited one day to hack it, I would have had my check\".We went to chiro, doctor told me I did a good job of getting my hip back in place... I was out less than normal. HA HA AND I could start back on the inversion table but only at a slight tilt which is what I was doing anyways not the full upside down.We stopped at Menards, 11 % rebate and got more off the list that the other Menards didn't have the other day. Added drinking water for storage . Stopped at TSC to get clothes line stuff since Menards didn't have it. They were out also. BUT we found a solar unit for the electric fencing so we can put the electric fence around the corn (stops deer and coons from eating the corn) and not increase the electric bill. Got dog food that was on sale. We went to Aldi's... M needed cream cheese and bananas. They were out of cream cheese so Hubby just got the bananas. SO we stopped at another Aldi's on the way home, they were at a limit of 2 cream cheese but I got 2 also (she needed 24) and some stuff that was on our grocery list, I added more sugar for us as M had mentioned it was not coming in to the local store.Then we went to Walmart that was 1 mile down the road from Aldi's. Got M's cream cheese and the rest of what was on our grocery  list. Loaded the truck ANDTRUCK WOULD NOT START .... Hubby then realized he had taken the jumper cables out of that truck for the work truck and when replaced work truck cables he laid the other set in the barn instead of putting them back in the other truck. SO he went in to buy jumper cables and to see if there was anyone there that could jump us.Automotive dept employee came out and jumped the truck for us. He had a jumper box aka Jumper car box. I told Hubby we needed 2, one for each truck. Then we never would have to wait for someone to come by and jump us.   We stopped at Auto zone on the way home, alternator is good, battery was in bad shape. We have a new battery. Auto zone guy told me to put on the calendar to have it checked in 2 yrs. BEFORE winter LOL.The Amish have been growing spelt... they call it speltz. One of women figured out how to make decent bread with it and brought over a loaf with the warning it goes stale faster than even whole wheat but will make good toast even stale... I mentioned that it would then make good bread pudding... he is passing that thought to his wife as neither of them thought about it. He also brought some of the flour so I could \"play\" with it.  I think I will try a cake. If it turns out I will take some over to they with the recipe. Both humidifiers are out of water and need filters changed. Since it's getting warmer and more moisture is coming in.

Our insurance pays for 26 visits a year and thing over that we have to pay the full amount. Our regular appt is every 2 wks.... which is this coming Tuesday.Laundry is on the drying rack. Dishwasher is unloaded. Lunch is leftover smoked sausage and mac and cheese. Supper is dried beef gravy over leftover rolls. Most likely I will toss some peas in it also. Applesauce for the fruit.E offered what he calls slab wood for free as he needs to get rid of it. It's what is left of the outside edges (bark side) when he is cutting for lumber. Hubby got some to make potato crates so he is in the barn tinkering on how he is going to make these boxes. This will sit on the ground (or weed barrier) with potting soil on the bottom and then the potato eyes and then more potting soil. As the plants grow we will add garden soil and Hubby will add more to the sides. We will also grow sweet potatoes in this style of crate also.  https://oldworldgardenfarms.com/2022/02/17/easiest-way-to-grow-potatoes/Not quite what he is making but where the idea came from.I figured up what we spent on ice cream at the store through last year. I did not include Belly Acre as we get ice cream as a dessert when there. We spent almost $200 between gallons, ice cream sandwiches, klondikes, push ups etc. I got a ice cream/frozen yogurt/gelato/sorbet maker for $60. Hubby already cleared an area in the barn freezer for the bowl. He decided he wanted ice cream first, then gelato then frozen yogurt and then sorbet LOL.We went to Menards to get garden stuff. Saved $114 using our rebates and their sales. I had a company send me 5 lbs. of potato tubers when I ordered 3 lbs. as they weren't sure what kind of condition they would be in with the weather that was going through. Box was so wet it had been put in a plastic bag by our carrier but the tubers seem fine. They were slightly damp. I have them spread out on a towel to dry.We ate from the freezers and pantry. I only need dairy and season salt from the store.We turned the furnace down when we left for an hour or more. Which has almost put us back on to our regular schedule of propane to keep us from using more than I budgeted for.I made 5 gallons of  laundry soap. Unlike M who made 50 gallons of laundry soap on Saturday as someone got a cow butchered and didn't want the fat, so she made tallow laundry soap. I used my digital credits and Amazon gift card from Pinecone research to buy Jamie Oliver 15 minute meals cook book and his 5 ingredient meal cook book. Hubby has been watching his cook shows and thinks it's great as he uses a lot of fresh in season veggies. At one time half the kids were using the 5 ingredient meal cookbook but not one of them kept the book.How did your week go?Blessed Be"},

March through November  but not what I do November to March.I told his this.I get up between 3 and 8 am. I don't use an alarm unless we have to be some where before 11. That went bye bye when I retired since Hubby worked 3rd he never used an alarm. It is usually between 5 and 6 (sucks retired And I can't sleep in)I drink 1 cup of coffee, open curtains and turn off night lights.I drink 2nd cup of coffee and start the laundry and put away the laundry on the drying rack. Hubby usually unloads dishwasher at this time if not then I do.Then I have my 3rd cup of coffee while waiting for the clothes washer to stop then put clothes on drying rack (clothes line in late spring/summer)I get dressed, make the bed, straighten the house and walk the perimeter with the Charlotte.If is is garden season (what my kids call it) I go to the garden. When it's not I get on the computer, email some friends, check Fb for other friends, read blogs, drink hot tea, read some, bake bread etc... if I need to plant seeds in grow cart I do that in the morning. I have a snack for bfast at 10. Take another perimeter with Charlotte. AT 11:30  I take meds, get more tea. If I didn't eat at 10 I do now. Do what ever needs done for the day. Grab a shower (which I would do at same time in garden season) and then take a nap at Charlotte's insists this is nap time on the bed and I have to be with her. Rascal was the same way. Thirty minutes to an hour later she is up and running and expects me to be also. SO we go for another perimeter.By two , I am wrapping up any work. by 3:30 I start supper as we try to eat by 4:30 to 5. Hubby is a weather spotter and likes to watch the weather on 2 of our local channels. I clean up the table, set the dishwasher to run when I head for bed.Five to 6:30 is watching the news. Then in warm weather we go outside, usually another perimeter (she hates winter and won't go as much). Around 8 I head to bedroom to get around for bed as Hubby sleeps in the recliner of the front room due to health issues. He usually goes to sleep around 8:30 but if I am there he will try to stay awake. He turns the tv timer on and turns off the light at 8:00 most nights. I read, usually with glass of water. I read my kindle first for 30 minutes so the light from it doesn't mess up my sleep, do my journal next and then read a book until 9:30 then it's lights out also.I told Son 2 it doesn't matter if it's garden season or not. My routine is pretty much the same. I don't have a cleaning routine *yet, still, some more* so that's more of a I can't stand it anymore and slide it in between other things. I can tell you it takes a solid 60 hrs. to clean this house from top to bottom. The old homestead where I raised the kids took 30 hrs. I think part of the hours now are lack of organization and the other is I AM OLD. LOLBlessed be  The best thing we changed at the beginning of 2021 was using only one credit card for all food ... groceries, eating out, snack on the road from gas station. Hubby told me more than once he didn't buy a snack due to not wanting to use a credit card for something that small and was not carrying cash on him.Total for the year  spent on food, groceries, stock up, eating out etc. $4979.73OF that $1622.95 was eating out, that is about 32.6 % of that total.... I noticed about   1/4th of that amount was during last Feb the two weeks before I was going in for hip replacement and the two weeks after that. Chinese 4 times, 2 pizzas, garlic bread and salads, 1 KFC 12 piece bucket with sides, 1 Ralph's (local sports bar with great food that takes us 3 days to eat) and 2 Arby's.We have a friend that goes to the store every week for groceries. They kept track of what they spent last year. They pretty much eat the same as us. Do some canning but that is no where near what we can.  She said they spent a month $503.76 on fresh veggies (they do can green beans and beets and freeze corn).They spent $272.94 on fresh fruit (they don't can or freeze any nor eat canned fruit). They average $260 on meat (neither eat much of it nor eat any beans). UNLESS there is a sale on brisket, ribs, spiral ham and turkeys.  But their average grocery bill is $1036.70 a  month. They eat out twice a week and that comes to $200 a month, $250 in a 5 week month. SO that is 1236.70 to $1286.70 a month. SO that is at least $14,804.40. The only reason they tracked it is they want to buy a different home closer to their grandkids and was moaning about how much her meds were and trying to come up with a down payment without pulling more. Their sons asked why they were pulling so much from the retirement and where was it going. I thought it was on the strange side when their younger son asked me how much we spent.  I did point out to him that they don't can as much as they could or freeze as much as they could. His dad eats salads every day but always choses the most expensive lettuce there is and refuses to shop at any other store than Kroger's even though Aldi's is right next door and sells the same lettuce for about 2/3rds the price.It did make me feel better about what we spent for the year and what we are trying to move towards this coming year. I have bought 3 heads of lettuce since end of Nov. Instead of lettuce salad I had carrot salad, canned coleslaw (vinegar base) fresh coleslaw and 3 bean (4 bean) salad.Blessed Be Okay Not Really. BUT I do have 2 of the January King Cabbage sprouted. We were going to remove row cover from gardens today but the winds coming in at 20 MPH with gusts over 40 MPH has put that on hold.I am updating what I keep track of on the \"inventory\" after noticing that Thomas Jefferson didn't note if his tomatoes were determinate or indeterminate. So I decided to add that information to my seed sheets aka inventory sheets aka plant sheets ... depending on the day of what I call them LOL.These will go into sheet protectors and then 3 ring binders....

So  a big thank you.We finished buying what we planned to give to Grandson D (and TB). Delivery is tomorrow as the weather today is to turn nasty. Hubby is doing a hauling job that is close by so not a big deal according to him. I am waiting for the last load of the dishes I bought to dry so I can box them up. Both have called me about odds and ends they thought of (already got) and then we got the call to bring staple gun and the fabric came off the back of the couch. It had been stapled. They warned us they had idiots (their term) running around them so to wear masks and bring gloves or hand sanitizer. Hey at least they are thinking about keeping us safe. We would have anyways as the great grandsons are in school and don't have vaccines yet. We just had 3 friends get covid after watching their great grandkids that were in school. Laundry is done and on the rack drying. I walked to road and got the mail.Son 2 reenlisted to Army reserves.... he was going to be 23 days short of having 20 yrs for his pension... you have to have 20 years. He was talking of doing at least another year as his girlfriend (her term and he calls her his woman) has a teenager and he is looking at possible marriage and the teen going to college. He told Hubby he wants to be as good as stepdad as Hubby was. My kids don't acknowledge he is a step dad. They call him dad and introduce him as dad as their biological dad turned his back on them when they were about 10-12. I was totally shocked when he did it.Daughter 4 had a hit and run driver total her car 2014 Jeep Latitude. She was able to find a newer 2016 Jeep Patriot sport for only $1000. more than she got from her insurance of the other car. She likes it better and thinks when I drive it I will be looking for one myself. Said it reminded her of my Ford Explorer. We will see. I had my check up with the GI/PA . I do NOT have antibodies to my Humira. The Humira is working. THAT IS VERY GOOD. He got the report from my ortho doc and said if he had knew I was walking around with a fractured socket for 7 months waiting for my hip to be replaced, he would have increased the Humira and put me on other meds to help keep things calmed down. NOW it's more of stay off the OTC pain meds as they are causing issues in the small intestine (Tylenol messes up my liver so can't take that either) BUT if in pain for longer than 8 hrs. TAKE SOMETHING LOL, do a food journal/ daily do list to see if it helps calm things down. Right now my CRP (C reactive Protein) is half of what it was a month ago. Since I am on NO meds to calm it down , he thought what I was eating (an not eating) was helping. I think  stressing over whether or not my Humira was working didn't help. He did mention he has several on Medicare that are paying huge amounts for their biologics. He hopes the new pill that is to replace biologics that has came out will be covered by Medicare within this year. I am reading Thomas Jefferson The Garden Book. He was better at keeping up with it when he retired.Next will be The Richest Spot on Earth by Peter J Hatch that is about the same gardens as he worked with restoring them.The Lost Super Foods by Art Rude, Lex Rooker, Claude Davis, and Fred Dwight is on the next list also. The Bread Bible By Rose Levy Berandaum I am definitely tired and sore today after a 4 hr. trip and being poked on by the PA.

I don't feel good so sit on my butt and read. I love to read, read for hours, don't care much for tv. Got to figure out a happy medium.Another change is we are planting/ seed starting by the moon and signs this year so that is a set time frame instead of when ever I get to it. Monday is always a big laundry day as I don't do laundry past Saturday morning except for the cleaning rags. Today (Saturday) I will be soaking some stained kitchen towels for the last load instead so they might get a wash later tonight or tomorrow morning as I didn't really clean much this week.  I will also be starting any of the veggies that need started in grow cart that is in the start 12 wks before last frost date.

I had note book paper. I bought plastic clothes pins and paint markers to mark what is what while in grow cart and then in gardens. As I am listing variety etc. on notebook paper and putting into the protective sheet I marked what color the veggies is. I am keeping track of how many of each color I have since my doctors want me to eat 5 colors a day. So far my colors are green/red/ green and red/ orange and yellow/ yellow to red/ purple/ black/ blue/ white and tan and brown. I have a few more color mixes. I counted how many varieties I had per color and then added some in the colors that was low. Hubby would like to at least do row cover again but maybe add a small green house also that we had planned last year but didn't get to. I would rather have cold storage first as we might not need a green house between the cold storage and the row covers in 3-4 of garden beds.  I would like to add at least 1 more garden bed( to make at least 4 beds) to the row cover. Last year I planted 1500 seeds in the \"3 seasons\" I grew.  That sounds like a lot... okay that is a lot HA HA but I have 32 garden beds and that is only around 15-16 seeds per bed per season. We added more dried beans, more cabbages( will be making kraut), more potatoes (even purple), more variety of tomatoes (black and white tomato? ), and sweet potatoes. There is broccoli, cauliflower and kohlrabi that I haven't been able to get to grow here but I am trying it again. I am trying to grow celery also that I have never done. I added more winter squash and yellow summer squash. I added cantaloupe, honey dew and watermelon. I added a couple winter lettuces that Thomas Jefferson grew in his winter gardens.I will be using pots for plants like lettuce that can't take the heat so I can grow them in the summer in partial shade. (M grows her on the north side of the house).  I will use grow bags for the potatoes unless Hubby wants to do it like E does then he can go for it. E digs the ground, plants the potato and then covers it with weed barrier that decomposed at the end of the season, you just till it under. When the potato plant pokes against barrier you cut a hole at that spot. Said their crop almost doubled last year doing it this way.We decided also to plant according to the moon/planets not just the last frost guidelines. We will see how this goes. We are under a winter storm warning. Last check was 1/4th is ice, 6-14 inches of snow AFTER 1/2 inch of rain. With winds 20 mph to 35 mph. Winds at 35 mph for 3 hrs. with snow is blizzard conditions. I will be cooking hamburger for taco/burritos and making 6 qrts of beef stew. I thought of beef stew (been craving it) and then second round serve over homemade noodles then 3rd round have it with dumplings and then the butcher mentioned using what was left for pot pie.

He acknowledges we would have to buy citrus and bananas. But looking at more like M buys  of celery and bananas (she also gets graham crackers, saltines, cream cheese and cool whip). I added I would miss my fresh bell peppers and fresh mushrooms. I do not know if we can hold onions until they come back in also.

Our supplier does that size also.I made instant mashed potatoes instead of frying potatoes to go with sausage gravy.

I might stop at thrift stores in Sidney to look for stuff for GS D.I was planning to make the dinner, Hubby suggested we get it on the way home from the testing and just get enough to have leftovers for Tuesday. As I usually eat rice after testing anyways. Both of our Chinese restaurants are closed on Tuesday (pizza shop and one restaurant is closed on Mondays) . I will also need to start gathering what I am giving Grandson D for his 1st apt. He was texting me last night as his oldest brother is moving in with him that they need food and kitchen stuff. He thought it was funny when I asked Box cook or scratch cook. UNTIL his brother went \" box mac and cheese or Uncle B's mac and cheese) then he understood. He is a box cook. Oldest said he would buy perishables as he cooks from scratch. So I am just fill the cabinets not the frig and freezer. GS D then sent Towels, wash cloths, dish towels, dish cloths, bedding dishes pots and pans... cleaning supplies.... then just put ... HELP ME. Oldest is trying to make the youngest get most of it as he is only moving in to help D get up on his feet. He is turning 19 but is in last year of high school. Oldest didn't like the idea of him going out on his own. BUT plans to move out after GS D graduates and can work full time to pay the bills on his own. Living with either parent is not a good choice and he has been floating between his 2 brothers the past year. Wed. I will clear and reorganize the kitchen frig and it's freezer. I will do finances also. Start the bread starter so I can bake bread on Thursday. Probably will pull meals from that freezerThursday  Finish what ever up. Make noodles as I am out.

I check the level at the tank WEEKLY for that reason.Two days ago I called in for a delivery. We were at 31 % and using 4% each day due to how cold it is with the windchill. We usually use 10% / wk. during the winter. This was 15% in a week. Today Hubby checked the propane. 25%... furnace will not run at below 20%. He called to see if the propane was coming in today. IT'S NOT. They have several with NO propane and they are trying to get them filled first. I do not have an issue with that at all.... BUT they did warn us that if they can't get to us by tomorrow (they hope to) that it would be MONDAY so we will be out. We took a deep breath... thought about if this was a blizzard, we could be in the same position. What do we have to keep the pipes from freezing and us warm enough plus our water heater and cook stove is propane.Hubby went to the barn. He found the 2 kerosene heaters with good wicks. E had 5 gallons of kerosene that he was not going to use so passed it to us. Hubby turned off the propane heater in the pump house and put a kerosene heater in there. The odor will not matter since it's where we won't be. He is also going after 5 more gallons of kerosene (and a gallon of milk).He found 2 gas buddy heaters we used to use on the old farm in the bedroom and front room. Those are now in the house with 2 grill propane tanks(both full) to run them. The canning stove in the barn is on a full grill propane tank and the grill's tank is half full.   I have electric roaster, electric skillet, crock pot, and air fryer plus microwave.  Hubby brought in the camping stove and it's fuel. We will be reheating leftovers today and tomorrow I will fry potatoes and make sausage gravy that can be reheated in microwave or over the camping stove. I found the old electric heater in a north loft and brought it down. Turned the lights on in the grow cart which will warm that area by 10 degrees. Right now we have some sunshine so it's feels warmer than it actually is. Furnace is down to 65. At bedtime we will turn it down to 60. It made us really think about if this was a blizzard we wouldn't get propane for a week or more... so rethinking back up for the propane is now something to be dealing with. Meantime.... I have Mother's thick cable sweater on. Hubby is wearing his insulated vest in the house over a heavy fleece shirt and tee shirt.

Good place for it to be stored.We used 20% of propane in last week. First time ever to use more than 10%/week. The frigid temps and wind chill sucked that right down. We had to turn the furnace up 2 degrees to keep the front room where Hubby sleeps in his recliner (so he can breath) up to 66. Below that his tremors get really bad. Still only 2 degrees and turning the fan on ON instead of auto kept the home warm. Called propane co and ordered a refill. They said they had one that dropped 9% over night and their furnace was struggling to run so was glad I called before we dropped down to 30% so we weren't an emergency. I used paint markers to mark the plastic clothes pins that I am going to use in the grow cart to track what I am growing. We bounced some thoughts of how we wanted things to be a year from now around the kitchen table. I  made notes so we can talk more about them and then see how it goes. Hubby took a break from his one hauling job, they were starting to load hours which he can't do with having State numbers. They know they can call him to help fill in as they hired 2 drivers to replace him.

Taking 10 months off the mortgage loan and saving $16, 870 in interest.Bought new chain saw, paid cash and got 10% off.Put our name on the list for the pruner (Stihl) that is on back order but suppose to come in during the next 3 months. Been trying to get it for 2 yrs. This is through the company that sold us the chainsaw. So another cash item and they give discounts for cash.Bought dripline for gardens. Saved $175 on delivery by Hubby going after it (within 15 miles of the chain saw) and 10% of purchase price (web promo) and 1.5% cash back from Hubby using his cash back credit card. Since he was already in the area and needed to kill about 30 minutes between stops, he pit stopped at the Mennonite store (cash or checks , don't accept credit cards) to check on half bushel baskets and crates for our cold storage we will be doing. Baskets are normally $7 and crates are normally $6. He got a $ 2 off each as he took last years that was in barn storage and \"dusty\" . Plus he got a free pallet as the guy was just going to burn it and Hubby offered to take it off his hands. He stopped and got gas using the new Marathon card he got and saved 75 cents total. I've used promo codes, discounts and priced checked all of the seeds I have ordered. Saved 1/3 of total costs.E let us know he was adding 2 rows of sweet bicolor corn for us since we have helped them so much this year. So our eating corn is taking care of.I have gotten 50 yellow sweet corn (aka canning corn) seed, tomato seed, Armenian cucumber seed and 2 packages of flower seed for free.   I ordered some \"office\" stuff to make a better inventory record keeping of the garden seeds and such. I used promo code for 15% off and my cash back credit card. Got free shipping.I have to go get a diagnostic CT scan and blood work at the hospital that is 2 hrs. from us. They arranged it so I could get both done the same day saving us gas and time. That is on the 31st.    I think we all know that they can  a lot of their food... veggies, fruit, and meat.But there are many that don't realize how they keep food fresh without electric.Some have spring houses, like our neighbors and Johnston Farms ,https://www.johnstonfarmohio.com/Exhibits/exhibits.php had one. Here are some pics I found on the internetThis is what they use as a refrigerator. M says she can keep hers around 32 to 36 degrees with just making sure there is fresh water going through it. She will add some of her block ice to the water holding areas in the summer.Most have an ice house to hold huge blocks of ice. This is NOT like a freezer. It's more for just keeping things cold. Like using a cooler to camping.Here is some pics from the internet of ice houses.M has said about the only thing she throws out is about a quart of milk every other day. They have 2 milk cows and 11 of them in the family , the cows still produce more milk than they need. She dumps the extra milk where she will be planting her tomatoes this summer.

They are thinking the hip and it's replacement triggered enough inflammation to retrigger the Crohn's as it triggered inflammation up my entire back causing headaches. That is the bad news.The good news according to my Doctor is we know Humira will work so it's back on the original schedule of one shot every two weeks instead of once a month like it has been the past year. AND remove chemicals from my diet AND increasing anti inflammatory foods. WHICH is more than I did two years ago. Told me to look at my garden as my drug store and the food as the medicine. Can use it as practice when I hit Medicare and they don't want to pay for the Humira. His wife and him garden and can a lot of their own food.What am I doing?Still in pain that rolls through on a 2 hr time frame instead of a 10 min time frame, still cramping goes with the pain and chilling.

You would think since I grow my own veggies etc., there would not be much.I just bought salad/ lettuce the other day and then had to toss it as it is on recall and I had ate some of it. SIGH. They didn't test for food poisoning when I went in for Crohn's so there might have been some of that. EDTA is used in salad dressings amongst other things... I have lots of different salad dressings that are now in the trash can WHY? EDTA was formulated formaldehyde. I do not think I need to eat that.Another one that is being pitched is Carrageenan that has been used for hundreds of years and indeed is organic, there is damning health research around it, suggesting that is in not necessarily safe to eat. It is linked to IBD, IBS RA and colon cancer and is banned in European Union ... My cottage cheese had it in it which funny thing is my go to when having Crohn's attack. I HATE reading labels especially in a store where I have to keep flipping reading glasses up and down. One lady suggested I look only for ingredients... like what I would buy to make it. As I don't see me  looking for carboxymethyl cellulose for a dish (ok in small amounts, large amounts ferment in large intestine).  Worse they go by different names depending on where the product is made.  Some even have numbers. Hubby and I started through the salad dressing and condiments. Now we wonder if the raw veggies/salad that we thought was messing me up was actually the dressing I was putting on it. SIGH.Doctor office said also since I am not in the hospital (still no beds and selective procedures being canceled again) my recover time will be at least twice the time (as least 16 days) and the pain will be longer to deal with as my home med is no where close to the strength of morphine I take in the hospital.  I am in pain, I compared it to the final stages of natural childbirth and Daughter 2 asked if it was when I delivered her or Son 2 which I went into labor ... hard labor 7 times for, Daughter 4 I didn't have labor as I was too busy puking from the flu . I look like I am pregnant for the bloat.  I went from walking 10,000 plus steps a day to less than 1,000 steps a day. I didn't eat for 3 days, than ate cottage cheese and crackers. Last night was double pumpkin pie as it was what Hubby fixed from scratch. I figured it was safe.  Tonight is potato soup.  I have no energy (need to eat for that right?) I am tired, either fall asleep at the drop of a pin or not sleep due to pain and just be tired. Have to be careful not to shut down the digestive system with pain meds and then have to go through the pain of starting that back up. Been there and done that. A HELL far worse than now.I am whiny... I haven't gotten to the point of Hubby telling me to knock it off but he does point out improvement which is next to nil at this time. Well , maybe not as one was I was home not in the hospital surrounded by covid  And I have Charlotte to cuddle some with me.I have started inventorying the seeds coming in and planning what season to plant what.

{"title": "drip lines for garden vs cold storage/root cellar vs pay off mortgage", "date": "Friday, January 7, 2022", "text": "Hubby is all for root cellar and waiting on the mortgage. I am for drip lines as I know how much time I spend watering all the gardens and fruit trees (in pots)and possible cold storage for some things as I felt we didn't really have an area for a root cellar... might be because I have built a couple with Daddy for his sister and his Dad.Our friend who is a Community Emergency Management Director, CEMD for short (aka Prepper) made the choice for us.Basing what he knows and on our age and abilities and then he added the layout of our land. His suggestion was No root cellar ( not enough slope and would lose 2 trees) and no buried tanks, freezers etc. Our health in 5 yrs will not be able to handle climbing in and out with ladders or being on our knees uncovering frozen stuff that would cover the lids of what ever we buried.The drip line for the gardens was a yes. (Showed us on line where to buy it local) Saves us electric from running the well pump, saves me time, and as it takes less water, more on target of plant, it will save more ground water and that also affects our neighbors on the same  underground water supply. He was glad the pond was not graveled as that allows the dirt around the pond to absorb water (more ground water). He was glad we have 90 % of rain water going to the pond and the other 8% going to the county drain, 1 % going to a cistern and he wished we would reroute the one that just goes to the ground at the back door of all places (ME TOO).He suggested it be routed to the cistern. That can be done when we rebuild those steps.  He then pointed out some areas that could be used for food storage. We could drill out concrete in north wall of basement for venting and do an enclosed 8x10 area. That is my pantry area now. I would lose space for 3 shelving units that I would have to find other places for. CEMD understood this and went looking for other places for those shelves. He suggest to move all empty canning jars to barn where we are going to set up the canning stove, add a refrigerator (we have 3) and a sink (we have that in barn not hooked up) Move the shelving units to those areas where the empty jars are sitting. Start canning our meat (I don't do much ) and get rid of 1 frig (as the 2nd one would be moved to barn) and at least 1 freezer.(two would be better)(lower electric, more food easier to fix). Put shelving units for meat where frig and freezer is at. Thought two places in barn that would be good for storage (cabbage) but Hubby was against it as he would have figure out where to move what he has stored in barn. CEMD being his buddy politely told him to quit keeping things that needed to go to junk yard. That is now on the March project of clearing the barn, as I had not put the back stalls in that as it's mostly tractor stuff and stuff along that line.He found a decent place in house in north south lofts for winter squash, temperature is perfect thought the humidity is a little low. We have a small humidifier that was Son2 that would work there.Said to leave beets, turnips, etc out in the garden with cover of screens to keep mice out as we have raised boxes and some other cover. Thought of other ways we could keep stuff in gardens that overwhelmed Hubby for sure. He personally had never used row covers for winter growing and was interested in how it does after this spell of wind chills at 10 below zero.I do need to focus on heirloom/open pollinated seeds and harvesting the seed. Suggest I plant one or two  of each variety in pots and move them behind the house so they don't cross pollinate with anything. CEMD then walked through looking at how the home is set up for emergencies. We have 2 generators, one diesel and one gas. We fuel for both on hand. We have a wind mill at pond that we could move to the water pump. We would like to get some solar power down the road. We have thought about getting a non electric pump that some of the Amish use for the deep well. I have a hand pump on the cistern. He strongly suggested we do that even though it is expensive. We just need to know how deep the well is first. (On to do list now). CEMD thought we were in decent shape except for needing a way to heat without propane. We have looked a bit for a wood/pellet cook stove for the barn as it has the chimney in place. If things got real bad we would move to the barn. Front bay was where the guy(age 18) lived while he built the house. It has water, septic line and the chimney for the stove right there. Would be easier to keep going in bad times. He strongly suggested Hubby to get his HAM radio back on line. We are in an area that we get NO alerts or warnings of bad weather. IF he had his HAM radio on (we have it on antenna) we would hear other HAM radio operators sending out alerts and warnings. Over all , we are in good shape and he priced the drip lines for the gardens including the fruit trees at $750 if we did the installation our selves.We got to visit with someone of like mind, that understood where we were trying to head for. He is also hunting for some seeds I haven't been able to find that is good for winter storage food. He would like to try them himself. Enjoy your day. I got seeds in the mail I need to inventory and to get the ham in the oven."},

At noon, we ate at Perkins (pancake restaurant) as I had to eat a meal before the EEG. I brought home half of my meal.5th I took Perkin leftovers of 2 pancakes, 1 French toast, 3 sausage links and 1/2 cup of home fries and diced up the link and chopped up the home fries and put them in to a big egg aka frittia. I cut the French toast in half and split the pancakes between us. Hubby got some toast as he was still hungry. Then M sent over dessert so we had that.. vanilla cake with mini choc chips and some kind of topping baked on it. Today we have chiropractic so we will have the leftover spaghetti with bread sticks and salad ( I planned that to have dried fruit in it) and the last of M's dessert.Friday we will have roast ham, sweet potato, and apple sauceI am not sure of Saturday, depends if Hubby works.

Was supposed to start back to work from surgery on wrist and elbow the next day and now that is not happening.  We also handed her some money for groceries and such. Her insurance is getting her a rental.Stopped to drop off stuff to Daughter 4's as they were celebrating Christmas on NY Day. The night before her car got TOTALLED along with a neighbors by a hit and run driver... cops are looking into another neighbor as the driver. Going to take a lot of evidence as no one has security camaras in that area. She is now driving her daughter's car and looking for a new place to live as that is the 2nd car totaled while parked in front of her home (no driveway). The other one was the city's trash truck.Texted rest of kids about those two, surprised I was the first to know about both.  We are usually the last to find out as they don't want to worry us. UNLESS it is Son2 and then he has to tell us each and every detail. His new girlfriend said she figured out she does NOT have to ask how his day went as he will tell her immediately.I went through all the seeds, glad I made notes of what to not reorder. Still spent 3 hours going through it, checking notes I made of what grew better and when. I have some that did horrible in the spring but wonderful in the fall.  Made a buy list with options of something we would like to try. This week I will be searching for what I need for the best price.We saved $95.72 on propane as we prepaid for the year and it has increased by 35 cents/gal. PLUS we went 4 wks past our normal fill.We went to the store for dairy only. Took 4 stores to get milk, large curd cottage cheese, plain yogurt and cream cheese. Hubby put the word out to local dairy farmers he is looking for dairy shares.We saw an old friend that used to work with Hubby, his wife and him are preppers (actually it's his JOB to handle communities emergency's like wild fires, tornadoes floods etc). I out canned him and then gave him sources for canning lids and jars. He did let us know a local bakery has sales on Tuesdays. We got bread for 25 cents. It costs me 60 cents to make the same size loaf. We got four loaves for M as she had just got back in state so that took some pressure of getting bread on the table off her. We got bread, tortilla wraps, pita bread, buns, rolls, hand pies, doughnuts and bread sticks for 25 cents each for us and split it with Daughter 4. We finished off the pumpkin yeast bread and the homemade rolls first.  I spilt some of it up to freeze and eat.  We won't make it a habit to stop as eating processed breads are not in our best interest.I am doing Frugalwoods Uber month (no spend except for necessities) and a pantry challenge (Good Cheap Eats) for the month of January. We both have several medical appts so we have tried to combine them so fuel costs are not so high as our medical out of pocket will be high.

We knew that because of Son 2 being in the Army. We have 2 that are coming up Boxing (Dec 26th) day for lunch.Son 2 called last night as he lost a good friend who was 70. She helped him find his house, the first he has bought. We have set the budget for 2022 to start paying off the mortgage. I had to tweak it a bit but don't we always? I already paid Jan mortgage and a small amt. extra in the principal. Bills are paid until the 6th. I figured up we produced 61 % of our veggies and 4% of our fruit last year. Amish produced 10% of our veggies and 6 % of our fruit.  I did not start any plants last winter since I was having hip replaced and then only bought 6 when I started in the gardens. Oranges, limes, lemons, pineapple and raisins are always going to have to be bought.This year we are aiming for 80% of our veggies and 25 % of our fruit. We have berry bushes, grape vines and fruit trees that are NOT producing yet. Maybe one to two more years. Probably will still get winter squash from Amish. We bounced around ideas to eat healthier or basically just eat as neither of us eat bfast and I don't eat lunch...

Specialist mentioned dry needling (I hate needles) but left it to the therapist to figure out the best. Since I have rebar in concrete (what my deep massage therapist called them ) for shoulders. They are not sure that is the answer when maybe regular deep massage would be better. My massage therapist retired after getting hurt at his day job.  Therapy is an hour away so they are going to try to work my therapy into Tuesdays when I am already in the area but it might not happen that way. We will see. My EEG for the ice pick heads and to see what damage the stroke in 2000 did is Jan 4th. Specialist said the headaches gave him the opening to run the test. It will show if I have vascular dementia caused by the stroke. Meantime, Doc thinks Hubby has the beginnings of Parkinson due to hand tremors... his hands have done that since he was 17, he broke a carpal tunnel bone, that did not heal and had to have surgery in the left hand which is the one that shakes the most. They had put him on a med that no longer works. So they are going to start running tests in Jan on that. We know his grandpa had and his dad has Parkinson and both also had dementia from it. I said something to Hubby's parents and they said we are now at the age where driving each other to medical appointments is the \"date\" of the week ...OH MY."},

A cold east wind hits the entire house and it's colder (and Hubby cranks the furnace up to 74 or higher) than a north western wind as it only hits the one corner . The barn protects a lot of west and northwest side.  We have already changed Wednesday and Thursday to meals that can be heated or reheated when Hubby comes in the door as he floats between 1 pm and 8 pm from work on those days.

By time he gets it and gets back, then unloads, it will be close to 8 pm. I made an itemized spread sheet to list all credit card charges.

We have a family member that just got arrested for using another  family member's Social Security number. Even with the shock everyone immediately dealt with it to protect them selves . Stupid was they used a number that was already under Life Lock. The family member admits they went through stuff in the homes when there for family meals for the last couple years. Better safe than sorry as we already had another member mess with us over 20 years ago that took five years to get completely out of.I spent a day unsubscribing from \"ads\". IF I do not see it I will not want it or want something like it. I cleaned out folders on my google accounts so to keep the amount in the \"free\" zone after I got my photos downloaded (Google sent it as a zip file) and on a thumb drive (old term  LOL).I checked to make sure that paying for Amazon Prime is still worth it. It is. I unsubscribed from two \"newsletters\" that is no longer related to how we live ... that's a savings of time. We looked for dental insurance. After a week of hunting we have found we are in a OUT OF NETWORK area( unless we drive 50 miles where we never go to) including for AARP, for pretty much any insurance we could afford. SO I went and asked several seniors in our area how they cover those costs, four had dentures, two had bridges. Our dentist for regular care, cavities etc. , they take care of Amish also, and two other places for bridges and dentures including snap in dentures. Hubby's Social Security alone is over 200% poverty line so we do not qualify for the community health/dental program.  I nearly lost my Aunt as her entire system because infected due to bad teeth. Hubby's parents use Aspen Dental even for their dentures. Hubby needed new work tee shirts, he was down to 2 and they were pushing rag bag time. I found a sale using Rakuten and got him Hanes Beefy (which last years instead of months). I pulled the ones he has for \"dress\" and moved them up to work and the new ones will go into \"dress\" drawer. The lighter colored ones he wears during warm weather is now in spring/summer clothes in Rubber maid in barn loft. Earned $8 digital on the orders from Amazon.I mended Hubby's work pants.I turn the heat down from 72 to 70 during the day, turn it up at bedtime and turn on the fan to ON instead of Auto when Hubby comes in as it helps warm up the front room. By doing this our propane has lasted 3 wks longer than it did last year (temperature average the same).We turn it down to 65 when we are gone for longer than 1 hr. The upstairs is 54, the basement is 62 and the pump house on a separate gas heater is on 37,just enough to keep it from freezing the pump. Our water heater is instant ready so it only kicks on when you turn on the hot water.The electric bill is still below the amount we budgeted with a week of Christmas lights on it and with more usage of the airfryer than the oven. The outdoor and 1 inside Christmas lights are on timers, 3 hrs. in the morning and 3 hrs. in evening. The only time they will be on all the time is Christmas eve morning until Christmas Night.We did not go to the grocery store this week during errands. I have plenty of milk and just harvested enough greens for salads. I have found by lighting 4 candles at the dining table we \"feel\" warmer and the thermostat also goes up by 3 degrees. It's not that close to the table LOL. I have plenty of candles, yard sales, auctions and family that must think I burn a dozen a day over the years.  An oil lamp (our go to during winter) does not \"warm\" us as well. As usual I used homemade laundry soap, cold water wash and short cycle in the washer and dried everything on the racks. If  I need to wash bedding or table linen., I wash them at night so they are the only thing on the drying racks.I got 2 $10 Amazon gift cards from Pinecone and 1 $5 gift card from Swagbucks. We decided to eat at a sit down restuarant after 2 back to back doctor appts. We ordered the specials and then immediately asked for take out containers and put half in the container. IF I add salad or fruit we might get two more meals out of it.

We figured it will be next year due to the covid spikes around us.I canceled my Real Simple magazine. Even though I read it, and two others of the family read it. We jointly decided to cancel it after seeing the renewal costs. The other two can read it at their library. Hubby has picked up a couple hauling jobs he normally wouldn't take to make sure he has enough in his business account to cover next month, Supply chain problems affect the Amish that he hauls for that build pallets for the supplies to be transported on. If you don't work in a job it affects you don't realize who it affects.Due to kids struggling with on and off wages, they have all asked for cash instead of gift cards. Four of the six of kids (adult grandkids don't care if we give them anything or not as long as we text or call at holidays) have said they are using it on the groceries sales after Christmas and New Year's  to stock up for Jan as they all are figuring things to be bad.We had 2 appts changed to Tuesdays as that is our errand day and we combine that with Appts.

The credit cards are paid in full each month and mostly utilities, medical and groceries. I have no car payment. There was no place to add what Hubby pays so it looked like I was in the negative even after increasing my withdraw. Head of the branch said my guy walked into his office and told him I had an issue with the program... he asked who I was ... the gambler's daughter . OH WELL , that explains it. They always called Daddy the gambler, it's how he earned his living when he was younger. He did it when he retired and refused to get rid of stock that I still hold because I refuse to get rid of it also.They did a manual report. Added Hubby's side also and filed a complaint to the head office over it along with the fact I had already met with my guy and dealt with every thing.  They did acknowledge they don't see many that can live on social security with very little of an IRA especially with a mortgage. I am my Daddy's child. Brother is Mother's when it comes to money.  I feel for his wife.  I forgot eyeglasses, no insurance coverage for that. This past year that was about $1200 for the two of us with exams. I have 5 pairs :sewing, computer, reading, long distance and sunglasses long distance. Hubby has two pairs of computer and two pairs for driving. He wears bifocals when driving. Need to put $100 a month back for that.I forgot dental and remembered it when they sent a card to remind me of my appointment on the 13th. They offer cleaning only and dentist only. They see a lot of Amish that do not have their teeth cleaned. I get both which is $150. This year we both had work done at $250 each. So we spend $1100 for the year. I figure I will just round it up to $1200 and put back $100 a month.Hubby said take it from the extra money for the mortgage. I really don't want to do that unless we have to.I called my IRA guy. He said he was just getting ready to call me as he had miss figured and I had 8 years left to pull the money instead of 7 and that he could add to what I am pulling now to cover those two bills and I would start getting that figure this month. WHEW....

She paying for her son's flight home, his dad is paying for him to go back to base IF HE EVERY GETS TO COME HOME, still is paying off court costs and probation costs (she was ONE hundredth over the limit of drinking and then got busted for driving without a license as hers had expired LAST YEAR). She was not sure when she was going to be able to start paying us.  Not bad news like I was worried about but we really figured she wouldn't pay us until she got her taxes back if then because she has one ,LAST one, graduating from high school.. he does take some college classes also and works as a cook and she is a server. BUT she did offer to give us gas money(wanted to know how much she should put back for us) when we went down to drop of Christmas or/and see her son. WHICH NO ONE EVER OFFERS US. Glad I was already sitting down. Daughter 4 is working overtime. From 3 days a week (32 hrs.) to 6 days a week.

The person (referred by my mortgage guy)  that works with first home buyers is working with her and her son in law and daughter to get them on track and be supportive of them. Daughter 4 said her credit score it almost there and she is saving for the down payment and closing costs. She is looking at the HomePath program as she is able to do repairs in a home. She won't be making payments to pay us back until 2023 as we agreed. We want her on her feet and in a better home as the one she is renting has a slum lord.  Daughter 1 had surgery on her elbow and wrist of her left arm(had right arm done a couple years ago). They told her it's from running registers for a long time. She is in management now and finally sucked up going for surgery. Son 1 is waiting to see how things go with the new covid before he finalizes plans for his vacation in Jan. Daughter 3 said she is working extra hours due to people quitting. Just let her know when we would be down like a day or so before. We might have to drop off gifts(cash in cards) to her at work if none of the kids are home. Two oldest are working thru their vocational school , next one down is working with his dad and the youngest is babysitting. They grow up so freaking fast."},
{"title": "January 2022 through October 2024", "date": "Thursday, December 2, 2021", "text": "YES that is correct. Hubby said he wanted the mortgage paid off. I told him that the last of the big projects then would have to be put on hold until that. He moaned and groaned  and thought I was out of line.We had our semi annual meetings with our IRAs guys. BOTH backed me. At this point if he continues to pull what he is then he is going to out of money in his IRA in 20 yrs at a 6 % interest rate (that has been the average and when it is over that is is called FROSTING on the cake) I looked him right in the eye and called him DAD. Because that is exactly what Daddy did on 2008 which is probably why I caught it. Mine is an inherited IRA that has to be closed out in 7 yrs. IN four years, I will have monthly amounts be sent to an account to be invested under my name instead of Daddy's when the taxes will lower (if someone is NOT pulling so much out of his IRA)This is how the budget is and I am using my blog to hold myself accountable.Monthly budget which runs from the 20th of each month as that is when all the money is in. Mortgage $1450.02 includes property taxes and farm insurance as according to our loan.Medical insurance thru Hubby's old employer $828Medical co pay and deductible  $420 ( I already have this in savings so it's not in the budget this year since we have to pay it upfront and we know Hubby is being tested for his tremors). I will pull 2023 from our tax refund. Propane $150 , we have to prepay in Aug for the next heating season. This is set to automatically go to savings.Electric $150. Our company does not offer the budget so I just put the money that is NOT needed over into a savings . I figured up the average (holding for 3 yrs now)Trash $17  this will probably go up since diesel went up. They have changed their routes to try to lower expenses. (Billed every 3 months so 2 months goes into automatic savings and then pulled)Landline (cell phones don't work well in home) and internet $100  Only ONE company in our area even though others have said they were coming in... still not here.Water softener co $65car insurance (my truck and the motorcycle) and farm umbrella insurance $92.65Life insurance $111 (his and mine and 5 of the kids that are not covered at work and we are not willing to put burying them on a credit card like 3 of our friends have)OTC/ medication $20 MS 365 program . We tried Open Office but there was things from Hubby's old employer  that would not open on that program.$12(goes into automatic savings until the bill comes due).My cell phone $53.82. Business pays for Hubby'sAmazon prime $12 (goes into automatic savings until the bill comes due.) Kindle $11(rounded up)Graduation IN SAVINGS  We should have 2 graduating but Daughter 3 warned us her older daughter might graduate this year as she has enough credits and she is in nursing school. She was suppose to graduate next year with our other grandson. ) Hubby uses his \"odd jobs\" he picks up off and on to pay for graduation. Since we know ahead of time who is graduatingCharlotte... $25 , includes food, treats, vet, nails clipped and tags.Fuel $200, includes my truck, motorcycle, 3 lawnmowers (we will be selling one next spring), snow blower  and the tractor. Right now it's my truck, snowblower and the tractor (snow blade is on).Regular savings (we get free checking due to savings) $150.Cleaning items ZERO I should have enough to get through most of the next 2 yrs IF my kids don't need to raid me.Home maintenance $20.  We have some Menards Rebates the will help cover this. It goes to savings until neededVehicle maintenance $100. This is my truck only and our mechanic will let us make payments if it's more than that.Garden $20. I might need a little fertilizer or soil. Food processing ZERO. I have enough canning jars, lids, vacuum bags, and freezer bags probably for the next 2 yrs Personal items ZERO. We are stocked for 18 months.Paper good ZERO for 2022. UNLESS kids raid me.Office supplies. ZERO for 2022 Weddings ZERO. we give what we can afford and if they are living in the area we fill their pantry from ours.Christmas $100 automatic savingsBday $30 automatic savingsGroceries $150 (what is left will be put back for stock up)Eating out (as Hubby will not go to movies or watch one on tv and there is no rent a movie place in this town) $80... if we eat at one of the two sit down restaurants that is once a month with the tip. IF we eat take out Chinese or pizza/calzone that is twice a month. IF we eat fast food (Wendy's or Arby's once in a blue moon Taco Bell that is four times a month.   OTHER RULES.Any tax refunds minus the following year's copay/deductible must go on mortgage.Any cash back from credit cards must go on mortgage.Any money paid back from kids, will go on mortgage. Any money left over  will go on mortgage. Any extra money earned not ear marked for something is to go on the mortgage. Any money found (like the 50 cents I found today at the mailbox) will go on the mortgage. Hubby's IRA (which I talked him into and his IRA guy backed me) withdraw has been cut to 40% of what he was withdrawing AND it goes on the mortgage completely UNLESS we need it for a crisis. Just to clue you in by doing that it will now last We will see how close we can get to paying it off by then.  The lights are all up (Hubby did a great job again with the outdoor lights) and I have started the list of what needs replaced. Son 2 is going to give us his tree as the lights don't work any more and he is tired of fixing them (added a strand to get him through this Christmas) so he is going to get a tree AFTER Christmas. Our Army grandson MIGHT get to come home from over seas for Christmas...the Army Nonna does not see it happening with the new covid crap, the civilian Nonna prays it does.  When you have been an Army Mom for twenty years you know how that goes. If he doesn't get to come home I will send his Christmas money to him as he said he is saving for a new car when he comes out in 3 yrs. I did order the prime rib for Christmas eve. BUT anything else is on hold until we find out if he is coming stateside.Hubby is trying to lose weight. He lost 8 lbs. and then gained 6 lbs. back (I think he forgot to take his work boots which weigh 3 lbs. off this time). He started paying attention to how many steps he takes a day. Days he works hauling he gets the average of 6,000. Days at home, was 2,000. He said he lost count of how many times I have told him he was being lazy as he actually drove down the lane to get the mail, drove next door to talk to E or wanted to get the tractor to pick up something that he could easy pull in the wagon by hand. He realized he was really being lazy. Said something to his Dad and his Dad told him that is good part of why he went down hill with his own health. I also pointed out how much snacking his parents do especially before they go to bed. Hubby is going to sleep at 8:15 (was 9:15 during daylight saving time and more often I am turning off the tv and lights because he fell asleep with the remote in his hand when getting ready to set the timer for 30 mins. on the tv) and gets up at 4 am (was 5 am).  At least he is now paying attention and trying to get more steps in.  We moved dinner up to before 5 unless he is working and then it's either soup or a light supper. Days he is not working our big meal of the day is lunch. We are down to 167 items on the punch list. Probably will not start back on that until March  or April. February and beginning of March is pruning time.We changed the budget for the 50th million time. Hubby said he wanted to focus on getting the mortgaged paid off. I told him how it had to be and both IRA guys backed me.We are ending the year in better financial place since Hubby is still hauling 3- 5 days a week. Usually at this time he is down to 1 or 2. So it is nice to not have to cover the bills of the business. He has enough \"net\" he could cover the expenses of the business for the winter which is usually slow until April. He has 3 years payments left on his truck. He is 3 months ahead on it. He plans to continue the business until the truck is paid off.On the sad note, we have had four deaths, 2 of the young men friends of the kids/grandkids gunned down with a random shooting. One of the kids friends wrecked after getting drunk and high, the people he hit are recovering  and another killed himself after hearing his parents one more time arguing over child support. His note was \"Problem solved\" Probably a good thing his parents are not one of my kids or I would be in jail for beating them."},

{"title": "memories of late Husband, table up", "date": "Monday, November 22, 2021", "text": "When Garry and I got married, he bought me an old tiger oak (veneer) table that would seat all us.  He would not let me put it up in the rental as we were starting to work on the one step above condemned house we bought. Then his daughter and I moved everything into that home even though it was not anywhere near finished, no running water in kitchen , okay no kitchen as half the floor had fell through to the basement. We both understood it would take years, did not need to be paying rent and mortgage and her and I could handle it with the little ones. He flipped but too late as we rented from his uncle who backed us so much he rented the furniture truck and drove it himself.  He still insisted the table not go up until he got the dining room done. He was down to redoing the floor when he dropped dead at work at the age of 39 of a massive heart attack ... inherited from his father's side as we learned later. I put the table up that very night. Told my mother and kids to NEVER wait to enjoy stuff. Every day life is a special occasion. When we moved out of the old home I left the table for Daughter 3 who had her 4 boys and her man's 3 girls. She passed it back when she became homeless (spent $2000 on Christmas but did not pay her rent. Not sure she learned the lesson but her boys definitely did when their friends had to take them in). It's been in storage for six years.  I saw it in the barn and told Hubby I wanted in the house. He was fine with that.  The veneer is coming loose and one leg needs reglued but Hubby already said something to H who repairs and builds furniture and he said to mention it again after Christmas and he would work it in his schedule to repair it. Right now H is doing Son 2 cabinet that was Mother's that fell apart. I used Howard's restore for golden oak and the applied Howard's bee's wax and let it sit here as this is the warmest room in the house. Was not much \"oily\" feel next morning. Wiped off and took it to the dining room,And then had to find a chair I could sit in and not have my chin to the table. I used the computer chair for a couple hours and then Son 2 reminded me the chairs he gave me when I lived on 245 fit the table and they were upstairs in the sewing room. I brought one down. If his lady comes to eat, I will have him go get the other one (he only had 2 chairs) as she is small as me. I put the table cloth (folded in half as it was for this table at full 8 ft) on it, Hubby put the oil lamp on cake stand and the tempered glass I have the candle, butter, salt and pepper on (that gets moved if I need to put a hot plate on the table) back on the table. When we sat down to eat he mentioned he didn't realize how crowd the other table was  until then. If I hadn't seen the blanket while looking for other stuff I would not had realized we still had the table. I thought it had went back to her. Even texted her to confirm we were keeping it. ANYWAYS, it was a nice ending to a whacked out week."},
{"title": "On the gross side. ", "date": "Friday, November 19, 2021", "text": "E wondered why I peeled out of our driveway and hauled butt down the road.I cut my thumb on the mandolin while cleaning it. Did not feel it but definitely saw blood. After 15 minutes of not getting it slowed down let alone stopped. I drove into the Urgent care as Hubby was over an hour away working. Holding it above my head while driving.In total it bleed for 45 minutes. I am not on any blood thinners and have been off the aspirin for over 2 weeks (thank heavens) due to going in last Monday for injections.  yeah it caught the nail bed also . The glue dried purple and then Doc used steri-strips as he felt stitches would cause more issues and I had it pinched together so well he had to turn my hand to see the cut.He said to let it come off on it's on. Probably 5-10 days and not use the pad of the thumb for at least 5 days . No getting it wet and use gloves while cooking. I have gloves .Hubby took one look and added a wrap that I can slide on  and off to keep me aware to not use it. At night I had another one taped on and it was a good thing as I woke more than once to Charlotte licking the wrap. OH well."},
{"title": "In the pantry ", "date": "Wednesday, November 17, 2021", "text": "I still have grape jelly (from juice) to makeI still have apple jelly (from juice) to makeI still have tomato paste (from canned tom.) to makeI have turnips I will end up canning I have radishes I will end up pickling.  I now have 15 gals of apples to deal with as we finished clearing the last tree. It even over whelmed our Amish neighbors.I know after Thanksgiving I will have turkey meat to freeze and broth to can.After Christmas I will have prime rib meat to freeze.. but probably no broth as the butcher shop said there probably would be no bones but I could stop in if I wanted bones for broth. Not sure I want to pay for bones. I need to make more homemade noodles as we are not out. As I am now getting free eggs I can make the noodles for just the price of the bread flour.In the pantry ... remember I \"put up\" for 18 months, it was a year until the kids had to come get food last year. By bumping it up to 18 months we can make a year and still help the kids.  FYI, my buckets hold 25 to 35 lbs.This is the basement door in the hall. My onions hang here. I don't really have a good storage at this point for keeping onions but Hubby can get 6 lbs from the Amish for less than I can get at the store until around Jan.Looking down the stairs. Starting to the left and go right , the bucket you barely see is White Lily white cornbread mix, then regular AP flour, then sugar, then regular bread flour, then long grain white rice then just barely the bucket of minute rice. Oils, vinegars, on top of cabinet nuts and M&Ms that Hubby make trail mix from along with muffin mixes.This holds dry mixes of just about everything. Jell-O, pudding, cake, stuffing, crackers, dry milk, Bisquick that Hubby can not live without etc.Cookie mixes in the washer. They are Hubby's that he likes to make so I keep them separate and don't have to worry about mice getting in the washer with the lid that goes on it. Rubber maid is dried mashed potatoes and mixes for baked doughnuts. Lots of empty canning jars, buckets have White Lily AP flour, White Lily bread flour, White Lily self rising flour, regular self rising flour, regular oats, quick oats and 00 flour > I call this the bucket room as it has the most buckets , Hubby changes what he calls it almost daily.more canning jars, gray frig is dairy (heavy cream, half and half, extra milk, cheeses, some beverages , freezer part is breads or such. Black frig is fresh produce and the freezer is produce and bagged turkey. Shelf unit next to black frig is the appliances like crock pot, roaster (behind jars) cake decorating stuff, al. pans and my bigger pans I use for bulk cooking.The other shelf unit is paper goods, foils, freezer back, vacuum bags, paper plates , ice cube trays for broths or fats. Some larger serving dishesWhere the rug (actually dog bed as Charlotte likes to lay there during storms) is the door to the mechanical room where the furnace, water softener, breaker box and water heater is.Freezers 2 and 3, 3 is at the door. Three has fruits, nuts and desserts, two has a veggies, pork and poultry and some odds and ends.Freezer 1 beef, sausage, bacon, breads, meat fats, condiments like carmelized onions etc. The shelf unit at the end is canning stuff and camping things if Hubby needs it. We do have a small freezer in the barn, I use it for leftovers and meat that will be ate in the month. By April, lates May it will be cleared as it's the freezer we use if we end up making ice for the Amish neighbors if the pond doesn't have enough water or freezes.ignore the double buckets as you saw those in the down the stairs pic. The first single bucket is the White Lily white cornbread mix the next one is semolina flour. The next 3 buckets with crates on them is dried sliced potatoes, dried hash browns and dried cubed potatoes. Crates are white potatoes and sweet potatoes.applesauce. fermented foods, veggies, condiments  1st shelf unit. Coffee , coffee syrups, booze next unit (I cook more with booze than I drink and Hubby only drinks hard cider now days) , last unit Charlotte's Den I am clueless why she claimed that spot but she kept digging the canned goods out of there to lay so I just put a bed in it for her. Spices and herbs on the two shelves about her bed (I have over 100 and yes I use them all) and then top shelf is the extra pasta.Bucket closest is Jasmine rice, the other one is Basmati rice, container on floor beside it in home grown dehydrated greens and herbs. Shelf units is pie filling and juices, other is soups, more pie filling and some grocery store canned veggies.Bucket is par boiled rice, bottom shelf is pickles of different kinds , then dried fruit, then canned fruit and pickled beets then more canned fruit and then homegrown dried fruits and veggies.left four buckets of 25 lbs. sugar AKA emergency supply for M  Shelf unit is different pastas, bucket is ramen noodles.condiments, canned butter, Crisco, flavored vinegars and oils. Top shelf has dried veggies and canned red bell peppers. Karo syrup beside butter.Taco shells, tomato products like pasta sauce, sauce, pizza sauce, hot salsa, mild salsa, green tomatoes, already got empty spots there .  Bucket on crate is for homemade noodles which I am out of, upside down bucket is for coleslaw that I can or kraut if I ever decided to go that way. Behind those buckets is more pasta, wild rice, black rice and risotto rice. Next unit is beans and canned meat. Combination of store bought or home canned. Bottom shelf has different lentils and broths . Bucket is brown sugar and XXX sugar and container in corner is corn starch, baking soda etc. Kitty bucket (there is two that Son 2 bleached and passed to us for storage) ) hold bags of smoke chips for the smoker.Right side against wall, special flours, yellow corn meal, syrups sugars, stuff to make desserts from. The one between that and the condiments has lemon and lime juice, fruit butters, jellies and jams, more dessert stuff on top. beans, most of it home grown. Dining room dry goods used daily or weekly, bottom shelf is dried fruits. Next is different sugars, vanilla beans and paste, powdered lime and lemon juice and different syrups (some are medical used like elderberry and molasses) Next shelf is bfast items and dried soups and flavorings One more shelf up and you have the stuff Hubby uses for his trail mix, different crackers, peppers, bouillon, some dry mixes of sauces and gravies that is hard to make for just two.  Next up, fig newtons, different salts, herbal tea and the glass container that holds the family size tea bags for our kettle tea. Up one more shelf, powdered drinks, extra family size tea bags and herbal tea . Top is extra tea. I buy tea once a year. I know what we use. I had to move the 3 plastic pitchers I have that sits on this. I have one for whisks, one for wooden spoons and rubber spatulas and one for cooking utensils. Left to right, self rising flour in ice cream bucket, White Lily self rising on top of it, Ap flour next with AP small can for when I need to dust the board, instant flour, then bisquick and almond flour. Baking supplies, corn starch, baking soda, pomegranate molasses malts, stem ginger (thanks to Great British bake off) all the little goodies of adding different flavors as Hubby is definitely in to giving me new recipes.I do have half a dozen cooking oils on roll care and two dozen bfast bars boxes on top of another cabinet . Hubby does not get \"lunch time\" when hauling so he carries trail mix and bfast bars that are not sticky or crumbly as he does not like the mess in his truck. Dust is fine, crumbs isn't LOL.I usually get asked how much we end up pitching due to it going bad. Very little. If I have something that needs used up I either plan to use it or ask Daughter 4 or Son 2 if they could use it. If it is flour or sugar I pass it to M and she just refills it with fresh . They go through 25 lbs. of sugar and 50 lbs. of flour A WEEK. Sometimes more like when canning. Believe me, I've been to her house to ask if she had something that I ran out of like yeast.I know what we use in a year. I have the same line for cleaning, dog treats(a little high now since we just lost two but Daughter 4 has 5 dogs so nothing will go bad) paper goods and personal items. Paper towel usage is down because I push the use the rag first.  Hubby just picked up pet friendly sidewalk salt and got enough for two winters. If we get a lot of freezing rain we will use twice as much because he KNOWS what we use in one year.All the kids get rice off me, none really eat a lot of rice so it goes bad on them. They have learnt to come get it from me and as a family we get through it before it gets bad. Another thing I will point out, I am organized , everyone in the family knows where things go as they also know I date pretty much everything and it's first in first out to keep the \"oh crap that got shoved to the back.\" I do have to watch that a bit more if Hubby takes something to the basement frigs and does not think to tell me he did. I've gotten to the point I go down and check every other day to keep that issue down also.How often do I shop? Twice a month is the most.  One will be a major dairy and what ever produce (mushrooms, carrots and celery) that I don't have any more of. The second one will be milk. Maybe something that is on sale that I try to keep stocked like butter. Bfast bars and trail mix is once every 3 months if that. Flours is maybe 9 months but closer to 12 months depending on if M or the kids need some (M replaces, kids give kisses and hugs, I did have a grandson that did some of my chores while I bagged food up for him.)Right now I am low of popcorn. We didn't grow any this year thinking we still had some in the freezer. I just pulled the last pint."},

The rest of the greens went into the dehydrators and then grinded them up. I have 16 oz of powder organic greens (savings of $23.50 -$35.95) I based the coming menu on the leftovers and garden. On Friday's lunch ,son 2 brought his lady up to meet us and the right before turning in the driveway admitted he never brough a girlfriend home to meet us(female friends yes, girl friend including the one he lived with NO) . I fixed turkey (meat from freezer and broth I canned) noodles (M's noodles she gave me) mashed potatoes (last I got off B) green beans (I canned) and homemade bread with choice of peach jelly (I canned) or apple butter (I canned) . They took leftovers home and I shoved ours in the freezer.We had left over mac and cheese and a small piece of smoked sausage (from Thursday). I diced the sausage, tossed in the mac and cheese and added peas I had froze from the gardens and served it with applesauce I had canned for our meal Saturday.Sunday's meal is leftover steak chopped and added to veggies in frig made into an  frittata and make biscuits.Monday's sausage gravy , biscuits and the leftover mashed potatoes of Friday made into potato cakes.Tuesday's leftover stir fry, our local Chinese restaurant is now has their dining room back open. It's not a buffet like it was  but they have a good menu. I froze the leftovers. I will add veggies and maybe some rice.Also on the menuSoupe Pelou with brat patties (instead of brat like hotdogs)Swiss chard soup with grilled ham and cheese (either bake bread as we are now out or use tortilla wraps)Harvest chicken, apple, sweet potato and Brussel sprouts one dish Haluski, might add peas and need to add some kind of pork on the side to make Hubby happy.Looking at making refrigerator pickled radishes, apple cider donut cake, homemade saltines and most likely more bread along with the biscuits. I have my back injections on Monday afternoon so I need to have a couple days of meals prepped before we leave for that."},
{"title": " busy", "date": "Friday, November 5, 2021", "text": "Since Hubby didn't get the heater installed in the first bay of barn. I had to move anything that would get ruined by freezing into the house. I still have boxes sitting in the front room, not as much and not the same boxes as I got that stuff put away but now have cleaning supplies to find a place for.The four hours I spent moving things into the house, moving other stuff that won't freeze out to the barn, Charlotte spent chasing pigeons. She finally caught one (YUCK) but didn't rip it apart after she snapped it's neck. I yet to figure out how she caught it. Must have flew low enough for her to jump and catch it. She brought it to me. Thanks for the gift, took her in for a treat. Then tossed it over the fence into the field while she wasn't looking. One of the cats (E or H's cats) took off with it.  Charlotte then spent time watching E deal with hay *it's green still so he will feed it to the animals instead of storing it*. AND then went to watch H while he was burning scrap wood. Then went over to check out what Cheryl was doing, English neighbor.  I was glad to see her out and about (not so much about the bird) and more like herself. I told Hubby this morning I was going to fall clean the east and west lofts this morning. That would finish the second story (we have two sets of lofts). Then I was going to put the cleaning supplies away in those areas. He told me to put the grow light and table where I want it in the east loft and figure out where I want the grow cart as the big drying rack is where it was in the front room. BEFORE I moved the cleaning supplies up. I did clear some area in the laundry room (now half fall cleaned LOL) to put personal stuff. Actually let me see what we have and I figured we might want to pick up toothpaste. I put the bleach there and couldn't figure out why I had 6 bottles of bleach until Hubby mentioned that E was having trouble finding bleach for the house and barn (calf bottles etc) . I must have picked up extra to cover it if they couldn't find any. I know when that happened he ended up getting a bottle from each of the neighbors. They buy it by the caseHUM Maybe since Hubby is working  only one job this morning , he will be back this afternoon to carry all that up 😁.We had corned beef hash and eggs for a late (after 8) supper. He mentioned Charlotte crawled up on him and woke him up this morning. Usually she just is curling up to sleep on him. But this time she kept pawing at him. So he got up thinking she wanted out and realized his alarm was ringing. It was on the 3rd round as he has it set to ring 3 times (he uses him cell phone for an alarm). So he gave her a treat for waking him up so he wouldn't be late going to work this morning. He very seldom gives treats. I have to only computer that updated to windows 11. Already moved what was in the center on the task bar back to the left. Deleted a few things off the task bar and then put excel and word on the task bar as I use them daily. MS word glitches a bit but they already said it would as they work out the kinks.We were talking of a no spend except for necessities for the month of Nov. Then the spare manual can opener broke. I was going to wait until Dec but Hubby said order it now or the other one will break and we won't have ANY can opener. I told him I would just pick other food that I canned until it was replaced. But what ever I thought since it seemed to upset him I would order one. Not like we would starve to death. I've sanitized a flat head screw driver and used a hammer to open can goods with. We got the spouting down on the porches and basement ramp roof. $80 paid.Hubby paid J for the two porches. He cut the price almost in half because Hubby was helping a lot and we did the clean up.The only thing left on the to do list is move the pile of dirt from the yard that came from redoing the basement windows and dealing with a fuel tank that he is not sure he is going to use but doesn't want to get rid of in case he changes his mind. I'm like it's going to be nothing but rust and worthless as it gets older. Sell it or scrap it if you aren't going to use it. In this , he is his grandfather's child (mother's side).I best get at it. Son 2 called last night to confirm he was bringing his girlfriend (He is 39 and she is 42) up to get his car and meet us next Friday. It's the first time since he was 18 yrs old that he has brought a \"girlfriend\" (has several female friends) home to meet us. Did not even bring the woman he lived with for 2 yrs home.  I brought it up to his attention of that and he responded that should have told us that she wasn't important enough to make that trip. I came back it should have TOLD HIM.  He admitted the attraction was \"I can rescue her\" along with 3 little boys that reminded him of his sisters to raising kids on their own. This one has already made it clear she doesn't need rescued (she supported the child's father for 14 yrs) and the father is active in his daughter's life. Son2 and her have been friendly (along with the daughter) for 4 to 5 yrs now working together at the VFW hall during events. SO it's not like ,here is someone you don't know to date mom with the daughter. Which as a single mom when I was raising him, he understood both sides of that. The daughter asked if he would go to Thanksgiving dinner with them... BEFORE her mother asked him . LOL"},

I got 5 of them yesterday within 30 minutes. No way I could deal with it as  I was canning turkey broth and apple jam.I have 5 canners worth of food to take down to the pantry now.I said something to Hubby about should we turn on the heaters in the pump house(pump house has a thermometer so we can see how low the heat is) and barn (1st bay) . He quickly said no but then admitted he forgot to buy the pipe to install the heater let along install it in the barn. But he didn't think it would get that cold in the barn.So today I am now moving anything that would be ruined if frozen . I might end up spending a week moving stuff around but I would rather be safe than sorry.Hubby went down to the pantry then yelled up wanting to know where the corn beef hash was.  Answer \"Canned meat section\". \"Where is that?\" West wall, north end of shelves ( do you know how tempting it was to yell back same place it's been for 4 yrs?).  He yelled back \" Why is it with the beans? then a quick \"Never mind, it's protein area.\" He did notice that was where the broth was now also . I was putting it with the soups but the soups have \"grown\" since I canned soup this year.Guess I need to get back to figuring out where to stash this stuff. Have a great day Blessed BePS. Charlotte is spending the day tracking birds that keep flying around the barn. She should sleep well tonight."},

She will bark at Pepper (E's dog) and Betty ( Jan's dog when they walk pass on their daily walks). But there is silence when the school bus and buggies go by. She does more looking out the windows than running to the door. She must have been taking the balls to get Rascal to play with her as I barely can get her to play with me and them. She will walk part way of the perimeter (like Wilbur did).  She was doing this before while we ate, I was surprised Hubby allowed it. Now she sometimes just sits there facing him while we eat. He won't let her put her head on his chair or lap. With his tremors he does drop food. But she waits until he tells it okay to get it. Rascal would wait also. Wilbur would not wait a freaking second.She finally is sleeping again at night. Hubby said she only got him up once and it was before midnight. He went to sleep at 7:30. I warned him this morning that would be 6:30 next week. We have talked about getting another dog, not a puppy as I don't think she would do well with a pup. I definitely said spring unless she got so depressed like Tashy did when Tubby died. She's eating normal already, definitely still is got the routine of last potty before bed and then treats still. But the care free puppy is gone. She looked older after Wilbur died, she looks even older now. Grief does that. Our apple tree we were told when we bought the house wasn't very good. I even said we would cut down this year because it didn't make apples at all or not very big ones. IT RAN US OVER with apples. Even M was ran over and there are still apples on the tree. I will try to pick more for fresh eating as I am done with canning.I canned ham broth, pork broth, turkey broth , apple sauce, and apple jam.I froze all the fat. Still have to cut the turkey fat into cubes to bag.I got my restock order from Amazon. They screwed up and doubled the one order. They aren't charging me since it was the warehouse's mistake.Hubby got his hearing aid replaced. They are only a couple months old but it wouldn't connect to the app on the phone. The owner is his hearing guy and flat out said to Hubby that he was sending it back and requesting a NEW replacement not a repair. Actually got it within 2 weeks. I was noticing he was getting confused with only 1 hearing aid. He said something to the doctor about it and it was his \"bad\" ear was the one without a hearing aid so he wasn't getting all the information he should of to make decisions. Which is why he went and got hearing aids to begin with SIGH.Canner about done with the last of the broth. I need to go pick apples also.Blessed Be Everyone"},

(her pic with her Jaxon )Well kind of... we paid her the last check we will be giving her to live on. All of us did a happy dance . We will do another happy dance in a year when she starts paying us back and again when she pays us off.  Out of 6 kids we have 3 that owes us money. Son 2 is already making monthly payments with an automatic deposit. Daughter 2 is barely making enough to keep the roof over her head along with Grandson (her youngest) being in his senior year. He is strongly thinking of going into robotic welding.  You can't tell there is a ramp on the front porch. We are still batting around color of railing. Both porches are done except for some odds and ends we will do ourselves next spring. Also paid in full as of this morning. We had a mess to clean up in the yard but it was easier for us to do as we keep a lot of stuff most would toss. I don't know how often we have needed 3 to 6 inches of wood for something and dug through the \"lumber \" section we have in the barn. Even E comes over now to see if we have something when he is only needing a small piece.Spouting guy is coming today for finish that part. That will be paid in full also Probably good we are stopping with outside projects until next spring with this cold drizzling rain we have had for the last couple days and today.Rascal(black one and 11 yrs. old) woke us up at 5:30 am today having a seizure. Charlotte was right there with us holding him and trying to keep him calm through it. Cookie, one of our old dogs used to have seizures. He is doing good now. Rough way to start the day. Every time she goes past him she stops and smells him and then goes on.I have an ear ache, used garlic oil ... my ear did the Mexican hat dance. Gland is swollen and I have a low grade fever. Took aspirin for fever, Vicks the gland and wrapped a towel around my neck. Hot tea with honey after I took my elderberry syrup. I really need to remember to wear something over my ears when I am outside in this type of weather. In this area, I am my mother's child. She always got ear aches and ear infections if she didn't wear a scarf. Fever broke quickly. Ear is no longer dancing and I feel a lot better.We watched Charlie Brown Halloween on PBS. We got a kick out of it as it's been a couple decades since we have watched it.This week in the pantry:I roasted a pork butt roast, froze the leftover meat in meal servings size, made broth from the fat and bone. Canned 5 pints of pork broth and put the fat in the freezer.I roasted a ham,(still want at least 1 for freezer ) froze the leftover meat in meal servings size, made broth from the fat and bone . Canned said broth and froze the fat.I roasted a turkey for supper last night, will be freezing the leftover meat and making bone broth from it and freezing the fat after I put a casserole together of it for Monday.Tonight is taco soup using stuff from the pantry and freezers. I am making enough for Sunday also. I gave him a choice of taco soup or chili (which is already canned). He chose Taco soup.I shelled and jarred small red beans, coco beans, lima beans, and Italian cranberry beans.Hubby is now only drinking half a pot of coffee each day. I asked him why and he said I mentioned how his coffee is very seldom on sale( he drinks bold or French roast) and he uses two to three times as much as I do. GEEZE I should have said something sooner???  He is the one than makes the coffee in the morning, you would think it would click he was just turning mine on to reheat every other day while making a full pot for himself daily. Daily I have started brewing a kettle of hot tea around 11 a.m.. When it gets down about half way I fill it back up with water using the same tea bag and bring it to a boil. We used family size tea bags with our kettle.We had doctor appts so combined it with grocery shopping. M gave us her list. It took 3 stores to get everything. Two stores were half empty of food. The last one had some empty spots in every aisle. Could not find saltine crackers. Amish use them a lot. Family members that are in food service told us that even the restaurants are struggling to get them. I found a couple recipes that I will try. After we dropped off M's stuff to her and I put our stuff away (still didn't find a red cabbage). Hubby announced he wanted the house stocked back up like I had it  before we supplied the kids for the pandemic.  Believe me, I ran to the computer, made 6 orders (ended up with $18 digital and 5 % cash back on what was through Amazon) before he could change his mind.  After I placed all the orders I asked why the change. He said he thought it would go back to the way it was, not maybe as many varieties of stuff but the basic stuff. Not being able to find saltines was what triggered it wasn't going to be back to normal between the pandemic and the drought in areas.He EVEN ORDERED a fitness tracker as he knows during the cold months he does not get the exercise like he does in the warm months of pushing the push mower around garden boxes and unloading produce at the auction. Doc has mentioned it more than once he should have SOMETHING to track his movement. He didn't even argue with me when I told him to ordered a protector and extra bands for it. I need to update the to do list and think about meals as of Monday Nano (National Novel writing month 50,000 words Nov 1st to 30th... https://nanowrimo.org/ )Blessed Be everyone"},
{"title": "No frost yet.", "date": "Monday, October 25, 2021", "text": "We haven't had our first frost yet, it's about a month behind.  A little scary with how warm it still is. The weather is cool in the mornings and mostly warm in afternoons except the few times we have gotten rain (we need lots more).Furnace is on 70 until bed time, it goes up to 72 *which puts where Hubby sleeps up to 70. I just shut vents mostly (not all the way as HVAC guy said the could damage our furnace but 1/2 half way shut was okay) When he gets up around anywhere from 3 to 5 a.m. he turns it down to 70.  I turn it to 68 when he goes to work and when raising bread I use a heating pad. The oil lamp is lit in the mornings instead of turning on the light.A candle is lit at supper instead of turning on the light. Laundry is on drying racks or clothes line. I inventoried my baking supplies and then grains. Baking supplies were good, grains we were almost out of barley and farro but the rest is good. I am also low on chia seeds. What is needed is now ordered at lowest price I could find. I was surprised that none of the bulk stores didn't carry any type of barley. I went through two cookbooks wrote by Brother Victor-Antoine d'Avila-Latourrette. It is Monastery recipes. I also went through another one \"The American Woman's cookbook (1948) by Ruth Berolzheimer. I pulled recipes that we have most of the ingredients.  Both had turnips and radishes in recipes and I have plenty ready to pick in gardens. Lettuce should be ready this week also.We talked about ham and Hubby wanted another turkey for bagging as shredded. I told him we would wait until after Tday unless the price drops. I would like one ham for the freezer and another to cook in the next week. We'll see what that price is. Hubby wants 3, one whole for freezer, one in slices and bone for soup and one now.I wrote the grocery list based on the recipes I got from the cookbooks. Hubby whined a bit about soups until I pointed out that most were potage type soups aka thick or stew type. We then had a round about whether or not Boston baked beans (or any baked beans) were a side dish or main dish. Just in case you are interested https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_baked_beansI did ask how bean soup could be a main dish but a bake bean (aka casserole style) couldn't be. He told me his family never ate bean soup, not even his grandparents. So he texted his mom to make sure he was thinking right and she said his great grandparents on her side ate a thick bean soup but not her parents or them. and his dad's side didn't at all. She really couldn't answer why. Since he is always willing to try any food at least twice. So he didn't say anything when I fixed the meal the first time . All the kids love bean soup, fried potatoes (or fried potatoes and onions) and corn bread. Some people are just not soup eaters. He loves red beans and rice, Jambalaya, and Cuban black beans and rice. Refried beans are welcomed once a week LOL. My parents ate soup twice a day for years since that was what they had during and after the Great Depression.We got the last of the watermelon dealt with . I still have apples, pumpkins and dried beans. Couple jellies, jams and tomato paste also. We will be combining doctor appts, banking, groceries and a few pit stops on Tuesday. Will be a LONG DAY.    I sat down yesterday and paid (or sat aside) Nov's bills. I forgot 4 items... all 4 auto pays. Added them into the SS budget as we now call it and instead of having $1.70 left, we are over by $78. IF we get the raise in SS like they say, we will have a lot more at the end of billing.I talked it over with Hubby when he got home from putting ramp on front of parents home. I showed him what we pulled between both IRAs and SS last year. Also supporting Daughter 4 was 1/4th of that amount. Plus we sold her our car so that was a drop in ins. (I hated the car but was what we could afford cash wise at the time). I suggested we use His IRA (which we weren't going to use at all) to cover medical *$6400 out of pocket, propane $3000 IF we can keep the heat like we did last year, $1200 for 2022 Christmas and $240 for the umbrella farm ins. That puts us back down to social security and my inherited IRA. We decided part of it would go in savings for the medical, we can put the rest in 11 month CDs (no penalty if pulled sooner).  I'll do small CD's so anything we don't need can be rolled over for 2023 which is when Hubby goes on Medicare. This year I had 2 surgeries by Feb. that wiped out my share of the out of pocket. Hubby never has wiped out or even used half his out of pocket but about the time I don't put it aside he will need it. That's why I figure we will end up rolling over part of it. I sent budget to both our IRA guys. they felt that was really good as when they figured it out we were dropping the budget by almost 60% .We figured the in social security could cover clothing, shoes, groceries and stocking up."},

We had 4 children and his sister (same age as our oldest) in the home. No health ins to cover the hospital. No life insurance to cover the funeral and bills and no savings to cover anything including the amounts of the utilities. AND WORSE NO WILL.It took 3 months for survivor benefits to kick in BUT since I had applied all the little help we were getting like WIC ended within a month of him dying.I sold everything I could to keep the utilities on (didn't put one in my name because they wanted $300 to do that, in fact when I remarried they wanted that to put it in Hubby's name. We didn't do that) and the mortgage paid.The his sister went to a cousin and his oldest we were raising went back to her mom. They both tried to take what was left in the house and the house. Thankful that the Judge not only sided with me but ordered them to pay MY lawyer for the extra costs.The home we owned we had only 6 months and it was ONE step from being condemned when we bought it. Within 4 years, we (as my kids worked right by my side) paid off the negative estate , doubled the value of the home and had a savings. I worked 3 part time jobs so I was always home when my kids were. We did yard sales once a week in the summer. Then Hubby came back in my life (high school sweetheart).We have a will(due for updating next year) we have life insurance and we have medical insurance. We have each other listed as beneficiary on IRAs.  I know what the social security benefit for me would be if Hubby dies before me. I also know that the car insurance, health ins out of pocket, propane , electric, water softener, his life ins, his cell phone, vehicle maintenance, garden, personal, groceries and eating out would go down, maybe not half but at least 1/3rd. That's equal to what I pay for right now. I would sell the work truck, livestock trailer and flat bed dove tail trailer. I might sell the tractor and all the equipment and my truck and get a newer truck with a plow on the front. Other wise E will be over here plowing me out like he does the other 2 elderly neighbors.If I die before him, he already told me he was selling all the garden stuff, canning stuff and 80%( probably closer to 90% as he is a 1 pot cook) of the dishes ,pots and pans. Not including my meds are a lot more expensive than his. Still, know we are covered , I wonder if we are missing something. When we update the wills, we are going to prepay our funeral expenses. Both of my parents did that, Daddy wrote his obit. Said he wasn't putting me through what Mother did (I wrote her's the day of our Thanksgiving) .  We plan to do that also. Take that off the kids' backs.  We also decided if we died together or went in nursing home. Son 2 who is in charge of us and estate is to have an estate sale/auction, everything goes. Son2 did happy dance as it's in writing so none of the other kids can cause a problem or they don't get any of the $$.Do you have that stuff taken care of?"},

Since he has the biggest income with his IRA, he can make the choice. It took me 2 seconds to tell him we would be short what I pull from Daddy's IRA. BUT pointed out how tight the budget would be, there would be NO extra paid on mortgage or projects done that we had to buy something or hire it done. No helping kids or his parents.  We could do birthdays but Christmas would not be covered in that budget.He said work it out  Okay, I went on computer and changed the budget and showed him how it would have to be. I pointed out the following which is where we usually have disagreements.I did bring up restocking. He wants to not restock until next fall but agreed to restocking with sales and then agreed to a certain amount set back as we both know it can take a bit of time to get cash from an IRA if you don't have it set up.Propane. I prefer 68 to 70 for heat . He prefers 72 to 74 (worked over 30 yrs at furnaces in factory). I told him heavier shirts, slippers on his feet instead of just socks and use a blanket when he is sitting.  We decided on 70.Electric. I will run the furnace fan full time (we already know that helps with cold spots) BUT I brought up he doesn't need to leave a light on by his chair and two at the desk in the front room. He doesn't need to leave his laptop on all the time and he doesn't need to put the tv on sleep for 60 minutes when he goes to sleep in 30. I really wished he would just turn it off but he is has had this habit since he was 16 and had rheumatic fever. He needs He added he quit plugging in his LED candle in the wheelchair bathroom as he found if he left the curtain cracked he could see well enough through the night with our security light.  I will not turn on my bedroom light  by the bed until I go to bed. Habit of turning it on when I close curtains so when I go to bed I don't step on Rascal who is BLACK. Means I have to walk around the bed 3 times dealing with lights, I laughed and said more steps for my Fitbit (which is under medical budget as it lets me know when my heart is racing). He suggested I use the bathroom candle he isn't using. He has adapted to less AC (since we only turn it on when Wilbur was panting, we will do the same for Rascal gets to that age ).We by passed any bill that is set or already to the lowest we can.Christmas is based on what ever we can afford.Food processing this budget is at ZERO. I have plenty of canning jars (HA HA), vacuum bags, freezer bags, foil, saran wrap, press and seal wrap etc to go 2 years if I can careful.Garden costs is set at $20/month. I need a little bit of soil for some of the boxes , I  and 1 type of tomato seed. Home maintenance is  $20/month. I usually use Menards rebates to refill this except for the frig filter. I buy it by every other year. We won't have much in rebates since we are not doing any projects that we don't have materials already. Cleaning items is $20/month. The only thing I don't have a year's worth is for the dishwasher soap. Well I might if I am the one putting the soap in. Hubby follows the directions. I use about half of that.Personal. $10/month. I really couldn't think, we both checked, of anything we needed but felt something might pop up so it's in there.Paper goods $5/month. Another one I don't see needing for awhile and can wait for salesOffice supplies.$5/ paper and ink, stamps (next fall) Eating out .... I said $40, that's one sit down meal at our local restuarant or take out Chinese. He said $120. We agreed at $80. But that doesn't include birthday or anniversary. Groceries ... I had cut it to $200, now I have it at $150. I did ask M and B(E's mom) what they spend at the store and how often. Both buy lemon lime soda(7 up for B as her hubby won't drink anything else) . Both said around $70  to $100 if there is non food products. They both said twice a month. Once themselves (usually their hubbys) and once with an Englisher going to Aldi's that is not in this area.  I am really stocked well now except for ham. Hubby thought another turkey( I have a 20lb one in freezer) and 3 hams for stocking. SO it's up for debate. According to USDA thrifty plan we should be spending $426.70 on food (not junk food or non food products) a month. I can say my in laws spend that much but I see a lot of snack foods that neither of them should be eating due to diabetes and weight issues. I know where Hubby got his snacking from. As a kid they had a snack bowl(5 qrt bowl) that they munched through twice a day. I was told to get a drink of water. We will see how this goes. Hubby wanted to start it NOW but I pointed out we had to pay J for the two porches, an exhaust system for Son 2 (Hubby told him he could make payments), Daughter 4's last payment. PLUS he wanted to add 3 hams and another turkey and he is not fooling me, he will order a prime rib for Christmas eve.  I got him talked into starting Dec except for groceries."},

Kt (daughter 2) was in 10th and Blane (son 2) was in 7th.  Blane called it hoarding and Kt thought it was funny I would have something over 25 yrs like that. Hubby asked why I had it all listed. Because there was more than one faith in our family and I listed them all. You know how some families point and say I am the same faith as my great grand parents.. Not my family. I am not sure if ANYONE was the same faith while living in the same house. Daughter 4, Son 2 and I have been struggling with menu... so Daughter 4's daughter is now in charge of sharing HER menu.We had 123 pasta Saturday with cheddar biscuitsSunday we had meatloaf, baked sweet potato, green beans and pineapple.  Monday was pork butt roast with roasted veggies. She usually does menus on Wed. Last week she had goulash, Son 2 thought it sounded good but definitely made too much as he ate it 4 meals in a row. Had no freezer room as he had just bought a couple roasts LOL. I have been pulling from the freezers and pantry. Daughter 4 doesn't go to the store until she get the \"menu\".My to do list is down to 25, I have 7 phone calls to make tomorrow, (hubby has one and has to go make the truck payment) and counted a 10 different veggies and a fruit that need processed in the next week. It was up to 32 but I did some things that were on the internet to get it down. Today, I planted over 100 bulbs of flowers part of them were in real bad shape but they were free so I planted that was on the list for a couple weeks from now. We'll see how it goes if they grow or not. Total now is 42 divided by 11 days left to get it done is 3.8 a day. I get the phone calls done and I will have done 2 days LOL. There is one day of appts so I won't get anything done on that day.We needed humidifier filters (2 per humidifier) I found them on sale so ordered enough to get through this heating season. While looking for that I found adjustable window screens. Hubby had priced new screens made for our windows at $65 each. We need 9. we decided to get the old fashion ones that we will be sticking in the windows until we replace the windows. I got found them for $12 with a $3 off each code. Then got another $3 off total order and 5% cash  back on my credit card. Well worth looking for something else since we plan to replace these windows in 5 yrs.E let us know last night that his daughter's appendix burst when they started surgery BUT since she was already in to the surgery it wasn't bad.  We checked on the older kids that was home and the eldest let us know they had an older cousin staying with them to help with chores. They spent today at the cousin's family (E's oldest brother).  Hubby just left to go get E and M and child from hospital. I sent 2 pillows, a light blanket (she had no coat when she went) and a small trash can just in case. Hubby took water bottles for every one. Hubby went and told E's family , his family was going to send a message to M's side through a Mennonite. I hope the families go help E and M to play catch up on chores and getting ready for winter.Hubby installed a solar charger for the electric fence we have between us and the pond. One of E's horses likes to lean over the wire fence and play nip on Charlotte. Only took one zap (both got zapped and she raised up to touch the fence in same area) and both now stay off the fence but it's not costing us anything. They still race each other down the fence line. Pretty much a tie according to E.E &M child is home late Sunday night. The 4 little ones came home Monday afternoon as B thought it would be better for M and child to have some quiet. M's brother sent one of his older girls (he has 6 girls and 6 boys) to help this week.Monday: I cleaned all 3 frigs, Hubby took trash to the road for Tuesday 5:30 AM pick up. I hemmed 4 pants of mine, mended 1 shirt of Hubby's and he has already tore another shirt, 2 bras, 1 dish cloth and 1 wash cloth. I made 12 meals of taco meat and bagged the mushrooms into paper sacks (they will last longer.) Got 4 phone calls done. Checked on daughter 1 who had wrist surgery. She's doing fine except it's her dominate hand LOL. Hubby got one of his calls done, second one to call back and has to go to hearing aid place to get his hearing aid cleaned.LORD what a week... it's only Tuesday and it feels like it is been a month instead of a few days. Hubby's one hearing aid is not working so they sent it in for repair or replacement. So he's down to only one...we should have realized it wasn't working as I kept asking him if he had them in when I was to the right of him which is the one that isn't working. It's under warranty so it's free.I got my IRA dealt with over the phone so I don't have to drive 30 miles one way to deal with it. That's done for this quarter. Mine averaged 20% earnings.Hubby got his IRA dealt with over the phone (60 miles one way). That's done this quarter. Hubby's averaged 12% earnings.We will have to go in person in Dec. I got my Humira ordered, sharps container ordered and 2 doctors offices to call me back when they can figure out when to schedule me. One actually had their \"scheduler\" program fail, just totally fail. They don't know who is coming in when at this point. No back up system at all.I canned 14 pints of Russian Salad ( zucchini, tomato, bell pepper)I canned 12 pints of butternut squash and 2 pints of acorn squash.Hubby went to 3 different Menards to get the last of the stuff for the kitchen porch, 4 outdoor timers for Christmas lights and some new roller handles and paint roller fills. I should have had him get brushes also as we are done to just a couple. We are having pigs in a blanket for supper. It's what is in the frig LOL.How is your week going?"},
{"title": "Here we go again. and some good news", "date": "Friday, October 15, 2021", "text": "FIRST  Daughter 4 got her 1st  and 2nd check at once. She did a happy dance. They were concerned since her 1st check didn't go through for direct deposit so they gave her a pay card for her 2nd check and then worked out the issues with the direct deposit with the small 1st check. She is grateful Son 2 and we strongly insisted we pay her this month even though she was getting checks. As her landlord doesn't do credit cards/pay cards she can pay him with what we paid her that is in the checking acct. and use the rest for utilities, groceries and gas and maybe fix the car where the deer hit her (in front of a state cop, he sent the video from his dash cam to her so she could give it to her ins). We all cracked jokes about another hit and run of  her new to her car( 1st one was totaled and the cops still think the trash truck did it but no witnesses or evidence). At least her ins will cover this if it's more than the deductible. Her son in law thinks his brother and him can pop it out since it's on the door. M and E's oldest daughter got sick late Wednesday night. Since a cousin had been over and had caught the flu and they don't think she was over it completely,  they thought flu.Thursday M sends note they can't get her stopped throwing up, did I have any ideas besides the 5 miles long list they had tried. I sent gas x (she was burping a lot) and Alka Seltzer for colds and flu. That helped a lot when I checked on her in the evening last night. She was keeping fluids and food down and feeling a lot better.This morning at 4:15, ( It's Friday right?)M was at our door as the child woke up with pain in the area of appendix. Hubby had jury duty so I'm the driver. E called (other neighbor keeps a cheap cellphone charged in his garage for the Amish ) local hospital and they don't treat kids that young (she's 11 going on 12). So told him to go to Marion.SO E and I took child to Marion who ran MRI and couldn't tell if she had ruptured so then they ran a CT scan and said her appendix had not burst but had a small rupture and since waiting for transport through the hospital would be 3 hrs. and then a 1 1/2 hr. drive to Children's hospital as they don't operate on children that young. (GRR, might as well drive straight to children's)The doctor was agreeable for me to transport even though he understood it would be 3 hrs. I made it in 2 hrs. before I could get her there, gave child a pain shot. and off we went.Since I had Son 2's car that DIED OUT in E's driveway when we were heading to Marion. We came back, I dropped E and child off, stopped and let my dogs out while I grabbed truck key. Then I switched vehicles with Hubby who's truck was in the bank parking lot where the jury was told to park. Texted him so he could check at breaks or lunch of what was going on. Stopped back to get dogs back in house. Picked up Child , M and E ,made pit stop to drop off youngest 2 as the 2 older boys walked across the pasture behind us as the hay pastures join between the two families, at neighbor around the corner and another pit stop to update E's mom . E called another driver to pick up his parents this afternoon to bring them to Children's and his Mom will spend the night with M and child. Then driver could bring him and his dad back to take care of chores and get the older 5 over to his parents. So I am not on driver duty tonight. He knows Sherm is got a limit of drive time around 10 hrs. so he figured that counted for me also. It's a state number thing with being a commercial driver.I told E that Hubby was hauling with his dad on early Saturday morning and was hauling for M's brother in the afternoon. But he could work in going after them at hospital if he need him to as both hauls can be put off until next week.At this time the hospital thought they might keep her one or two days depending on the seepage  from the rupture. Since E had his burst, he definitely understands the reason why they can't say exactly when she can come home.All 3 of them went to sleep while I was driving to Children's. Operating room was already prepped and they were waiting for us as E called the ER at Children's and told them when we were 30 mins away. So that helped everyone also.I got 5 hrs. sleep last night. My rear hurts from sitting in a vehicle 9 1/2 hrs. since I couldn't go in with them (COVID rules) and it was raining so I couldn't even get out and walk around the parking lot. Blowing storms I stay put.   I don't know how Hubby just zones out while being a driver like he does. He did say it's hard when he can't go in with them and time drags forever. But since I knew how long MRI and CT scan takes and normal time of waiting for results ...I wasn't wondering what was going on as E used hospital phone to let me know that. Now there will be 3 households behind on things, E & M's ours and E's parents."},

We have taken the summer gardens down, I put row cover on the fall/winter gardensThe first one is how they look now. When it gets to a frost or freeze it will look like the second one. I replanted some in bare spots were I had already harvested.Instead of horses we have the guinea hens visiting the pond. Rascal was frisky that day. Charlotte is always friskyThe hens just ignore them. Daughter 4's daughter got married in a small wedding at the preacher's house which is her new hubby's uncle. Five generations was representing his side, four on our side. Daughter 4 looked at me and realized it's my generation that is the oldest now .It kept the focus on the vows and not on a big wedding. GD said she has seen that those with big wedding crash and burn a couple years down the line when times get hard. But those that kept it small haven't. I told her it was not the amount spent of the wedding but the attitude of why it was spent that crashed. Thoughts of \"I deserve expensive things given to me\" will wreck your life. GOOD life not based on money.M is doing a lot better, she still has help come in after E had the 4 little ones for a day and complained he didn't get anything done ... then laughed and hired someone to at least come in half days. He's taken to working on the upstairs (drywalling) when he is on childcare duty. M and I just laughed and laughed. I spent yesterday playing with the budget since Daughter 4 comes off OUR budget beginning of Nov. Still tinkering with it.Fine tuning the last of the outside projects that to be finished this month. Right now it's more of getting him to quit changing what is planned and just get it done. We went a couple rounds about the roof over the basement ramp. J who is doing the porches stopped by to tell us 7 -14 days he is coming in to do both porches in 1 day. Bringing the work trailer and full crew. Hubby asked him what he would do for the roof... it was exactly how I said to do it. GOT TO SMILE.I started with 76 items to get done this month I did that list on the 3rd. As of this morning I am down to 38. I told Hubby since he isn't hauling Tuesdays that he can get on his own jobs. He didn't looked thrilled with that but he could actually finish some stuff in a day or two if he quit putting it off. He is a procrastinator which has been a hard learning curve for me as my entire family is \"let's get it done and off the list\".ANYWAYSAfter spending time with the budget I tinkered with the grocery list. I have 4 things in the frig I bought 2 wks ago still not touched. Still good but not even opened. HUM... We decided to go to Kroger's or Walmart once a month and then 2 wks later go to either Aldi's (if M needs something) or Save A Lot.  Got to get at it.. back to the to do listBlessed be"},

First load is on kitchen porch line. Hubby figured out that I have \"save\" $11.55 a month using the clothes line each month. I will save $13.76 using the clothes line when doing seasonal washing (bedding for 5 beds, 15 sets of curtains, 3 loads of clothing, furniture throws and dog beds).I am down to washing curtains (those that are hanging and those that was in storage).I have 3 dogs beds still.I have 2 loads of throw rugs.Then I will clear the gardens and garden shed if I can before the rain comes in on Saturday. If the hornets go away, I might be able to pick a few more apples. I'm highly allergic so it's not worth the risk.Monday I got 60% of work doneTuesday I got 99% doneWednesday I got 15% doneThat's an average of 58% done. Hubby asked me what that meant.

This area gets no direct sunlight but tons of WEEDS coming off the pasture across the yard.Transplant black raspberries as they are too young to put in ground yet but getting too big for the pots they came in.Transplant orchids (just finished blooming) Transplant philodendronTrim herbsOrganize flower bulbs that need planted in Oct. Get said bulbs planted in the north garden. Plant garlic after 1st frost.For the house:Prep the kitchen porch for it to be torn off this coming month. I have paint the support posts and the ceiling before they tear the rest off.We will be getting all the winter bedding, throw blankets, clothes etc  washed and put away, all the summer stuff will be cleaned if needed and put into storage.I will start do fall cleaning with the hope to get all 23 areas done by the end of Oct.   $29.35  on bank fees each.. this has been all year but it just dawned on me (duh) that this savings should be either going on the mortgage or in a savings acct.We were given produce. So the menu got changed LOL. I was able to split the leftover chuck roast into 5 meals in the freezer. We had philly steak subs (sub buns given to us) instead of philly steak pizza but some of the meat is now in freezer listed for pizza. I also put a bag in for what I fondly call blue plate special (shredded meat over mashed potatoes or bread dressing or both drowned in gravy with corn or green beans as a side along with coleslaw and some hot dessert) and some for 123 pasta or stir fry plus a bag for beef and noodles   I had a flank steak, it's now 3 meals of London Broil, satay and stir fry/123 pasta. I was given a tip beef roast. It's in freezer. I was given more butternut and acorn squash and a couple small watermelons. I will can(pressure can) the squash. I am not sure if the watermelon is good but if nothing else I will use the rind to pickle and can. Hubby found cube steak marked down as he went to store for one of the Amish. He asked the meat dept. if they would mark it down more since it was at the end of the day for it to sell. He got it for 1/4th of what the original price was. I floured it and baked it with gravy. We ate it for 3 meals.I harvest harvested peas. Found another zucchini and golden zucchini.  We ate 5 meals off menu after I added a few to do what was given.We went back over the budget... have some large bills being paid end of Sept and again in Oct to finish projects.I priced what I have on my master grocery list at different stores  and made notes on the original list of where to get what. A few things will no longer be bought as I am not willing to pay $7 for a bag of California Blend veggies. We got back $68 on our cash back credit card. It went toward a coat for Hubby for this winter. That leaves him only needed wool tube socks size 13-16. Hard to find in tube socks.I got a $45 refund due to a mistake that the company caught. Blessed Be"},

I say 4. Both of us will be shocked it is all of them. LOLThursday: Amish started working on the front porch. Hubby has to move the fence and due some filling in with gravel before they can build the ramp that will go on it. Since I was so tired but couldn't just sleep away the day as I was the only one home so the one to answer questions.I caught up the mending.3 of Hubby's shirts, One of his work pants. Of mine there was a skort, shorts, and 4 bras that the cups kept coming out of  in the laundry. I also mended 2 hand towels and 2 face cloths. Just getting that done made it a good day. I also wiped down all the canning I did last week but I didn't carry it to the basement. I can do that tomorrow.Having leftover chuck roast , mashed potatoes  and corn.Friday:I carried all the recent canning down and put them away. Straightened 2 shelves. I harvested peas, shelled them and put them in pan in freezer to flash freeze.I harvested concord grapes and using my new steamer made grape juice. I thought about making grape mash jam from the stuff left and decided against it. I have enough canning to do. We talked about getting rid of that grape harbor. We have 2 other grape harbors that should start producing some next year. This harbor is right next to the curve in the driveway. I really would like Hubby to take it out and straighten that section as much as possible by widening the driveway.. which lead to the conversation that he is still putting 2 wheels in the yard when he leaves and pulls in. We need to widen the driveway at the asparagus on the asparagus side. I think it will also help him as he keeps thinking he is going to hit the mail box. Can't move the mail box as there is no other place for it due to the country drain ditch. SO that was put on the punch list.We had chicken wraps for supper.Saturday:I bagged frozen peas. We now have 18 meals. It's been a very slow harvest. If I was canning I would have never got enough at one time to can even a pint. By freezing even 1/2 cup is doable. Hubby hauled. Produce auction is having their annual pumpkin sale on Tuesday. S has 4 if not 5 loads to go. Hubby started hauling the first on today. He will do 2 more on Monday and possible another on Tuesday. It will be a mad house at the auction as a lot of the local stores have people coming in to buy for their stores.We straightened up the front porch area. He stabilized the steps we are using for right now. Not sure if we will leave steps on that end when the ramp is up because that is where the ramp starts in the driveway. We might put steps at the other end of the ramp and change the fencing in that area as I wouldn't want to walk up that close to dogs if I didn't know them and they carried on like ours does.We had leftovers for supperSunday:The day of rest and we took it. We did talk about getting through the rest of the boxes, extra furniture, Daddy's stuff etc. as we just had some friends have to hire help to clear a parent's home and that was after 2 yrs. of being in assisted living home and them tossing stuff on a regular bases. Like Daddy's some of the wooden furniture had dry rotted so bad it couldn't be fixed. We decided to finish clearing the barn (house is done except for extra dishes) by next summer. I am 2/3rds the way through the front bay. Hubby has the last stall done and is going to put the tractor and it's equipment in that stall. Middle stall is half done, (he thinks mowing equipment and the motorcycle. The stall at the door..the south side of it is a kennel for the dogs if needed and he wants to put  his work truck on the northside so he can plug it in during the winter . He has a diesel truck and it needs the heater to be on during winter. The big bay and the loft over it is not been touched at lot. Goal is to have gone through EVERY THING by next summer.I fixed shrimp cocktail, T-bone steak, twice baked potato and salad for supper.Our tv started messing up today. Hubby sent pic to Son 1 and he said it was dying. BUT did tell us what he just bought himself as his had just died. We bought it in the spring of 2014. Monday:I called 2 doctors that I am over due for check ups. Neither are taking patients at this time due to high rate of covid. I won't bother to try again as it's been a month now for the same reason. It's getting worse not better around us.I harvested 2 zucchini, 1 golden zucchini, 1 cucumber, enough green beans to make a meal for us tonight and maybe 1/2 cup of peas that went in the freezer. Hubby hauled a couple more loads of pumpkins for S and then picked up a load of pallets from another Amish that's driver that had to cancel due to truck breaking down. We are having green beans, leftover mashed potatoes and beef and noodles for supper."},

I also will be getting the flu shot mid Oct and then Nov call to schedule my back injections. I got this month groceries bought in the home, not all dealt with.

It showed on the head MRI that was ran for other reasons, ruled out MS and tumors.Left side that affects vision, language and memory.  It has not affected it enough for Hubby who is a EMT to notice it. Or even my doctor that I see every 3 months. I still read nightly, I still run my mouth... which neither comment to my brother or girlfriend went over very well but our kids thought it was funny.I already have been doing all I can to keep my heart healthy since I was BORN with left side heart failure. I had a nasty fall awhile back and they now think either the fall causes the stroke or maybe the stroke caused the fall instead of my cerebral palsy. Six one , half dozen another. My attitude is IT DOESN'T MATTER ... it just is. My doctor who I see this coming week already called me to let me know that I just need to eat healthy, get exercise and not watch all the negative news.

{"title": "Why I cancelled Sam's club and other memberships", "date": "Tuesday, September 14, 2021", "text": "I am glad Sam asked. First when I look at taking a membership or subscription I ask myself these questions... does it save me money? does it save me time? Do I learn something from this? Is this helpful in any way, shape or form? (more of this at end)Our Sam's club is 45 minutes away.  If we walk through the store we end up with 3 flat bed carts. We buy the OH LOOK AT THAT... stuff that should be OH WE DON'T NEED THAT  stuff. Junk food to be sold in other stores in my pantry LOL.We did 2 curb side pick ups during pandemic. There was limits and somethings were out of stock.  SO basically I paid around $25 each trip as my membership is $50 about. At that point it was worth it to kept us out of the stores as neither of us was vaccinated. Our Walmart and Kroger's (Kroger's is now closed) didn't have anything of my list. I did use instant cart a couple times.Membership renewal was coming up so I looked to see if it was worth having.45 minutes away along with at least an hour and usually two shopping and then 45 minutes back. ADD the cost of gas/wear and tear of vehicle  to get there and back. My time is based on $5/ hr. with mileage to cover truck is $1.75 (yes that is more that gov't allows on tax return but it reflects the true cost for this area AKA $5000 for entire brake system of truck) I compared what I was buying:25 lb. flour (bread and all purpose) was actually more at Sam's than Walmart or GFS (Gordan food service, no membership required, 30 minutes away).FIGURE THAT ONE OUT of Walmart cheaper than Sam's.25lbs sugar ... same thing , more than Walmart's or GFSYeast at 1 lb. was a bit cheaper at Sam's but cheaper at Amazon and could not get at bulk store.SO I started comparing... where is my money best spent... I was NOT saving enough to cover the cost of going there let alone the membership. The Amish bulk store 15 minutes from us has it but they are higher priced than Sam's club and limited on what they have. But I can pick up some items that most regular stores don't carry. Like gelatin in bulk that I can store in old canning jars. Especially peach gelatin that is hard to find. GFS , my brother's favorite place for getting stuff for family gatherings (he is a retired school principle) is closer (30 minutes) and lower prices, generic for most items. Walmart and Save A Lot are the only grocery stores here. Both with in 10 minutes. Save A Lot has decent meat. Both stores acknowledge that Amish shop there and have items in larger amounts that those families would need to buy. Then I priced Amazon. The amount of tv shows Hubby watches covers the cost of the membership against the cheapest satellite tv shows we could find as cable is not out here.   Add the fact I saved over $600 on shipping last year and get 5% back on my credit card. IF we had a Meijer's here I would shop there. But the closest is 50 minutes from us.We shop Kroger's and Aldi's biweekly if needed when already there for doctor's appointments.We shop Save A Lot and Walmart here. I order from Amazon and some spices (not much herbs as I pretty much grow what I use) from .We have memberships or subscriptions with the followingAmazon, shows for Hubby who zones out in front of the tv (finally is setting a timer to turn it off) , unlimited kindle for me as I am a read-alcoholic , free delivery most times. Seed Savers not only can I find heirloom seeds but it's a tax deduction for the membership.Real Simple magazine. Recipes, time saving tips and I pass this to Daughter 4 who passes it to her daughter who passes it to a friend etc. I do not do auto renewal. I wait a couple months to find a good deal on it.Milk Street magazine. This is Hubby's. He watches the shows, loves the recipes and gotten a few more quick meals that were really good on the table.I think this is one of the few things he reads AARP... lots of tips, great brain puzzles, discounts not so much in this area but was great where we lived before . We are looking at going that way with our taxes. Keeps me up to date with changes in Medicare etc.MS 365. I tried open office and several times could not get it to work with things coming from Hubby's employer. We are thinking strongly of Norton 360 with LifeLock as we have free AVG. Three of the kids have it and it has been a blessing. Since I just dealt with my credit card number being stolen I know how bad it can be. This would fall under peace of mind.We thought about a membership to Anytime fitness or YMCA , that's all that is here. BUT we know we won't drive 15 minutes (both on west side in town and we are east of town). The price was on the high side. Wished there was a planet fitness as I would have done that. We decided we would just wait until we qualified for silver sneakers. I picked up a Fitbit which paid for it's self when it caught I was having heart issues(again, some more , what ever). I have a Fitbit Sense with membership.       We have a GFS (Gordon Food Service , they also supply restaurants) that sells to public 30 minutes away, no membership required. T"},

I just have to wait until MY money comes in to pay off her balances.She knows we have $6000 of bills that have to be paid this month (truck brake system and the two porches) so I will cover her with my social security and my IRA.We want house paid off before Medicare as a friend on the same meds as me has to pay out $6000/ month since she went on Medicare /Medicare gap. Extra payments on mortgage probably won't happen the rest of the year. I really hope I am wrong about that. Really hope she finds something. But even Son 2 said the airforce base is now at 25% of employees due to Delta covid.Does this sound like a HERE WE GO AGAIN year???"},
{"title": "September... remembering Daddy", "date": "Tuesday, September 7, 2021", "text": "Son 1(Hubby's) and Son 2 (Mine) turn 39. Their birthdays are 10 days apart. We have always said it was like raising two sets of twins as our girls (Daughter 3, Hubby's) and Daughter 4 (mine Hubby adopted when she was 9) are 9 1/2 months apart.Daughter 1 hit her 15 yrs at Walmart .Daughter 2 is pretty sure she has a new place to move to Oct 1st. She thinks she might even have other people to move her that doesn't require her 62 yr old parents to move heavy furniture. We are okay with using our truck and trailer if she can work around Hubby works schedule since he can't afford to take off now.Daughter 3 is planning her wedding. They are eloping. They have not set the date... or at least have not told when. Daughter 4 starts work this week and gets her 2nd covid shot.Hubby picked up a couple extra jobs to help pay for the brake job. Meant he worked Saturday and Labor Day. BUT the less he has to pull from his personal account to cover the business the better he will be.I canned 14 pints of cole slaw, 4 pints of cole slaw dressing, 8 pints of ratatouille, 6 quarts of veggie soup and froze 2 more cups of peas. I harvested and pulled plants of black coco dry beans and small red beans. I still need to shell them.We are running water from the pump house to the pond for 1 hour in the late evening. Pond is down to 3-4 feet instead of the 8 feet it is supposed to be. We watched E's horses walk across instead of swimming across the pond while they were over here. His pasture south of us is now connected (we removed fence with his blessing even though it was OUR fence) to the pond area. Saves E from carting water and we don't have to mow around the pond as the horses do a good job of \"mowing\" it. We are down to 46 % on propane tank, so we are on spot with not needing a fill for another month at least (fills are when tank is at 25-30 %). We usually only prepay winter heating season and summer fills are full price and cash. This year they allowed summer fill to be added to the prepay of winter season so I added it. If they get the fuel for less than the prepaid price we get the lower price BUT if it is more, we still get the lower price. It can go down but not up so we don't have to worry about if we have enough to pay for heat.I cleaned all 3 refrigerators (which is why I canned ratatouille).  I pitched some out dated dairy. Last blood work showed we were low on calcium, doc was not happy with the comments of eating more ice cream (Hubby is trying to lose weight, he lost 8 lbs. in last 3 months but still is over by 38 lbs. Both his parents are over weight by 100 lbs. He doesn't want to follow that path). We spent last week talking out how bad our eating habits was (our go to snack... Reese cups anyone?) since we moved here. We used to eat healthy , rainbow diet of eating different colors daily, balanced carbs and protein, calcium...etc. What happened?We bought this place and started working on it. With the drive we were 10 hrs. gone from home. We staggered when we left, drove separate so the dogs were not stuck inside that length of time. Bfast was McD's on the way here, lunch was Chinese or the local store that serves hot lunches but no veggies. Dinner was what ever sandwich or pizza we could pick up once we got home as the focus was to get the dogs out and give them play time. Do laundry etc. We did a brain dump of what meals we used to eat (think 1940s through 1970s because that is the food that is from our childhoods) and what salads we really like when we eat out, as salad at home isn't as well liked. Then we went to bfast which neither of us eat. Mine due to stomach issues and Hubby always ate supper for his bfast since he worked 3rd but he would be up a few hours before eating PLUS he doesn't like to eat much as outhouses are the only bathrooms available with his work. We even listed desserts for fruit and dairy.He is now carrying more water  and cut back on the coffee (was a pot a day now to half pot like me) and has beef jerky and slim jims along with granola bars that he is putting in his old lunch box (small cooler) daily when he is working the full day on Wednesdays and Thursdays.We decided to follow Daddy's eating pattern as he was a diabetic at age 60 and only took 1/2 metformin daily until he was 92. He was on insulin, lowest dosage for his final year of living. He was the healthiest of all of our parents.Daddy ate bfast 2 hrs. after he got up. Bowl of raisin bran with extra raisins and 1/2 banana ( he wrapped the other half in saran wrap to eat the next day and washed the saran wrap to reuse), drank the 1 cup of milk he poured on it. YES HE MEASURED THE CEREAL AND MILK.  He rode his exercise bike the two hours before bfast while he drank his first 4 cups of coffee. He put a shelf on the bike so he could put his coffee cup on it. Watched the morning news while riding.THEN he went for a 1 1/2 mile walk, rain, sleet, snow didn't matter.Then he had his dessert... pie, cake, pudding. Sliver of pie about 2 inches wide at crust, 2 inch by 2 inch cake or brownie or 1 /2 cup of pudding. Then he did weight lifting for at least 30 minutes. He has free weights in the upstairs bedroom. At 11:30 he ate lunch. A slice of thin bologna sandwich with mustard (tomato if from garden) on whole wheat bread, 3 fig newtons, a small apple or 1/2 of large apple and another 2 cups of coffee. Then he walked 2 miles.Snack was at 2 pm what ever dessert he had followed by 2 cups of coffee.At 3-3:30 he took a nap of 20 minutes. I can't get to sleep in that time let alone take a nap. In winter time he would take 1 1/2 mile walk... when the sun was shining he would do it after dinner.Drink more coffeeDinner was at 5 pm but the menu was a floater until his final 2 years at home. Then it was navy bean soup with ham hock, fried golden potatoes, and corn bread. With  4-6 cups of coffee. Wasn't nothing for him to make 2-3 pots a day just for himself. It was how he was raised.He was 90 when he couldn't take his walks any more. Bad knees even after surgery. He handed over the keys to the car without battle as he felt he wasn't safe for him to drive anymore. Balance was starting to go. When he burnt his brownies so bad he had to throw the pan away he stopped cooking and asked for help with meals. When he started having problems eating (he had throat cancer and the scar tissue from surgery was causing issues) . He went to the nursing home. Until he was 92, he was still active, walking his wheelchair, eating well, able to carry on conversation even with his dementia. The only time I ever saw my Daddy frown he was sleeping. He always had a smile. We want that life for our selves. I know how had my Daddy turned his life around at age 60 when his health started going down and he was 60 lbs. over weight. Right now it's \"just talk\" now we have to walk the walk. Neither of us watches the morning news. Hubby might watch noon news for weather if he is home. I only watch the evening news if that. I might start listening to our local new (which is actually our little town ) on the local radio station. I will check their website to see when that is broadcasted. We both know we have to change this NOW as Hubby's parents were doing silver sneakers at their YMCA right around the corner then decided to not go out when winter hit and it's been a downhill slide since. Are you changing anything to be healthier through your senior years?"},

I need 2 2/3rds cups more to have enough for ONE meal a month. It wasn't a good year for peas. I am hoping I get enough as they are still blooming. But if not, we will make do.I have 11 jars of peach pie filling to wipe down and move to basement.I have 13 jars of rutabaga to wipe down and move to basement.I have 2 jars of turnips to wipe down and move to basement.I was given 3 cantaloupes that need cut and frozen.I have 2 small watermelons that need cut and frozen. I might make pickled watermelon rind.I was given cabbage so I will add that to what cabbage I have to can cole slaw. Will also make fried cabbage, New England boiled dinner using smoked sausage instead of corned beef and cole slaw with mayo dressing. I have apples,( some we bought but the second apple tree is almost ripe now) so that's apple pie filling. apple jam and apple sauce with cores and skins going into apple butter and jelly. Ham and apple Welsh rarebit (rabbit depending on who says it) is on the menu as Hubby's request.Hubby got some extra $  so he bought 8 jars of 32 ounces mild hot pickled cauliflower. We go through a jar a month and I had 4. He called and asked how much I had. They were on sale for 25% off. The only condiments we are low on is Heinz 57 steak sauce and sweet and spicy mustard that I will get when I see a sale. We are at the point we can go a year with out worry. We have what we need or can make do with.  I follow Daddy's advice to have at least a year, eighteen months is better and two years worth is great for hard times. M found this out when 4 yrs ago she stopped canning and gave produce away or sold it at auction because she had 1 year's worth. The following year they lost their main garden, not once but 3 times to flooding. Lesson learned. That year she had to buy peas at the store in cans so they could have peas once a month.  We still have garden coming in.On the list to process:tomato juice tomato pastecherry tomatoes to dehydratecole slawveggie soup ( bought celery)Italian (wide) green beansapple pie fillingapple sauceapple jamapple butterapple jellygrape juice (not quite ripe yet)grape jellygrape mash jamratatouille (eggplant, tomatoes, onions, garlic, zucchini and golden zucchini from gardens)dehydrate garlic.finish curing onions.Black coco beans to harvest and shellSmall red beans to harvest and shellcucumber (down to just enough to eat fresh)Cannellini beans to harvest and shellRed kidney beans to harvest and shellpeas to freezecarrots fresh eatingbasil and sage.

{"title": "Happy Anniversary  ", "date": "Tuesday, August 31, 2021", "text": "I told Hubby that I texted JD and told him happy 21st birthday... And then I said \"Happy Anniversary Hubby\".. he looked at me like I lost my freaking mind. Our anniversary is Feb. Four years ago we moved in. YEP. We signed closing the day before our oldest grandson's birthday and moved in on his brother's birthday.As of today we have 153 items to do on the punch list not including a greenhouse. We talked about how the area is more to the lifestyle we grew up with. How the Amish is our bubble and the struggle to fit in with family when we are at gatherings. His sister is Mennonite so she understands. Our kids just make sure we can keep things up without much help and keep busy as they know that is what best for us in the long run.  My brother when out here the last time mentioned we both seemed at peace and happy and he hadn't reached that yet. He is 10 yrs old than me , definitely a work alcoholic that can no longer work due to health issues. He had planned to work until he died. I suggested some on line tutoring. Part time in the mornings as he needs a reason to get out of bed. He is looking into that. Cracks me up that he will text me \"hey I am planting lilac  bush , what color do you think I should get? ( I suggested he asked his wife).  Or when he sent me the pic of the mixed flowers he got to grow for him. His wife told him anything he plants he has to take care of. He is in the city so the yard isn't big so that might keep him in control but you never know with him. He is happy in the city but misses the quiet of the country.  First, M ended back in the hospital for a D&C  then back in for low potassium, came close to losing her, talk about a scary moment. Church is having a meeting this week to figure out how to help pay the bills. M is home and has a niece staying with them to help her run the home. M has been ordered to bed by her mother in law ( I offered to \"sit\" on her to help keep her in bed) and E's father ordered him to stay on the farm for 3 days as E was helping others when we had to go after him twice (that takes an hour to go and get him and him get home). The 5 older children have started school as of Monday so the oldest of the 4 still at home is 4 pushing 5 yrs old. M goes Sept 20th for a check up. We have spent 3 days of supporting them with these issues. Hubby has slept more than once in the truck in the hospital parking lot. I did remind him that his parents live right around the corner from the one hospital but he didn't want to go there since he wasn't sure if anyone had been around with covid. His niece came down with it 2 wks ago. Not vaccinated.Daughter 2 is pretty sure she has a place to move to Oct 1st. . She is looking around for furniture that people want to just get rid of. Since it's just her and one son, they won't need much but she is making a list as she thinks it through. Ten bucks says she will ask for food and or kitchen stuff.Daughter 4 is antsy.. she is so ready to go back to work. She figured out if she saves enough money by Feb she could look to buy a house instead of renting. Son 2 went that same route. He has already passed all the info he had when he bought his house to her. I did tell her she was more than welcome to come up and do the fall cleaning. I doubt if she will take me up on the offer 😜Daughter 1 and 3 are working steady and staying well.Son 1 is being over ran with IT work  LOL. He is going on vacation with some friends to go fishing and will be out of touch for a couple weeks. Son 2 has made a name for himself at his new job. Not sure it is a good name. He went over blue prints for the new building and found one room has no doors to get in it and the room that houses some training equipment that can't have windows in the room ?simulators? has windows on 2 sides of the room. There is a storage room but it can't be used for it is too small. He asked one manager what color he wanted his tent...the guy was like what? \"You didn't respond to my email of how many people is in your department so you won't have an office for them in the new plans. SO what color do you want the tent that I will put up in the parking lot\".  Guy starts flipping thinking his people is going to be all over him for his screw up. Son 2 quietly adds \"wait until they have to use port a johns because they won't have scan cards to get in to use bathrooms since they are not housed in the building\". When the guy turned white. Son 2 lets him know he could have everything if the information was on his desk in 30 minutes. After that it's back to the tents. Later at a meeting it was brought up that EVERYONE should answer his emails with in 24 hrs. of receiving as there is a program in place that shows when the emails come in. His own boss was not thrilled to find out that he hadn't even gave himself an office and he signed off the blueprints.  Son 2 laughed all the way home.Hubby got his truck fixed after almost 2 weeks. He lost 12 jobs and paid $5000 for the truck to be fixed. While they were waiting for a part to come in they did the regular maintenance that was scheduled for last Monday. BUT he got things done around here. Tower with tv antenna and his HAM radio antenna is up. Hoops for row cover for winter garden is on one box, a second box is started and the third has hoops cut for it. He ran out of a couple things. Since we can't afford the green house this year, we are doing low tunnels ( http://www.motherofahubbard.com/category/winter-vegetable-gardening/low-tunnels/). I have seeds sorted that I want to try to grow. I ordered seeds that I was low on. I had to order from 8 different places to get 12 different seeds. I have some to notify me when the seeds can be ordered.  I will be doing the grow cart and grow light this year.I harvested and cleared some of the garden beds. I added more green beans, turnips, tomato juice, peach pie filling and rutabaga to the pantryWe ended the month with in the black and paid extra on mortgage. Can't say the same for the business.Blessed be."},
{"title": "Need prayers for Neighbor", "date": "Wednesday, August 25, 2021", "text": "4 p.m. We rushed M and E to ER today. She was having a miscarriage AND her blood sugar had dropped AND her blood count was off AND she is passing massive blood clots. Hubby is an EMT so I drove while he called the hospital to let them know what was coming in. Getting a squad out here to pick her up would be a 20 min wait and that is if the squad was available as there is only 1. We went and got E's mom ( M's mom lives out of state). She went to take care of the grandkids and then she went to sit with M at hospital as E came home and did chores and now E is back to the hospital along with his mom to see if M is coming home or spending the night. Hubby is doing this round of sitting in the parking lot as there is a limit of who can be in the hospital due to delta covid.  We dropped E off where he had been working on a pole barn and left his buggy. We checked on the kids. The oldest two are old enough to babysit and even do the evening chores at that. 7:30 pm Hospital called and asked for E to come back to hospital. Hubby picked up E, reminded kids I was just across the pasture if they needed something.8:15 pm M is being transferred to another hospital 20 miles away. They are trying to make arrangements that E can ride with her. When they reduced meds she started bleeding again. SO sending her to get a scan, and most likely will have to have surgery. E's mom had mentioned D &C as she was M's midwife before she retired from being the midwife. She is hoping the uterus's has not torn. Daughter 2 had that happen with her 3rd son. Not good.So Hubby waiting to make sure he is only bringing E's mom back to M and E's and not also taking E to hospital. Going to be a long night as we will get the call to go get E or both of them later."},
{"title": "SIGH", "date": "Tuesday, August 24, 2021", "text": "The brake system on the work truck is broke. This sucker has 6 tires and a brake system for what ever trailer Hubby is hauling. $5000 to fix.  He has already lost 8 days of work and will for at least the rest of this week as they couldn't get the parts until this coming Wednesday and said it usually comes in late afternoon and it's a 5 hour job so will be Thursday before they start on it. So a total of 12 days most likely of no work on top of wiping out what little net profit he did have.He ran into another hauler that had wrecked several times so quit hauling. Said the man can hardly walk now because he just sits around like Hubby's parents started doing. Hubby said he doesn't want that to happen to us. Considering how much I walk around this house and around the perimeter I don't think it's going to be me.We were supposed to move Daughter 2 but that's a no go now as she needed the livestock trailer for her stuff and my truck doesn't tow that trailer. Might end up being best as her son thinks he found an apartment (instead of her moving in with a friend )that will be ready to rent Oct 1st that is in her price range. Hubby was supposed to have a hearing aid appt last week. Doc was a no show and no call to cancel or explain. Receptionist called yesterday and apologized as she thought the doctor had called everyone as she had covid. She picked up the day after Hubby had been in. She got it at church. The whole church got it. My sister in law got hers at church and the whole church caught it a couple months ago. I was getting my blood work done when they were setting up the area for booster shots for covid. Said the Delta variant was hitting our area hard and to mask up even with being full vaccinated. It will help stop the spread to children and those not vaccinated. We also have RSV hitting kids and we have not had that happen in August before.Daughter 4 got her 1st covid shot at her primary doctor's. She was going to have a check up for her lupus but when the insurance got the report the surgery and treatment was done and she is in remission. The insurance canceled her policy. Her notice that it was being canceled is in the mail GRR. Her doctor told her to keep doing what she was doing during her cancer (since she couldn't take her meds) and call him when she has her insurance from the job she starts Sept 8th. THEN she was driving home and heard a rattle under the car so took it straight to her mechanic. Bolt was loose but her other tie rod is going out... so it's back in today for a tie rod and a complete inspection because I KNOW something will happen when she starts work and we won't have an car to loan her to get to work while the jeep is being worked on.  THEN she got called from Columbia Gas that the program she was on before Covid had not renewed and she had an outstanding bill that had to be payed in full before Oct as it's the new heating season. They did take part of the amount off since they told her she was still on the program through the state. AND they were willing to take 3 payments. I told her to get the full amount for the bill and the car brought up for winter and text me the amount. Since she is going to work 3 months before she would be off our budget she can use that money to fix the car, get that debt off her back and start with a clean slate when she starts work. She was freaking that she would have to change her car ins and go back to door dash etc... I redid her budget and sent it to her and HER DAUGHTER said Daughter 4 wilted to the floor in relief.  I did not tell her 3 of her siblings have already said door dash is doing poorly in the area. SO based on all that $$ going out, I am glad we spent the money on another half bushel of peaches and a full bushel of apples to finish the pantry. I am not sure I am getting corn for corn relish from M as half of her canning jars of corn came back open and spoiled. I told her to make sure she had what she needed as I was only making corn relish not a need but a want. I think September needs to be a NO SPEND month."},
{"title": "rough week", "date": "Wednesday, August 18, 2021", "text": "I got 5 loads of the last of the pasta sauce and both mild and hot salsa done Saturday. They need wiped off and taken to the basement. I still need whole tomatoes and tomato juice.Sunday we went to great grandson's 5th birthday party at his other's sides grandparents home. It was a pool party even though it was on the cooler side (mid 70s) and we didn't take our suits for that reason. It was a really nice party, I told both grandparents we were thankful they invited us. We haven't seen this child in two years. He walked up to me and I introduce us... his daddy's grandma Nonna and his granddad. He gave me a hug and a kiss. His mom who we will always call our granddaughter came up to say something to him about who we were and he told her who we were before she could say anything. She said that both Taylor and her have made points of showing their boys pictures of us so they at least know what we look like. After we got home, since we ate supper at the birthday party ,I measured out dried beans to start canning this week. I canned 21 quarts of beans (7 of them were mixed beans) and 45 pints of different beans. Took me Monday and Tuesday to get them done. Tuesday we went to Lima to drop off Hubby's work truck for repair. Dash lights were flashing at him and the right front tire was squealing horribly. I followed him and neither of us thought about it when we left.... we drove right by where we had Wilbur put to sleep just 7days ago. I was bawling by time he started to get in the truck with me after dropping off his truck. I had already moved to the passenger side which I normally don't do.  I know it will get better with time.We stopped and paid our mechanic. Our bill in full and Son 2's payment as he sent it to me as twice now he has had to put stop payments on checks that never arrived.  My personal checking and his are connected. SO that's another bill off the pay this month list.We went to Wendy's for a lunch we split in our car.We went to chiropractic. Doc told me to watch how I am sitting and standing as I am throwing my back out a lot.We went to Menard's and got a new door handle/lock for the front door as the one had snapped off. We got white flex seal (gallon) to coat the top of the basement ramp instead of getting metal to cover it. I can use it around the basement windows also. We also got a new outlet/USB for the bfast bar as the one there quit working right. I got some additives I needed for the gardens so that's off the list also. We used all the Menards rebates so didn't have any out of pocket.We went to Walmart. M had sent a list over as E had been to town and our Walmart had no sugar at all.  We got the last 3 bags that Walmart had. BUT I forgot her list and could only remember part of it (was half) and when we came home we grabbed the list and finished getting was what on it.  I got 25 lb. sugar, 25 lb. AP flour, 25 lb. bread flour and 12 pack of Vernor's ginger soda (only thing I can drink when sick). I picked up a gallon of milk when we stopped back at our Walmart after picking up M's list (which was laying where my purse was sitting SIGH) .When we dropped off M's stuff to her she gave me tomatoes. Her tomatoes are bigger than soft balls. She gave me 5 and they filled my Dutch oven. I canned 4 qrts. of juice today. We did some errands for M and E after leaving there, ended up ordering 1/2 bushel peaches to come in this week. M's brother W is going to pick peaches for an orchard. We have been seeing them for $42/ half bushel and he only wanted $12. I can finish making pie filling and some peach chutney.How has your week been?"},
{"title": "Working in the pantry", "date": "Saturday, August 14, 2021", "text": "I changed out some of the jars that I could use in canning and used Daddy's old jars in their place. I know when the harvest comes in I will most likely need a few small jars.  I put the beans in the north/south staircase to go upstairs. Hubby decided he liked them just like that as he could see which one he was looking for. He went to an Amish auction today as there was a couple things listed to be sold at that auction we have been looking for. He knows what they sell for new. The auction he was at on Wednesday was extremely on the high side when it came for what it sold for. UPDATE.  Was there from 8:30 to 4:30 and only got what E was looking for. Everything we wanted was going too high almost new prices.As I was getting the mild salsa made to can, he asked if I knew how many loads I had to can to have the pantry were we wanted it. AND how much was water bath canner vs pressure canner.Water bath canner 28 loads (7 jars/load)Pressure canner 65 loads (7 jars/load) 93 loads.... about 14 weeks as I don't can on Sundays usually. At least one load a day puts me at the middle of November to finish the canning... last year it was in December and it was tomatoes from N's hoop house.END OF DAY... We harvest Italian green beans so I might have a quart of those. Cherry tomatoes that some will be dehydrated.. A couple regular tomatoes. A half a cup of strawberries, 3 watermelon and 2 muskmelons. I canned 14 pints of mild salsa (finished salsa) and 16 quarts and 1 pint of pasta sauce. With the 16 quarts and 1 pint I already have  the total comes to 32 ... 33 quarts as the two pints would be used together. I decided to make tomato juice that I will be out of when I make the next batch of veggie soup before I make any more pasta sauce. We can always go to every other week instead of every week for pasta sauce.Have a great weekend everyoneBlessed Be"},

At least he takes the time to hunt up good directions on how to can it safely. That's not touch the corn relish I am going to try for the first time pints or anything else that comes along. I have beans and tomatoes coming in(admit this is starting to run me over) and M has corn, tomatoes which is running her over.  B and A both have cabbage they want to give me. Or the pumpkin that will come in during the fall, maybe more beets?"},

I walked over to M before the semi driver had pulled away to let her know I had jars. That was at noon. By 4, two of the kids was over with the pull wagon to get 6 dozen of the regular mouth quarts. E had been to 3 places and got ZERO jars.  More than once I went to check on Wilbur. More than once out of habit for sure I would call \"I am going out, Wilbur do you have to potty?\" and then remember he isn't here. The tears still come, I just remind myself he is with his mom and being happy and free. Charlotte and Rascal hardly ate, Rascal clingy more than normal. Charlotte kept nosing Wilbur's collar so I put it on her and she settled down pretty good. She took it off her self(easy to do as his neck was bigger than hers) and laid in on his blanket that he always wadded up to sleep on during the day. I left it there. Probably won't mess with it until next week if then as I had just washed it a couple days before.We got decent rain so I won't be watering. I will be canning.  back together with his mom Weebels and his siblings as he was the last living of her litter. Born May 3rd 2008 on my Daddy's birthday. Died August 10th 2021. Exactly 1 yr and 1 month from Daddy dying.Found a softball size lump on his neck last night that hadn't been there that morning as I check all my dogs for lumps.  Emergency vet said cancer and it was crushing his wind pipe and in his lymphoid.Hard day today as Charlotte has never been without him. She kept nudging his collar so I put it on her , seemed to comfort her. She took in off herself a couple hours later. Rascal looked for him last night and this morning... Heart breaking through the entire family as he was originally Daughter 2's dog and from her older dog's litter. Blessed be everyone"},

Paid, charged only for materials since there was issues with the labor's work. J gave estimate to do the two porches we have material on site for to do later this fall. The estimate for those are less than the money set back from the estimate he gave for the basement ramp. I will still have to do the painting unless I hire Amish ladies to come paint. Flex seal top of walls.Basement ramp roof, Hubby is looking at ordering this later this month.Tractor Repair, waiting for phone call to say it's done.Fuel Tank pump bought on sale.

{"title": "Stop the Merry Go Round ", "date": "Wednesday, August 4, 2021", "text": "I do not want the brass ring ... I WANT OFFThere are times I think this family gets together to see if they can drive me crazy...they need to remember I do NOT HAVE TO SHIFT OUT OF PARK to get there. GEEZE.Hubby has been watching doom's day Preppers on tv, now wants to be a homesteading prepper. I did ask why? Because  a known drug dealer from two counties away was murdered (shot to death beside the road) 2 miles from here. Amish heard the shot and had their English neighbor call it in. Englisher went down the road to see if it was an animal or what. Business at the end of the road has the sound of the shot and then a car racing pass on their security camera. I reminded him of the Grube murders in Fort Recovery OH that was close to where we lived at the time along with cattle and pig rustlers when he worked 3rd... now he is home during the night and worries about me during the day. He has taking to calling me while he is waiting on loads. I don't carry a phone when out side so he best just quit or he is going to worry himself to death.Then Son 2 called to whine about being bored in his new job because he can't do all his stuff yet. I asked him how much more he was getting paid from his old job that just 3 wks ago he whined about having too much to do. His answer was too much to whine to them but not enough to not whine at me. I told him to call Daughter 2 and listen to her whine as payment to me since I had listened to her for 4 hrs. the other night as she whined over choices she made but isn't willing to do the work to correct the problems.Daughter 3 texted to whine about her daughter wanting her to not get married (decent guy that is very supportive of Daughter 3) BECAUSE she wants her parents to get back together... I will commit Daughter 3 into the hospital for mental issues first and I told both granddaughter and her dad so. He finally admitted to his daughter that he put her mom in the hospital from beating on her and then landed in the hospital when he tried to do it a second time when she was with Daughter 2 when she blocked him from hitting Daughter 3 and then smacked her then she kicked his butt for him and then had the cops scrape him up. Granddaughter's asked if punching someone the norm for her dad's side (yes, it is).She has never saw her mom hit any one. Daughter 1 whined about her younger daughter not wanting to come around because Daughter 1 thinks she can tell her how to raise her baby and run her life. As that granddaughter had already told me why she wasn't going around her mom. Daughter 1 hung up when I reminded her that is why she wasn't in her own biological mother's life who tried the same crap with her.Daughter 4 was doing good until some mortgage broker tried to talk her into taking one of his classes to get a down payment for a home in the county she lives in...She asked me for the money for the class (Her own daughter told her it was a scam) I had her call him on speaker phone, granddaughter called a cop and cop  listened in. Guy is now sitting in jail. Meantime Daughter 4 really thought after not working for 18 months she could just up and buy a $100,000 home and the bank would only want 3.5% down (not sure where she realized how much that was let alone the thought of where that was coming from) and she would get 3.753 % interest rate WITH A CREDIT SCORE of 500.... AND she has a collection against her from a credit bureau with she defaulted the payment 2 yrs ago when she was working a good job. Granddaughter had her send me her budget for when she starts working because Granddaughter thought it was missing things.  Both Granddaughter and I found several things missing from the budget and not enough in the grocery budget but plenty for extra like cigarettes etc. I got Daughter 4 talked into going to the same doctor Son 2 went to when he quit. I have no clue to why she started back up but Granddaughter said she was buying them with her door dash money. WHICH she is not doing now. I had Granddaughter show Daughter 4 that she would need to pay at $900 a month for that house with those guidelines. She can't afford that on the money she will bring home on her job. SO since I had 5 of the kids whining, I decided to text Son 1 (he works all sorts of hours so I didn't want to wake him if he was sleeping). He said he was fine, working steady and getting ready to go fishing for a week away from whiners at work.  LOL. I did update our budget. Updated the pantry inventory. Checked over Daughter's 4's budget and sent that back for her and Granddaughter to go back over. The laundry including all that Wilbur wet on (about half of what he did 2 days ago and he only has 1 more day of the meds that makes him pee... it should take a week for it to stop completely)  Rascal has to Monday and then texted Hubby I was taking the rest of the day as a MENTAL DAY.  Last Radiation and Chemo pill AUG 6.Last check up with oncologist AUG 12thFIRST DAY OF ORIENTATION SEPT 8th.. 3 days on 1st shiftSEPT 12th she starts FULL TIME 3rd shift at her OLD job with a $2/ HR raise from what she was making 18 months ago. She is working out with a personal trainer (so she doesn't over do it) 3 hrs. a day 5 days a week. Her goal is to be able to walk her dogs by herself  by the middle of the month (Jaxon is a tugger and weighs 80 lbs.).She quit napping right after working out. Focused on staying up and moving 10 hrs. a day like she will when working. She is trying to set her own budget based on her bring home. Her goal is rebuild her credit score and buy her own home. Which requires saving which she is not good at doing. HER daughter told her that it's not \"okay the bills are paid so I have this left to spend\". IT's the bills are paid I have this for savings for my dream. When Daughter 4 asked her where she got that from (as her Dad is not a saver either), she answered Nonna... when I had custody of Daughter's 4 youngest, I would get the older two (half siblings) for the weekend once a month. We were saving to buy a home when Hubby retired. She paid attention.Daughter 4 sent me her budget... I sent back she missed some things like vet bills, copays and medication. Repairs on car etc. Her daughter had caught she was way too low on groceries and would get sick again from not eating right.  Hubby got 38% of a set of jeans at TSC.I got 56% off my order at Hanes for pants for this winter. Son 2 had just bought some  and knew it was the style I prefer. More likely he didn't want me to swipe his and cut off the legs 😜. The old sweat pants will go to being PJs and the old PJs will be cut up for rags.Garden budget: I made an order at Johnny seeds for items we need for the gardens for late fall and spring seeds saving 11%.Garden budget: I made an order at Amazon to finish getting clips and half clamps for the hoops for the gardens to cover a few of them with row cover saving 5% and a $2 digital credit. Eating out budget finished the month with $28.42 in it. Grocery budget: Even after 2 \"big\" orders from Amazon (cheapest price and $2 digital credit) and 10 dozen ears of corn for freezer. We ended the money $229.51We went to Menards to get more piping for hoops over the garden boxes. Hubby found an 100 ft roll for $10 cheaper that buying pipe. HE says he can make it work better and curve better and not bend into a triangle. He checked out and went to the truck while I finished shopping.While there I checked the food and cleaning sections. Since I had my lists, with prices from Walmart and Kroger's I checked prices. Juices were $1 to $2 cheaper. I use a lot of apple juice for canning fruit instead of light syrup. I got cleaning supplies I was low(Lysol spray especially for work truck) on (or out AKA furniture oil). I save 49% (adding 11% rebate) on what I bought.Then we went to Kroger's. I finished getting what was on my list except celery. They were out. I saved 29% with coupons and sales.When we got home, M saw us pull in and sent young B over to give us a cantaloupe and asked if we could go get her celery. WORKED FOR ME as it meant Hubby would go get her and ME celery. She wanted to can vegetable soup and needed celery. I will dehydrate some of the celery and also be canning vegetable soup this week.How is things going for you?"},
{"title": "Frustrated.", "date": "Thursday, July 29, 2021", "text": "Can't get my reading list up on blogspot so I can not read everyone's post today. Been jumping hoops for over a  month to get my Humira refilled and was told that it is still pending and my injection due on Sunday and I am out. Stupid pharmacy told me to ask my doctor for a sample. I turned that person in to their boss. Clueless totally clueless. This one has been a battle for over a month. We didn't have a direct number to the company that manages our medication and does the approval. I do now as the Medical side gave it to me but they are doing battle now with why it's been pending since 7/10 and they did say if my doctor can't get it through to go back to HR from where Hubby retired and get them to put pressure on them. Freaking stress of trying to get my Humira approved after 2 yrs. of taking it, is going to trigger a flare up.Rascal is now shaking his head like he has something in his ears. I washed them out and it seems like he is doing that less. I might wash them out again later today. If he is still doing it tomorrow morning we will be taking him to the vet by himself.On the good side: I sent Hubby yesterday to TSC as he had a coupon for $10. that was expiring. Since he had got 4 pairs of pants the other day for $29.50 I told him to check if they had any more in his size and if not then get dog food. He got pants, they were $39.50 (none were on sale or clearance). The casher couldn't get them to ring up so she got the manager. The manager couldn't get them to ring up so she used a different pants that was $34.50 And he pointed that out to the manager and then she gave him the $10 off coupon he had and another $10 for standing in line for 10 minutes to get it to go through. We still have another coupon to use next week on dogfood.Wilbur is coughing less and sleeping through the night again, voice comes and goes.  When he is sleeping he leaks SIGH. That's just his meds but he has 2 more weeks of it. I have protectors on the bed, couch and 3 chairs he will crawl up in. Thankful we have solid wood floors especially since he coughs up water (no food so that is good). He has more energy, not like he had before getting sick but he is walking pretty much the full perimeter again with me now at least twice a day. Have a good day."},
{"title": "Update on Wilbur", "date": "Tuesday, July 27, 2021", "text": "He still has symptoms of bronchitis but his lungs (and heart) are clear. So Vet is thinking non bacterial as neither of the other dogs are sick. Meaning... he was breathing something that caused it... like the hazy smoke in the skies or the chemical spray the English farmer across the road sprayed. So another med was added to the first one since he is better but not well and still has next to no voice. At 87 lbs. he looks thin to us *he's always weighed around 95-100 and that was down 50 lbs. from living with Daughter 2* but the vet said that is his healthy weight especially for being 13 yrs only which is also not usual for his breed. He likes the one med... I have to hide the other one in a vitamin *which I get for meds only* but I have to give it to him in the morning as this med might cause him to potty in house. He is eating decent and willing to walk part way around the perimeter with me once a day.  A complete change from last Tuesday when we thought we were losing him. Now if he got his energy back (better but not good) and his voice. I would be happier.  Hubby found work pants for $29, cheaper than the $35-$50 of normal range. He was able to try them on before buying that .. that is a big step for him as usually I have to get them, bring them home and then take them back half the time. We ate from pantry and gardens except for a friend's cook out we hadn't seen in 2 yrs. due to covid. We took what we had from the pantry instead of buying stuff at the store.We used gas buddy to find the cheapest gas.Hubby stopped at Save A Lot for milk instead of getting it at the gas station when he got fuel. He saved $2/gal. as he checked the price when he went in to get receipt. I put a post it note at the paper towels to use dish cloth. I found myself getting a paper towel (half sheet torn in two) to wipe jar edges with vinegar while canning. I used 6 half sheets last week. Zero this week.I found some old PVC pipe in the garden shed under a bunch of pots that I am giving to an Amish lady.  I am using them in a couple of my garden beds to put row cover over for this winter. We  used the grill to keep the  main propane tank usage down to no more than 1 %. If we can keep it at that range we will be able to reduce our amount for the year by 1 tank (300 gals) saving at least $600. We paid off two loans that had 8% interest that will save us $60 a month. I moved some of the laundry (bedding , furniture throws, dog beds etc.) up from Friday/Saturday to do during the week as rain was to come in over the weekend. So I didn't have to use the dryer or only be able to do one thing a day due to having only 2 drying racks.I updated the pantry inventory. Adjusted amounts of things still needed. I dehydrated basil, cilantro and carrot tops.I harvested and canned purple beans, green beans, carrots.I harvested onions to cure and mini eggplants, radishes, blackberries, green onions and cherry tomatoes.I deadheaded the sunflower so it would grow more flowers and the zinnia that started as 4 plants.We went over the budget line by line and made adjustments, waited 3 days and went back over it and made more adjustments. Goal is to get house paid off so we can live on Social Security only and use IRAs for medical and big items... like roof or different vehicle. How is your week going?"},
{"title": "Budget.", "date": "Monday, July 26, 2021", "text": "Deep breathe... we can do this... Deep breatheFirst.We refinanced the house on a lower interest rate and got rid of the PMI. A PMI is Private Mortgage insurance that you pay for so if something bad happens the mortgage gets paid off . You have to have 20 -22 % equity in your home before dropping this unless like us you have an FHA loan and then you have to pay off the loan.Refinancing dropped the payment from $1600 to $1000. House ins. and property taxes increased by $50 a month.  Bill now $1450.02 including ins and taxes, was $2000.Still a good deal with the refinance. We decided to pay $2000 so extra is going on the principal. Second.With monitoring we are making our propane last until winter fill(Which is late Sept) instead of getting a summer fill. Means more grilling and using canning stove (which is on a grill propane tank also). On the other side, to get a fill we have to be at 30% . I called the manager at the company we get our propane and he crunched numbers and called back. IF we can use only 1% a week and get to Dec we will have dropped another tank of fuel compared to last year. That's a savings of of almost $600. So every Sunday I go out and check the gauge. So far even with canning in the house, we are not using more than 1% and with good possibility  get clear into Dec.  Third we paid off the following:Cement for the basement ramp.Hubby's life insurance loan.My life insurance loan.Hubby's hearing aids.J is not willing to give a bill for the rest of the ramp until the ramp is up to his standard. BUT that might be mid to late Aug as he is finishing one home and trying to get hay and oats in. UPDATE, he is now laying foundation for his brother in law's barn that burned down Saturday afternoon. No one hurt. No animals hurt. First two crops of hay GONE up in fire. We went line by line of the budget... then waited 3 days and went back over line by line. We agreed it starts September 1st. First mortgage payment is due then.Hubby mentioned there was no budget for clothes. I said nope, what we have starting September first is what we have for the until end of 2022. He went shopping by himself for jeans. He even tried them on at the store. Glad I was sitting down when he came in and showed me. He knew I had said the price for them was between $35 to $50 as he wears work jeans that are heavier material than regular jeans. He also wears carpenter style jeans which always runs a bit higher. He got 4 pairs. I just pitched 2 pairs that weren't any good for even rags( I sent the zippers to a friend) last week and have mended 2 more pairs three times this week.  He also got them at $29 as they were on clearance. He is still looking for a carhart coat and hood as this spring it got tossed. He is one to wear rags if you don't keep on him and it's not a good image for business.  I still need pants for winter. If I don't find any then I will be wearing sweat pants that need rolled at (maybe 2 rolls)waist band at home. I will wear thermal underwear under long dresses and dress slacks when going out if needed. What ever we don't spend due to not needing it etc. Gets set aside in a savings acct (mine) for when it's needed later.Each month:I deleted the misc. line completely. Hubby called it piddling money. When he earns extra (not business related) he can spend that. I get what ever I earn also.Office supplies $25. Paper goods $10 Personal items is $25.Food processing is down to $25. I am stocked for enough jars, vacuum bags, freezer bags, canning lids, clear jel, pectin, etc.Garden: $75. We will need some compost for sure. I need to check seeds for starting plants this winter.Truck maintenance , Not work truck, the business pays that. $100. Home maintenance NOT big projects (that comes from savings) $25. We usually use the Menards rebates from buying the big project stuff for home maintenance but I do have to order humidifiers filters from Amazon.Cleaning $10Savings $200Fuel for Truck $200. That is 2 tank fulls.Dogs $150... that is an average. This month will be higher due to Wilbur being sick, April was higher due to Rascal's shots. Dec will be higher due to Charlotte and Wilbur shots. Jan is all 3 get dog tags. Christmas $110($25/person) Graduation $50Birthdays $45Kindle $11.Amazon $12 (ending Sam's club membership)My cell phone $55. Business pays Hubby'sMicrosoft 365 $12. Health insurance $900Health: out of pocket/deductible $500 (any not used goes to saving for when surgery etc. happens) OTC meds/ first aid etc $25Family life ins . $111.Vehicle ins $93 (farm ins and property taxes in escrow as required by mortgage)Internet/ land line $90. We save $20/ month having the land line. They are the only company in this area.Trash service $17 No recycling. We have to take recycling to the township hall once a month.Water softener (hard well water) $65 salt delivered (and put in if we want. )Electric $150 average.Propane $200.Daughter 4 $2242. (Ends Dec 31st) Mortgage. $1450.02. We decide to pay $2000 (what we were paying) to help get it paid off. We will look at paying more after we run this budget a few months. When Daughter 4 goes off our budget, that money is planned to go over on the mortgage unless we need to replace the truck. Groceries ... we set it at $500 even with how we eat cheese. I don't see it being that high with the way the garden is coming in. I updated my pantry inventory so I know exactly what I need to go a year.Eating out is our entertainment. Set at $250. Fingers crossed"},
{"title": "Update on Wilbur", "date": "Wednesday, July 21, 2021", "text": "Vet said could be congestion heart failure or cancer or bronchitis... SO he is treating him for bronchitis and seeing if the meds work. He wasn't looking to have Wilbur go through all the testing at his age nor run up close over $1000 bill for us at his age that would have showed cancer or heart failure but the fact he got in and out of the truck on his own and actually dragged me in the vet's office (which he does NOT like to go to ) made us and Doc think bronchitis.  I took this when him and Charlotte (that's her foot at his face)were laying on the couch this morning. He still isn't eating dog food...lost 20 lbs., but that actually put him at the weight he should be for his size and age. But Vet wants him closer to 90-95 lbs.  He hasn't gotten sick but the only thing he has ate is his treats (which included his meds being used as one of his treats) and I got 1/3rd of a slice of crustless bread (Charlotte and Rascal got the crust sections) down him. Later I will try eggs, they are due for their eggs (helps with dry coats) anyways. He isn't snoring like he was and the cough is not as wet sounding.  He took his pill this morning without me faking him with a treat.Vet said he should be closer to normal by late Thursday or Friday if it is bronchitis."},
{"title": "what a week.", "date": "Tuesday, July 20, 2021", "text": "Wednesday. I harvested more purple beans, cherry tomatoes, mini eggplant (patio eggplant from Burpee), carrots, last of the lettuce (now pulled), 2 green tomatoes, basil, 2 red raspberries and some blackberries. I planted  2 types of peas and 1 type of be for dried pea, navy beans, zucchini, cucumbers, 2 types of runner beans, Italian bush beans, and Cannellini beans.We are supposed to get 1-3 inches of rain over the weekend so I held off on planting fall crops including lettuces and some of the winter crops that I will cover with a low tunnel since the green house isn't going to be done this fall due to having correction work done on basement ramp. At this point after E told J how bad J's workers did of building the forms for the ramp... the workers did not get paid. E \"donated\" his time as he knew we hired J on his recommendation and he felt that it's just neighbor helping neighbor like we do for them. J is coming over to E to get horseshoes and said he would stop over to look as what can be done to fix it right. Hubby thinks it just needs a finish coat except for one spot and that will need to be reframed and cement poured that a bag of cement would be more than enough to fix it. I am hoping Hubby is correct. I imagine J is hoping so also. UPDATE J stopped over, he is going to add a finish layer to all of the concrete and a sealer. The one area that needs reframed will be taken care off. J was really really upset.We had leftover lasagna rolls with odds and ends of gardenThursdayI got all the furniture throws and dogs beds washed along with the regular laundry.I made the list up of what to finish planting for fall and what to plant for winter.I rearranged somethings in the kitchen, pulled out things that I don't use ever for Son 2 to check and see if he wants since he is back to cooking. Made note of a couple things that needed replaced so ordered them after supper. Hubby was out delivering messages to some of the Amish and Land A stopped him to let me know my beets were ready to pick up Friday morning or I could wait 2 weeks and get the next batch if I was already busy with other things. I will go tomorrow and get them.We had gas station pizza for $10 that Hubby got from delivering messages.FridayI picked up beets, KY wonder beans, zucchini, and a head of cabbage from A. M then sent over cucumbers, zucchini and yellow crookneck squash. I canned 6 pints of purple beans, 10 pints of KY wonder beans, 5 pints of plain beets. I made refrigerator pickles out of cucumbers and called it a day. We had braised beef from the freezer in tortilla wraps.SaturdayPicked up a bug so nothing today, I had chicken noodle soup, Hubby fixed grilled cheese... at 11:50 pm got a call from Daughter 2 that had been ignoring our phone  calls and texts since Father's day when we delivered the bar and firewood rack that she was suppose to pay for on delivery and wasn't there. Her man only said she had issues she had to take care of.  Rule has always been not to call after 10 unless it's emergency, accident, or you are in jail (we have family and kids that are night owls that will call just to yack at 2 am and we get up at 4-6 am) . First words out of her mouth was \"I was in jail\". Last time she called me and told me she just got out of jail was because she called the cops on Daughter 3's ex that was trying to beat on both of them and she got hauled to jail also for non payment of her city taxes. ..(Daughter 4 holds the record for the most stupid reason of getting arrested; she didn't pay a $50 water bill and blew off court, got picked up when her friend got pulled over who got arrested for no license and then they verified who Daughter 4 was and off to jail she went also).    First offense OVI ( Daughter 2's first OVI, she bruised her own butt kicking herself)in Dec 2019 was license suspended 2 yrs  and 3 days in rehab *could have been jail* was postponed due to covid. It got postponed 3 times due to covid. She moved, made sure the court and her lawyer had her new address... they sent the summons to the old address. Her lawyer didn't call her when she was a no show. MEAN TIME, since she was under suspension she was getting rides to work. Her ride didn't show and instead of calling her son who could have came and got her and took her to work... she drove ... and got pulled over and then the cop let her know she had a warrant out for her also. So a week in jail, $1500 in fines and another year added to the suspension. AND still has the rehab to do. SIGH... she down loaded all the negative about everyone. After 3 hrs. of non stop complaining she made the mistake and asking what I thought... I quietly told her more than once through the years that the way she has treated us and her siblings was going to come back and bite her in the BUTT.  I really hope this\" bite\" changes how she is but I doubt it. I really do, she is so much like her biologic dad in how she treats people. He wasn't that way when we got married but after we lost the twins when I was 5 months along and his brother a year later , he changed . At 4 am she almost fell asleep talking to me so I got her to hang up as she said she was on the couch. She probably just slept there. UPDATE Just got the message from one of Daughter 2's son saying she was coming home from work not going to work and she got busted for another OVI. That she is NOT divorced like she has been telling everyone including the guy that she moved in with. He told her to find a place to move  but he wasn't going to put her on the streets. Grandson that was living with her moved to his Dad's and his stepmom is bitching about that. To her he is 18 so he should be on his own... he is a senior in high school. His older brother is trying to get a place for him to keep him in the school district as he is counting on a football scholarship to go to college.  We have offered to pay for her 1st month rent and deposit for her to get a place. She will have to figure out how to get to work. SIGH KIDS>>> BUT since I was no longer sleepy I got up, made coffee and at 5 Hubby got up (his usually time) and asked why I was talking to Son 2 or Brother at midnight... two of the night owls. Wrong night owl. SIGH. BEING SUNDAY I checked what I needed to finish the canning for this week. I am totally out of onions and what is in the garden isn't big enough yet. I made grocery list. We decided to step back and see what Daughter 2 does. We had take out at local restuarant.MondayI had doctor appt 2 hrs. away. Daughter 4 needed me to pick up canning jars and bring her bar soap and dill pickles. Her daughter needed the secretary desk we had for her baby's bedroom. So that all worked out as we just made a loop that didn't add any miles. While driving down to appt. Daughter 2 texted me that she needed a name of a lawyer to get her divorce and didn't want to text Son 2 who started his new job. I texted Daughter 4 a and got the info on her lawyer that she used for her divorce as he is in that area. SO MAYBE she is taking steps towards getting her life around??? One can only hope. TuesdayIt's going to be a rough day. Wilbur has stopped eating, I bribed him with treats to get something in him and then he was throwing up white foam through the night. His dementia is worse. He is not smiling, dancing for his treats , not walking the perimeter, barely goes out to potty. We are taking him (alone instead of all of them like planned for nails to be clipped) to the vet this morning. We don't expect to bring him home. This dog was Daughter 2's dog that I took because she was homeless and wasn't taking care of her sons let alone Wilbur and Charlotte. The first month we had them we spent over $3000 in surgeries and meds on the two of them. My grandkids grew up with him... the whole family is going to grieve hard."},
{"title": "Frugal week", "date": "Wednesday, July 14, 2021", "text": "We are sticking to our budget except for medical. Hubby's blood work bill just got in (just in time to get blood work again) and we had hour hearing tests. Hubby needs hearing aids (we figured he would). We were going to use our cash back card but the owner(small business in our area) gave us 5% discount if we paid by check and we could make payments, he just would not get the hearing aids until paid in full. I paid it out of my account (which is not in the budget but I've left Daddy's ins in it for just this bill and the basement instead of pulling for savings). It was $2660.50, based on his hearing loss, Bluetooth  and under warranty for 3 yrs with repairs possible instead of auto replacement like some places do. The doctor also let Hubby know he mumbles and twice did not even move his mouth when Hubby thought he answered. Glad to see I am not the only one he does that to. Hubby got fuel saving 50 cents/gal because he drove around the block due to an accident and realized the other gas station was cheaper. We went to Walmart after the hearing appts and got 50 lbs. of sugar. I was down 100 lbs. between us and M.( M sent 50 lbs. over last night)  I also picked up some ingredients for some dishes I want to try before I take them to a friends' annual cook out . It's been 2 yrs since we have seen them. There will be about 20 of us. Friends are providing the main dish. Their older son usually helps in that also. We didn't eat out like we usually do on Tuesdays. We had some leftovers with lettuce from the gardens.Electric bill came in $19 under budget. IF we can make it 10 more weeks before needing the propane filled (water heater/cook stove is propane besides furnace) we will save around $550. We both checked the gauge which is at 50% on the tank. Refill is at 30% (or our stove has issues when it drops below that) SO I focus on not using more than 2 % a week. Since I am canning , I am using the air fryer or grill for our meals. Microwave if a reheat or veggie. Air fryer heats up the surrounding area by 10 degrees so it's in the mudroom away from the thermostat and where we are NOT much in. I started processing the garlic that had cured. Bulbs that are not going to hold will be dehydrated this probably starting on Sunday as that is when we aren't suppose to get rain and I dehydrate onions and garlic OUTSIDE..onion smell would make dogs sick and I don't want my house to smell like either for weeks. I use my oldest dehydrator for this. Blackberries and purple beans are going on. I hope the scarlet runner beans start making beans this week also. E talked( he blasted according to M) to his brother in law J whose workers had built the support for the concrete for the basement ramp. J asked for Hubby to stop over after 7 this week as E made it clear the work done was poor and because of that the finish of the concrete was not like is should have been. Several areas will need concrete to smooth it out. I would like J to come over and refinish it himself. Hubby wants to just do it himself and no pay for the work that was done. I told him time was money and then to pay E or J if he is doing it himself...NO workers. I know Hubby has tremors and that isn't good with doing finish concrete.Weather wise... chance of rain every day... but only get it maybe every 3rd day and then barely enough.Blessed Be Everyone"},

Won't be necessarily the day it's written on but the thought it to cross off what we eat. Hubby asked if Daughter 4 had been up as it is definitely what she has done in the past. He did ask if we were going to start this month... I said no, we are going to east what is coming in from the gardens or what we pick up from Amish instead.He then asked if I thought the grocery budget would go down and I brought up the eat out budget needed to go down first. I won't do the finance calendar until I get the paperwork from the new mortgage. Mortgage guy made sure the escrow was transferred since the farm ins is due in Sept. I pulled lasagna rolls from barn freezer for supper. Veggies and fruit will be what ever is ready in the gardens. Have a blessed day."},

I have some cured food like garlic etc also,As of this morning ALL deep freezers and frig freezers are FULL. I have 4 casseroles in the one I will need to get ate before corn comes in and I freeze it. I will need a turkey for Tday, a rib roast for Christmas, pork ribs or roast for NY day and lamb for Easter. I should have enough meat (might not be what we want). We have plenty of meat, maybe not what we will want on a certain day or time but we will eat what we have.Tonight I can peach butter tomorrow will be mixed berry pie filling after that will be cherry pie filling.I plan to grow more peas to freeze so I need room for that also. Since I am making mixed berry pie filling this week, that should pull out 6 lbs. of mixed berries to give more room.I wrote out what we still need.I will can green beans, Italian green beans, French style green beans and maybe some purple beans if they come on a bit more. Right now they are at just enough for a meal stage every two to three days.I will can turnips, beets, tomatoes (sauce/ whole/juice), pasta sauce, apple sauce, apple butter, apple pie filling, caramel apple pie filling, cherry pie filling and maybe depending on the blackberries coming in ... more blackberry pie filling. I have no red raspberries and we won't have black raspberries (plants died again) either so most likely that is a buy or go without. That goes for mincemeat pie filling also and mild hot pickled cauliflower.  I have dried peas and dried diced carrots that I can use for peas and carrots especially with my fried rice or casseroles.If possible I will add winter squashes and pumpkin to the storage in the fall. I told all the kids and grandkids that if they need help... they can come get 1 month of what I chose to give them. Everyone except Daughter 4 is back to work full time. Even she has stocked for 2 months herself using what she has earned with Door Dash. Son 2 has stocked 1 large package of TP for each of his 3 sisters and 1 niece that live in his area so they don't have to drive 4 hrs. round trip for just TP.  When I get my Flylady calendar https://shop.flylady.net/p/_Calendar  I will write what we can eat on each month and cross it off as we eat it...Daughter 4 used to do this years ago.  I inventoried and figured it out. Tomatoes is any of the tomatoes, sauce, pasta sauce, whole , or juice.July/Sept/Nov/Jan/March and May we need to eat these fruits/veggies.Tomatoes, corn, any of the  green beans, pickle beets, spinach, hominy, asparagus, dried vegetable including dried potatoes, dried or canned beans or lentils, frozen fruit, peaches and applesauce once a weekdried fruit once a day4 oz. juice once a day Green tomato apple pie filling, beets, canned green tomatoes, pumpkin and canned mushrooms 2 times a monthmandarin oranges, and canned potatoes  3 times a monthonce a month : peas, bean sprouts, veg all, wax beans, canned carrots, snowpeas, pineapple rings, pineapple chunks, pineapple tidbits, crushed pineapple, blackberries, plums, apples, cranberry sauce, fruit cocktail, mango, cherry pie filling, plum pie filling, mixed berry pie filling, peach pie filling, apple pie filling, and strawberry pie filling.

THEN we decide to figure out what we averaged on take out during the pandemic.   We set our budget for $250 a month including anything that we buy for stocking the pantry (food only). We also set the eating out budget at $250 a month. That is what we averaged since the pandemic hit. Granted we were trying to help our local restaurants but I really don't see us continuing to order take out once to twice a week. I don't see us going twice a week. I have a slip of paper taped to the wall under the budget and I deduct what we spend from the $250. IF there is some left in that budget at end of month, it get's put in savings. Same with grocery budget for when prices goes up or I need extra for stock up.  Right now I am down 60 lbs. of sugar and 50 lbs. of flour.We went through the pantry and moved somethings around (I found more green beans) so everything is together not here and there. Fingers crossed. Blessed Be"},

I just don't see it as I walk on it several times a day to get to the gardens and compost pile.. Maybe in Sept  Daughter 4 had her surgery for removal of ovary and a tumor on the lining of her stomach a week ago. Was a rough week as she refused pain meds, feared it would trigger her addiction and she's been in recovery 8 yrs. By the 4th day she was doing fine. She starts radiation today for 4 weeks Mon-Fri. and will be taking a chemo pill nightly for 4 wks. Then the plan is physical therapy for 4 wks. She is hoping to cut that by 2 wks and get released to go to work  so she could have her 1st pay check Labor day weekend.In June we spent only on necessities until the closing of the refinance loan. I put everything that broke (grinder for herbs, cheese grater, immersion blender, instant read thermometer, oil/candy thermometer) ... I think the kitchen took the worst hit) on a wish list and waited. Day after the loan was notarized. Mortgage guy who had warned us to not buy much of anything and thought it was funny things were breaking ..said order LOL.  I went through Brandy's website to Amazon. I added to the wish list and to order a raised dog food dish as Rascal's cardboard box bit the dust. I ordered 3 as I figure Wilbur could use a raised one also and Charlotte shouldn't be left out  HA HA. I saved 38% on them.  It will be easier to keep them clean also helping keeping flies down. Living between two farms that has horses, cows and chickens and manure that goes on 3 pastures around us... flies are common.I bought cherries to make mixed berry pie filling, jam and freeze. $6. OFF a pound bringing it down to $1.25/pound. I still need to pit the rest of them (jam is done and in freezer)I got blueberries 50% off. I froze them , some for the mixed berry pie filling and some for eating. Ours is very small  so I decided fresh eating and for muffins this winter so I froze those also.I ordered 2 Flylady calendars. One is for appts... we have used this for years. Love the big calendar with big squares. The other I will use to keep track of what to use in the pantry... another post. I had a code that I got $17.46 off the order.I ordered one file pocket calendar using code for 10% off , this is the calendar for finances only. Hubby sold the Honda motorcycle since he has the one he bought off son 2 tagged and insured lowering the ins by $50/month.Today I took the last of the peaches and last year's peach puree and started cooking it down for peach butter.I harvested purple beans (like green beans but purple) for our supper tonight.We discussed and debated and then went a couple more rounds... we want storage for paper goods/cleaning products in the barn. Barn means possible mice. Hubby didn't want wood... I wasn't thrilled with the price of the metal one he wanted. He did some searching and found almost the exact same thing but instead of holding 150 lbs per shelf it's 400 lbs per shelf AND $250 LESS per cabinet. We got 2. Hubby thinks paper goods in one, cleaning in the other. I saved an additional 10% and got a free $50 tool rolling seat cart that Hubby can use instead of sitting on an upside down 5 gal bucket.  M sent over a bag of peas. They had enough for a meal  and what was left wasn't enough to can for them. I shelled them and froze them and now have another 6 meals in the freezer.How is your summer going? Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Lets talk Dementia/Alzheimer's ", "date": "Saturday, June 26, 2021", "text": "AgeAge is the greatest of these three risk factors. As noted in the Prevalence section, the percentage of people with Alzheimer's dementia increases dramatically with age: 3% of people age 65-74, 17% of people age 75-84 and 32% of people age 85 or older have Alzheimer's dementia.62 It is important to note that Alzheimer's dementia is not a normal part of aging,69 and older age alone is not sufficient to cause Alzheimer's dementia.https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.12068.AlsoStatistics are grim. 10 percent of 65-year-olds, 25 percent of 75-year-olds, and 50 percent of 85-year-olds will develop dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. And the fastest growing segment of our population is the 85-year-olds. Researchers predict Alzheimer’s will affect 106 million people by 2050. It’s now the seventh leading cause of death.https://thewomensalzheimersmovement.org/8-steps-to-reverse-memory-loss/Why am I bringing this up? The reason we have bought the house we have, done the work and will continue with the work is because...We didn't want one of us to have to sell the home if one (most likely me since I wasn't suppose to walk to begin with) ends up in a wheelchair like Daddy did and Hubby's grandpa did and they had to sell their homes.  Appraiser brought up that if we had a studio apt or a something along that line of a bedroom/sitting area we could have a live in helper when we got elderly (he said 80s is what is elderly to him when I asked because my Amish neighbor's brother said something about elderly/old and I asked what age that was... E from the back seat answered YOUR AGE...which immediately his brother denied but then said 60s ... then was worried as he was sitting next to me when I told him we were 60s.It's okay, his parents nailed him when E tattled as they are OUR AGE LOL). We could stay in our home with Dementia. Appraiser's great grandma had to sell her home and move in with a child when his great grandpa went in to assistant living home. There was no way to change the home to stay there with out incurring more debt than the assistant living was nor was there a way for someone to stay with them and help take care of them.In this areaAssistant living home cost $10,000/ month $120,000 a year.Nursing home cost $15,000/ month or $180,000 a year.Memory care home cost $24,000/ month or $480,000 a year.Medicare does NOT pay for this. Medicaid will some but you have to have meet low assets etc. and the waiting list at the limited homes is very long. We sat down... the home is so we can stay even in wheelchair. There are some things that would need to be changed out but that money is already sat aside in an account for when needed. We would save 3-5 yrs of assistant living/nursing home cost with the home finished as planned. We would need a better bedroom set up for someone other than our children to live with us.Mentally ... is a different store but since Daddy had Dementia for a decade before he went into Alzheimer's at 92 and Hubby's dad just got diagonized at age 84 with Alzheimer's.  We decided to look at what we are doing to slow that and what more can we do.In a study that tracked 639 adults for nearly 12 years, Johns Hopkins expert Frank Lin, M.D., Ph.D, and his colleagues found that mild hearing loss doubled dementia risk. Moderate loss tripled risk, and people with a severe hearing impairment were five times more likely to develop dementia.https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-hidden-risks-of-hearing-lossALSODementia is a general term for loss of memory and other mental abilities severe enough to interfere with daily life. It is caused by physical changes in the brain. Alzheimer's is the most common type of dementia, but there are many kinds.https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/types-of-dementiaHubby is hard of hearing at a certain pitch. So after we close (waiting for title office to schedule that and our mortgage is pushing for this week) we will be going to get our hearing checked.... we will also get hearing aids if needed. No excuses allowed. We both know our dads refused to wear hearing aids. Hubby's dad just started when the doctor informed him of the connection.What else is there to do?Be physically active.Eat healthy.Don't smoke.Limit alcohol.Exercise your mind A new study is warning that people over 50 shouldn't watch too much TV. Researchers at University College London say excessive viewing could lead to memory loss and contribute to the development of dementia. They have discovered that people over 50 who watch more than 3.5 hours of TV a day are more at risk of losing their memory.https://www.ageuk.org.uk/dacorum/about-us/news/articles/2019/watching-tv-and-dementia/Take control of your health.We focused on the positive first...We can schedule appt for hearing after closing and get hearing aids if needed.  Hubby agreed since he refused hearing aids when working (always had ear protection on at work) and only would have wore them 3 -4 hrs a day.I found this and he thought it helped him with looking at the costs.Here’s another way to think about the price of hearing aids. If your hearing aids cost $6,200, and they have a lifespan of eight years, they will cost you approximately $775 per year, $64 per month or $2.15 per day. In other words, while the total amount is high, the ongoing usage price is more reasonable. Monthly, it is about what you would pay to get satellite or cable television. When you consider the communication, relationship, and health benefits you get from wearing hearing aids, most people agree that it is well worth it.https://www.healthyhearing.com/help/hearing-aids/pricesBe physically active. Hubby started doing more trimming with the trimmer than the push mower as it also meant movement with his arms since he sits 2 days a week in the truck over 8 hrs. He is also walking the gardens just to be walking.  I average 10,000 to 15,000 steps a day. I will try to increase this to closer to 15,000 to 20, 000 (usual summer amount but will have to work at it in the winter.  We both carry weight or dig in the gardens etc. Drag dogs into the vet's office. ;)https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/risk-factors-and-prevention/how-reduce-your-risk-dementiaEat healthy... I checked out Blue Zone diet/lifestyle. It's something a friend had suggested and then my brother who as mild dementia shared he was trying to do more like it. We need to add more leafy greens and beans. We do eat more meat than that but we don't eat as much as the US normal is.I quit smoking March 6th 1979 when I found out I was pregnant for Daughter 2 (Daughter 1 is late husband's daughter we raised). Hubby has chewed tobacco off and on and quit when we got together ( I think my comment of YUCK was that factor LOL).Neither of us are much drinkers, don't even do what the amts.  they suggest. THOUGH we might pick up the dry red wine since it helps with Dementia and other stuff with the heart.Use it or lose it... exercise your mind. Daddy used to say if you don't learn something every day you are going backwards.  We both do Sudoku. Hubby does crosswords. We sometimes watch Jeopardy. I read a lot. Maybe a couple books a week ( I can read a 300 some book in a day On a Sunday). We should work harder of understanding/speaking Pennsylvania Dutch aka Amish Swiss German. The local Amish language. Take control of our health... this is from changing to things that have been proven to help lower the risk of Dementia and taking care of ourselves with doctor appointments for care."},

Instead of putting extra money on the mortgage it would be saved to do that. That would bump everything else by one year.  We could change it to a dormer. That's the top of the roof line with windows. Be best to put it on the west side of area so not dealing with staircase changes.or change it to a shed dormer That would only be raising half the roof line.Our hv/ac/electric/ plumping guy said it wouldn't be that hard for him to disconnect that area and reconnect it. We would have Amish do the work. Hubby would have to get a permit. HUM. I know it's common to recoupe 65-70% of the cost of a shed dormer...It would be easier to resell with a dormer. It's a big negative and only considered storage as it is.Lots of decisions to make of which way to go  We really liked this picture he got. Said it is actually from the road and he zoomed in with his iPhone.We bought it for $165,000 03/09/2018.It appraised for $400,000 06/23/2021.I am glad we both were sitting down when that phone call came. We figured $300,000 to $310,000 (we even bet, loser had to do to the other's chores for a week) with putting utilities in along with ADA wheelchair bathroom and ADA wheelchair ramp on deck. Our mortgage guy thought $275,000. So I went through the appraisal to see what the boost was fromStable housing area... there are 2 house in our area for sale... that is it Both were around $270,000 but didn't have the land or barn.  Land WAS going for $9000. acre NOW is at $15000/acre. We have 4 acres more than they did. So $36,000 for the land should have been $306,000 . At $15000/acre it should have been $330,000.Went from 2 bedrooms to 4... could become 5 if we ever raise the roof line on the north/south lofts and put in a wall. As it was he counted it as ONE bedroom.  We have thought about it as it's like an A frame and we do use it for bedrooms and non food storage(which is moved to the barn for now with thoughts of keeping it there with some metal cabinets to keep mice out of it). We have a walk in/out basement with 2 rooms that could be finished into bedrooms. SO the potential of 7 bedrooms is there. We have 200 amp service to the BARN so it could become a business or another home. As what we call the 1st bay was actually a studio apartment for the original owner while he built this house. The plumbing for bathroom is there (toilet and shower is not, we capped everything) Sink is still there. We have the water off to it because it's not heated in that area. We have landscaped. A dozen trees, bushes and perennial fruits.SO definitely no PMI as we now have 40% equity in the property."},

I had 4 today.Blueberries are the size of peas but are turning as I got 8 today. I was surprised to get any as they definitely got hit with the frost and snow with blooms.We had 8 sour cherries off the trees. I picked snow peas three times. I picked regular peas twice. Hubby told me I needed to pick again today as he was just out in the gardens.I dehydrated basil, cilantro, dill weed, sage, oregano, rosemary, and apple mint. I will reload today.We have ate from the gardens or pantry.I got 1/2 bushel of peaches for $24.50 from Amish bulk store. They were told they  were cling free... they aren't. I made 7 qrts, 5 pints of peach jam with half of the. Saved pits and skins (will make jelly with that). Today I will finish the peaches making freezer jam. I will call the other bulk store and see if they have cling free for my canning. I like halves when I can them as fruit and check to see what apples they have in. Hubby got the last of the rebar for the basement ramp that should start this Saturday or next Saturday. J got slowed down on the job he is trying to finish to start ours with the weather that came through. He also picked up some odds and ends while at Menards we were needing for other projects. He paid ZERO out of pocket since he used rebates.I ordered Resveratrol (take for cholesterol with a side benefit is helps lower dementia risk also), dehydrator screens, a spice grinder (mine is making noises) and 3 kindle books about Blue Zone life style and eating during Amazon Prime Day for ZERO out of pocket using Amazon coupon and cash back points.E brought two of his horses over to graze his pasture on the south side of us and our pond area so we won't have to mow that area saving Hubby time and gas. He said he would mow it around the pond (he can get a lot closer with his side mower and horses) after he removes these two in about a month or so.I have one med to only take every other day  and another only as needed... that will save $15/month between the two. How is it going with you?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Thursday .Appraiser...Bar done for Daughter 2", "date": "Thursday, June 17, 2021", "text": "What a week!!!!This is the bar Daughter 2 wanted made for her man for Father's day. She is NOT fooling me, she's a bartender, she wants it for herself also LOL.She found a picture on Pinterest. I found a pattern on Esty and then changed it to be bigger as they have 5 sons between them and told her to get at least 4 chairs. I wanted it big enough for a cooler or dorm frig to be in the side of it but not cause an issue with them bumping into each other or it. Hubby and I agreed that due to weight (4 pallets) that it should be on rollers so if either of them are alone and want to move it they can. H, Amish neighbor on our south side built it. He said it's almost like the counters he makes for Amish that sell from home. He also now has 2 orders from Englishers that stopped for other reasons. So he gave us a discount. The top was the hardest and most time consuming to do. It's now at N's, the Amish we bought the house from as he builds furniture and has the ability to spray it with sealant to protect it from the weather.  I told daughter she might have to pick up pavers for the edge of her patio. Said she had thought about it anyways as the gravel doesn't stay put next to the cement pad. We will be delivering it Saturday morning early. SIGH as that's a 2 hr. drive one way which means no sleeping in. When I told her she said she would have coffee on so if I didn't get my 3rd cup, she has me covered...the child is like her mother... 3 cups a morning for her also. I did not collapse yesterday. Wanted to but had garden to catch up. I put 13 trays of basil, 2 of cilantro, 2 of apple mint and 1 of dill fern aka weed in the dehydrators . I canned 3 pints of the last of the turnips. Caught the laundry up as I shoved one load in the washer and closed the lid when the appraiser was here.Appraiser was the age of our grandchildren, worried me a bit to say the least. I Googled him and found he does a lot of Amish to English converted home. So that helped how we felt about his age.  We heard a lot of , this is cool, I really like this, I want this for myself (south and north loft, bed under the skylight). Loves the two upstairs with the point if you had younger kids and teens they wouldn't bother each other. Pointed out the house was appraised as a 2 bedroom when it is clearly a 5 bedroom with option of being 7 bedrooms. I told him I had that battle with both the appraiser and our ins guy and proved a twin bed would fit in the one room and a queen in the other and you can stand up out of the bed and NOT hit your head on the ceiling unless you were over 6 ft. I asked where the other 2  rooms that could be made into bedrooms was. Basement, my pantry that has a door and the other doorway had a door (I never noticed that since the door was already gone, I asked N and he said he took it off for E as she wanted it for laundry during the winter and the heating stove for her washer was there.) and the freezer room that has a door on it also and we have a walk out ramp so it could be bedrooms with sitting area instead of how I am using it. He noted that having the outhouse over the septic tank was a plus as if we lost power and had no fuel to run generator to run the well (he has seen that happen) we still had a working bathroom. As he wrapped everything he mentioned he doesn't usually get handed a list of what was done with what materials are on site for what projects and goals for the next 4 yrs. AND the receipts.  Said it would be a good help as there is NOTHING in the area to compare the house to. The closet about 5 miles away , will less than an acre and had no working furnace ( cost of $20,000 to $30,000, Son 2 just had one done so we know that cost) and it appraised at $168K without the furnace. He was not the one to appraise it.Our mortgage guy told me to give the appraiser that stuff... he also insisted it be reappraised as the underwriter felt it was fine with the old appraisal. Our ins guy is waiting to see what it appraises also. IN the gardens today... I still have strawberries to harvest and the blackberries are coming on and starting to turn. I need to finish planting the fall crop, check the garlic as it's already turning brown. I need to refill dehydrators as the herbs are going nuts. We have been conditional approved for the refinance loan. They are waiting on the appraisal and then probably have to have this past month's bank statements since closing in mid July instead of late June like our mortgage guy wanted. I won't be doing a lot of shopping on Amazon prime day nor will I buy a new mattress for my bed until that point. BUT we did try a restuarant here in town and found the food comparable to two of  our old favorite places so that is a good thing. There is another  place the people down the road suggested we try and when Hubby worked plowing for the state several of his coworkers mentioned they ate there. Have a great weekend. Blessed be"},

{"title": "Refinance update Daughter 4 update", "date": "Friday, June 11, 2021", "text": "we are now in what they call the processing stage of the loan. For those that don't know what that means... they are verifying that the information we provided is correct and that there is nothing showing that we didn't provide (aka bad credit on your credit score and I have our credit reports so that's not an issue).Closing is suppose to be mid July. Our mortgage guy is trying to get it wrapped up by end of June as we are in a \"don't spend\" much part of the loan. I asked what they would consider much due to having cement delivered and Amish needing paid when they do the basement ramp at the end of the month... that is okay I guess since it is maintenance for the house. The appraiser is coming Tuesday at 3. It was decided it was a good choice to have one. There was a possibility of not since we are refinancing through the same mortgage company and it was appraised less than 3 yrs ago. Our mortgage guy pushed for it to be reappraised. One we have done tons of work and two house values have went up.  I have to write up everything we have done and give copy of the receipts to the appraiser. Making second copy for tax file at request of our tax preparer so when (if we sell or the kids do) there is proof to lower capital gains or something along that line. Brother had fits when he couldn't prove Daddy installed STEEL siding when he was filing taxes on Daddy's estate.Daughter 4 came up and boxed non food stuff I had in the one bedroom. I moved it to the barn. She was in a good mood... was worried about trying to find work after she recovered and the company she worked at before Amazon (like 2-3 times) called and asked if she would like to have a job. They told her to apply in August (with her doctor's release and any restrictions). She can go back on 3rd at starting rate of $20 +/hr. Which is $5/hr. more than what she was earning when she left to go to a better paying job. There is 401K, health benefits etc. She has a good chance of getting back in. That's helping her mentally.  She is now focused on getting her divorce (they have been separated 10 yrs but he keeps disappearing when she gets his address). Hubby told her to get it done and move on with her life. She just got stuck with a bill of his and his girlfriend for their rent and ended up in court over it. YES LEGALLY she is responsible for his unpaid bills  BUT the judge said since she did NOT sign the lease nor live there at any time, he dismissed the case. Which triggered Hubby to tell her to get the divorce. He is paying for it and putting it on her loan. Her cancer surgery is June 24th. They are removing ovary and now a tumor that was found on the bottom of her stomach in the lining. She thought she was having a gallbladder attack so they scanned her. Cancer doctor has agreed to take tumor out at the same time but instead of just radiation 5 days a week for 4 weeks she will also take a chemo pill at bed time (she does better with it at night) every night for 4 weeks. THEN she has to do 4 weeks physical therapy to rebuild her strength which I can tell you isn't up as much as she thought it was. She was informing PT today she couldn't keep up with her OLD mom who just had hip replaced. I told her to quit sitting zoning out on the tv and get out playing with the dogs in the mornings and late evenings. Blessed be... back to work for me"},
{"title": "lamp lady", "date": "Wednesday, June 9, 2021", "text": "It's kind of weird because Mother was always one to sit in the dark if she wasn't in the kitchen. Pop had a goose neck lamp at his chair. But they worked the flea markets as Pop was on to barter or sale so they might have got it that way. We have debated until we were blue about refinancing KNOWING our goal is to have the house paid off in 3 yrs (no more than 8). We talked to both our finance guys and two bankers and our mortgage guy. All felt with the interest rate at half our currant rate, that we should for the following reasons.... FHA keeps the PMI (mortgage ins.) on until the loan is paid off instead of the 22 % like other loans. That is $2000 plus a year. IF something were to happen and we couldn't pay off the loan... we would be better off with a lower rate and lower payment. Since it is a home loan topped with a construction loan changing it to a home loan only will help if we ever had to borrow against it. We have equity but not 20% unless the appraisal comes in higher than what it was 2 yrs and  9 months ago. Which means the appraisal would have to come in at no lower than $325,000. I don't think it's raised that much but we will see. We refinanced through the same company that is holding the mortgage now. Closing costs were cut in half, interest was the best also and the escrow acct is transferred to the new loan immediately so we don't have to come up with the ins payment and taxes that are due in July when the loan will go through like we would have if we went some where else and then wait for that acct to refund to us. The house was sold as a 2 bedroom. If I get it done this week it should list at least as a 4 bedroom if not 5. The mortgage will drop $500/ month. I already know the ins will raise $50/ month and the takes will $100/month.  So that \"extra\" $350 can go on the principal each month.Back to work.Blessed be This was a lamp Mother gave Son 2. He passed it back to me as it was not working (too tall) for any place in his home. Works great in my bedroom next to Mother's rocking chair. He also gave me the lamp that was in the room I used which is now his work out room and he actually went and got a queen size mattress for the guest room that we had taking to calling the farrowing room. The farrowing house on the old farm we rented was where we store everything we didn't want to get rid of.What we have been doing...We met with Hubby's Finance guy. We told him what our goals are and he is making sure our finances  stay focused on helping us reach them. Mortgage and truck paid off in 3 yrs,Hubby finished filling the last of the garden beds. I started planting them. One of the sides came off on the end as the board warped with the rain and 80 plus weather we got so he fixed it with metal bracing. Said the soil never moved when he took the board off and turned the warp towards the soil. He moved gravel to where he parks the livestock trailer and truck. He still has 1 pile to more before the cement get delivered end of this month or beginning of next. Start date for J to start on the basement ramp is the 26th  or July 3rd. He helped harvest strawberries twice.He trimmed and mowed twice. Just loves the new mower as it definitely has cut the time of trimming down and takes less time to mow. He worked hauling 5 days. Turned down work this week so he could go to his finance guy.I started planting late summer/early fall crops. Made plans to cover some of garden beds if we don't get the lean to green house put up late summer.I harvested and froze snow peas, spinach and garlic scapesI dehydrated 3 rounds of strawberries. Freezer room smells like strawberriesI canned 7 qrts and 3 pints strawberry pie filling, 6 pints of strawberries (won't do any more of that as the berries are now pink) and 14 pints of strawberry freezer jam. I have more strawberries... definitely a couple different desserts and more dehydrated. More jam .TODAY I need harvest lettuce, spinach, 2 kinds of turnips, garlic scapes, green onions, snow peas, braising brassicas and more strawberries. I really hope the strawberries slow up before the blackberries are ripe. Beans are up about 6 inches. We get any sunshine with this daily rain and they will be up the trellis.I need to dehydrate strawberries. We don't care for frozen strawberries. Dried get used in cereal, oats, and snacks.I need to can the turnips.I need to freeze snow peas I need to finish the refinance papers on line. Then I need to declutter and move things around boxes of stuff got put in the rooms what were to be bedrooms. This area most houses have 3- 6 bedrooms. I have 2 bedrooms finished. To make the house appraise higher a big thank you to the realtors that is friends with Son 2 told me what to do to raise the appraisal for a refinance instead of a sale.  I got a lot of \"work\" to do and get done in 1 week as the appraisal should be the beginning of next week. Daughter 4 is coming up and giving me some time after her PT today. Said she is practicing going back to work... get the dogs used to her not being there, her actually doing more than just sitting in a car delivering Door Dash (which is not earning much) and thinking about her surgery the 24th. I did decide to get me the new mattress and box spring... the old one can go on the spare bed. I found 2 bed frames that we really liked (only been looking for 2 years) . They might not get here in time but at least I have the pictures of what I ordered LOL.I found while working at decluttering the front bay of the barn, sections of the old closet we removed for the laundry room,  doors that had been on the linen closet (thinking room screen?) decorative rod holders. The curtain Son2 used at basic for a door to his room, entertainment center to convert to wardrobe, and an old dresser that we can have H and M redo. I am not finish decluttering the front bay of the barn BUT I am half way. I plan to give it an hour every day at the end of the day because I definitely need to shower immediately afterwards. I am thinking.... there is enough closet sections left to use for at least 2 of the bedrooms (no built in closets in this house ever). Plus the entertainment center can be converted to wardrobe. I will need some wheeled under bed drawers for a couple of the rooms. Might have enough scrap wood to make drawers and just buy the wheels... lots of thoughts there. I need to move the dry goods storage as we have paneling for the unfinished walls in that area. Blessed be"},

Just think 2 feet deep across entire area. I couldn't even put my coffee cup down to the left side of coffee pot let alone prep anything. I was frustrated as it seems I am clearing this off every other week. I still have another hanging sign to put up around coffee pot to the right but I need to buy a picture hanger for it first. Hubby asked what was all on it... 2 dozen clean canning jars he said he would take to basement for me, mail that should have been put directly in burn trash (he acknowledged that was him also), paperwork from Daddy's insurance that needed filed, recycling that needed to be taken out to can (it was raining so he stuck it there and forgot to take it out when the rain stopped, it's 6 steps to the recycling can on the deck, I don't think the rain will hurt either of us)... dishes that  I used that was stored in basement but needs to be up here for summer cooking but had no place. SIGH. I have bruised my butt from kicking it. I told him if he agrees to take something to basement it is to be done that day. If it isn't and I take it down I don't want to hear the whine of \"you never give me time to do such and such\". I have started asking for a time something will be done that he agrees to do as other wise it is NOT done until I am fighting with him over it. He actually brought this up to our doctor during our appt and doc told him  it sounded like HE had a problem with priorities and keeping his word. I kept my mouth SHUT. Our doctor has did a lot of volunteer work with Hubby so he knows him well.I cleaned off the bar (still have a box of jars and some dishes to take down to basement) THEN I put what I wanted on there... food prep stuff. I moved the chargers that usually sit at the wall to the end of bar (yes I have plugs on end of my bar) and put the chargers in that drawer after moving the random recipes and instruction books for kitchen appliances to the file cabinet in the front room. I also cleaned inside the cabinets which has the pots and pans, some of casserole dishes etc. , move dishes I have not used out to go to the basement. I shifted the cooking stuff to the kitchen side and put the serving dishes on the dining room side. I had stopped using serving dishes at the request of Hubby a couple years ago. It bugs the crap out of me so I just told him I would rather wash extra dishes which 90% goes in dishwasher anyways. Breakfast and lunch I am okay with serving from the pans but I prefer our evening meal to come from serving dishes. I have no clue why he felt the way he does as his grandmothers and mother (even today) puts food in serving dishes. Bfast was the only meal Mother didn't put in serving dishes.ANY WAYS I side tracked. Sorry. Since my cooking methods change with the season and I plan on using the grill more... I looked hard at what is taking up kitchen space. I will be buying containers for the Christmas dishes ,sitting in the china hutch, and the fancy wash by hand dishes that was Mother's and Daddy's  I use for Easter, Thanksgiving etc. also in the china hutch. But that is for another day.Today though I will be going through seeds... to finish summer planting (raining) and prep for fall planting and then winter planting. Since costs for the basement was higher and we are refinancing house... we might just cover a few of the garden beds for winter plants. We did that a couple years at the old farm we rented.Blessed be"},

Rascal got pills for allergies and his annual vaccine, Charlotte got shot for allergies. All 3 got nails done. Wilbur's allergies are not raging....yet.Daughter 2 asked if we could find someone to build a couple things she wanted to give her man for father's day. It took most of 2 days to figure out what she really wanted (I just love it when they find something on pinterest but are clueless of what size it is or where to get a pattern for it) . M sent over 2 dozen eggs, a loaf of bread and 4 small heads of lettuce.I saw my back doctor to start the process of preapproval for my injections. I harvested 2 types of turnips, radishes, garlic scapes, scallions, asparagus, spinach  and strawberries. I made 5 pints of strawberry freezer jam... we already ate one of the pints. First time I made freezer jam...first time there was room in the freezers LOL.Hubby drove me to ENT appt to get vein cauterized. I have been getting migraines also so that doctor gave me enough meds until my primary can deal with it. Not the first time I 've dealt with migraines. We got heavy spray starch for M as what E got her was worthless. We got flowers for graves (for Sunday). Stopped at the Mennonite store to get onion sets and got onion sets half price and free onion plants and should have LEFT but instead we walked out with  several packages of flower seeds for the butterfly, hummingbird garden to plant next year ,a dozen fry pies, raspberry sweet rolls, 2 snickerdoodle whoopie pies, and 2 metal scoops for the flour and sugar buckets. We also stopped at the meat store and got 2 meals of full racks of smoke ribs, pasta salad, fruit marshmallow salad, potato salad, cole slaw, rolls, and broccoli salad. We ate like pigs. I spent 2 days checking out mortgage rates for refinancing. Even though we plan to pay off the house in 3-5 yrs, our finance people felt we should refinance for a lower interest rate in case something happened and we couldn't get the house paid off. Also by get the lower rate, our payment would drop, meaning we could pay the same amount and that would help pay off the house faster. ALSO it will take it off the FHA loan which carries a PMI for the entire time. I applied at our original lender...their interest rate was the lowest. Property taxes went up. Our insurance guy let us know that our insurance will increase also.I've been saving our Menards rebates to pay for the material for the basement ramp. Have close to $800. He went to Menards this morning to get the stuff including the stuff for Daughter 2 projects (she will pay us back so that's not an issue). He forgot to use the rebates, charged it all  to cash back and then realized I had just told him to not put big bills on the credit cards as I had applied for the refinance and we needed to keep credit cards under 30 %. Freaking plyboard is $80 a sheet. We need 20 for the basement project. Good news is we can reuse them... bad news is between them, the 2x4s , paint supplies and other odds and ends we will be at 40% GRR..... He texted he now has bruises on his butt... I thinking \"great, he has fell and we have another bill\" I asked how bad and how it happened.... He was kicking himself in the butt for forgetting to use the rebates. I need to go water garden. Blessed Be"},

Just to see how much trimming he would have to do. I mowed the rest of the inside of the fence (1 acre) and Hubby mowed what was outside the fence. Results are... normal time to mow/trim 12 hrs. each week. Cut down by 2 hrs. due to horses \"mowing\" around the pond and pasture. Leaving 10 hrs. of work. Trimming is usually 4 hrs.  What it took with new mower>>>> 2 hrs. trimming. 4 hrs. mowing.  We are tearing out a fence line this summer, removing an old dog house N left here and adding more weed barrier in the garden to drop the trimming of grass in that area.

We had it checked out by our mower guy and he said Do NOT waste money fixing it. Son 2 is interested in borrowing it since it does still mow and his mower is down.I talked to ex SIL and grandson and two others that all are in landscaping and know this property. Was told to get commercial mower and make sure it gets yearly maintenance and it would last us 20-25 yrs. I am not sure either of will be mowing this property in our mid 80s to 90 yrs old. But we might be as Daddy push mowed until he was 90. We were told what brands to stay away from. Then the owner of the pallet company (he is Mennonite) suggested where he gets his equipment. We got a commercial Bob cat ZT6000 mower 61 inch cut (so 1/3rd of time just got cut off) mulching blade (so no raking and loading grass in to bucket of tractor and moving it to another area cutting another hour off the time) . At 61 inch cut I can mow the ditch as it's big enough to handle the incline. The seat has an adjustment for your weight so you don't get jarred as bad. Has 2 tanks about 15 gals of gas between the two of them so no stopping to go fill up the tank twice... or worse ending up at the far side of property and having the go get gas can and then walk it back to the mower... been there and done that more than once. Zero turn so I should have less trimming.It was on sale for 10% off, and then the manager took another 4% off for paying cash. Still was a big ouch in the finances but if it lasts 20. A \"regular\" riding lawn mower with a 54 inch cut is $3000 to $4000 and last around 5 yrs (10 if you are lucky to have great maintenance and got a good one).  Yeah, not real comfortable about both our personal checking  accts and the joint acct and both our personal savings accts being that low. BUT I still have the money for the basement coming in from other savings accts and the IRA hit today so we are okay. Goal is to get this money replaced before we pay any extra on mortgage. Blessed be"},

We get our SS on the second Wednesday of the month. Daughter 4 has 6 weeks to her surgery for her cancer, then 4 weeks radiation and 4 weeks recovery. So if all goes as plan August 20th she should be released to go back to work. Being that said, we have in our budget to support her until the end of Dec. We just aren't sure she will be able to work full time without causing more health issues right away. I do have $$ that is automatically transferred to savings from our checking at our local bank which is no longer a local bank but we can do the banking in Sidney when we go to chiro every two weeks. When that account gets to a certain point I move it to Ally. When Ally gets to a certain point I move it to a CD. We lowered the amount that we keep in our personal accounts and in our personal savings. Since I still had the paperwork from our old eye glass place I checked to see how much we saved . In between the two of us we saved $1600. That includes a second pair that Hubby is going to order. I couldn't believe he didn't get two pairs to begin with since he always has. Especially since he needs them to drive with. I told him to get the second pair and put them in the work truck.I saved $80 on a Kohls order as they were the cheapest I could find to replace some dishes that have been broken (that I use often). Electric bill came in $33 cheaper than budget.We got buy one get one off on our meal thanks to FIL savings was $8.I added my CVS extra bucks and coupons used into the savings total.I added my cash back from my credit card. We got the bid for the basement, Hubby added extra on as he is looking to do pour concrete for the entrance walls instead of block. J agreed that it was a wise choice and they figured up what that costs would be. Cheaper labor costs but higher material costs.SO that means I can transfer what is NOT needed from the tax refunds and stimulus also.Hubby thought to put it all in savings. I came back with half savings and half mortgage.Hubby is one month ahead of having his life insurance loan paid off so has 2 months left on that bill. Since our mortgage interest rate is higher than the interest rate on my life insurance loan we are going to focus on the mortgage. As long as I pay the interest on the loan it won't affect my policy amount.I paid just over $6000 on the mortgage. Put $3000 in each of our savings accounts.Since we have a higher taxes withholding on our IRAs due to the business AND also pay our health ins out of pocket... we got more back than normal. I will be surprised if that happens next year as the deprecation on the trailers is pretty much used up for deductions and probably won't pay enough interest on the mortgage to claim that either. We are now writing down daily what we saved."},

AND it's should dry out by the end of this day. We hit mid 70's tomorrow and the to do list will start getting done. There are 90 things on the to do list for this month and doesn't break down gardens stuff and that's not dealing with any of the projects for this month or summer.Since I know me... HA HA I know that when I come in from working outside I am not going to want to spend a lot of time cooking lunch or supper/dinner.I need to organize the kitchen better as it is in shambles .Lunch thoughts: eggs in many forms, lunch meat in tortilla wraps, hotdogs , brats. And a fruit... pickles, pickled asparagus, pickled cauliflower, pickled beets, regular beets, carrot sticks, celery, radishes etc will be on the table. There will be at least on run to the local little store for a lunch or two as we are trying to be supportive of her reopening after being closed a total year.Sundays will be either frozen meal (already in the barn freezer , there is about 20 left) or soup.Dinner (what I was raised calling it because it was around 5)/ supper (what my family consider a meal after 6 to 7 and what Hubby grew up with). I hate eating  late as it means I have to stay up right for 3 hrs. after I eat. I try to be in bed at 9 ( so 6 pushes me), read an hour, go to sleep (with praying I sleep) until 6. That is 8 hrs. In reality I am lucky to get 6 hrs. since I have issues with waking during the night for 2 hrs. Seems to be common on this road LOL.On the menu: main dish for evening (that is not in the freezer), sides will be what ever is coming in from the garden. Lettuce, radishes, asparagus (still) turnip greens and green onions will be probably a week from now.Tuscan Braised potatoes with fried eggs.Fettuccini with butter and cheese.Nacho Bell Grande *homemadeMexican pizza(me) Crunch wrap( Hubby) *homemadeCreamy enchiladasEgyptian barley salad (American Test Kitchen recipe)Haluski  with smoked sausageBaconator cheese burger *homemadeRoman braised beef with tomato and cloves (Milk Street recipe)hotdogs with coney saucebrats couscous  asparagus risotto (Milk Street recipe)Baked risotto (Sara Moulton recipe)sweet and sour chicken kabobs Roasted chicken Cornish henAppetizer night... beet sliders/ bruschetta/ chicken satay/ eggrolls/ pot stickers/ stuffed mushrooms/ spinach artichoke dip/ popper dip/loaded French fries (air fryer).

{"title": "savings ", "date": "Tuesday, May 11, 2021", "text": "I have been scattered brained and had the hum drums.  Morning routine is on autopilot even if it takes me all day.  Clothes washed and either on drying rack or clothes line. Dishwasher unloaded, put away and reloaded if anything is sitting there. Dust mop is every other day That's usually done by 8, no later than 10.Then it's either into the gardens or on the computer. When it's damp and/or cold , it is computer. If it's going to rain before noon even if damp and cold it's the garden. I like late morning or early afternoon but it changes depending on the temperature of the day. Then I take something off the list that is a priority.Monday was dentist. I paid cash to get a 5 % discount which was better that the cash back I would get on my credit card. Tuesday with chiropractic and errands with a late visit from Brother. Used cash back card. Wednesday even with feeling like crap and trying to deal with the insurance that was Daddy's. Helping E and M as they got things around for the house sitter and us taking Molly and Dolly, two Belgian work horse, E's small pasture is connected to our pond and the feed trough (they get some oats besides the grass) is at our gate thanks to N that left his feed trough when he sold us the house. AND another visit from Brother as he got more mail from the same ins company for me.Thursday was finance day which I promptly screwed up paying  off a credit card with MY account instead of the joint acct. Thankful that the bank caught it and I got money shifted so I wouldn't get an over draft fee.  DUH.  We decided that anything we saved through the cash back or coupons/clearance/discounts etc would be transferred to savings.Friday We stopped down to A and B's to check out their hanging pots. I found marigolds and basil for the gardens and begonia's for parents and brothers graves. B gave us a discount because Hubby hauls sometimes for A. I went to library to get stuff for Daddy's life ins (another policy jumped up) and have it faxes. Lady there that witnessed my signature (not notarized) asked where I grew up. Then told me where I had grew up and who I was. Was clueless of who she was. We grew up together and I hadn't see her in almost 50 yrs but since I look like MOTHER she recognized me.Saturday we checked out the local farmers market (dud) and got 2 fig trees and 2 cherry trees on discount when getting the dog food from TSC. Then we went to the nursery and got hanging basket for MIL and then to Walmart and got fountain grass at $3 and calla lilies half price. They are tender perennials in this area but I can put them in pots and deal with them that way. We dropped off the hanging basket to MIL. She was complaining of being cold and Hubby told her to put some clothes on instead of a tank top and pair of shorts. It was 58 outside not 85. I don't think she liked how he answered her but I had bit my tongue from not saying the same thing. FIL said he had told her repeatedly to put more clothes on. He is bringing it up to the doctor today(Tuesday). We then used coupons for Arby's FIL gave us that they would not use. Got one meal free with purchase of a meal.  We stopped and ate a the park near by and watched frisbee golf contest.  Since we ate out late we had a snack of popcorn.Sunday I fixed French toast (using last of bread) stuffed with cream cheese and raspberries from the freezer for lunch. We had odds and ends for dinner.  All 6 kids , 3 grandchildren, 4 friends and one grandson's ex girlfriend text me Happy Mothers day. Monday. I called and priced my eye exam at our old place $150 without insurance. I already know what I spent on glasses. I went to Walmart at noon. Had the same eye exam for $60 saving $90. They were able to reuse one of my glass frames. I still ended up with 5 pairs of glasses (4 new frames in children's size), it would have been 4 but I know myself and need to have 2 sets of reading glasses. I could go without my long distance as the eye sight has improved in that part.  Thank heavens as at one time I was nearsighted in one and farsighted in the other.  That isn't as drastic now. I got long distance sunglasses $30 off, long distance glasses 20%, 2 reading glasses  20% off and the glasses for mending used my frame. Children's frames are cheaper and fit me better with the difference in costs almost 40%.  All told, I save $200 with the discounts etc and over $1300 of what it would have cost me at the old place AND I put it on the cash back card.I went to the grocery store and got some meat for special meals, basic veggies (carrots, celery, potatoes, ice burg lettuce, cucumber. PLEASE QUIT being freaking cold with freezes and frosts Mother Nature) no fruit, dairy, and junk food... yes, junk food , chips, candy, coke a cola, root beer and ice cream for floats.Tuesday... a sad day, a very sad day.... the pasta serving dish that matched my Nonna's can not longer be used. It has a large crack but not all the way through YET. There are no replacements . I spent HOURS trying to find one. SIGH... So I settled for 1 quart bowls (the size is a match) and went with  4 different colors to match the dishes I have. I finally found a soup tureen to replace the one my kids put in the oven to heat up chili (clueless as the bowls were on the table and they could have heated it up in the bowl in the microwave). Needless to say that dish was NOT oven proof. I found replacements at kohl's on sale, used codes, free shipping and  my cash back card. BEST NEWS ... J priced out the basement. Highest bid was $20, 000 , next one was around $15,000 that he came down to $12,000 when he heard that J was also bidding. J said less than $7,500... he thought closer to $5,000 depending on if we use the blocks we have or if we want all pour concrete. He is deducting $10/ hour for the time Hubby works on the job with him. ALSO said if we had it dig out on the sides and the block removed before he starts(2-3 wks as he is finishing a job and planting) that it would drop the cost of the labor. ALSO he is only going to work Saturdays (which is not a big deal for us) so Hubby isn't missing work himself to help on this job AND it will be easier to deal with the dogs only on 1 day a week. He thought 3 Saturdays barring rain. We are going to put up fence around that area to stop the dogs from going down there but also stop Charlotte from leaping on to that roof as she runs from back to front of the house for front to back. Don't want her to fall in when the roof is off while doing the basement. Blessed Be everyone"},
{"title": "SIGH I miss you Daddy ", "date": "Wednesday, May 5, 2021", "text": "He would have been 94 years old on Monday. He was 93 years old in this picture. Right before he got pneumonia which ended up being his cause of death.Yesterday (Tuesday) Brother brought out a stack of papers of 25 and a copy of the death certificate. Scared the crap out of me as he CALLED instead of texting. Which he only calls when it's bad. He has never been here even though we have repeatedly told him and his family they are welcome and we are not welcome at their home. Mother would \"punish\" him even as an adult if he had anything to do with me. If he mentioned I was at Daddy's when he stopped in that was okay. So we are like to only children but have a sibling. Sad even though she's been gone 10 yrs he still is that way. He had gotten papers from an life insurance policy that no one knew Daddy had on Monday... hard day for both of us . So he brought out what was for me to fill out and he got the copy of Daddy's death certificate so I wouldn't have to make a trip to the court house that he was driving right by to come here (savings of $5 for me and he didn't want the money back),He said he talked to his lawyer and has now given his lawyer a list of life ins policies, a copy of such policies and a list of where his investments are so if both him and his wife die, or she isn't well enough (has really bad health problems for last 20 yrs and then long hauler for covid) the kids don't get hit with this kind of stuff popping up as this is the second time a policy has popped up that we didn't know about. The one we did know about he cashed out to pay for his funeral when he made the arrangements when Mother died so we wouldn't have to go through that HADES again. Nothing like writing your parent's obit on Thanksgiving.I will be making copies of ours to take to our lawyer when we update the will this year. He stayed for 5 hours. With him \"snapping\" at me one time because I repeated what he said and he said he didn't say that.  Wanted to take a different way home, likes to drive and see the countryside we get that from Daddy. Hubby gave him a different route and wrote it out for him and then input it to his GPS on his phone for him as Brother is not all that great doing that. After he left , I mentioned I might want to check with doc about my short term memory. Hubby said NO, your brother has Dementia and hasn't accepted it yet. He had said what I repeated to him. Hubby texted niece to tell her what happened because he got \"snippy\" with me and she said he was getting worse since he had covid( real bad  and got the \"drip\" (Same stuff as Trump got). That her brother (from her mom's first marriage) was checking in on the two of them in the mornings before he went to work, her uncles and one cousin during the afternoon and she was still living at home (actually they put her name on the house and her brother's name on the other house to ease that issue). Said right now he is still okay to drive, even has worked some short term jobs off and on. She has been keeping in touch with Son 2 (who didn't mention it due to overload of changing job and trying to train his replacement etc) as she felt she could use the wisdom of Son 2 to help guide her since he is the one to deal with us.  And she didn't want to \"add\" stress to me when I can't do anything about it.I am happy she felt comfortable with Son 2 (she is my grandkids age ) to reach out to him for support..We knew he had the beginnings of Dementia as he would say \"I have a short term memory issue \" when he would start a conversation where Daddy would say \"I have Dementia\" every other sentence. Now I have 25 pages to deal with for this insurance. I am glad Niece volunteered she sat down with Brother to fill his out with the line she wanted to know how to do it when he or her mother died. Since he retired from teaching after 40 some years, getting him to \"teach\" you is a way to guide him she said.  She added that most the information they are asking for is already in the paperwork as she added that page for me. I just got to find the page in her handwriting LOL."},
{"title": "This week's savings", "date": "Monday, May 3, 2021", "text": "When J brought the concrete guy down to start working up the estimate for repair/replace entrance and ramp he marked where the ramp would be. I went out and measured how long an ADA ramp would be to run from the kitchen porch beside the basement ramp. Not going to work. There for we will be putting wide steps in as originally planned saving $4,000 to install the ramp.We have been using the cash back credit card and then I transfer the amount from the checking over to the savings so when the credit card comes dues, the money has been sitting there. Won't earn a lot of interest but between the cash back and what little interest it earns is better than nothing. We bend over to pick up the penny we can do this also.My truck ins dropped 10% as we don't put the miles on it. I have over 60 servings of asparagus in the pantry/freezers. I told M she could have what ever is left as theirs didn't come much at all.I reminded Daughter 4 to amend her federal taxes... cutting $1,000 off her tax bill which means I am not coming up with $1,000 for her to pay. Win for both of us.I took the recycling to the township haul for drop and in conversation found that the township clean up day is either the 2nd or 3rd Saturday of April every year. I put is on the calendar and told Hubby we needed a spot to put stuff for it instead of paying the extra  $90 to have it hauled.  I got a bill over $3000 that wasn't paid by health ins. Couple phone calls and follow ups in writing. The bill is now paid by insurance and I was rebilled $200. M sent over pie and bread. I cut up the bread after a couple days and made bread pudding. Pie was ate that day. She makes us and her north side neighbors 8 inch pies where she makes her family 12 inch pies. Hubby priced the size she sends us at the local Amish bakery. Pie costs $6.75. Last month she sent over caramel raisin pie with crumb topping. Little leary at first, but her caramel is not real sweet (or sticky) and the raisins were very soft. We enjoyed it.Since I was done with asparagus, Hubby asked for a schedule of what fruit and veggie had to be eaten per week/biweekly/monthly/ seasonal etc. After I thought he lost his mind( I think my mouth dropped open) I worked it out. Then he informed me I was SHORT in some areas and he figured out what it was and gave it back to me with notes of who he had worked out barter deals to get the crop and I just (yeah ... JUST) have to can/ freeze/ dehydrate it. On the  NOT frugal side though I have 6 friends and 3 kids saying it will be... I ordered a 7.25 quart Le Creuset Dutch oven in blue. I checked out American Test kitchen for reviews on Dutch ovens. Then did price checks with shipping costs and time frames of arrive and ordered it through Amazon.  Hubby's buddy who does the cooking (his wife is the baker) said to leave it on the stove. I can do red beans and rice, Cuban beans and rice, jambalaya, stews, soups, roasts and desserts. I do have a small dark interior Dutch oven for baking bread and a small oval one that was a gift from Mother. I don't use crock pots (unless keeping homemade noodles and mashed potatoes at a family dinner warm) nor do I use instant pots. I don't like the texture or appearance of roasts in them. Hubby doesn't like the taste. Son 2 uses one for roasts but if he is inviting us he sears the roast before putting it in the crock pot or instant pot. We are still thinking of the green house. I think we have some buried windows or doors that we could use so until we get to that stage of cleaning out the barn , we won't be buying anything except ordering the roof for the barn over hang. We can reuse what is on it for the basement ramp or even sell it as Amish will buy it used. Only milk from the store this past weekBlessed Be  Garden boxes... painted/ put together/ installed in garden/ filled with soil and trellises added.

{"title": "Daughter 4 said NO ", "date": "Thursday, April 29, 2021", "text": "I had pulled coupons and CVS extra bucks and saw the sale at CVS advert. I figured up what it would cost and what I would save.Said something to daughter 4 who immediately played 20 questions. Is that the best price? How much do you have of that? How often do you use that? How long with the amount you have last you? GEEZE.  I kept having the scene where she took the 3rd can of corn out of the cart because it wasn't on the list pop up in my head. She then informed me I did NOT need to go buy any of what I was going to buy because either I had enough for  a year or I had something else that would do the same thing. AND I had enough allergy meds for this year. I can wait until end of the season to get that on sale for next spring (voice of experience there as she and brother buys it more than I do). YES I asked brother and he backed her and his wife is just like Daughter 4.  She told me to take the money and either buy canning supplies (I hope I do not need any more this year as I tripled what I usually get) or seeds (Nope, don't need that but might need inoculant) Or plants. Not until mid May, too cold for warm weather plants. I am not buying flowers until mid May also. Well I won't buy them then as Hubby barters for the flowers. I also have bulbs and seeds for flowers to plant.I bought supplies for dogs for 40 % off  AFTER approval of Daughter 4 and Son 2. Actually Son 2 ordered them as he could get them cheaper through his account.Hubby thinks it is funny that those 2 know more about our finances than he does... why is that?Son 2 gets medical and financial power of attorney if something happens to us. He also would be the one to have to help Daughter 4 until she is over this cancer surgery and recovery. (Thank Heavens that she has a new granddaughter to take her mind off it Now if she just finds a job in August when she gets released from surgery). After dealing with Mother and Pop getting sick, nursing home, and no clue to how in debt they were. We have been more open and keeping Son 2 up with what is what that includes Daughter 4's care. Like Daddy was with Brother and me. Less stress on all of us.Why doesn't Hubby? He knows where the financial stuff is at , he knows how to look at where we are standing... he is one of those that just doesn't care to know. He put himself into bankruptcy with his first wife, did it again right after we got married when I took over the finances . He already told Son 2 if something happens to me , he gets the finances. Son2 is fine with that. We have a grandson that is willing to step in there also as he is the one that will do Son2 's if something happens to him and then me (military kid).I helped Hubby set up his business (Thank you to Legal zoom for crossing those t's and dotting those I's ) and have everything on auto pay and what account to put it on so he doesn't over draw his checking in the winter or late June/ early July during his slow season. I also had him set it up at the bank for over draft protection and everything is set up to text him on reminders etc. Thanks to Son 1 who does that crap HA HA for a living being in IT.And life keeps rolling"},
{"title": "Planning to save more", "date": "Tuesday, April 27, 2021", "text": "Sitting at the table with the oil lamp lit between us as we drank our morning coffee.  I said to Hubby.\"I want to save more. I think this coming  year (especially if Daughter 4 has to have hip surgery along with the cancer surgery) will put us off a year on getting the mortgage and rest paid. I don't want to piddle it away what isn't spent.\" Hubby looked at me like I had lost my mind... then he asked ...\"What can you do that you don't do now?\"I can use the airfryer for small \"bakes\" instead of the small oven as our electric is cheaper than our propane. I can use the regular oven for big bakes or multi bake dishes. It will take planning for those last minute biscuits, cakes etc .I can use the canning stove this year after we get the garden boxes done as they are blocking the path to it. Grill \"summer\" propane is cheaper than our \"winter\" propane in the  big tank. (PLEASE MOTHER NATURE I need at least 70 degree temps to paint boxes for 3 days... okay 2 days if that's all I can get.) I can use the grill more than once or twice a week since it is on the front porch and once again the grill propane is cheaper. We debated about moving it to the deck but then it has to be good weather as there is no covering and the deck is vinyl and Hubby already melted one house siding on the old house . SO since it's mostly me now days grilling I will get a small table and chair for the front porch so I am not running back and forth from the kitchen. I should have something in the barn to fill that want.I can put up the canopy to block the sun from  coming in the French doors and heating up the house this summer. I can use the umbrella for the table Hubby built and then realized he didn't put the umbrella hole in the middle. I am okay with it not being there as it's a freaking pain to pull out when the storms are coming.I have stopped making menus because I buy what is needed for a dish that Hubby wants and then don't make it because hubby works late and doesn't want that type of meal that late. and then I forget it was to be made and it gets tossed like the $8 of veggies tossed to the compost yesterday as I was focused on getting asparagus dealt with. SO the answer I said for that is , We eat what needs ate first and no extra veggies in the basement frigs. Fruit I will go check as we store apples there in the fall until coming summer.I switched what goes on the cash back credit card That has already saved us $15 in one week.Instead of waiting 3 days before buying anything we are waiting 5 days unless it's a NEED (like Hubby's part for his trailer that is leaking fluid that runs his dove tail.. dove tail is the end of the trailer that drops to form a ramp to the trailer).I checked the list of needs for the pantry to decide where I could save there.Instead of buying canned pork and beans I will make them from scratch and then can them myself. I found a couple recipes I will try before canning them so I make sure we actually like the flavor. I have plenty of Great Northern dried beans and tomatoes from last year. I am turning last year's tomato juice into this year's pasta sauce. I will grow green beans to can (low on that)both regular green beans and Italian wide green beans. I have the seeds.I will grow beets to can plain beets (or barter with A as she grows beets to sell but will barter with us). I have seeds.I need hot salsa and mild salsa. If I don't get enough tomatoes to do that we will go without. N isn't sure how well the tomato plants he got are going to do as he waited too long to order and they were out of his go to plants. J is suppose to have roma tomatoes but he is worried about how this weather is going to affect them.I need grape jelly. I have grape juice from last year that should cover that. IF the grapes after being hit with the snow and frost, make enough to replace the juice. If not, I won't get grape jelly.Horseradish mustard, I will watch for sales on this.Sweet and Spicy mustard, I will watch for sales for thisA1 sauce, another one to be on sale as I can't make anything close to it that Hubby likes.Linguine... I have no clue to how this got down to 1 package when I am stocked well with everything else UNLESS I had kids that took it and didn't mark it down on the \"we took\" list. Wouldn't be the first time. The pasta sale the other week didn't include linguine. I  will check Dollar General/Save A Lot/ Aldi's . Price is  set is less than $1 for a pound or we will go with out it.Spicy Hot cauliflower... it's more pickled and yellow due to turmeric, a small hot pepper is usually in it with the cauliflower and it's usually a good size jar. We eat one or two a month. I've not been able to make it that we liked so I could can it.Campbells chicken noodle (or stars) soup. I keep 6 cans for when I am sick. YES I am picky when I am sick.Luzianna family size tea bags. It's the only tea both of us drink. We drink it hot, room temp or cold. I stock up on it in the fall to get us through winter. I am down to 3 boxes of 24 . That is 2 months. I have found it I refill with water and simmer longer we can get a second pot (10 cup pot) out of it. That would make what I have last 4 months. I try to get it on sale with a coupon.  Daughter 4 and I will holding each other accountable. She has been saving her money (after expenses and grandbaby stuff) in a real savings acct (as she used to do change in jars) because she has decided to buy a home in the next two years. She talked to Son 2 about what she needed to do and figured if she could save some now with her door dash that she would be in savings mode when she went back to work. In May or June they are going to work on her resume.  We will share what we are buying and costs and what meals are being made. This is the child that nailed me for putting the 3rd can of green beans in the cart (aka buggy in the south)because there was only 2 on the list and being on sale did not mean anything to her. Hubby was going to use the rebates from Menards to buy filters ( I need 4 for kitchen cold air vent) I told him to hold off as I have some to get through the summer and I wanted the rebates in case we need something for the basement project or find we can put a ramp off the kitchen porch next to the basement ramp. If we can't do a ramp we are going to do a very wide set of steps there as I can't step up on the railroad ties that are there as steps. I did check Amazon to see what I was waiting for to come in... 2 planters that should be here in the next couple days  and two books. Back to finish weeding the gardens.Blessed Be"},

Turned it up when winter April storm dropped the temps.Had leftovers for our meals that we reheated in the microwave.Did not use high temp wash cycle or dry cycle on dishwasher.I washed freezer bags, sandwich bags and foil. Used silicon covers for food when possible.Clothes washer was cold water, rapid wash, medium soil. Dried clothes on drying racks.Used tasked lighting. Drained the \"water\" off last year's canned tomato juice to make pasta sauce. Took 6 qrts of juice to make 2 qrts of pasta sauce. I put that in a pitcher and put in the frig . I will make more tomorrow to get enough to can. I want at least 4 qrts if not 7 which is a full canner.Got a ball park estimate from E's brother in law for basement ramp repair. He is figuring up a more solid estimate but said $6000 to $10,000 but really didn't think it would go that high. He said some of it is still good and can be reused (blocks/gravel for back fill) and he was more than happy to have Hubby help as that means the tractor can do the digging instead of his guys and Hubby can bring the blocks over to the ramp instead of the guys carrying them... there is over 100 blocks and they weigh about 40 -50 lbs. The other estimates were $17,000 to $20,000.Wednesdaywoke up to thisUsed oil lamp on dining table for morning coffee chat Did not use high temp wash cycle or dry cycle on dishwasher.Clothes washer was cold water, rapid wash, medium soil. Dried clothes on drying racks.Turned furnace down (Hubby left for work).I washed freezer bags, sandwich bags and foil. Used silicon covers for food when possible.Did not use snow blower to remove 3 inches of snow off deck. Figured it would either melt by tomorrow or the wind tonight and tomorrow would blow it away... 2:15 pm ... most of it's gone.Used task lighting.Used 16 qrts of tomato juice to make pasta sauce. Will be canning tomorrow.Cleaned, blanched and flash froze 96 spears of asparagus. Will be vacuum bagging them tomorrow. I have another pan to blanch tomorrow and 36 spears in the frig for meals. Made a pot of tea (10 cup) and then left it sit on stove next to burner that I was cooking the tomato juice down on. Kept it warm enough I did not have to reheat at all during the morning and early afternoon. Made 2nd pot of tea using  same tea bag. Simmered it a bit longer to increase the strength of it.I washed the peanut, cashews and M&M containers that Hubby had emptied. He sat them aside instead of putting them at the sink so I didn't know they needed washed. They don't do well in the dishwasher. We refill them with bulk nuts and candy or  store pasta, beans etc in them and Daughter 4 has a few so she can get flour and sugar from us.Hubby texted me and said to not fix the pork roast as he was given a gift card for take out that was going to expire. Someone gave it to one of the Amish guys and they won't use it in time. Update, it was a KFC gift card, Hubby used it and added $9 something to get a bucket of chicken with sides. I will vacuum bag the leftover chicken and freeze. We can reheat it in the air fryer. We will have 6 more meals from it.We got a new credit card from Chase Amazon that gives cash back. I am reading the information to see the best way to use it (with what I am already using a credit card for). I save enough on shipping to \"pay\" for the prime. Hubby watches the shows. Called a friend that uses one and listed what he suggested.Thursday. Woke up to frost.Used oil lamp on dining table for morning coffee chat Did not use high temp wash cycle or dry cycle on dishwasher.Clothes washer was cold water, rapid wash, medium soil. Dried clothes on drying racks.Turned furnace down (Hubby left for work).Used task lighting.I washed freezer bags, sandwich bags and foil. Used silicon covers for food when possible.Made a pot of tea (10 cup) and then left it sit on stove next to burner that I had the canner on.  Stayed warm.Got 9 qrts of pasta sauce out of 22 qrts of tomato juice (after draining \"water\" off juice). I wrote on the canning lid it was from tom juice from last year.M sent over a loaf of bread, she wasn't going to bake as they are going to visit her parent but they ran out of bread completely so she baked. They are going to her aunt's funeral (congested heart failure) today and then back tonight (long day) and then leave tomorrow at 5 am to go to her parents. A couple of their church family is house sitting and taking care of the calves and horses. (M didn't leave for her parents as her parents are now helping her uncle \"close\" up the house her aunt and he lived in) I put away the \"non food stock\" that came in and straightened up the storage loft. We have 6 months supply of dog stuff. Since Wilbur is going on 13 (May 3rd) and Rascal (March) is 10 and both have health issues. I am not willing to stock more than that. Charlotte will be 4 on Father's day.Fixed pork loin roast with potatoes. Tossed a bunch of asparagus on top of it when I pulled it out to rest for 15 minutes before I cut the roast. Worked well.Daughter 4 got the title of my car changed over into her name and sent me a picture of my tags on her mantle incase I buy a car between now and Jan so I can just transfer plates not buy plates. Dropped the cost of our insurance I cut open a lotion pump bottle that the pump had broke off. I had already mixed a bit of water in it trying to get the last out. I scraped what was left into a old container. I labeled the container lotion so I will know that when I have one I need to cut open, I can put the lotion in it.Friday No snow and no frost and no freeze that was forecasted. As happy as I was to see that , I was not happy to see Charlotte climbing up on the kitchen porch table to lay down. She's not happy with the new cushions. But when I put the old ones in the metal chair on the deck she will probably be laying in them.Used oil lamp on dining table for morning coffee chat Did not use high temp wash cycle or dry cycle on dishwasher.I washed freezer bags, sandwich bags and foil. Used silicon covers for food when possible. Used to drive Hubby crazy I do that.Clothes washer was cold water, rapid wash, medium soil. Dried clothes on drying racks.Turned furnace down (Hubby left for work).Used task lighting.We uncovered gardens and took covers to barn as there is another possible frost in the forecast. No sense washing anything until mid May.Hubby turned heater off in pump house (again) Hubby moved trees and blueberry bushes out of barn. We went to produce auction. Not much there . A friend is hunting for Roma tomatoes so we went down to the greenhouse down the road from us. They had Amish paste. So I let him know as it was above the price point he was wanting to spend and smaller than he was wanting. We bought nothing even though there was things I would have loved to have for the front porch. We dropped a message off to an Amish guy.Stopped at the small store that reopened in March and bought ham (real ham) salad and a cherry pie made by a local Amish young lady. That was lunch and supper.Menards called and said delivery of the front porch flooring and ramp will be delivered Friday mid day. J, the Amish guy, that is going to work on the basement ramp, came back with a guy that works concrete (also helped build the ramp originally) more than J does.J likes second opinions. He agreed with J's thoughts that the whole ramp did not fail, just 2 batches of bad concrete did. Looks like they will be doing this job together .We should get that estimate next week.Hubby went to CVS to pick up my meds. It was $1.04. He had already pulled the new cash back credit card out and normally we don't use any cards for amounts under $5. He mentioned to the clerk what he was doing and why he wasn't sure he wanted to do that... she asked him if he would bend over and pick up a penny... of course he answered. She told him to use the card for anything $1 or more. That was the same as picking up a penny.Hubby sat down to eat and made the comment \"I feel like I have been unplugged. I have no energy and don't want to do anything else. Is this how you feel daily?\"Yes that is exactly how I feel daily and now he finally understands when I say I am done for the day even when there is still work on my to do list. SaturdayUsed oil lamp on dining table for morning coffee chat Did not use high temp wash cycle or dry cycle on dishwasher.Clothes washer was cold water, rapid wash, medium soil. Dried clothes on drying racks.Turned furnace down (Hubby left for work and to drop our tractor off to dealer for warranty maintenance).Used task lighting.I washed freezer bags, sandwich bags and foil. Used silicon covers for food when possible. I put the pans to soak in the sink and let the hot soapy water do most the work. I used vinegar to soak the kitchen sink for it's \"deep\" monthly cleaning. Helps clean out the drain pipes also.Heated leftover pork roast and veggies in microwave and had ice cream for dessert.I redid Daughter 4's budget due to increase in food costs, fuel costs (no more free rides to treatment) raise in her utilities even though her usage is the same and car insurance. Actually the car ins going over to her is less than ours was. Eating organic food is expensive when it is not growing season in this area. She had to go to a smaller meat box due to the increase in that price. Except for asparagus, nothing is growing yet.   Then I changed our budget to not have to pull any more $$ from IRA.  We decided to do as my life insurance agent suggested and only pay interest on the ins loans and nothing extra on anything else until we have all the projects paid for (basement and soil for garden boxes) and pretty much if necessary hire the work done. She just had one pay off their loan and then had to sell the house because they didn't have money to convert to ADA and couldn't get a loan due to loss of employment due to pandemic. They have unemployment only and the husband had a major stroke. At this point we have one ramp to get in and out of house on the first floor. We will have another on the front porch.  We would need a chair to go to the basement. My MIL is getting on for their basement. We have a wheelchair accessible bathroom. The sink would need lowered or changed (most $100). The Mudroom(originally was kitchen) sink would be lowered (Hubby can do it or Amish can do it as they put it in and MADE THE SINK) so I could wash produce and what ever there instead of the kitchen . The other would be oven and changing to a cook top instead of a stove. Really I can sit in a wheelchair and use 3 of the 5 burners on this stove. Yes I have practiced. The oven I would like a retractable door like British bake off . I do have an airfryer so that works also.So we decided what ever isn't spent at end of month will go into savings until we have projects done or close to done. Daughter 4 has cancer surgery June 24 with 8 weeks recovery . She is supposed to get her results for the MRI of her right hip on Tuesday. If she has to have surgery that is going to make some interesting summer (NOT). But I did tell her this is her 1995 (my year for 3 surgeries in 90 days during the holidays)How are you saving?Blessed be"},
{"title": "SNOW , deck table finished, Basement update ", "date": "Wednesday, April 21, 2021", "text": "s Just a little over 3 inches at 6 a.m.looks like December Hubby got a project done. this was what was left of the deck table after wind storm last summer.Hubby got these two boards ...the one to the left is a corner board He used the metal frame from the old table. This table is heavy. We thought maybe it would be light but it's not. I won't be carrying it by myself for sure.It's sturdy enough to hold 3 inches of snow.Basement update...E's brother in law stopped over last night since he won't be working today and tomorrow due to weather. He took a good look and a couple solid kicks to the concrete and told Hubby it could not be extended due to the field tile. He had helped build it. It was not failure but looked like two batches of bad concrete as it should have held another 30 yrs. He can reuse at least half of what is there. He will be figuring up a  better estimate counting on  Hubby using the tractor to do the digging, reusing the bad concrete for fill, us already having most of the blocks and concrete for the entrance... he is thinking around $6000 to the most being $10,000... he just doesn't think it will be that much. He is going to look at price of having ready made concrete brought in or bag concrete that they mix in a wheel barrel with labor to figure out the cheapest way but make it last at least 30 yrs. AND he will figure in how long it will be that the dogs can't go down that way. Since that is a lot cheaper than the other two estimates, we will be going with him. I can cover that without pulling from the IRAs YEAH"},
{"title": "Small changes", "date": "Tuesday, April 20, 2021", "text": "I went over the budget with a fine tooth comb. Between basement ramp and basement entrance, front porch and ramp, my dentist bill coming up, the rest of my surgery bills, Hubby's one set of glasses, my eye exam and 5 sets of glasses , building the greenhouse, yearly maintenance on the tractor($1000) under warranty so we can't do it ourselves and finishing the garden boxes and buying more dirt. On top of the two loans, truck payment and mortgage. I am trying to only pull from savings and not have to pull from the IRA's. I emailed our tax preparer (who is retiring) and asked what we could do to lower our taxes.  Her answer was keep better track of our medical miles and to keep receipts for medical stuff AKA the walker I bought that is deductible.  I printed off round trip directions to each of our doctors/testing/ etc. and I will put the dates on the maps and receipts of the bill paid in a file for medical deductions. Hubby moved his cell phone bill to the business as 80% if not more is business calls anywaysWe have the majority needed for the basement entrance, might need a few more blocks and metal for the roof as the metal one now leaks. The ramp part , highest estimate in is $20,000. The other was $17,000. We should have E's brother in laws in the next 10 days when he gets the job he is doing right now finished.I told Hubby we could take scrap lumber that's in the barn from us converting this house and  I can paint it with what ever outdoor paint I have and build the green house. Local metal shop can get us clear fiberglass for half the costs of what we could find it at a lumber yard for it as we know plastic won't hold up to the winds here.Hubby designed and ordered the material to redo the front porch and add a ramp. He got $1000 off it including delivery when it all comes in. Would have costs him $300 to haul it himself).My dentist gave me a discount since I am having the work done in 60 days and paying with cash or check. Hubby did not need an eye exam as he had one a year ago. So he just had the glasses to pay for.I found paint in the pump house so we don't need to buy outdoor paint for the garden boxes (or green house). We get the soil cheaper as we buy it by the pallet and Hubby always asks the manager for a discount.Since I am paying cash for eye exam and glasses, I was offered 20% off  plus there might be additional $$ off depending on the sunglasses I get. I want plastic frames and I don't want the lens section to touch my cheeks when I smile. I think I want a half lens for computer work but if they are more expensive, I won't go that way.So using estimates we have gotten, I think I need to save up $4000 in next 2 months over what we have in savings already. We can pay only the interest on the ins loans for now. Business is back up so no worry about Hubby's truck payment. We decided to not take the driveway to the basement ramp. Saving $12,000 in gravel. We might have enough here to finish or at least not have to get as much and it can wait until next year if needed.I can cancelled 4 memberships I had forgot about. They go through my PayPal. I checked my activity. I do not put auto pays on credit cards.Our menu is now WHAT EVER NEEDS ATE FIRST...asparagus... repeatedly.Instead of eating our fill of asparagus and then giving the rest away. I have blanched, froze and vacuumed bagged 84 spears and canned 13 pints of bread and butter pickled asparagus over the 8 pints of dill asparagus and 12 pints of bread and butter pickled asparagus I had already. I picked more today to blanch tomorrow. The freeze we are expecting with the snow might stop it from producing any more. The apple trees, blackberry vines, raspberry vines and grape vines are going to take a hit. I covered everything else I could and Hubby moved all the fruit trees in pots and the blueberry bushes in pots to the barn. I have went from hauling butt to prep and plant to hauling butt to cover plants up and will be hauling butt to uncover and start planting warm weather crops as it is going to be too warm for a second round of cool weather crops. I might get some \"salad\" planted in pots for the porch...and we will get tired of eating salad.I inventoried what I was low on in the pantry. I made separate lists for what I can can myself and what I would have to buy in the store. I know from several sources that food prices are looking to be close to another 10% higher and if the corn belt gets hit hard again with the weather going through there... it will only go higher. I've already stocked my corn meal.  I am taking last year's tomato juice to make pasta sauce (I'm down to 2 qrts). Due to increase of prices I stocked up the dogs stuff and non food for us for next 6 months.I have some  flower bulbs to plant for spring and fall to help with getting the bees and possible Hummingbirds around the gardens.  I use the app on my phone to turn the furnace down. If Hubby sees me turn it down, he gets cold and turns it back up. BUT if he doesn't see me then he doesn't get cold. He has to have his reading glasses on to see the thermometer.I cut the grocery budget to $50 a month. Hubby wants to eat out twice a month... or I should say take out because covid is going up here and even though we get our second dosage Monday, we don't trust the variants and with a new great granddaughter and  Daughter 4 fighting cancer. We just are going to continue to stay at home. Just a note, the local little store that serves lunch has been so over ran with lunch orders it is almost now a call and see if there is anything left. Glad for her.Produce auction starts Friday. I will be going to it (please let it be above 30 degrees) as I want to check out some of the plants etc. I have $$ set aside. Blessed Be.   Elizabeth Mae born 4/19/2021At 3:28 pm after Mommy pushed 33 minutes *daughter 4 timed it* As Daughter 4 AKA Gammy and Daddy had to hold Mommy's legs. Stirrup's wasn't where her feet could fit. Lizzie weighed 6 lbs and 6.4 ounces and was 20 inches long. Everyone doing good even though Mommy and Gammy had panic attacks when Daddy cried when I was born and I looked right at him. Gammy and Nurse said so."},
{"title": "GEEZE", "date": "Monday, April 19, 2021", "text": "... granddaughter is almost to 6 dilation. She punched her man when he cracked the joke about it being called labor for a reason when she said she was tired of all this pain. Good thing he is a big man with her being ex ROTC. Daughter 4 was allowed in room to give T a break after granddaughter punched him. He knows now to remain arm length from her during contractions LOL.Daughter 4 still has both ears infected but they are better and she was glad I told her to take Tylenol after the  MRI of her hip. Even though I pass the eye test when getting my license renewed, I wouldn't want to be in the car with myself driving without my glasses. I realized today while driving to the dentist that things were a bit blurry. So I now have an appt May 10th and I know it's going to be expensive as I have 5 different pairs. That is down from 7. Long distance, sunglasses long distance (which is the pair I wear the most), reading, computer and mending (including removing splinters). I am going to get half lens for the computer so I don't have to wear my glasses have way down my nose. Last time I had to get glasses it was $1600 without the exam which insurance paid.  Hubby just got a new pair of his old prescription that cost $350 without an exam.I am 62... I have NEVER had a cavity... now I have 4 mild ones in back molars. SIGH. Well water does not have fluoride and I didn't think to pick up a fluoride rinse. That is $400 with a discount for cash/check payment. I would ask why is it when you look at getting OUT of debt... more debt hits? But that is the way the ball bounces, cookie crumbles, life just rolls on.SO I am taking a good look at where I can cut $$ so I don't have to pull more from the IRA's or the savings. MEANTIME we are expecting up to TWO INCHES OF SNOW and 29 degrees with 25 mph winds with in next 3 days of nasty weather. SO I am out to cover plantsBlessed Be Daughter 4 has infection in both ears, she gets retested for it today after her MRI of her hip.  HER daughter was induced this morning. Still waiting for Baby Lizzie to come out. Her daughter complained about the labor pains and Daughter 4 informed her they were nothing compared to what was coming. Granddaughter is not happy with Daughter 4 now. They have been doing video chats a couple times a day.Daughter 4 has appointment to get the title of my car put in her name and earned enough to get tags and full coverage insurance. She says that her Door Dash income will drop with summer as everyone will go to cook outs. Their county has went higher with covid.Son 1 said his work is steady. He works for an IT company and he hasn't been hanging out with anyone but his mom and stepdad.Son 2 has refused nomination at his VFW. He still is secretary of Combat vets motorcycle. That is a 3 min job of roll call when they go on a bike ride as they don't have a building to take care of. He had a problem a couple weeks ago and the ER thought mild heart attack. They have ruled that out. He had a bunch of blood work ran Friday and is waiting on those results before they schedule his appt with his primary (60 miles from him). He accepted a job that gives him a promotion ( civilian side of Air Force military instead of Army like he is) and increase of pay. He looks to start the first part or middle of May as they start everyone on the beginning of pay period. I am willing to bet stress between a job that he was handling 5 other peoples work along with his own  on top of battles in the VFW and a couple long term personal relationships that he had to finally admit were toxic. Stress will kill you.Daughter 1 just had her second injections for her back. She has a rare bone disease that destroys her bones from her biological mother's side. She still is able to work as dept. manager at Walmart. Daughter 2 said she head bartender and manager of servers. She said some days she doesn't make enough to pay the gas of going to work. She plans to work 1 more year (her youngest graduates then). She gets no health ins or retirement from this job. Her man and her have been looking at opening their own bar some day. Nice dream but she definitely knows what it takes to run one.Daughter 3 said she works and goes home to her kids and man. They have his mom and sister around them (he helps take care of his mom). She works at a cash advanced place.  All the adult grandkids are working and trying to stay in their bubbles. The ones in school... half went to school the other half stay in homeschooling. Back later as I have a dentist appt.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "What is going on", "date": "Wednesday, April 14, 2021", "text": "My life insurance agent was reading my policy (my old one left a few years ago) and she noticed my insurance expires when I am 77... it's not a whole life policy like I was told it was. SO Hubby checked his... his is 87.  SO  she is now looking at options so we are covered as both our parents lived longer than that. She mentioned Hubby's life ins company does mortgage loans and so does my IRA company. She is going to get the interest rates for us to compare to what we have and she will also have the refinance costs so we can figure that in. When I got this insurance they were a life ins company only. Now they do everything from life insurance to making sure you have health ins for the best price that covers all your needs, to helping you do a budget, getting medical supplies to keep you in your home etc.Hubby is fixing Son 2's weed eater and leaf blower. Son thought it was the battery as both are battery operated but it's actually the charger and the battery. Son 2 gave it to us instead of pitching it. Hubby priced the cost of just replacing the battery and charger compared to replacing the the weed eater and leaf blower. He found a sale at Lowes. that had the weed eater aka trimmer and leaf blower and 1battery and charger. He then priced buying the weed eater and leaf blower separate. He got them separate AND even with buying both new he spent less than he would have just replacing the two batteries and two chargers. We will be checking yard sales for chargers and batteries as this would be good to pass to one of the girls. Mean time it means we can split the trimming and get it done faster between the two of us.Daughter 4 is taking the title of my car that she has been driving pretty for the past year. She went and got a quote for insurance and it will actually save me money even with me paying for the insurance until she gets back to work. I haven't liked the car, sits low to the ground and that stresses my back to get out of. My doctor agreed to a teledoc appt since I only needed meds. Saved me 3 hrs of driving, $12 in gas and $50 co pay as our ins pays completely for teledoc or online visits.Asparagus is coming in. In next three weeks I will be freezing some and canning some as bread and butter using asparagus instead of cucumbers and get tired of it being on the table every day.Furnace is turned down during the day, oil lamp or candle is used at dining table instead of electric light when needed.  Electric bill dropped $35 putting it below our average for this time of year.I used the 55 lb. dog food bag as a trash bag saving 8 cents.I got flower bulbs on clearance to plant on the hill at the mailbox. I got Hummingbird food on sale for half price. We only got milk this week. We took the dogs to the vet when opened in the morning (it's a walk in clinic) and got their toe nails cut and Charlotte got her allergy shot. By driving them back to the old vet even though it's 70 mils away  we save money. ALL the vets in this area charge $20 for nails PLUS office visit of $35 . EVEN if we take all 3 at the same time...they charge separate office visits for each dog. We pay $10 for toe nails and if that's all we are getting that is all we pay... no office visit charge. We did get a $48 charge for Charlotte's allergy shot and HER office visit even though doc did check all three of them. Wilbur is at 103 lbs. Doc said that since he is going to be 13 yrs. old May 3rd he wasn't going to put him on a diet but for me to make sure he was up and moving more. Slow walking was fine. He still runs some especially when it's a motorcycle going down the road. He will stand on his back feet to hug me around the waist when he is wanting a treat. Rascal is 9 yrs. old, he weighed in at 78 lbs. and Charlotte will be 4 yrs old on Father's day weighed in at 62 lbs. Doc said she will probably be in the low 80s when she gets the boys ages. She is just a bit shorter in the leg than the boys who are pretty much same height.I went down the basement ramp coming in from the yard and found 2 places on the ramp it's self that the concrete is giving way (ramp about 20 yrs old). We were already to replace the walls at the basement door and have those blocks. We got the price from a company, they want $15,000 and 2 wks. Another one wants closer to $20,000 and 3 wks. E suggested we talk to his brother in law that does construction as he would take in account that Hubby can help with the work (the other two said no and they would supply the blocks for the walls even though we have them already) and let us pay directly for the materials. Right now the brother in law is working a job out of town and will be the rest of this week before he can come price it. He did say (since he knows the house) that he thought the ramp should be lengthened due to how steep it was. It can't be ADA standards as that would put it at 96 feet long ramp but it would be less steep. We have lean forward to get up it right now or lean back some if coming down.  He would also look at it to see if we will be able to ramp that side of the kitchen porch or only be able to put stairs on that side. Right now there is nothing there as the stairs are on the other two sides of that porch. Financial changes will be made.How is your week going?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "past busy week", "date": "Saturday, April 10, 2021", "text": "She is hoping for delivery on the 14th which is baby's daddy's  and her cousin's birthday. Lord is she huge. Dilated to 3 and the doctor said he could touch Lizzie's head. Daughter 4 took the picture from her car as Granddaughter is quarantining since she is in labor and will be entering the hospital...soon,  we hope. Cuddles, Son 2's kitty. He is my oldest 4 legged grandchild.  Bailey, she Son 2's baby girl.  Yes I got my kitty fix when Hubby helped Son 2 put the water heater in.We have high winds coming in along with too cold of temps for the buds on the fruit trees this week. Hubby was glad they were in pots so he put them on pallets and hauled them with the tractor (fork lift on it) and put them on the south side under the over hang. He moves them out in the sun (they get some during the early morning and early afternoon)when the weather is ok and then puts them back. He has it so he can hang a tarp to keep them safe if it gets too cold. He has already been warned by a couple people that if the flowers get cold we won't get fruit. First meal of asparagus from garden. I had to pick two nights in a row to get enough to go with our meatloaf patty and mashed potatoes. I imagine I will be ran over this coming week. They say the harvest is 3 wks long but last year it was closer to 5 weeks. We will get tired of eating it. We took the dogs for a ride while picking up our taxes from our preparer, thinking we would stop at the vet's but the vet's was packed so we just came on home.Charlotte got stuck in the front seat with us on the way over as the boys took up the whole back seat. She made sure on the way back she had back seat as Wilbur got in front to watch us go in.Wilbur got in his standard position when the window is cracked open. He actually sleeps this way. He won't ride in the front, gets car sick that way.Poor Rascal, he could have laid on the floor, it's wide enough Wilbur has slept on it or even put his head on Charlotte as she doesn't care. But he doesn't like to cuddle much. Hubby says when he sees Rascal cuddling with me he doesn't know if I am sick or if the dog is. It's usually me.I put the middle part down so he could at least put his head on it. We started planting the garden. To make it easier of what varieties I am planting, I made a spread sheet. 2021 gardensI will wait another week before I plant more.Since I was starting in the gardens I reminded Hubby he needed to cut the last 5 of the 2 x 8  boxes and get the wood for the 2 boxes that would be 2x 16 for strawberries this fall. I will paint the 2 x 8 boxes (they are plyboard). He came in and said the plyboard was cut. Too windy and wet to paint but when he was rummaging around he found enough plyboard to make 4 more boxes. Okay, he has bickered with me for years about the size of the garden. So it was a shock to hear him suggest we have 4 more boxes.  THEN he added that he thought if we had the money this fall that he could build a small green house on the south side of the barn. It would be blocked from the north cold and get the south sun. Open to the east so I wouldn't have to shovel much snow if I used it during the winter. He would change the white metal roof in that area to fiberglass roof (and change the mudroom door awning to the same) that would let light come in but block the weather.I asked him why the change of mind. He said he saw that the Amish didn't go without fresh veggies and fruit during the winter. Some even had greens still growing in their green houses. He was the one that went to the store and saw the lack and the recalls.  He doesn't think this coming winter is going to be any better and he thinks we will still be helping Daughter 4 who is now in 5 days a week physical therapy. She had commented she wasn't able to handle walking her dogs one at a time and the doctor put her in therapy to rebuild her strength.I was okay, design the green house and price it out. Yes that means we won't be paying off loans or on mortgage as much. I will be crunching numbers for sure and warned him there would be a change in our life style when it came to store bought food."},

I cleared as best as I could as I still have trouble getting up and down with the hip the north flower garden. We had a zucchini noodle with Angel hair pasta with garlicy yogurt sauce that was on Sara Moulton's weeknight meals. The dish was okay... too much lemon for our taste and I cut it in half to begin with. FYI I love lemon pie and we drink lemonade. Definitely not what I would do for a weeknight meal as it took over 30 minutes to prep and took 3 pans to put the one dish together. Today after laundry and dishwasher is unloaded. I am going to spray the asparagus patch with neem oil to help keep the bugs off when its fully light  around 8 am. I will take the organic weed killer and hope this one actually works as I have weeds in the asparagus patch and the north garden that just keeps coming back. So I will do those two areas. I want to clear the rhubarb. I want to get spinach, radishes, carrots, turnips and parsnips in today or tomorrow... some lettuce in pots as it's still iffy about growing them in the garden. In pots I can bring them in to the barn or the pump house.  I might do some beets, a bit early to start them but the ground is 50 degrees.... dandelions are up and they come up when the ground is 50 degrees.Washer buzzing... to the clothes line, unload dishwasher and on to work"},

He found fresh flowers that were decent on clearance so brought them home for me. I decided to start cutting the bread with the \"meat\" slicer as Hubby just whacks it and some are thick and some too thin. I will measure the bread that M sends over and figure out how many slices I can get 3/8s or 1/2 inch thick. I might do both from same loaf as we like a thicker slice for garlic toast and French toast. We turned the furnace down to 62 several times during the week. It was warm enough and that let us get to April without having a propane delivery. I ordered propane to be delivered this week... that should give us enough to go until fall. I told Hubby I wanted to use the canning stove since it's hooked up and working now for canning this year as that is a grill propane tank. We talked to my life ins rep about paying off my life ins loan. She is crunching numbers as she knows the company that Hubby retired from is shut down now due to computer chip shortage and she doesn't want us short cashed if we have to start buying our own health ins. There has been 3 other companies in our area that their retired people are now looking for health ins. as they are not going to reopen in this area. She wanted us to see all our options. We have been using up leftovers. Freezing extra for when we work in the gardens and are too tired to eat let alone cook. Old age sucks sometimes. I finished clearing weeds out of the 2 ft by 16 ft herb bed. I have room for some annual herbs in that bed now. I cleared the pots of mints of weeds in them. Repotted into bigger pots the last of the fruit trees we got last year along with a maple tree I had started 3 yrs ago from the rental we lived in and the lilac a person was going to toss because it wasn't growing (root bound).  Cleared weeds from 6  4 ft  by 4 ft strawberry beds. Cleared weeds from the 12 ft long beds of the red raspberries, yellow raspberries and blackberries. Cleared the 3 pots of the blueberry bushes ( we have alkaline soil). I still have the chives and garlic chives patch to weed and the north flower garden.  I will start potting stuff closer to May.My garlic and Egyptian onions are doing well. Asparagus is starting to show in a few places also. I plan to be planting my cool weather crops today and tomorrow so by middle of May we will have fresh veggies without going to the store"},

She gets check tomorrow and she is hoping she goes to hospital LOL.I only saved 10%.. BUT 95% was veggies or fruit so I expected to not have much savings. I can't wait until the garden is my grocery store for fresh veggies. I used what was left of March's grocery money and most of April's. I have enough for milk and some cucumbers and the shrimp.  I did not get daffodils, they looked bad and nothing else looked good either so no fresh flowers for the Easter table again this year.I did not get chorizo (didn't have any but ordered it from Amazon), shrimp or mint Probably by time the chorizo gets here , the mint will be high enough for me to snip what I need for a dish Hubby wanted to try. Getting shrimp when I go to make the meal. I did get him Kentucky bourbon for a lemonade bourbon he wants to try ... it also has beet juice in it. I did not get ice cream since we decided to shop Kroger's in Sidney and that's over an hour away. Dairy Queen just opened so we will get our ice cream fix there.Best deal was free 6 oz Cheese. I got Havarti for HubbySecond best deal was pasta for sale for 49 cents if you got 10 items of the sale. I got the pastas for Daughter 4 as she eats a lot of pasta salads of different sorts.Everything but the different breads (slice potato bread, hamburger buns, hoagie buns, and onion buns) are dealt with. I will freeze the breads and vacuum pack them. Menu will be based on what needs used up first.I know the zucchini noodles (only because they didn't have zucchini large enough for my spiralizer) will need used, the avocados and the plantains are not ripe but when they get there, that will be used now. Bananas as M told me she dices them in cool whip and calls it done.I still have 49 entrees in the barn freezer.Tonight is manicotti from freezer that we didn't have last night. Leftover sautéed bell peppers, mushrooms and onions  and garlic toast made from M's breadThursday - sausage gravy, home fries, sunshine salad, cole slaw and biscuits. Friday - zucchini pasta with garlicy sauce and Ky. lemonade bourbon. Bruschetta. Should use the last of M's bread or can use bun.Saturday- homemade loaded pizza and salad.Easter - rack of lamp, smashed baked potatoes,  asparagus , deviled eggs and ambrosia salad.Need to prep today so the meals for this week actually get to the table.Blessed be"},

We now have 2 pallets of garden soil (156 cu ft  total) and 1 pallet of potting soil (78 cu ft total)... AND HE FORGOT THE DOG FOOD.

Might be home around lunch. I will be \"motivated\"  HA HA, to get the laundry and dishes done. Frigs cleaned out as it's also trash night. Dust mop house (new habit or should say trying to get back in the habit). Update the finances since Hubby bought dirt instead of dog food the bank acct took a bigger hit. He saved $4 a bag.

Son 2 wants the Andes candy. Son 1 wants the B vitamin. Daughter 2 wants the eye shadow. Daughter 4 wants the face mask ( her daughter wants one of the face masks also) Daughter 3 (and her 2 girls) want the hair bands. Daughter 1 asked for the dental stuff and Hubby came back and told them ALL to go read Sluggy's blog LOL. I will still share... but Son 2 is NOT getting all the Andes candy ... guess that is what I get for sending a text with pic of what I won to the kids.Last night Daughter 4 sent me a text... found 4 bedroom, 3 bath, finished basement and attic with mother in law suite... I was excited thinking she found something to move to and thought she was going to share with her oldest that is expecting a baby in a few weeks.It was a huge pot hole (so not really a house SIGH) she hit with MY car to avoid hitting a 8 yr old boy chasing his ball in the street. Mother of boy was grateful, boy is now grounded and my car was creaking as she drove it away. Appt for car is this morning to figure out the damage done. Daughter 4 took pic of pot hole and sent it to the street dept. Mother of boy put a orange cone that she carries for emergences from her truck in the hole to try to help others not hit it.Daughter said if she had been going the speed limit she would have hit him. or destroyed the front end of the car if she seen him in time to swerve . SIGHSO I woke up at 4 am with thigh cramp... got up, had coffee , walked around. Didn't ease up so went to get massager by bed, moved Rascal as he was laying next to it (on floor between bed and stand) . Picked it up , turned it on and got shocked. Blew all the electric to the bedroom, have nice burn on arm. Put aloe on burn, go to basement to turn breaker back on and open door to mechanical room (breaker, water softener, water heater and furnace room) and find water at the bottom of furnace. SIGHING STILL.Call Hubby while he is working (did 10 loads yesterday, 5-6 is normal) and he THINKS he will have a couple loads today only so will be home normal time (mid to late afternoon instead of 7 pm like last night) to deal with furnace ...said the drain pipe is probably plugged and the pan under it probably has a leak. Told me to check to make sure breakers were in on position... they ALL ARE ON >>>>> AND NOT listed what they go to.SO we will have to go through each one and find the one for the bedroom because he forgot to go down and write what went to each breaker and he doesn't know where he put the sheet the electrician gave him that had the list... I don't know why he didn't just tape the thing to the door of the breaker box. I was going to do it but he said no, we would do it together and just be on the phone so we knew what was off and on. I was going to do finances this morning but decided to wait until I see the bill to get the car fixed. So instead of paying off one of the loans I will be fixing a car. Which upsets Daughter 4 but  she knows we would rather fix a car than her hit the child as she was hit by a car... and our grandson was hit by a car....Hubby wants to finish getting the last of the dirt and stuff for the gardens before he pays off his loan. TOOK A REALLY BIG BREATH...AND started labeling the breaker box. Work 20 minutes because it's walk up and down 3 different flights of stairs as they did not put the electric in what I would call logical order. FINALLY figured out which one was the bedroom. Hubby got home and called the guy that put the electric in the house and he told him to check the first outlet the electric goes to when it comes in the room as because there was already existing electric he made circuits of the electric. WHICH made logical sense. ANYWAYS replaced the burn outlet which was not the one I had the massager plugged into. AND had electric. Savings was $45 trip charge and $60 an hour that the electrician would have charged.  We still have a few breakers not labeled that we will deal with later. Costs were a screw driver that Hubby dropped down the sump pump pit by accident and some back up outlet. $30.Daughter 4 got repair bill of $500. Said it was kind of a blessing as it messed up the ball joint but repair guy showed her the steering control  part was going bad so he took care of that also. And she's back on the road... which is good because HER DAUGHTER is thinning and dilated to 2. OB said they would see her next week if she didn't have the baby before that.Saturday we went down to drop off stuff on Daughter 4's porch for her and Granddaughter who's in laws were visiting her so she told me to drop her stuff off at her mom'. In laws were still sleeping in the front room on sofa couch when we would have been there.  Went to Son 2's and got sprayed with Lysol as I walked in. I used to do that during flu season when they came in from school. Spray them, go wash their hands and change their clothes. They didn't get the flu when they were in school. I just laughed. We sat 6 ft apart even out on the patio. Hubby and him wore masks when they were taking the old water heater out and putting the new one back in. Son 2 now can install his own gas hot water heater. We drove the scenic way home adding about 30 minutes but well worth it as it was a beautiful day. But an eleven hour day was wearing and my hip was cranky last night from all that sitting in the car.  Three and half hours round trip. We ate left overs."},

All the kids took her flowers the morning before she died. So sweet.   Son2's hot water heater went out, can't be fixed. Was quoted $3000 for new tank  , $4000 for instant ready (which is really what he needs for that area). When he said he would have to get other quotes (know he is not going to shower at home but can at work) the guy offered $1900 with 50 gallon tank. He said he wasn't doing that and told the guy to leave. He called the company and reported the difference and prices and that the guy said he had to run new venting through the roof which we know is a lie as ours is vented with the furnace just like his is and why he wasn't going to use them or refer them to anyone at the base . OOPS not good to mess with the person that helps soldiers get help. He called another one and they were coming out to look. Did tell him the instant ready heater was $1100 and they confirmed since the furnace is over 80% efficient they could be vented together like the old one is. Mean time he is thankful his Momma insisted he have a stock pot. He has used it more than he ever thought he would. Now he is boiling water for washing dishes and going to the gym at work to shower.The kitchen storm door handle broke, of course this is the door the dogs use... so that it was LOCKED. Good thing we have other doors as we couldn't get it open. Took an hour to get the handle off, mess with the latch and get the door to open. Checked 2 places to get a handle... ending up ordering at Amazon (used The Prudent Homemakers site). GEEZE.We got our first covid shot. Hubby said he was sore. I have a bruise the smaller than a dime at the site and that is the only thing sore if I touch it. BUT side affect was we both were starving... 90 minutes from home... it was definitely buy something or I would get sick so we got Wendy's. Considering he finished eating (we sat in the parking lot as he doesn't like to eat and drive) a good 15 minutes before me I would say he was hungry and didn't acknowledge. Even though we both ate before leaving home 4 hrs. before.We dropped our taxes off. Filling out the drop off forms was worse than gathering all of it up.  Our preparer was not there but another one was getting ready to go to lunch (one preparer at a time in the office) and said refunds would not be seen until summer, probably late summer. Good thing we don't ever count on it and really try to not give the gov't an interest free loan of our money.My finance guy called to let me know it was a good time to sell some stock I had. I was getting my shot and by time I could call him he was out of the office getting HIS SHOT. LOL. Got a hold of him this morning and he was dealing with it as we spoke. Said in a way it was good timing as the cash acct I have was going to be used up in 2 months...that's what I am using to support Daughter 4.He said he had just priced nursing home costs and it was running around $15000/ month. Yep Daddy's was running a bit lower but a friend out of state said his mother in law's ASSISTED living was $15000 a month and it would be higher when she went to nursing home. That is $180,000 for one person. Average in a nursing home is 3 yrs. Assistant living can be higher and then they get moved about half the time to a nursing home due to needing more care. Yep glad we decide to make it this house \"the old folks home\".Hubby told me last night he doesn't see Daughter 4 back to working full time to support herself until spring or summer of next year so to look at the budget and figure that in. It wasn't hard to do as it's my (Daddy's) IRA that is supporting her with my Social Security covering the odds and ends.Rain, cold and wind today. High winds through the night. I am NOT going out to weed strawberries or the herb gardens.Blessed Be."},

IT will take him a month to get into the primary. Daughter 4 has an appt for a MRI April 19th for her right hip. It's been hurting but she put it off. Figured she might as well get it dealt with now. She has surgery to remove ovary June 25th. The results came back that the cancer is GONE. Doctor is iffy about whether he will have her do more radiation after surgery. Did tell her that it would be 8 weeks after surgery if he does the radiation before he releases her to go to work. That puts her in the end of Sept. Means she is not going to be moving this fall like she wanted to as she has to have 3 months of work showing she brings home 3 times the rent. She is NOT A HAPPY CAMPER. He did put her in physical therapy to help her recover. She is to the point she isn't even able to walk her dogs and the kids have been helping her in that. Due to Honda suspending production due to lack of computer chips, her earnings at Door Dash also went down. Granddaughter's man said he had to pick up working 7 days a week to make the same he did at 4 days a week to cover their bills as granddaughter is off work due to problems with her pregnancy, having some issues with sugar just like her momma did with her.It was a nice day yesterday so I decided to clear four garden boxes and put the preen and green in them in south gardens to prep for spring planting in a week or so (snow expected Easter Monday). Yeah , well , I did 21 garden boxes that are 2 ft by 8 ft.  Did not have to really bend over, used a garden rack to smooth the dirt. Some are going to need to be refilled. I helped Hubby transplant 3 of the fruit trees to bigger pots , we have 3 more to do.  When I came in and sat down to drink some water before fixing supper I realized I had over did it. SIGH. The whole body ached and I was worn out. We had steaks off the grill, baked sweet potato, pickled beets and applesauce. I took Bayer back and body before bed. Achy a bit through the night but better.Hubby found these greens growing in north garden, red mustard can't really be seen, kale, frisse lettuce etc. growing again in the north garden. He had tossed some old seed 2 years go out in the area thinking the birds would eat it. It was actually rotor tilled last year in the spring. Daughter 4 got fresh greens every time I saw her. Sent this picture and she laughed. I still have 2 boxes of herbs to clean up in south gardens. Sage is doing good already. I have 6 4ft x 4ft boxes of strawberries to weed. I was going to transplant them but Amish guy who stopped to see Hubby said to let it go until fall and then only transplant the runners. I would get a better batch of strawberries the following year as strawberries drop in production every 2 to 3 yrs and it's the runners that produce after that. Told me to say something to him or his wife and they would \"guide \" me to transplanting in the fall. They sell berries a lot during the summer.I think I will go take a nap as I've been up since 2 thanks to Charlotte barking at a bunny. Covid vaccine today ... Blessed Be"},

He called to make an appt and they asked if he could be there in an hour... they are 40 minutes away. So off he went. Son2 spent last night sick, got up this morning  (to a broken water heater and repair man comes tomorrow)and decided to go to Urgent care since he was just around a friend that is looking at having surgery at the end of the week. Urgent care thinks tummy bug (welcome son2, you got it from me with texts) BUT his heart reading were not right so they sent him to the ER. SO I am sitting here waiting to see if they are going to keep him or send him home because of course he texted me right after Hubby left.Daughter 4 is still waiting for date of surgery , they said they would call more likely in April as they want her to rebuild some strength before surgery. Her cancer doctor has now put her in physical therapy. She is also waiting for a MRI to be scheduled for her hip as it is hurting horribly.Honda laid off workers again and with that lay off over 75 % of door dash orders dropped. SO Daughter 4 isn't getting much door dash. Daughter 2 said her income took a hit as she works at a bar and Son 1 that works and lives close to a Honda plant said pretty much all the businesses have seen the same hit as when we went on lock down last spring. BAD BAD BAD.Daughter 1 and 3 are doing okay and their income is still steady. IF Son2 ends up off work he is going to be in a tight squeeze but okay. He said better to find issue now than AFTER retirement.MEANTIME, Hubby and I decided to work out a possible schedule for this summer to get some of these projects off the punch list. I will be working on that today along with clearing 2 garden boxes and a bit of weeding in one of the strawberry boxes. Stay strongBlessed be"},

BRAT.Our local little store that also sells cooked lunch special is back open after a year. She's had it hard as she was also fighting cancer a second time. She had to increase her lunch prices. No one batted an eye over it and told Hubby when he stopped and got a snack for the road that she sold 50 dinners (totally out) of meatloaf and had to go take the sign down as the meals were all call ins for pick up. Said if she could have 3 months of selling 75 % of her lunches she would make a good dent on the loss she had. We will be trying to do at least once a week if not twice to help her. We have a busy week ahead. Hubby is now answering calls with \" hectic for the week\". Seem like everyone was wanting him to driving them to Holmes co.Monday we were supposed to be having taxes done. We got a call that the appt was canceled and it would be drop off only. So we are dropping them off on Tuesday and not making a special trip just to drop off.SO instead of taxes on  Monday Hubby is calling to see if he can get in for his physical for the business. It's usually just walk in but they haven't always had someone in the office he goes into for it.Tuesday we will drop off taxes and get our covid (Moderna) shots. First round. We have been checking and not seeing anything available near a hospital in case I have a reaction (has happened). I said something to my ortho doctor (which is not in my county) and he told me to watch the hospital scheduling he in with. I had checked yesterday morning... nothing open... checked yesterday afternoon and 4 appts were open. We grabbed 2. Wed and Thurs. are full days for Hubby to haul. It's supposed to be decent temps so I figure to be in the gardens cleaning up from winter. Suppose to SNOW again following Monday.Friday is still open. If he doesn't haul anything we might go get the supplies for the gardens. He said except going to an auction or something he won't be doing much work with the business on Saturdays. I will not hold my breathe on that as he will get to thinking about the slow time through the summer and haul anyways.I ordered 2 of this type of planters through Brandy The Prudent Homemaker's Amazon link. I got one in lime green (or it looks that way) and one in purple for the deck. I also got 2 of 30 inch tall rectangle shaped black planters to put at the front steps of the porch. I need some roll saucers for some of the other pots to keep the deck from getting ruined.I have noticed that when the temperature is going down, the screw in my pelvic holding the hip socket in place aches. When the temperature is going up, the hacked off thigh bone (where they cut the ball off the bone and replaced it) aches. Blessed be"},

He ripped her as no one, no one including family comes between him and this friend. She wouldn't marry him when they were kids because she couldn't handle military life. He is not in love with her, but they will always love each other.  The friendship with the other, probably will not recover unless she grovels.Daughter 4 is fighting the tummy bug (no news of when surgery is).... I must have gave it to her through texting. She had a friend from high school that she has stayed close to start dating a guy Daughter 4 put in jail for threatening her, he is on probation over it (got 5 yrs probation as he is an ex cop). THEN girlfriend had the nerve (had to be a lack of brains) to ask Daughter 4 if they could stay there a week so they could be together. NO. Then she asked for money to get a motel room for the week (He lives in OH she lives in KY) NO, Daughter 4 told her that would be giving her the money from ME that is paying her bills... girlfriend threatened to have boyfriend attack Daughter 4 until she gave them the money. Daughter 4 called cops, boyfriend called his PO when his brother saw what was texted. AND girlfriend is  without a friend and a boyfriend and sitting in jail. When Daughter 4 gets over the anger she will have a broken heart as this friend has stood with her through a lot. I got so mad I actually shook. I wanted to punch.Hubby mentioned he was getting some weird political messages from a joint friend and asked if there was something going on. Then I got an email with a raging rant and a lot of political lies from him. I got a hold of a friend that lives near him to have them go check with his family as this is not normal for him. His family said he has been banned by Facebook, had the church talk to him and even tell him that he is not going to start his spew during church services. His wife is in denial that he needs help but his daughters did get him in to his doctor and found his sugar was over 300 and had been for a couple months. He has dementia and they (both daughters nurses) feel it Alzheimer's due to becoming aggressive. Both of us told the daughters if they need some thing more than the prayers we are giving to let us know. They asked us to let others know he is having medical problems. His older daughter told me she removed all women's contacts from his email because it seems he is more violent towards women. Since he is in Alabama and we are in Ohio, the threat is only going to be verbal. His knee and hip won't let him drive over an hour due to pain.Hubby and I sat down and after talking over the \"end a friendship day\" we talked about the stimulus.I have been crunching numbers off and on all day and had 4 plans we could take. We decided on plan 4 (which gave me the shakes also).Plan 1...put it in savings which isn't earning all that muchPlan 2 split it between bills, gardens and savingsPlan 3 put back for front porch.Plan 4 take stimulus and half the savings and pay off life ins loans, the medical bills from my surgery and the gardens now.It's not like we don't have access to more income. Either of us to make a phone call and have money pulled from our IRAs.  Both of us get social security. But going down that low in savings triggered all the times we paid something off and then needed money and couldn't get it.But reality is  we pay more in interest than we earn in savings so we will be saving money.  We can take April to reboot savings and start paying on mortgage in May. DEPENDING ON TAXES...We will find that out on Monday.Since I was doing finances I called the propane company and the manager crunched numbers for me  figured we would have 1 more fill before next heating season and told me to order half of what I ordered last year as he could see I was going to have a large credit this year even with the winter we had. That's over $1000 less out go. YEAH!!! that means the air barrier has really worked as that is down 2 tanks of propane a year.I put in to transfer the money, did the laundry and have it on the drying racks and kicked on the dish washer. Is it nap time yet?Figuring out what I am planting is next on the to do list.Blessed be"},

We hope to finish the original plans this year so after this it's maintain or update.We bartered asparagus plants (we are ran over with a 4 x 100 ft patch) with L and A for 5 gallons of beet this coming fall. We bartered asparagus plants and 2 prayer bushes starts (red twig dogwood Amish call pray bushes)with H and M for repair Son 2 dresser.We ran errands before going to chiropractic. We dropped off deposit for E at the bank, then picked up 50 lbs of flour for M. Then went to Menards to get oak veneer, adhesive and stain for Son2 dresser. I got small bags of inoculant as my order isn't going to come in like they thought. I went through the patio section and saw 2 chair cushions for kitchen porch and a canopy with mosquito netting for the deck at French doors like what we were trying to find 3 yrs ago when we bought this home. We crunched numbers with the 11% rebate and decided with it already on sale and the canopy on clearance we could do it. SO we got that. The old cushions will go to the deck for the metal chairs we have there.Blessings"},

E stopped in the middle of the road and asked what I thought I was doing as I had just had my hip replaced.  I just laughed.We get comments all the time from the Amish about what work we do. We used to get it from the Englishers we lived around also. We are in our 60s not 80s LOL.Yes we dig post hole manually though Hubby will sometimes go get the tractor and digger if it is more than 2 holes. Yes we climb of roofs, ladders for spouting issues, move limbs, etc. We both know when you stop doing the work, you stop being able to do the work as you are not moving those muscles. My parents always worked . Mom until she got cancer and we lost her, pop until the dementia won, Daddy until he literally could not walk any more. All were in their 80s. Hubby's parents retired at 68, bought a one floor home (they don't use the basement) and sat down to \"enjoy\" retirement. Now they can't walk up and down stairs, can't get in a tub, and both need to have surgery but because they didn't lower what they were eating while just sitting they have to lose a lot of weight to have surgery. Both weigh over 300 lbs. SO we will keep working, keep moving and keep walking the stairs like my parents. Handle the finances like Daddy.... The better your health the cheaper the cost of medical during the elderly years.How are you preparing for the elderly years?"},

She get blood work done Wednesday and see the doctor on Friday ( 12th) to discuss results from scan and what surgery ( just ovary removed or all removed) she will be having. She is coming up Monday to get some stuff I have for her and baby Lizzie... not sure if granddaughter will feel up to the ride. She caught the same stomach bug I had... SIGH.We signed closing on this home 3 yrs ago today.First one is what was taken for the realtor to advertise, the second one in 2019 when we got the fence up.We have 117.5 things left on the punch list.We have 26 years left on the mortgage. We have been paying extra on the mortgage so we got it down an extra year but as of yesterday we decided to \"take the hit\"LORD BE WITH US as it's going to be squeaky tight around here.We decided that starting June 1st  that ALL of our social security  and my IRA income from Daddy's to go to the mortgage. These are 3 incomes we never counted on when planning our retirement. I didn't think Daddy would out live his income let alone that he had that much income and we never counted on Social Security to be there when we did retire.Hubby is going to put back what he was short this year during the pandemic ... how many of us started a brand new business in a brand new area in a pandemic??? ALONG with buying 2 new trailers and a new truck and all the costs of driving numbers (DOT AND MC #) and business start up with legal stuff SIGH and run it 9 months instead of 12.  I am surprised he was only short $150/ month.  and that included buying 2 sets of tires for trailers and 3 sets for truck. He now puts semi tires that hold up a lot better on the truck. He needs a third more to have what he needs and since I just did the business bills I know he can pretty much get that this month. He went back to work Saturday. THANK HEAVENS as he was starting to bug me by watching me. Our loan officer suggested using this site to see how extra payments would affect the loan https://www.daveramsey.com/mortgage-payoff-calculatorSO I put  the amounts in  started with just the extra payment, added my social security, then my IRA and then Hubby said add his social security.Original date of pay off was April 1st 2048.We have already cut a year off that so April 1 2047.By starting June 1st 2021 and paying all the extra amounts...both social securities , extra payment in budget and my IRA....Pay off date would be Sept 1st 2024 and last payment $87.42. ..Kids are backing us on this which helps. Got to get around for physical therapy... yep should be able to handle a mild work out LOL"},

Must have had an ice dam inside it as there was nothing in the spouting.Hubby checked the level of the propane. Hubby went to ACE and got Preen and Green (or something like that) using a coupon that was getting ready to expire saving 20%. He also stopped and got dog food at TSC that was $1 off a bag.Hubby stopped at L and A to ask if they wanted to dig some of our asparagus plants up and they are getting to crowded here. We don't want anything for them but since they won't take them for free we offered to take beets. LOLE said maple water (aka sap) is running on the south side of trees but not the north. That side is still froze. He is okay with that as he got ran over last year and was having to empty bags 4 times a day and still had some over filled. Said M got her bulk canning lids and more jars. She also got her seeds in.I updated my \"sitting\" to do list. I started out with 43 when I went to surgery 3 wks ago (wow has it been that long?) and I am down to 21.I listed what seeds I have as I am going to try for a 3 seasons garden. Daughter 4 was given pallets for garden beds by her daughter's man.... the 3 of them are going to be working at getting it together when it gets a bit warmer. I told her I could give her some seeds but not plants as I didn't grow any.Yesterday I cut a chuck roast up, part went to cubes in freezer for a small batch of beef stew as I know being March in Ohio means we will get another cold spell. I roasted the rest and added 2 potatoes, 2 carrots and 1 onion for our supper... I actually ate yesterday , the last of the pizza rolls (gift from Son 2) for lunch and half what was on my plate of the beef roast and veggies. Leftover beef roast with the \"broth\" will be put in freezer for beef and noodles later. Noodles are already made and in pantry. I haveDaughter 4 is picking up Door Dash. Not getting much as she is only working a couple days a week. Her daughter is now riding with her so they split the money. Gives granddaughter practice time of driving (she was in a car accident so stopped getting her license and has a temp.) and daughter time out of the house so the 5 dogs can adjust to her not being home again. We figured out she needs to earn $15/ hr for 36 hrs to make ends meet without any payments of paying us back. That helps her when she is searching for jobs to know that if she gets something less than that she will have to cut her budget or get a second job.This year it's focus on just getting her well and back up on her feet. I don't see work that she will be able to do at first (she can't lift or pull) or work full time going straight back to work. She had done home health care but gets too attached. Not good with her own issues. She also had a friend who has always been self employed ,look over her taxes before she filed them... she had made a $1000 mistake (forgot to deduct her expenses as she is self employed with door dash). I am thankful that the friend caught it. As that lowered the what was owed.I haven't been zeroing out the checking when the month's income comes in. I have been putting some on the loans and mortgage , a bit in savings but have left some sitting for IN CASE... in case one of the kids/grandkids need something or Hubby doesn't make enough to cover business bills or something is needed on the house. Taxes and hospital bills this month which the hospital did tell me it could be end of March beginning of Jan before I see that bill.How is your spring looking?Blessed be"},
{"title": "Over a year of stay at home", "date": "Saturday, March 6, 2021", "text": "We are looking at pretty much still being staying at home until June at least. I miss the kids, the grandkids, the great grandkids, Hubby's parents and my brother... but reality is they take too many chances of getting covid that I am not willing to risk getting around them much. So I will be wearing a mask probably for the rest of this year. I am okay with that. Hubby's sister in law has lung damage from Covid, my own sister in law does also. Both thought they were being safe enough but did not acknowledge that the \"bubble\" of their group was more than they thought. Example, daughter 2's bubble is her man, their 5 boys. Those 5 boys have other parents and siblings. Those other parents have their bubbles of family and those kids have \"girlfriends/ boyfriends/ hang out friends... and they all came down with covid. My daughter put out on FB \"to all my family and friends except Mom and Dad, we have covid. Why? because even the one time we were there I insisted we all wear our masks and we did a drop off and leave. We sprayed our clothes with Lysol before getting in the car. Washed our hands with hand sanitizer and put the masks in a plastic sandwich bag , sealed it and then resanitizered our hands. Maybe extreme but she didn't worry about us getting it.Our supplies are low in some areas of non food but not wiped out. I can tell we have ate at home more as I am low on dishwasher soap.I should have 8 bottles (we were averaging 1 bottle a month precovid) and I have 4. I have 1 bag of peas, one bag of peas and carrots, no broccoli or cauliflower. That's okay. I have plenty of green tomato slices and asparagus (which will be in within 2 months) instead. Green beans and regular beets are low. I might not need as much flour as M asked if she could bake a loaf of bread every 7-10 days for us instead of me baking as their chickens are still not laying much more than what they used. Even though we have said she does not need to ,she insists on doing it because we let them harvest ice out of the pond. I do pray we can open businesses safely. I know half of the kids and almost all of the grandkids are struggling to make ends meet. Hubby worked for the first time since my surgery. He hauled 3 loads of horses to an auction about 15 miles away starting at 4:30 this morning with 9 stops to get all the horses.  Came in, sat down, took a nap and woke with the chills. Said he was glad he not only lysoled his truck, he lysoled himself before he came in.I'm like STAY AWAY FROM ME LOL. We aren't even eating together due to it and Lysol is our companion LOL. Heavens I am not over it yet and don't need a second round. Doc's nurse had it two weeks ago, said you are contagious first 48 hrs but you will not feel back to your normal self for a good week, possibly longer since I just had surgery. SIGH. Last night I slept ALL NIGHT. A good 9 hrs. I have learned how to ditch a throw blanket, pillow for the leg and haul butt to the bathroom. I can tell you the new hip is not happy sitting any length of time on the toilet, less happy than the old one that was used to me sleeping on the toilet during crohn's attacks.Charlotte will always take my pillow while I am in the bathroom and she does not care if I lay my head on her when I come back. I was hungry today... shock... had a sweet roll Hubby had baked, a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a handful of potato chips. That is the most I have ate since this crap hit. Hubby had 4 sweet rolls, a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. He's not sure if he will feel up to eating when he gets back as he just got a phone call that a horse needed transported for one of the Amish he transported this morning. IF he does it could be chili, his go to when the few and far between times he gets sick.I did the laundry, let dogs out and in a million times. Sunshine but cold. Wilbur wanted to stay out and lay in sunshine but it was just too cold for his old bones.  Rascal wanders around the house to find sunshine he can lay it. Charlotte is going out and then back in every time we turn around. Hubby took recycling in... they asked if we were recycling everything as there wasn't much. Actually after  full month it was next to nothing. Hubby said he could have put it in an old clothes basket.I wrote out addresses for Daughter 4 as they are doing a welcome home Lizzie party when Lizzie is born. I sorted more recipes. Have one more batch to do.I worked a little (very little ) on planning the gardens for this year. I PUT MY THIN DRESS SOCK ON MY FOOT.!!!!!!! Which also means I can wash my own foot. Hubby is very thankful for that goal being meet.I am still working on walking up and down stairs and doing frog legs aka butterfly stretches and balance on one foot with eyes closed.Time for Charlotte to go back out LOLBlessed Be"},

We have about a half of dozen on the same ball as Charlotte will take them and hide them from him. She plays a little with them... good at going to get the ball, not at bringing it back like Rascal does. Playing ball is not something Wilbur does. Probably because the grandsons didn't want him taking their ball as they practiced baseball when he lived with them.Charlotte sleeps in this position a lot. Definitely feels safe.I am bored... weather is nicer, snow mostly melted, mid 40s to high 50s all this coming week and I can't get in the gardens. SIGH... yes I know we will have more snow and cold before the end of March. We usually get 4 inches of snow in March in this area... so it's not like I am going to be doing much even if Hubby would let me off the leash (HA HA). I still have 20 things of sitting work to do... just tired of sitting.I have cerebral palsy, pain meds cause it to flare up causing me to lose my balance and struggle to control my movements. Surgery were they move nerves only makes it worse. I am on B vitamin ( B6 is the one they said to use if I didn't want to take a complex B) at night time. Things are improving slowly. I still have no  desire to eat. I am underweight from where my GI wants me as I always lose 20 lbs during a crohn's attack and it's seems like forever to gain in back. If I had an attack now I would drop under 90 lbs... not good.I am not sleeping well.Which means Charlotte is also up with me ... then it becomes I wake her up, she wakes me up cycle. Negative of living with an open floor plan that I can't get up and walk around (nor her) without waking Hubby or Rascal and Wilbur up also. Naps are a regular need now. THOUGH I don't nap no matter how tired after 3 pm.I am bored.... LOL Whine whine whine.... Looks pretty out but I can see the windmill is facing north west and moving pretty good so that's a cold wind that I am not going out in. Going to go find something to do off the sitting list."},

Got the first bill today.We KNOW we need to install 3 more garden beds (2 for strawberries and 1 for veggies) We need dirt to transplant fruit trees to bigger pots (got the pots). I want some window boxes or pots for stuff also... I need to go walk the field for more rocks for the \"rock\" garden at the dining room windows freebie as it's OUR field.We will be going to Kroger's for fresh produce since we will have a 3 hr wait between my first appt and our second appt tomorrow. Taking a cooler with us. MEANTIME... I would like the nerves in my leg to quit feeling like something is pinching them AND I would like to put my own sock on my own foot... I can take the sock off . I am taking my pain meds with me tomorrow because I figure about the surgeon does his thing and then I go through PT I will be in pain before I get home 90 min later.What do you have plan for this month?Blessed be I finished shelling the small red beansThe small red beans did very well this year. Baby lima, dark red kidney, navy and Cherokee Trail of tears weren't not as good. There are 4 more varieties to shell. I had 9 varieties.I have 21 more \"sitting work\" on my to do list to cover the next 5 weeks that I am still doing PT. That's 4.2 things a week and right now the day after PT is NOTHING getting done except me hobbling around whining after a night of only 2 hrs sleep. I have asked the kids for cheese and bread sticks but Hubby was the one that got me cheesy bread sticks LOL.He bought calzones and cheese bread sticks...not sure if that was to stop the whining or because he was tired of reheating stuff after HIS WHINING. He also came home with Arby's but that was because he was running about 2 hrs later than planned and didn't thaw anything for that day. He has been making sure he has something out the night before for right now. We pull out of the punch list. There is 8 things needing done, 6 of them are outside and will depending on the weather.Hubby goes back to work starting Saturday. I am more than ready to have him out of the house during the day"},
{"title": "I am alive", "date": "Wednesday, February 24, 2021", "text": "YES I know SHOES LOL.The physical therapy hurts worse than the reason I had the surgery or even the surgery. Recovering well from surgery, they said that I tested as if I was pushing 4 weeks out instead of just 1... Cerebral Palsy is raging like a gas fueled bon fire. SO a lot of the therapy is for the cerebral palsy. They wanted me to stand feet together on a soft squishy mat with my eyes closed to balance... I looked the guy right in the eye and told him if he could justify when I would ever stand that way I would do so. He mentioned getting out of bed in middle of night and stepping on  dog bed. His dog bed is squishy LOL. I did it... didn't do well with my eyes closed but okay with them open. It is more of a test of a certain spine issue that affects balance... then I told him my L5 is a triangle, spine does a cork screw before a nice S curve. Not sure if he will have me practicing that again. I am walking without walker and part of the time without the cane. I did the bike thing. Best part as far as I was concerned was the leg massage, both legs. Hubby is getting tired of running the house... He already is tired cooking which is really just reheating and he acknowledges it. Is tired of opening and closing curtains, doing laundry *I did suggest using the dryer* But he is hanging clothes to dry. He did say he was surprised when I was to test( advised by PT) going on our stairs that I took 4 steps and then came back up and said \"same time next week\". I was not stable enough to do that for sure. Tired of figuring out what to fix for meals (so I am making suggestions of 2 and letting him chose). He is tired of explaining to 1 certain person he will not be back to work until after March 6th. M came over to check if I needed anything (bread and pie tomorrow) and I asked her to mention to E that this one was calling daily. E let me know last night when he came over to check on me(hadn't seen the dogs out so was a bit worried if something was going on with the dogs) and he knew Hubby went to town for odds and ends, E had talked to the guy. Hubby mentioned today the guy had not called. The driving me to PT and waiting isn't bothering him as much as that he does with work. He did say he got some of his paperwork caught up, redid some of his finances also and refigured what he was going to have to charge. He already has Tuesday and Friday morning lined up starting mid March (my pt is Tuesday and Friday afternoons)  He has Wed and Thursday line up also. Monday is a floater, there is a guy that sometimes needs to go get supplies and he tries for Monday since Hubby doesn't have much on that day. He is okay with morning or afternoons. I went through the one file cabinet. It is now decluttered and organized. Tomorrow will be the next one.I paid March bills that was in, made extra payment on the two loans on life ins and the mortgage. I got the confirmation of getting SS on second Wed of the month starting next month just under $1000 after I had taxes taken out. I think that was the 3rd time I got the notice.I ordered LL Bean boots, their gore tex boot on sale as I wore out 2 pairs of boots since moving here that actually costed more together than if I had just ordered the LL bean boots to begin with. I spent the money with what I know will hold up. I have ordered 2 pairs of crocs for the garden. I will need a new pair of muck boots as Hubby tried to repair mine and it won't stay fixed. E said they are just starting to come in to the TSC so I will have to go there to try them on. Snow is melting and starting a muddy mess for the dogs to track in and out. Another frustration to Hubby. Wilbur has taken to walking by my side, Rascal is now getting up on the bed and sleeping next to me. When Rascal sleeps on the bed Charlotte will sleep down on the end and leave my legs alone. She is a leg snuggler and been a battle for her and me. She has gotten so she lightly paws my leg and if I can adjust for her to lay down I do but if I can't a pull her to me to sleep tucked into me. I told Hubby I need to draw my garden plans. April 2nd is the last spring date to plant peas. LOLHow is everyone and everything in your neck of the woods?Blessed Be"},

His scheduler has been informed she is to block Tuesdays for surgeries and follow ups for surgeries. If they mess it up again they are fired as there was no excuse for my follow up to be 2 months later. He filed complaint against anesthesiologist for not reading my file (he skimmed it) and giving me fentanyl when my chart says it doesn't work for me (actually specifies that a double shot of whiskey does more for me) and gave it to me anyways. Pain blocks do not work for me so that is another thing to go in my chart we did not .know.Doc think that comes from the CP since it's a nerve block.Nurse that got me up the first time. I told her I was going to pass out and she tried to get me to step back to the bed... I said no put your leg behind me and I slide to floor down her leg and sat down. They don't have the rule that a nurse should have a belt on the patient even though Phys. therapy has pushed for it. I will be giving that in writing to the hospital as the nurse was smaller than me and could not hold me up. She did not argue with me when I told her to put her leg behind me. They wanted to call it an assisted fall, and her and I both specified I did NOT fall I sat down. Then I showed them with another nurse. They were shocked that all the one scheduled for surgery showed up. About half the nurses couldn't get in. Hubby will start plowing at 5:30 in the morning for 2 1/2 hrs to get to the road so you can go to surgery and then drive another 2 hrs to get you to surgery.I know of at least 3 times he had to get the truck to pull the tractor out where he got it stuck. Going to the bathroom with a walker is annoying. Daughter 3 who has been on a walker for 3 months backed this.Trying to wipe with a bum hip is more than annoying.You can lift with 1 hand a 95 lb boxer when he accidently steps on your bad hip trying to snuggle to you in bed. No damage done unless you want to count Hubby's heart going into his throat when I yelled get off my hip.Rascal took on Charlotte over getting to snuggle to me since she was \"hogging\" the snuggle area. He won, he usually backs down. He is not much of a fighter.I still can not get out or in bed by my self.I can't take the muscle relaxer as it turns my stomach. So Hubby cut it in 4ths and I can take it with carbs. I have my standard pain meds so that's not an issue but I can take Bayer back and body (same dosage of the aspirin they gave me) and an Aleve and it does as good as the pain meds and doesn't trigger my crohn's.I just want to sleep, potty, drink something and potty again and then sleep. No appetite at all... SO eating soup and crackers.M came over yesterday because she hadn't seen the truck out (it usually sits in front of the house) and E told her we were home as he saw the dogs being let in. She brought over a loaf of bread (figured I would need it to help with pain meds) and  Lemon pie as she knew it was my favorite.  This afternoon is my first Outpatient therapy. When they \"tested\" me in the hospital they thought I was doing well considering they gave me too much pain meds during surgery and I didn't come out of it until the next day. My cerebral palsy is flaring big time. I had the nurse laughing because I kept saying put your leg down (had foot on toes) and then glanced to her and told her I constantly have to tell Rascal to put his leg down when he starts walking 3 legged."},

LOLHamburgers with homemade rolls, asparagus, and sweet potato and peaches.Strip steak and huge salad...we were going to put the steak on the salad but decide to just eat it on it's own plate. I put apples in the salad for our fruit.Meatloaf , hassleback potatoes, carrots , and raspberry pie filling on sponge cake with cool whip.Big egg... leftover ham and potatoes tossed in skillet with beaten eggs poured on top. AKA Frittata  but Hubby's family has always called it a big egg.Cream of mushroom soup HOMEMADE. As that is the only way Hubby will make itFrench toast with baconWhat ever we could find in the frig day .ORTHO doc said if I didn't want to go out in this weather ... it was okay we could postpone it... Hubby was like we will leave early and get there driving main routes not secondary like we did yesterday to \"clean up the mess \" of what wasn't done before surgery. Took us 2 1/2 hrs. for a 1 1/2 hr.  drive yesterday. BUT coming home the main highways it took 1 1/2 hrs. First....ORTHO forgot to get my primary doctor's release in early Jan when I had seen him so I had to go back to see him. Second they forgot to fax the forms to primary so I had to GO GET THEM , take them to the doctor , then take them back to ORTHO.Hospital forgot to send results of bloodwork and EKG to Primary so they had to call for that. My BP was so high they ran another EKG. Doc said it is most likely stress of the drive (saw a person do a 360 in the middle of the highway when they hit an icy patch) and the mess that was caused by people not doing their job. I now have the main person of the ORTHO private phone number  Doc  CAUGHT they(ORTHO) had forgot to have me sign a paper with witness in ORTHO office... so back track to deal with that.Went to the hospital as they had changed my surgery time but didn't leave the time to be there... ORTHO DOC changed it to later to give me more time for roads to be cleared and then wanted me to know it was okay if I postponed, he had even gotten a statement from my ins acknowledging the surgery might be postponed due to weather and they would extend the time frame for me.  Ortho office ordered codeine for my pain med instead of the pain med that is listed in my records ...it's on my RECORD I don't take that. SO office head called CVS to stop it from being filled. CVS had already rejected the order (GOOD JOB CVS)  and they ordered what was listed.Ortho made it clear if I didn't have surgery to use the pain meds now to help me get to the surgery.ORTHO forgot to schedule the date in 2 wks to remove sutures. SO today BEFORE surgery I will have to bring that up AGAIN and make sure I have it before leaving hospital tomorrow...I am supposed to spend the night... might be two or even three as Ortho doc noted to hospital of another weather storm coming through on Thursday. MEAN TIMEhouse is cleaned, paths for me to walk with walker are clear, main dishes are in freezer and I even brought up 2 wks of veggies and fruit from the pantry and put them on the counter. Have some dessert stuff if Hubby gets the urge to bake. Brought up 2 cups of 5 different rice, instant mashed potatoes and told Hubby he would have to go down for fresh potatoes and pasta and pasta sauce if needed. I haven't slept more than 3 hrs at one time due to pain that has now cranked up to a 10.Surgery is at 12:30. Hubby is plowing the driveway so we can get out (got 10 inches and then 35 mph winds) right now (it's 5:37 am). We will leave at 8 to get there by 10. I have a caffeine headache, am dehydrated and am starving which is weird as I am NEVER hungry in the mornings. I probably won't be back on until Wed night or even later if they hold me to Friday.SO READY TO GET THIS DONE>"},
{"title": "waste not want not Wednesday ", "date": "Wednesday, February 10, 2021", "text": "should be whacked out Wednesday LOL.Late last night I got a call from my primary doctor that they still had not gotten the form from the Ortho doctor they needed to fill out to release me.... since it's been almost 3 months since they were supposed to get it (the day after I saw my primary) they would need to see me. Doc is giving up his lunch to see me on Monday the day before surgery as the only other time he had open was when Hubby was working and I am not driving myself for 180 minutes. Learned that lesson already. I called Ortho office and they thought they had but then found the form still in my file so was suppose to do it immediately. Doc's head nurse AKA his wife was going to call them if she didn't get it by 5 last night. I still have 21 things on my to do list that I want done by Monday. BUT I have all the food in the freezers for meals. I would to put some pie crusts (not rolled) and hamburger buns into the freezer if I get to it. I think I would like some vegetable beef chunks soup afterwards also. Maybe beef stew... IT'S FREAKING COLD HERE. Our high yesterday was lower than the low for the state capital here in Ohio. Hubby said we have been getting about 1-1 1/2 inches of snow daily with the snow showers.On the good side of being cold  as E, his brother M and his BIL J have been clearing the pond daily to keep the snow off (snow makes the ice mushy)He thinks they will cut tomorrow. As today everyone is cutting wood for the 4 schools.Hubby made the comment they best be making sure their WIVES have cut wood before this polar vortex hits.We had an Amish guy come borrow our generator, his Englisher that cuts the horns on his cattle couldn't get his generator to start. So Hubby lent him ours with the understanding if we lost electric he was coming after it. They brought it back last night and had the guys generator in the back of the truck. Hubby looked at it and mentioned it had 2 GFI outlets. Used his keyto push the reset button to reset them and the generator started up. Englisher was embarrassed and the Amish got a chuckle.The electric bill was down $10 below budget but I am having to use the dryer for furniture throws and bedding (less dog hair after surgery) so it's going to go up. I have my mid calf dresses along with sweaters ( along with long johns and knee high socks LOL)already picked out for after surgery, wearing some of it this week to make sure they fit and I am comfortable in them. Dug into to my stock up for a pair of slippers that fit snug without socks in case Hubby leaves before I get out of bed and I have to go sockless because I am NOT stretching out my socks with the sock helper. Memo to myself I can not use either walker to dry clothes on as I have one in the bathroom for helping get off the toilet and one for me to use. SO laundry will be done mine in morning and Hubby's at night or something like that.Today I am in the basement cleaning... that's 5 things off the to do listThursday I will be in the east and west lofts . It's going to be warmer (HA HA by 3 degrees) and there is low heat in those areas. That's another 4. That will leave the main floor to do last and any additional food prep I want to do.M has asked I send over what I want her to bake for us ... I know a loaf of bread but I think I will also ask for cookies or a sweet of her choice .I will take that note over to her on Monday so she can think about what and when it fits for her. At this point I would walk out the door right now and go have surgery."},

I told him I would remind him when we got to the hospital...give him something to do while he waits hours on me.Saturday we ate left overs and Sunday we had refried beans with cheese with tortilla chips.  We are eating the left over refried beans as casserole tonight.I made, rolled and dehydrate almost 6 lbs. of noodles. Today I am making pie crust... a chicken pot pie for the freezer, a Dutch apple pie for now and a couple single and 1 double crusts for later. I also need to make bread and rolls.North and south loft and their stairs in on the cleaning list for today. I have a teleconference with SS today. The only thing they need is my checking acct info. All the rest is done unless they find something... don't they always find something???Daughter 4 is counting down to her grandbaby is due... 10 weeks. AND if she isn't working yet she plans to come up and help plant the gardens also.I found these from that were daughter 4's when she was born. Now washed and packed up for her grandbabyNot that she'll use blankets much with baby in April but she can keep them instead of me. I have a couple things that was Son2's that he told me to pass to Army Grandson when they start their family as Son2 doesn't have kids. My SIL has lung damage from covid. She already suffers from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (aka pots) and has a pace maker. She has a host of doctor appts that brother and the kids are taking her too. Brother has his own medical problems. He was worried about bankrupting her if he went in to the nursing home (he is 70 and she is 49) Now she is worried about bankrupting him. She did listen to me when I told her to get a home that they could stay in that was ADA for wheelchairs. SO they could stay put as long as they can have someone come in and care for them. Which is cheaper than the nursing home of $9000 a month. That is the cheapest in this area. The county home that takes Medicare has a 3 yr waiting list. I best get to making it happen LOLBlessed Be"},

PLUS  I brought up the fear she is dealing with triggering her PTSD and bipolar, she brought it up to her doctor... or I should say she showed him my text. Then her Lupus doctor chimed in that it could trigger her lupus to flare up when she's had in under control. It's starting to flare now with her off all medication. She is handling all the stress by taking her 5 dogs outside to play in the snow several times a day. Son 2 dropped off a couple yoga dvd's he had for her. As her doctor will not release her to work with weights or walk in her steel toe shoes but told her she could do some relaxing yoga. She earned enough extra money being taxi to some elderly to buy  a crib and some sheets for her grandbaby. She is also now getting her dog food for a huge discount thanks to the vet that she takes the dogs to. She is planning on having a baby shower for her daughter in March.

Dogs were pacing a lot during the night and had both of us up and down. We are expecting freezing rain next or a wintery mix. I really don't want the freezing rain. We decided against plowing or shoveling until after the system passes. Saved 50% on seeds. I have had 3 places I had ordered last year that couldn't fill my orders sent me discounts. I focused on things I can plant for fall crop.Moved some things around in my IRA and made over $20,000 in 6 wks. Knowing how it's went I will probably lose it by next week. We only bought milk this past week. We have been eating from mostly the kitchen frig freezer. I want to put 10 meals in the freezer to easy things while I am down. M said to say something to her on Tuesday or Wednesday if we need her to bake bread for us on Saturday. We saw that there is pork butt on sale for 89cents/lb at the local Save A Lot until Feb 2nd so we will go get some of that. One for smoking and another for adobo pork. I pulled frozen corn, a round steak, instant mashed potatoes, cherry pie filling and whipped topping (freezer) to go on top of the choc chip angel food cake M sent over for our meal tonight. I put ham out for tomorrow's meal... thinking scalloped potato and ham, maybe coleslaw as I have a cabbage in the frig.

I plan to sort through boxes during recovery as Hubby said he would bring one down a day for me to sort.Speed Up Saturday....Under winter storm warning of  3-10 inches of snow from 6 pm tonight to 7 am Monday. Possibly turning to rain middle of snow and then freezing ... I just hope we don't get WIND. Right now the wind is blowing at 11 mph.Hubby made sure both trucks were full of gas and moved to the barn for cover. He disconnected the work truck from flatbed so he could put in under cover at the barn also. He checked on M and E making sure they knew it was going to get bad, tomorrow is church Sunday so they would be looking at being out early in buggy. M needed kerosene so Hubby got it when he went to get fuel for the truck. She is sending over angel food cake later today as she had made noodles and had extra egg whites. Hubby had already got milk so we didn't need anything.I made sure the trash was out in the can and the can was bungee corded to the steel fence post. Too windy to burn anything so that stuff went to the holding area we have inside. Generator has been checked  and is ready to run if needed. Lamps are filled with oil, I have candles, lighters and matches. Meals for next 3 days are planned so we are set. AND YES I remembered all 6 adult kids what they needed to have if they lose electric and to be safe through this storm.

But she was just wanting to know what she was going to pay in from doing door dash and instacart. She was figuring a couple hundred between state and fed and had that back.She did NOT get the $600 stimulus  but what she did get..was her paperwork for unemployment that did NOT take taxes out. EVEN though I saw what she marked when she filed for them to TAKE TAXES out. She freaked.... As between all of that she is almost owing $1K. Federal... she could not handle looking at State. I reminded her she was not behind on child support. Her ex just gives the money to the son as allowance. It's $20 a week. Like she was 2 yrs ago for 2 kids at $50 a week for EACH. She can make payments if needed as she can show she's off work due to cancer. CALM DOWN. We can pay it and tack it on her loan. CALM DOWN. Doesn't help she pulled a tendon  in her elbow to shoulder walking one of the dogs. They slid on ice, dog one way and her another. Her dogs are as big as mine.  She's bored so a friend lent her a carpet cleaner to clean her furniture as she has all wood floors and no throw rugs(the dogs played tug of war with her throw rugs). Radiation is to start along with the chemo she is on this week for 3 wks... then rescan and possible surgery.. I remind her that the light is in that tunnel, faint but in the tunnel.She's also upset because she can't help me spring clean and nether can Son 2. Her for medical and he is leaving for AT about the same time I have surgery.SO he is having to get a friend to cat sit as I can't get down to change the litter box (automatic but still needs dumped). The other 4 are too scared they might give me covid as they all deal with the public.   At this point I really don't want them in the home anyways. I don't think they wear their masks like they should and are in \"friends and other family\" homes without masks. In this state you are to wear a mask if you are NOT in your OWN home and guests are to wear them in YOUR home.Masks suck... but I would rather have a mask on than get covid. My SIL who is 48 is still sick from it and it messed her lungs up real bad. They aren't sure where they picked it up as the whole family including Brother's in laws and the church got it. He is in and out of funerals, she is a preacher with her brother, their kids are working in businesses that are open. They hang out with family and friends that don't live with them without their masks. Lesson learned. I hope it doesn't cost her her life as she already has a pacemaker.Back to work... another round of decluttering the east loftHeavens what a week.Since trash is hauled to the road on Monday night. My motivation was to check all 3 frigs for anything that needed tossed(lost celery that Hubby forgot to wrap tight with the foil). I also finished decluttering the \"bucket\"(flours and oats in 5 gal buckets) room. Had 2 bags of trash, some recyclables and 3 boxes of stuff to go to Daughter 4. She uses it, passes it on or sells it.  I started a spreadsheet to track what we buy from Amazon. It helps to keep track of stuff and the amount not going on to pay the mortgage down. 😁Boy did that comment make Hubby change his mind about ordering some stuff.A neighbor sent over a meal... 3 glass containers that were 8 x8 inches. Main dish in one, two sides in the other and a dessert in the 3rd.... just the right amounts for us to have 2 meals from it. Hubby liked the idea of the 3 dishes, he asked if we had any thing that size... NOPE. We hadn't downsized those type of dishes. He did order those from Amazon after going through The Prudent Homemaker site. Maybe we won't have so many leftovers in the freezer because we got tired of eating it.I made a casserole that I got off Amish365. Zucchini hamburger casserole. Texture was soft like custard can be. We really liked it and have leftover in the freezer for when I am down with surgery.Task Tuesday...I used my walker and walked around the 1st floor to make sure I can get around safely after surgery. I spent 30 minutes working in the east loft decluttering.I updated finances and the calendar.Then I went to bed sick... 24 hr bugWaste Not Want not Wednesday.Hubby used the last piece of chicken in the frig to make a wrap (tortilla wrap) for his lunch as he will be between jobs and will be able to eat.I took a package of thin sliced beef out of freezer for supper. Not sure how it's going to be used until I know what time Hubby is going to get in. If it's going to be late it will be wraps (he loves wraps but not sandwiches)"},

I paid the house bills (the electric is the only one that floats but I figured out the average as they don't do budget billing) then I pay all the \"extra\" amounts on the debt. Leaving what is left of groceries, fuel for dog truck, all the odds and ends that can nickel and dime you if you are not careful. I bought vacuum bags for my food saver, bought generic. I would like to have more wide mouth canning lids. Maybe 10 more dozen. The bulk store has not gotten any in yet.I would like to buy some plants for the garden since I am not growing any of my own this year.  I priced them at Burpee as they are usually the most expensive.SO I at least have that cost. I down loaded 2020 orders from Amazon, check what I spent and on what.

I try to keep enough to add to vanilla pudding to make pumpkin mousse at Thanksgiving.I made 5 gallons of laundry soap. We ate from the freezers and pantry. I have 25 empty jars (some fruit and veggies came from freezer) and the kitchen freezer top drawer is now at just a little bit of ice cream, a bag of peas, a bag of peas and carrots and a bag of ham for what ever casserole. We will be working on the second freezer drawer of that frig next... I know there is some fried chicken in it. Plenty of fruit and some cooked hamburger for casseroles etc.I placed an order with Amazon for some things that Hubby needed stocked for his homemade trail mix. He paid for it out of his money since the only time he eats it is when he is in the truck working. Let's him keep his sugar level and not have to worry about where to stop for something to eat or making a mess in his truck as he really doesn't like to eat sandwiches or such in the truck. I inventoried my canning jars and canning lids. I still need to buy bulk wide mouth canning lids when they come in again. M said she had enough to get through canning her meat and if she found any more wide mouth lids she would try to get me some also. I need 730 more jars if I am feeding daughter 4 for a full year.I made a list of what veggie plants I will need to buy this year AFTER I made the list of what I want to put in the garden minus what I can buy at the auction or from Amish growers. I will go through my seeds next. Since I am having hip surgery Feb 16th , I am not growing my own plants this year. Less frugal but less stress.For my birthday Hubby trimmed all the oak trees that had limbs low enough to hit me when I mowed.

We do NOT watch tv while eating. Son 2 had our dog truck while his car got fixed.

In Dec  Hubby started getting his Social Security.We had several projects to do, some had the stuff here already.Jan 2020 our investments were down to $300,000. Hubby decided to not work for Ohio dept of transportation plowing snow. SO he started a business hauling and doing odd jobs for Amish/Mennonites. We picked up some cash making ice blocks for E and M since no ponds or river froze for the Amish to make ice blocks. I picked up some selling asparagus, traded asparagus for 10 gallons of beets also (mother in law got half of it)We pay for our health ins, co pays, meds, otc , out of pocket came to a total of $14,600.  We had NO money put back for anything.Mortgage, property taxes and farm insurance remained at $22,800.Propane was 6 tanks at $1.899 ($4075 with tax)when we moved in for the first year to 5 tanks at $1.699.($3098) Our propane company said that was great.Electric average was $150/month ($1800)first year to $125/month ($1500)Trash service  remained the same $204 a year.Life ins remains the same of $1332 a year Internet/ home phone dropped from $1440 a year to $1020 a year.Cellphones dropped from $1380 to $1320 a year. We both carry to cover large amount of data that we do use.Car insurance stayed the same since Hubby bought a new truck $8500 a year.Dogs (we did find cheaper food and meds that work better for Wilbur and Rascal, Charlotte still needs shots for her allergies), non food, pandemic crap, food, gardens, fruit trees and berry bushes etc . I did not track very well since the goal was to restock completely for a year.THEN in Sept Daughter 4 was diagonized with ovarian cancer. The new job she had for only 25 days let her go as they would not cover her time off, they offered her to quit due to medical so they could hire her back when she is recovered as they don't do rehires any other way. IF she had stayed with her old company whose pay was about half of the new company she would have had medical time off, with pay and medical ins. That so called \"change for the better\" she thought she was doing, actually was for the worse. We figured out her budget...$24000 a year since a hit and run driver totaled her car she is driving and I CUT our budget so we wouldn't pull more from our IRAS to cover her. I am thankful I am completely stocked in non food and food before she went down.  The money we are using to support her would have been used to redo the front porch and add an ADA wheelchair ramp. GOALS FOR 2021. Within the last week we have put money back for emergencies so we don't need that now. We put money back for the medical out of pocket needed for the year. Hubby is now getting his social security to cover his business if needed as he did know there would be slow months. Any money he doesn't use is being divided by 4 between the mortgage, 2 loans and savings.When I start getting my social security the same will be done Any earned money gets divided by four also.When Daughter 4 is supporting herself we will let the money divide the money by 4 until we reset for next year.I need to keep  better track of the finances going out and in. How are things going for you?Blessed Be for you. Son 2 came back negative in 3 tests. He did talk the friend into going to get another test and she told her dad she was not coming back to take care of him if he didn't go get tested. Her dad went with her to get tested. Daughter 4 came up to get the car tags and some odds and ends and bring jars back to me. Wilbur was happy to see her.  Rascal gave kisses because Wilbur did as he is only friendly with someone if Wilbur is... and Charlotte who is actually the pup to Daughter 4's dogs kept barking at her and wanting her to play chase..you can just see Charlotte over Wilbur sneaking up to tug on Daughter 4 sleeve.She had her hair dyed lavender because she let a person that was taking their tests for recertification for hairdresser...she flunked as she burnt Daughter's blonde hair to white with yellow burnt roots. Another hairdresser conditioned the hair, gave her special shampoo etc for her hair to use daily to help it get healthy again and then hair painted her hair lavender (Daughter's choice) ... actually as much as I hate to say it...the lavender does more for her than her natural hair of blonde as she looks to have some color in her face instead of being Caesper as she is called. Does not help she is starting to lose her hair due to chemo.Said she was thankful her hair was thick to begin with as it might be too thin or gone in 5 wks.We all had masks on in the home, social distant, I sprayed her with lysol before she got in the car and sprayed the house with Lysol after she left.She is tired and is having some side affects of Chemo...she knows it's the side affect as her doctor wrote out what they could be so she can just keep telling herself she is okay, it's just a side affect. Glad she takes it at night and usually sleeps through most of it but has had some visual hallucinations when she wakes up in middle of night to potty. She has learned to turn lights on and that seems to have stopped it. She can't wait to go back on her lupus meds and she really never figured she would say that. We are figuring her recovery from the cancer and mine from hip replacement should be about the same time.

Dishes including the pans are washed and on the drying pad. Stuff for daughter 4 is gathered except some things she is taking from the freezer like green tomato slices and Brussels sprouts. She should be here late morning. Son 2 called to tell me his friend just tested positive so he is not bringing our dog truck back until he is sure he didn't get covid. His car is still in the shop being fixed so we didn't plan for it to be back this week. He did tell his friend to get a second test to make sure it was not a false positive as she takes care of her elderly father and he refused to get a test but was willing to quarantine. He spent the past week working from home so he deep cleaned everything (laundry, bath and office left to do) of his 3 bedroom home. Change the guest bedroom to the bigger bedroom since he got Daddy's bedroom suit and moved his to the guest room. I got the twin bed he had as child for my guest room. It looks really nice. His kitchen and front room always looks good. He was talking about getting a file cabinet for his office... we have 2 in the barn so he doesn't need to buy anything.It's take trash to the road tonight. I have a couple things in the frig that needed tossed, not even a serving which is why it's getting tossed. Hubby usually eats those things and he shoved them behind the eggs when he cleared the table...so I didn't see them and he forgot he shoved them there . I put that kind of stuff that needs ate first in the drawers. SO they don't get shoved behind stuff. I didn't bother to ask why he pulled the eggs which were in cartons out to put the stuff behind them. When the oldest eggs are in the bowl so we know what to eat first. SIGH.One deep freezer has been emptied, defrosted and cleaned. Only 3 more to eat through along with 3 frig freezers. We did not buy any turkey as I have enough turkey packages to go 6 more months or ham for stocking this year. I will look at ham at Easter.We got the electric bill in. It's the last \"floating\" amount of the bills as everything else is a set amount pretty much. It was $40 less than last year at the same time and electric cost had went up some. We had more Christmas lights, I used the kitchen aid mixer for 10 days straight that I didn't do last year. Everything else is pretty much the same. The only thing that is different is Hubby did the insulation of attics. Must have been the difference of the fan running on the gas furnace. Weather has been about the same as last year also. We did not go to the store. Hubby grabbed milk when he was picking up meds at CVS that was the only thing. We had grocery money left last month that I have put aside to help with stocking up. SO far the only things bought was Dreft newborn laundry soap so I could wash the baby stuff I had in storage for granddaughter. I got 2 bottles, one for me and one for her. I bought vacuum belts when I had to replace the broken one and found we only had one left. My seeds I ordered in December are in.Neighbor told Hubby to get a 1 liter bottle , cut ends off and make into sock helper... She has the same size 3 in children's foot I have. He is going to use the ropes off the one we bought.  How are things in your neck of the woods?"},

I made another extra payment on the mortgage and loans.  I checked to see what was left and decided to transfer money to savings of what was left leaving just enough to cover us until the next \"payday\" from the IRAs. Hubby was going to get cereal for bfast this morning, I ask where we were on the bread. He decided we would finish the loaf as toast. He ate 3 slices and I ate 1. I will make biscuits next. We have tortilla wraps.Last night, I used part of the leftover kraut from the 1st to make Rueben sandwiches using the last of the rye bread from the freezer (unless some is buried). I used 1 can of corned beef. I now know 1 can makes 2-8 inch wraps and 1 sandwich. I used ketchup, mayo and green tomato dill relish to make the  thousand island dressing. I have one more kraut in the freezer for later as we never eat a full jar and I only use jarred kraut.Today ,I took the meat mixture I made and froze for hamburger pie.  I had froze it in the casserole dish I use to make the \"pie\" and then took it out and put it in freezer bags. So as this thaws it is already back in the dish. I put out the frozen corn (from the gardens) and will use leftover mashed potatoes I froze from the 1st. I will \"drain\" off the extra water before spreading it on top. I am making a list of things I can do without straining my hip while recovering, thanks to suggestions of others that have had this surgery. I also started a list of meals as Hubby's work has started picking up.I got my \"hip kit\" from Amazon. The scrubby to wash your legs is too short and I am only 5 ft so maybe it's my arms are too short. The sock helper is worthless. Even Hubby that wears a extra large sock and Son 1 who wears a size 16 shoe couldn't get their socks over the end of it let alone my sock fitting over it. I will be looking for something else as some times Hubby leaves for work before I get up and I don't want cold feet all day. I will wear socks to bed but usually find I have taken them off in the night .Blessed Be"},

Went to bed and for the first time in YEARS slept through the entire night. Had some nausea, compared it to the end of the flu when you are getting better. She ended up going into the office of who does pipp (program in Ohio to help with utilities). They did find her application she filed in Nov. State had received it but they are behind in processing it so the local couldn't do anything to over ride the state. BUT they did get the gas and electric to be set on a budget for $85 a month  each compared to the $10 a month each. At least until the state gets done processing her application. Not great news but good news. That still keeps her on budget and $130 less than she was at since she had just cut her budget. Her boys when there have decided to sleep in front room instead of the bedrooms when its cold so not to turn on the electric heater. She said 9 times out of 10 that's where she finds them anyways with the electric heater running in the empty rooms because they went up and turned it on so it would be warm when they went to bed. Her youngest had went to the store with his other grandma and there was a lot of sales on produce she was getting that was buy one get one. He asked why she wasn't getting both... she said because it would go bad before they would eat it... he picked up the \"free\" one and stuck it in the cart and told her if his mom didn't need it then he would drop it off at the food pantry around the corner from his mom. His grandma went back and got the other free ones, swung by daughter 4's and gave her what she wanted and then she took grandson to the food pantry to drop off the rest. This side of the family are bursting with pride that he understands the need for others to give. The other side decided to bring it up in church and try to get some donations for the pantry. His grandma told Daughter 4 that she felt shamed that she never once thought about giving to a food pantry and he did.Which I didn't understand since BOTH his parents have used food pantries off and on. Daughter 4 always tried to give once a month when she was doing good and a \"pay back\" for when she needed the help herself.Hope everyone is well. Blessed Be"},

Goal is to have 3 months emergency funds. We have 2.Any money we make from garden or ice blocks goes on to the garden to add to what is budgeted for that. What we made in 2020 doubled that budget for this year. Hubby figured he would have to cover the business for six months a year. One during the summer (July 4th factories shut down) and again from late Nov to late April. So far he hasn't had to cover any of the business. He picked up enough work this coming week to pay to start covering Feb. bills. He was offered 6 different jobs on the 4th (tomorrow) but only one could be worked in with him having to drive me in the morning to the doctor appt for my hip(right hip so I can not drive due to pain) and we are down to just the work truck as Son 2 blew something with his radiator and it's not a year old. It was dropped off at the shop today and he took our dog truck. Daughter 4 cut her budget by almost $300 a month.. BUT she then got notified that the one discount she was getting on heating and electric hadn't went through. IF she gets it she will still have it cut by $300... if she doesn't get it ... the $300 will go on those bills meaning she won't have to ask for an increase from us. I made a $1000 mistake on the budget.... it's okay, I made it in the income not the out go so we decided that amount would also be divide by the 4.Lots of changes this coming year as Daddy used to put it, we will see what comes out in the wash.We are eating from the pantry. I have a list of 30 minute meals, it would take us 30 minutes to go to town and come back (if not longer) with take out.I reused freezer bagsMore than once LOL. I took the leftover Christmas prime rib and made Philly cheese steak pizza and then tossed the last of the roast in eggs I found a bread recipe that gives us the right height for the toaster... was a little denser than I like but Hubby was fine with it.

Her doctor and her looked at this as good news as it was NOT spreading.So the next 3 weeks she will be on chemo alone. Since she has bad veins they are doing a \"nasty make you puke horse pill\" ... that was her doctor's words. She will be taking Abrarane. THEN she will take Abrarane for 3 more weeks with daily radiation. THEN another ultra sound scan and IF there is any cancer left they are doing surgery. This puts her through everything about the same time her granddaughter will be born in April instead of July.This plan is replacing the 12 wks radiation, 4 wks off and 16 wks chemo and then possible surgery. There is concern for her immunity system as her lupus along with her bipolar is starting to flare up. Her county is extremely high on covid.SO since she is not working at all and trying to social distance and stay in her bubble.. she decided to figure out how much food \"we\" needed in the pantry for next year. She also decided the majority should be in by mid September instead of late Oct (or Dec this year with tomatoes and I don't have the pumpkins or dried beans dealt with yet)Please notice the WE as she really meant ME and our pantry but she was counting in feeding her as she doubts she will be able to find enough work to pay her bills and feed herself. Her goal is to be able to at least pay her own bills by August where we budgeted supporting her until end of Dec 2021.Here is what she came up with...Fruit   1643 pints Veggies 2190 pintsGrains 822 lbs.Protein 548 lbs. ( legumes is 1/3rd of that weight)69 gallons of milk69 gallons of yogurt104 lbs. of cheeseI did ask if she had a broke down account of per fruit or veggies etc.She said no. She figured if I didn't grow it or the Amish didn't grow it, we could go without it or find a seller that supplies it.She stayed with pints since it is two of us in this house and her in her own house. That way if she didn't need our help, it was canned in a way that worked for us.Makes me wonder what other things she will be figuring out for me"},

Even though all the lights in the house are LED. Hubby gets the lamp oil for free because he hauls the barrels for the Amish. It's a bonus or the tip depending on how you look at it.We moved dinner up so I don't have to turn on the light over the stove to cook.Hubby has a digital thermometer in the pump house so he does not have to worry about having the gas heater too high out there (or too low) when keeping the pump and pipes at the well from freezing. He tries to keep it between 34 and 40 degrees.I turn burners off (we use propane to cook and heat) and the oven off before the food is done. Food continues to cook but I am saving a few pennies on the propane.We have been staying home. Hubby is in the slow period of his work so he's mostly at home. We have started recycling. We are using an old trash can for the plastic and glass. We burn paper for ashes for the gardens. We compost, not very well but enough that we spread it on the area we don't plant as the soil is very poor.I use my unlimited Kindle nightly. We check to make sure we save enough on shipping to continue the prime at Amazon. Hubby watches the shows as we don't have cable or satellite (over $100 a month around here).Our goal is to pay off the mortgage in 5 yrs but will settle for 8 yrs if needed. Our mortgage original payoff date is April 1st 2048. Right now if we paid no more extra we would be paid off in April 1st 2038. How are you looking at the new year?Blessed be"},

Regretfully we are still being asked to not have family gatherings and stay with in our bubbles of who we live with. So with masks and gloves we dealt with this year. First let me add we usually give the kids and grandkids $50 each and the great grandkids $20. We also donate $100 to our son's VFW (very small membership). Instead the kids asked for cookies and candy and when son 2 said something while at a meeting, the VFW asked if we could do that instead of the donation. The bakery they usually order from shut down and they couldn't afford to get the cookies from the other bakery. We usually spend $1800. We spent $648.02 on ingredients and $55.20 of fuel for the cook stove and fuel for deliveries for a total of $703.22. Savings of $1096.78. I did not count the 80 hrs of work. It breaks down to 27 cents per cookie/buckeye on the average.I kept our meals simple , cookies or buckeyes was for lunch and a sandwich was for dinner. It was not a healthy week.Today we delivered the last of it. The kids were grateful but a bit worried as they know I pushed it since I did it in a week. There was talk of getting together to bake next year...I really don't see it happening But I did tell Hubby I want part of the one freezer empty so I can put cookie dough in the freezer.

DUH and how much are they recycling? (none) Eating out with throw away containers?(a lot) Mending clothes? (no way)Did you vote (they did not) are you involved with your local government (No).SO the granddaughter thinking she would be a smart butt asked me what I did. Her mom and two aunts replied with the word MOAN on her post and her mother said you asked for it.I know who my Ohio house of representatives and Ohio senator are. I pay attention to how they vote on things. I know who is my US house of representatives and US senators are. I know who are on my township board.  I know what they are voting on and how they vote. I do give input and write letters BUT I make sure I am not whining. I do vote ALWAYS. I research the issues being voted on.I have went from 6 bags of trash a week (for 2, think tin cans, boxes, take out) to 1-2 a week. The 5 R's of zero waste is refuse , reduce, reuse, recycle and rot. Goal is to be like Daddy of using a grocery plastic bag for his weekly trash. Brother said most of the recycling was cardboard and cans.Our township was recycling and then stopped. I will be checking to see if they are going to start back up. We do not have a recycling center in the area... closest one is an hour away.SO if they are not going to start back up then I need to focus more on REFUSE # 1 of zero waste#2 of zero waste REDUCEI will be focusing on reducing our use of propane (fossil fuel). Goal is to lower it by 1 tankful this year (already lowered it one tankful last heating season).I will be focusing lowering electric (fossil fuel) Average amt this year was $150/ month for 2020. My goal is to average $125 for 2021.I don't have a water bill but we have lowered that by adding rain gutters to the barn that is goes in a drain to the pond and rerouting 2/3rds of the house gutters to drain to the pond. SO we won't be trying to put water in the pond with a garden hose. SMILING.We will limit take out to once a month and think about what containers it comes in. Chinese has reusable and recyclable plastic, pizza and calzone has card board. We burn our card board and paper and the ashes goes on the garden. Wood like limbs goes to E for him to burn when he heats water to make milk for the calves. I refill, I add water to shampoo, conditioner, soap, dish soap. etc. I make my own laundry soap in the same 5 gallon bucket.#3 REPAIR.We do this a lot but we could do better.#4 Recycle We do not have recycling in this area but we do recycle within our home. I reuse a lot of stuff. Such as the plastic grocery bags that we get *when I can't use cloth bags* goes to Amish that sell produce during the growing season.#5 RotWe compost. The leaves that come off the tree is left to rot. There are other areas that slowing are going to be put in place."},

I can beets, but I have been sharing my beets with Daughter 4. My doctor wants me to either eat beets or do a beet supplement daily. Same goes for grapes. 1 1/2 cups of fresh grapes (not happening) or a supplement. I can use raisins but I don't usually eat a lot of dried fruit. I had to order green tea, almost out and not sure if my son is getting me any for Christmas.

I've used this for years for my heart but now for my bones also. It's hard to find unsulfured in this area. That is it. I told Hubby, if he finds a small roast and specified what I thought was small with bones and without bones, it's okay. Other wise we are down to dairy only. MAYBE a salad. I will not be getting another bone in ham, one: do not have the room for it, two: do not need it since I have 14 meals of sliced ham and the one I am cooking today will do us for beans and such.

E is taking the old dog house and some pieces of metal roofing and the fence around it can be used on a spot that the dogs could go through when the dog house is moved. Getting rid of the trailer (everything has been sitting on it) cleared a good area so Hubby could move things around to make it easier for him to park his work trailers and his truck.STILL LEFT TO DO 2 hot sauces red tomatoes north attic.DECEMBER done alreadyappt for primary doctor. Weight stable and blood work good for me. Hubby lost two pounds and his blood work was great like always.First vein procedure of left leg done. Next one is Dec 29th if injections are needed to finish closing vein down. Appt with ortho , had MRI of both hips and lumbar (wished I had the back injections afterwards as it took me 3 days to walk right ) Had follow up for results of MRI. Arthritis in every joint (duh) and the right hip will need replaced but hopefully it will last a bit over 3 more years as Doc said Medicare pays better for it than my health insurance. In Jan I will see what that estimate costs through our ins and get it put aside.House, inside and outside is decorated. What is still needing doneStarting the  7th I will be making cookies for 50 people.Starting  the 14th I will be making candy for 50 people The 20th we will be at grandson's wedding( Army in AZ and bride here in Ohio). Masks required. Families sit in their bubbles. Church used to be a roller rink.  They asked to include Christmas exchanges (yes they know all are getting cookies and candy from us)Thought it would help with gas costs and social distancing. Having a nonalcoholic \"cocktail\" outside (heaters will be there) while there will be a bride and groom dance, and mother and son /father and daughter dance. Nothing else. Soon to be granddaughter said they would be greeting each and everyone.  The 8th we have chiro and vet for the dogsWe added some things to the grocery list: hamburger to make more chili, Hubby has ate a lot of it as a dip. Ribs for New Year's eve. IF I can find a small rib roast I will get that other wise is will be steaks E gave us a couple months ago for Christmas eve.  We still need a boneless ham to slice and another bone in. Milk.  We didn't spend all of Nov's money so I am okay with it within reason.E sent over 10 lbs of pork loin I cut into 3 roasts and 8 chops to flash freeze. I will vacuum seal tomorrow.I need to finish the last 2 hot sauces.I need to finish canning the last of the red tomatoes I need to bake, puree, dehydrate and grind 5 pie pumpkinsI need to can dried beans (first time to ever do)I need to transfer stuff to the 2021 calendar I need to set the goals for 2021. Household and personal. Hubby won't do any goal setting... that is his goal...not setting any goals."},

Even with holes in some areas. I am thankful for medical insurance as I face 4 medical appts in the next 8 days. I am thankful Hubby is able to shift work around so he can take me to the appts. I am thankful there is money in the checking to pay most of December's bill though it will be squeaky as we are not counting on SS or my IRA payments to make the bills.  I am thankful the company that makes my biologic its putting enough on my acct to cover a good part of my co pay for my meds as in Jan my ins goes from $50 for 3 months to $125 EACH month.I am thankful I heard the brakes on the work truck squeaking, Hubby had a low tire . He got it fixed today, had a screw in it. Brakes are fine.  He was told by the repair guy that truck will have brakes squeak when the tires are low. Nice to know even though Hubby checks his tires before he hauls, he did not check them when we left Daughter 4's after dropping of frig and stove.I am thankful we are not having to go to appts today as the weather is crappy, rain turned to snow with temps dropping below freezing so that means black ice on the back roads if not salted.My Amish neighbors are home from the funeral in Indiana and they said they were thankful for a safe trip, the masks we gave them to keep them safe and that the weather has turned so cold. They are butchering this week, means they won't need as much ice from us to help keep meat cold."},

{"title": "Last week of Nov Frugal", "date": "Saturday, November 28, 2020", "text": "We spent $17 at the grocery store, 1 gal of milk, 2 cartons of sour cream, 1 carton of cottage cheese, a 3 pack of colored bell peppers, 1 bunch of celery,1 pack of white mushrooms, and 1 pack of portabella mushrooms. That should last us for two weeks.We ate from the pantry except for a gas station $10 pizza the night we didn't get home until 7 due to waiting for appts an hour away from us. We have been combining appts so we are making less trips. The last one that day was running an hour behind and then took an hour. SIGH.Daughter 4 had a company give her some money to help her buy her frig and stove. She passed that money to us to put on that bill. Now it's down to the same as if I have bought the frig on sale. Stove is now \"free\". Considering her old frig froze her milk, the new one is up and running just in time and she was baking a cheesecake in the new stove.We decided to Not buy a live tree this year. but use the old little tree we had when we lived in the 800 sq ft rental. I bought a light tree insteadfor less money than the live trees would have costs. We buy two, one for front porch and one for inside . I haven't decided how to decorate the deck yet. I should say I haven't found anything in the decorations to put on the deck yet.The holiday dinner we usually attend for HAM radio was canceled so I did not buy anything for it as it would have been this coming week. hard right now with our friend dying and his sister fighting covidbut my soon to be granddaughter asked me what I was thankful for. I am thankful her and my grandson have one another. I am thankful that my vein surgery has not been canceled, it is NOT cosmetic. I am thankful that I was able to hang my laundry including all the Christmas towels, table linen etc out of the yard line.I am thankful a company stepped in and gave us money to help pay for Daughter 4s stove and frig (which she is going to pay us back for it and all the money we use to support her).She had mentioned us buying it for her while at treatment. It's now down to the same amount of buying her just the frig with is being on sale. I know we are all tired of the covid and politics.  I've had a brother in law, 2 sister in laws, and nephews already go through this. They got off lightly.BUTI just lost a good friend... his sister tested negative for Covid and so did he. They spent the day together in his apartment as he is disabled. The next day she had \"allergy\"coughing, her doctor tested her. She was positive( 2 day turn around on results), She called her brother, he was already in ICU as of that morning. He did not make it. She is in ICU on ventilator. We worry she won't fight it because of his death. From internet ...If you continue to have no symptoms, you can be with others after 10 days have passed since you had a positive viral test for COVID-19. Oct 27, 2020Just because the test is negative does not mean you do not have it. You canhave it and not had it long enough to test positive or are nnot showing signs of it.False negatives — that is, a test that says you don't have the virus when you actually do have the virus — may occur. The reported rate of false negatives is as low as 2% and as high as 37%. But the infected person doesn't begin producing antibodies immediately. It can take as long as three weeks for a blood antibody test to turn positive.Nov 20, 2020 Harvard edu.If you have symptoms, there is a 70 per cent the disease will be detected with a positive result, said Cheng, who recently wrote a scientific article summarizing research so far on COVID-19 testing. On average, symptoms develop five to six days after exposure, but it can take two to 14 days.Son2 said a lot of people including MEDICAL do not realized they have it. He had a soldier in ICU on ventilator because his doctor thought it was bronchitis and did not send him to be tested for covid. YOU will most likely test positive until 5 to 6 day after exposure .My son has been guarantied for 2 wks due to others having it around him. He is NEGATIVE but still staying away most except at work as he has to go to work  and he is now wearing his mask even alone due to the heating system runs the whole building NOT just his office. The ones that were positive around my son, had NO symptoms. , except the one that was told he had bronchitis, which he gets often.My kids told me they could not live with themselves if I got it because of them and put on oxygen the rest of my life because of it or died. I definitely know I could not handle giving it to my children, grandchildren or great grandchildren...COULD YOU? My grandchild whose wedding for next month is at \"we will see\"  said her florist who works from her home is now moving it to the garage due to her Hubby's health as he has Parkinson's and the CDC told her that the in home business was putting him at a higher risk even though she requires mask and has hand sanitizer.Because of covid shedding. It’s when an infected person releases virus particles into the environmentViral shedding is highest when COVID-19 symptoms are getting worseIt’s possible for asymptomatic people to shed the virus, as wellUpon infection, a virus multiplies inside the body, and when that person sneezes, coughs, or (in extreme cases) speaks, it has the potential to be released into the person’s environment. According to WebMD, this occurrence is called viral shedding.Knowing how viral shedding happens is beneficial in understanding how COVID-19 spreads, and it helps scientists figure out the point when a person with the coronavirus is the most infectious. Researchers reportedly use terms like “low” and “high” to describe levels of viral shedding. you can shed for up to 20 days on the average.  There was a woman in Washington that did it for 70 days. Makes me wonder if she was what they call a long hauler of covid.CDC and the companies making the vaccine have repeatedly said even after taking the vaccine (TWICE, it is TWO shots not one) you will still need to wear a mask and socially distance. SIGH.I really looking forward to cookies and candy for the kids and grandkids but worried about spreading germs. Grandsons and daughter working in culinary field said I could do it still, the only change I would have to do is wear a mask."},

Said he finally found some that he is sharing with 4 other families. Factories making it was shut down due to Covid. He was glad he had gotten a couple deer during bow season.Things you take for granted as not available like they used to be. I have 8 spots on shelves that have nothing. Between us and Daughter 4 we have cleared those spots. That is 120 pints of food. In one month gone. Not counting anything from freezers or fresh. Thirty pounds of sweet potatoes gone. I have two for Tday and Daughter is out. I usually buy 50 lbs bags of potatoes for everyone. Can't even order them. Out of 60 lbs of red onions I have maybe one pound left. Had 30 lbs yellow onions , they are gone. Can you tell we eat? It will be interesting to see what we run out of completely and what we still have when garden starts coming in. I know I did not get any peas to grow this year so that is a BIG need to grow next spring and again in fall. Hope the garden season is better than it was this year.Do you have a pantry? Are you stocked for the winter? How are the grocery store shelves in your area? Sister in law and her family recovered from Covid. Brother in law and his family down with it now but staying home... Son 2 was tested Monday... said he has no symptoms but every single person that has been around him in last 3 weeks has it. He waited until day 7 to be tested.MRI of hip done, struggling to walk thanks to it. Food supplies to daughter 4 along with some old magazines for her to read. She sent back 2 cases of canning jars.Have chiro this afternoon. Which I hope with easy some of the pain of the MRI of having my legs in one position for 30 mins. . Daughter 4 oven had quite working, she bought her self a roaster, then a burner went out (glass top stove that is 20yrs old) so she gave me a heads up to look for used stove. HER daughter texted me that Daughter 4's frig has been freezing things on the frig side with no rhyme or reason and she had lost some of her fresh veggies she had just bought. SO I check out used appliances came up with the cost that was equal to brand new when on sale. Hit a sale of a stove with coil burners and knobs along with a decent size frig for the total price LESS then the two USED. We are picking up the stove tomorrow and we will haul the old away. Frig is coming in next week. Daughter 4 decided to keep the old frig as second freezer and is having her kids move it to the other room. Said she can keep water bottles and stuff that doesn't matter if it freezes in it.  Thankful granddaughter got ahold me and that I hit a great sale. I am thankful the election is moving forward I am thankful the vaccine is moving forwardI am thankful for the tomatoes in the grow cart turning red so I can finish canning them this week.I am thankful Hubby has picked up some work between our appts as he is working on paying Dec bills for the business.I am thankful that all the kids are staying in their \"bubbles\" for Thanksgiving. We were invited with the note that we had to wear gloves, masks, glasses  and sit in the dining room by ourselves LOL. Daughter 2 was going to be serving everyone, mask and gloves. We will just stay home.

In fact I am still using ones that Daddy had used that are over 3 yrs old. I wash them, dry them, roll them up and reuse. They hold up better in freezer when flash freezing than parchment or wax paper. Hubby reused the foil off the lasagna he washed (SHOCK) and put it on the brownies, then used it to cover the pot pie after he washed it again. Said last night it was beyond washing as it fell apart in his hands. Believe me it took wanting to pay the mortgage off early to get him on board of washing foil and plastic food bagsI washed freezer bags and sandwich bags and hung them on the kitchen porch line to dry. I used silicone covers on some containers that do not have lids. I put them on the clothes line to dry also. I've been known to use a saucer on a bowl and a plate over a serving bowl also.I froze brussels sprouts, caramelized onions and hamburger rolls. I am still canning tomatoes that are ripening in the grow cart trays. I am tired of tomatoes LOLWe did not go to the store even though Hubby thought we should check out the sales.I saved the crumbs from a box of cold cereal to put in the fruit crisp that is on the menu next week I  put 1 meal of leftover broccoli cheddar soup and 1 meal of chicken pot pie to go with the leftover green beans, ham and potatoes that are already there. Those are on the menu for first week of Dec due to 3 medical appts back to back. We set the budget for buying Christmas decorations and live trees. Hubby pulled the decorations down from the barn loft so I don't have to climb up and down stairs to carry them down. I can start looking at one container each day. This is the first year of decorating the deck.I have combined 2 blood works, 1 MRI, 3 vet appts and our chiro appts into 2 days this coming week as they are an hour away from us. Except for Thanksgiving, meals will be simple with plan overs (instead of leftovers) . For Thanksgiving we are smoking a turkey breast (cutting legs and wings off whole turkey as Hubby was not paying that price triple of a whole turkey just for a breast and roasting them for another meal and bones for broth). Home grown sweet potatoes, home grown brussels sprouts, Amish grown pumpkin into pie and homemade bread or rolls.  Extra smoked turkey will be froze to make what I call blue plate special... turkey over bread dressing (rolls or bread if not dressing) or mashed potatoes, green beans or corn gravy over all of it and cole slaw and some dessert.  I am thankful I have extra stock that I can take to Daughter 4 ( no one else needs anything) I am thankful that I have more tomatoes ripening and being canned, even though I am tired of seeing tomatoes.I am thankful of another small harvest of volunteer kale and mustard. I wonder what it will take to kill since we have had a couple freezes.I am thankful that due to the colder weather, M won't need as much ice and I will have room for at least two hams in that freezer. I am thankful my health ins is doing a 3 day turn around on approval of medical testing so I can get it done this year when it's not costing me anything since I have maxed my out of pocketBlessed be"},

Hubby even though he is careful when working is always at a low risk. Most are staying away. One Amish canceled a haul because he as coughing... he has bronchitis... but still held off being around anyone. The tests are not always right in negative or positive according to him (including what we are seeing on the news) I am thankful it was warm today even with the high winds. I was making hot sauce (yep, got 2 more to do from the father's day gift thank you daughter 4) and it had enough fumes both Hubby and I were coughing. Can't wait to do the Ghost pepper one tomorrow SIGH. We did tell her if we die from her gift she does not get an inheritance. 😏 Hubby got the last of the plants pots dumped and put away and a couple holes out in the yard filled in with dirt. I got 2 of the hot sauces done , cooked 2 trays of tomatoes to strain for juice to can tomorrow . Decluttered the small desk behind Hubby's desk that he was doing \"over flow\" on top of and paid the bills for this week.

{"title": "New Budget for 2021", "date": "Tuesday, November 17, 2020", "text": "Now that all the kids and a few grandkids have had their input on our budget. LOL 😄Daughter 4 has made my basic grocery list with the only thing I am allowed to stock up for is ham for the year * I buy 4* at Christmas. Hubby got a turkey to smoke, I will cut off the legs and wings to roast and he will just smoke the breast for Thanksgiving ... Just the two of us.  And I have several packages already of turkey in the freezersWe had a talk about him picking extra thing up at the grocery store , spent $61, when Daughter 4 has cut the budget for groceries to $50 A MONTH with NO stock up. He asked if she gave us a grace period and I said, yes but it is firm starting Dec 21st.She listed the following. Did price points also so we would know if it is higher something else is not going to get bought. 3 gal of vitamin D milk , I use 1 gal every 2 wks, 3rd gal is for yogurt that I have been told I need to make my self. I will use the whey in baking so it's not wasted.2 dozen eggs... even our Amish neighbor had to buy store bought eggs this week. She got so mad at her 50 chickens for not laying enough even in a week that she butchered them and canned them. New batch came in but won't be laying for about a month.2 large curd cottage cheese.1 sour cream1 Dean's chip dip though I have been strongly encouraged to change to dill dip and make my own as it will save me 50 cents since I grow my own dill weed and seed and just buy sour cream.1 qrt half and half. I was reminded I could mix heavy cream with milk for this until she checked prices and decided that the price of making it would be more than the price of buying it.1 qrt heavy cream.16 oz. of white mushrooms * half of my normal amt.*16 oz. of portabella mushrooms *half of my normal amt.*1 package of tricolor bell peppers * half of my normal amt.* I can't eat the green ones1 bunch of celery 2 lbs. of regular carrots 3lbs. onions* Not going to be needed for a good month or two* Baking potatoes or sweet potatoes are limited by price of $4.* I have some sweet potatoes we grew. They didn't get very big and I have some small fresh white potatoes we grew. I would have to bake enough to make a serving. I might get sweet potatoes when I pick up the ham to have enough to late spring.$ 8 is left for cheese or something else like extra sweet potatoes or frozen peas or broccoli if we shop Kroger's (after chiro as ours closed)or Walmart 5 miles from us.$17 is left for cheese or something else if we shop Aldi's after chiro appts. There is two things they don't carry we would have to get else where or go with out.$20 is left for cheese or something else if we shop Save A Lot which is 6 miles from us . There is 1 thing they don't carry that would be picked up else where. We know one of the gals. of milk will be through the month so what ever is not bought on the main shopping can be bought then. Daughter 1 who works in a grocery store as a manager told us to do our grocery shopping  AFTER the second Wed (social security starts their payments ) and the last week of the month, more clearance of what is Best used by date at that time. We are not going to starve for sure . I am canning more tomatoes this week and look to finish the last 4 hot sauces.Goals... that by end of 2021 Daughter 4 is back on her feet from fighting cancer and can start making payments back. AND can buy my car that she drives most the time anyways. I really don't like how small it is but it was what was available at the right price when the other died.That we have the huge  mortgage, back loans and the work truck (business usually pays unless don't make enough) paid in full... in five years so we only need Social security for living and the Ira be for medical coverage as needed. LIKE my Daddy had been doing. That is $350,000 in 5 yrs. We know we can do it in 8 even if she can't pay us back as fast as she hopes to. But I know we have paid far more off in the same amount of time with 1/4th less income. We can do it again."},
{"title": "I am thankful", "date": "Sunday, November 15, 2020", "text": "that no one of my children and one grandson worry about offending me over anything.  I have treaded lightly with my own parents when they were alive. Hubby does it now with his own. But our kids and one grandson have decided that treading lightly doesn't always get the job done. After dealing with Mother's negative estate, having to sell everything to try to pay things off and Pop having to move in with his son. We share exactly where we are at financial and medical wise with all 6 kids and the grandkids who are in their teens and twenties. They all know who will be in charge of the estate(they actually talked it over between them and chose Son2) if we both die, they all know exactly were things stand.With in the past week I have all 6 kids tell me our budget is whacked out and made suggestions, reasonable suggestions that was put in place saving us $500 a month. The biggest savings was when Daughter 1 told me to go back and see how much went to out of pocket medical and since I maxed out (we have a limit on oop) to check what would have also had to go out if I hadn't met my limit. Our co pay to doctors is counted towards our OOP. Unusual I am told but it is how it is with our insurance. I still have to call Humira with my insurance change for prescriptions but they are still going to work with me. Daughter 4 who was the last one to go through the budget and figured out that she would rather do $400/ wk like a pay day than $2000 a month as we put in . Her budget is $1800 a month IF she doesn't have to pay for any meds and no increase in food or diapers.(She is thankful I insisted she take a package home because the radiation triggered her in the middle of the night. Her daughter's boyfriend went and got her more this morning) BUT she wants to focus on working while she can part time and putting that money back to cover the rest knowing she can ask if she really is in need. She plans to be back to work full time Oct 22 2021(her 27th birthday if no problem working with this pandemic) Our grandson against his mother's advice told me to go back to the old recipe of Buckeye candy , not what I used last time as every single one of them pitched them in the trash as he had asked. Then he asked if they said anything to me, nope. We don't eat them so I did not know what they tasted like. I thanked him for being truthful, When his mom heard him tell me she flat out said I told you to keep your mouth shut. HE  come back with he wants buckeyes and not me wasting my time and money. I didn't need to do that. I backed him on that.  AND she admitted she went into the mode of not saying anything about the gift because MY MOTHER would had been a terror over it when she gave them food they did not eat and she told Mother that they didn't eat it. He was not rude, just plain spoken. He was proud of saying his is his Nonna's child LOL.I am thankful that we realized we had an air leak in the upstairs east and/or west loft when I noticed the curtain hung in the staircase (no door) moving. Furnace was not on, not even the ceiling fans as it had been a decent start to the day of warmth  (not now 30 mph plus winds and cold front dropped us 20 degrees). I found both small windows leaking air even though they were locked and have decent insulation. That means the outside needs caulked as the inside already is. I covered the entire window with plastic and then made sure the insulated curtain covered the window.I am thankful Charlotte let us know we had a mouse in the basement. It ate the corner off the organic whole wheat flour (thankful it was a 2 lb bag not a 5 lb) I had just took down to the basement. That Hubby was going to put in the freezer when he put the turkey in... two hours later. We know exactly where it came in (drain pipe it ate through the cover. SO now there is metal cover with weight on on. THEN we heard it in the vent run that goes to the east loft while we was sitting at the table. So I went the basement to see if it could be the one that got in from the pipe... Yep, found evidence were it chewed the drywall to get from the freezer room (I keep that door shut to keep the heat from the frigs and freezer out of the pantry part) into the mechanical room because Hubby had shut that door and then where it went through the insulation board Hubby had just installed over the crawl space opening. Hubby put out poison since it would be where the dogs couldn't get to it and fixed the insulation board. I can tell you it is dead from the odor in the east loft. Glad that is not a room we use much during the winter. Odor will probably be there 3 days. Blessed be"},

SO Hubby went out and put the canning stove together we bought and figured out he needed one part to be able to hook it up.

I did give him a heads up of things he really needs to check out ,like health coverage in that area, as he is moving out of state. Since he lived in Las Vegas for 8 yrs he understands high utility bills.I am thankful Son2 warned me not to come in his home. His local VFW where he is an officer had a \"river\" of covid, one of them caught it working at the school and then they sponsored a toy run for bikers so over 1000 in tracing to begin with. SIGH.  He does not have any signs of it but why take a chance. If I am in the area I usually stop for the bathroom and kitty fix... okay mostly for the kitty fix but since I am there might as well use the bathroom Right? I am thankful I have a day that I can spending cleaning without trying to juggle other things in between. We have a phone conference with our one financial guy, the son is taking over the business and he just wants to touch base of where we are, what we need and how we want to continue. .Blessed Be"},

Since it faces his house I thought OOPS... I asked if it bothered them? He said no, the kids liked it but asked if it was just a pretty or if it had meaning.  I told him the evergreen is to represents everlasting life through Jesus and the circle is for GOD with no beginning or ending.

Procedure 1 will be fiber optic laser on Dec 2nd. Procedure 2 will be injection two weeks later. Good news is my body still makes veins.. it shows in the ultra sound and the right leg has good veins. Better news is due to it NOT being cosmetic surgery, it causing my bp to drop when I stand up or sit up in bed AND it raises my BP when I walk. Guess it can't make up it's mind ?  I am thankful that the doctor decided to bill it all including follow up appts as one amount so everything would be covered under this year's insurance which I have already maxed my out of pocket and co pays.I do have to have blood work down but they agreed it could be done the week before when  I get my other blood work done.Bad news is I have to go back to the ortho because the ultra sound of the right leg showed nothing from the veins so it has to be a muscle problem...That appt is now Monday at noon since they had a cancelation . BUT thankful they got me in now so it's on this year's insGood news is... the brussels sprout plants are pulled YEA!!!! I got 4 gallons of sprouts now in the freezer.   I still have 5 trays of green tomatoes.... well it's 4 trays as one is almost completely ripe and will be canned in next couple days."},

Only a few years older than me but as nurse she did NOT follow advice of losing the weight (over 100 lbs OVER weight) went into diabetes and still eats everything and anything and does no exercise. SIGH. Does the I take a shot so I can eat what ever I want.  Our grandson lost his great grandmother on his late Dad's side. He said he was thankful she went in her sleep and she didn't have covid. She was in her late 80s.Hubby said the old fence lost ... it's the one that \"bit\" him. I am thankful he is an EMT and makes sure we have a full supply of first Aid. I get the OTC meds but he does bandages etc.Rascal (black) and Charlotte (white) checking out the new fence. Charlotte loves putting her head through it to smell the grass on the other side. We decided to replace the white wood fence with pipe next year if money is available. That will match E's side ours connects to at his pasture south of us. It is also a lot less maintenance.I have to prop my feet up above my heart 3 times a day. I say nap and all 3 dogs head to the bed. Yesterday I didn't say anything out loud. Just texted Hubby I was going to do the legs prop.. Rascal is usually the one that follows me everywhere . But Wilbur realized what I was doing and wanted me to hold him. I froze 1 gal of brussels sprouts. Last 2 plants will be harvested today.I canned 2 1/2 pints of tomato juice from tomatoes that finally turned. I have another tray that is almost red enough to can mid week.I roasted 2 chickens, ate 3 meals from them, deboned (got 2 bags that have 3 cups of meat for potpie) and 4 1/2 pints of broth canned.I made the menuToday we have to take the work truck in for a repair that is tomorrow morning the dealership said to bring it in today and then we can pick it up after our appts. It's a 4 hr job.  That's 2 1/2 hours of today on the road to drop off and come back home. The repair is under warranty so has to be done by dealership.I am doing regular Monday laundry, clean frigs, trash to road stuff. Hubby wants to burn a stump he has been trying to burn all week. Clear the old dog stuff and work on getting concrete off the metal clothes line poles as I am nagging about this old trailer and crap on it that was supposed to go to junk yard two years ago.Tuesday... last warm day over 70 for the year most likely. I have appt with vein doc which is 75 min from here. He is going to tell me what the results are from ultra sound, he thought they should know how much the insurance would cover as it is affecting my heart failure and schedule the surgery. Then Hubby and I both have chiro appts. Hubby is taking a return to UPS for Amazon of what was sent wasn't what I ordered. We need to stop at Aldi's and Krogers. Looking for turkey breast for Tday and gal of milk (will have cooler and ice packs) THEN  we will stop on way home to pick up the work truck. Wednesday This day is suppose to be back into the 50s . I plan to do some sewing but we will see. Probably canning another tray of red tomatoes.Thursday... home but Hubby's financial guy is calling  to do our yearly \"meeting\" . His office is still only doing phone or Zoom. We don't do Zoom. We already have figured out the budget. We are still debating about one check to cover my surgery and Daughter 4. Going to depend on the costs of the surgery.Friday I have follow up appt for my back injections. That's 2 hr 15 min one way ride. We will pit stop at Daughter 4s. if she needs anything dropped off or picked up (aka empty jars). That pretty much wipes out the day for us.Saturday will be catch up on the housework, etc.Blessed Be"},

I have 2 brussels sprout  plants to harvest still after harvesting 3 plants... probably about a quart of sprouts between the two as we've ate off both plants through the season. I canned 2 1/2 pints of tomato juice. Looks like I will have a tray of red tomatoes mid week. I deboned chicken and made broth. I am thankful that when Hubby ran a metal fastener from the old fence through 2 of his fingers that he had a tetanus shot and it only went through meat of his index and middle finger. He pulled it back out himself and I washed and bandage. The one could have used 1 or 2 stitches...no sense wasting my breathe as I know he wouldn't go get that done so I taped it. Looked good when I checked it last night .I am thankful the last of the old fence is down. That leaves the old dog house that has metal roofing and it's fence and the old clothesline poles we pulled out (they were 4 ft off the ground. Pretty worthless for anything buy small items) that need concrete beat off them and he can haul the old trailer and all the crap on it like old appliances the kids couldn't get hauled away to the junk yard and get a bit of cash from it.I am thankful I have stayed away from family. Even though it ticked off Hubby's parents. His sister's son has covid, he has been in and out of the grandparents home since he goes to school around the corner from them so NOW they understand as they have to turn friends and family away and stay home themselves.

I set pics to Daughter 2 as it was the one she was going to throw away in 2007 and I took it home. Said it was the best $2 she ever spent.I am thankful that Daughter 3 and her two oldest were not hurt worse when a car pulled out in front of them. Kids were not hurt at all. Daughter 3 broke her heel and is bruised and \"burnt\" on her arm from the air bag. She was pinned in the seat. Not surprised as she's only 4ft 10 and sits almost on top the of steering wheel. She was in a SUV. If she had been in the small car she would have been crushed according to the officer that was there.  I am thankful her employer will work with her limits of being on her foot."},

SO I don't have to follow, bring him home and then take him back. Not losing 3 hrs of my time or the costs of running the dog truck doing that.I am thankful for the warm partly sunny day so I can wash all the bedding and furniture throws and hang them on the yard clothesline instead of one by one on a drying rack like it will be during the winter or freeze drying them on the line. I am thankful I figured out the laundry room window was not latching and allowing cold air to blow in. Some of the felt weather stripping had shifted and it was making it look like it was latched but wasn't. I shifted it so it would latch and tucked the weather stripping back in place. Windows are still on the punch list.I am thankful I was able to transfer \"paycheck\" as Daughter 4 now calls the money we send her for her bills this morning before she leaves for treatment so she could pay her rent this morning.

{"title": "Menu Monday, Frugal Choices.", "date": "Tuesday, November 3, 2020", "text": "I sat down Sunday night and made the menu. We then decided to freeze the Brussels sprouts so I figured I would pull out the last roasting chicken this morning to make room for the sprouts.There was 2 roasting chickens. I think one was Son 2's as its smaller than I buy. I told Hubby I was roasting both. They will take less room with the bones out of them and I can make the pot pie and a pot of soup from the birds after a meal of roasted chicken. They are in the downstairs frig thawing.  SO a change in the menu already.I am definitely ready to be done with the green tomatoes. What ever is left after I can another 16 pints is going to be left to turn red... if they don't turn, sometimes paste tomatoes don't, then they can just go to the compost. No one else wants them.I called Hubby's finance guy (since we now each have one) and asked it we could meet with him on the same day I have an appt within his area. He is two hours from us so this would save us a lot of time and money if he can. They are doing appt only and he was at an appt outside the office so we have to wait until the secretary gets a hold of him to find out. JUST an update, they decided due to our age and my surgery pending that we would do a phone conference. They offered ZOOM but we don't have that good of internet here for that. I've hung clothes on the drying rack and clothes line. Hubby went to the store for milk and heavy cream and brought home rolls and French bread that had been marked down. He felt since I couldn't bend over due to back injections that I didn't need to worry about making bread. They were priced lower than my cost of making them would have been.I put the clean oil lamp wicks I used last year in the windows again to stuff in the windows were there was a draft. Hubby turned the ceiling fans to rotate the other way for winter. I closed the ceiling vent in the front room so heat would not go up to that loft and put a heavy curtain in the stairway to stop heat from going up that way. Hubby went out and worked on replacing the old fence. He now has the south section done completely. That leaves the east section. He also mowed the yard mulching the leaves as he went. Two for one.I used the leftover apple tomato soup to make sauce (added homemade sauce) and made pasta for supper along with meatballs that I made and froze. Sliced some of the French bread and made it into garlic bread.I paid all our bills that was in or on auto pay (deducted, I just will check to make sure they go through). We have 1 bill still out, that is electric. Our propane company called as we had a winter fill at this time last year and asked if we needed propane... it's fine I have been turning temp down during the day and when we are gone. So that helps. PLUS Hubby got some air gaps closed up so that helps also.Back to work for me as I am now taking the brussels sprouts down and freezing them   I am thankful for our forever home that we designed for wheelchair as I talked to an older friend last night that has to walk the furniture as she can't get her walker through her home. Her youngest added railing so she can get out the back door from her bedroom if she needs to get out of the house from the bedroom. I am thankful for the sunshine as it's always a better day with sunshine.I am thankful the Amish man that put up a new rain gutter on the barn and hooked it to the field tile to the pond , checked the rest of the rain gutters and fixed ones he found not working right without add more to the bill. Now we have another section of rain gutter hooked to the field tile for the pond and the cubby hole gutters are one section instead of three and drain out the gravel of the driveway not under the front room and front porch. He also left a note that the birds had a nest in the north gutter but it was starting to down pour so he didn't mess with it. Hubby took care of it the next day along with putting screen in to stop it from nesting there. We had leaf covers installed when we put the gutters on... should have spent the money and got the one piece rain gutters. I am thankful that I have my pantry over filled, having to store cases of home canned goods in the upstairs loft as it will allow me to pass organic food to Daughter 4 as she fights cancer.I am thankful we can vote for our leader,we have a voice in who does win unlike other countries.What are you thankful for?"},

I was thankful that it was just snow flurries and a cold blowing wind and not worse as my soon to be granddaughter's bridal shower was yesterday. I am thankful she thought of me and texted me before the shower as I couldn't go due to needing to \"stay at home\" to keep safe from Covid because of upcoming surgery. I am thankful for the pint of tomatoes I canned and the 3 apples I had made the soup for dinner and the 75 cent loaf of bread Hubby picked up since I wasn't allowed to bend over after back injections made a nice addition to the soup with it grilled and cheese melted on top.Nov 2nd I am thankful that an old friend of my parents that is from the old neighborhood called me today to let me know she loved me and if she dies before my birthday she wanted me to know she would be singing to me then. She's not very well and only her one son is in and out of her home.  I am thankful my in laws texted instead of just showing up, not thinking about they shouldn't be in our home especially since they go out and not wear a mask  when I am waiting for surgery (veins in legs affecting my heart). I am thankful we can afford Hubby to turn down some jobs that would open the door to him getting covid and bringing it home to me. I am thankful, even though tired of it, of the green tomatoes I am still running through the food processer to can.

I confirmed my appt with the cardiologist that is checking my vein problems for today (Wed). His office called back since they realized I live over an hour away, they got the preapprove from my health ins to run a ultra sound before my appointment so I wouldn't have to make a two more trips. That is very nice. Son 2 and Daughter 1 and 4 warned me when they had ultra sound ran on their legs, they had some issues of keeping their balance. I can't keep my balance to begin with... LOL. Hubby can't go in with me so he is going to do some banking for the business and go look for snow shovels. Our Chiro office called to confirm we were coming for our adjustments on Thurs. They don't usually call but it was a new girl and she was calling everyone.My pain doctor's office called and left the message they had ins approval for my injections so to call them to schedule. So I called them back.... and they were at lunch so I had to call back an hour later. That is scheduled for Friday morning.Which means I won't be doing much more than sitting with ice on my back Friday. I won't do much over the weekend either. Do you ever feel like all you do is run to doctor's office or testing?"},
{"title": "Planning for November.", "date": "Monday, October 26, 2020", "text": "Finances for both us and Daughter are set. Both households need to stay on budget.

So I told him Hubby would ask around and get back to him by Thursday. He did tell me my earnings rate was up. Thought he would offer that. Hubby went to E and he is still clearing dead wood out of his woods and suggested H who lives on the other side of us and sort of behind . The back of his workshop is at the side of our back field. H wants to look at the trees first so Hubby is taking him over to see them tomorrow afternoon.We had smoked pork butt along with Simply Ming French Onion soup with apples. I switched the cheese to swiss as it was what I had. Decent soup, though we both thought we could have put the bread to the side instead of in the soup. I wouldn't mind some mushrooms in it. On the time consuming side and a light soup but went very well with the smoke pork. The shallots were costly, next time I will use a small red onion and add a bit more to the garlic. I added another meal of meat to the shepherd pie meals in the freezer. I cooked the hamburger for the mild chili and hamburger to make philly cheese egg rolls to finish bagging for freezer tomorrow. I cleaned and prepped red tomatoes for tomorrow. I cleaned out the frigs (nothing in them to toss!!!!) and gathered the trash (forgot my bedroom trash can SIGH) and Hubby took the trash to the road for pick up. Trash is anywhere from 5:30 to 6:30 AM. Hubby finished the air barrier in the side attic of the west and east lofts. They are what is commonly called knee wall attics. He has the north loft attic to do yet but it's a regular attic over the dining room ceiling so it's lay the barrier on the studs not staple them to the walls. I scheduled my appt with the back doctor, have to go in and do the ins paperwork for approval first. I scheduled my appt with the cardiologist as my primary thinks the problems with my leg veins is coming from my heart failure (I think there was a duh moment there with him) and I scheduled our flu shots at CVS to do before voting. We finished the leftovers.TuesdayTurned the tomatoes on to make juice on my way to the first cup of coffee. Gathered the last of the laundry and kicked the washer on. Made my bed and got dressed BEFORE I finished my first cup of coffee... not the norm for me as I don't move quickly when getting up. I think it's the orthostatic hypotension I have is the reason I don't. By the second cup I have the tomatoes cooling to be juice, that juice is going into chili. Laundry on drying racks and my emails and FB done and sat and read The Prudent Homemaker comments on her frugal blog. I had 4 things to do out in the garden that isn't getting done as it's cold and rainy and I am not chancing getting sick. Winds are out of the north and they are cold. I canned 7 pints of hamburger chili. Hubby decided he didn't want me to make sausage chili so I put those 3 lbs in the freezer to sausage gravy later. I repackaged bacon to make 6 of 1 1/2 lbs packages and put 4 of 1 lbs packages of smoked pork in the freezers.We had hamburger pie for supper.WednesdayWe left the dogs in the house, first time in a long time. It was storming and Rascal and Charlotte don't do good with storms. I put the trash can on the front porch so Wilbur wouldn't get into it. Figured we come home to someone's mess as Charlotte has not really had to hold it longer than four hours. She still gets one of us up during the night. NO MESSES at 6 hrs.I had to be in Centerville for an appt to start the paperwork needed to get my back injections, a 2 1/2 hr drive and had to be there at 8. Got that started.Pit stopped at Daughter 4 and gave her organic veggies I had and my juicer.Got home and both of us took a 2 hr nap. I cleaned the jars I canned and Hubby took them down to the pantry for me to put away later. I rewrote my to do list as in 10 days I start NANO and want to get most of the stuff done before then. I know I can spend 4 hrs a day writing NANO.We had chili for supper.Thursdaypea soup fog this morningDaughter 4's 36th birthday. She had her first external radiation treatment. Scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursday for the next 6 wks. Said it wasn't as bad as she had planned for it to be. Felt like a sun burn on her stomach. Her daughter said she fell asleep around 4:30 and woke up at 10, ate a salad and salmon, risotto and green beans for supper and went right back to sleep. We got our flu shot and went and did early voting.I washed all the bedding and furniture throws besides regular laundry as this looks to be the last or next to last warm day for it.We finished 98% of the outdoor work including gardens. There are a couple sq ft gardens with strawberries ,1/3rd of of the north flower garden and the berry trellises that could just a bit more work but if they don't get done this fall it's okay. It's a lot better than last year. I planted 4 types of garlic taking 4 of the 2 ft by 8 ft garden boxes and transplanted walking onions in another 2 ft by 8 ft box.We finished the chili I didn't can and snacked of apples.Both of us tired and chilling... I usually have side affects from the flu shot, Hubby usually doesn't by I am thinking this time he is going to.Storming tonightFridayCheck on Daughter 4, she said that she felt like she had the flu along with eating something super spicy (radiation can feel like that) that burned all the way back out. Said she tried to work the night before but the storms was too bad so she didn't call in to deliver anything. She does Door dash. Also told she wasn't going to work any as she was told when she called Door Dash this morning that her county is almost to purple on the coved 19... that is level 4 the worse that can be. SO she is staying home, we will all suck up tight budgets with us supporting her.Hubby started  working on replacing the perimeter fencing between the pond and E's pasture on our south side. Going to take a lot of time but he figured he could do it off and on.I made meatloaf patties (instead of loaf) and meatballs for the freezer. Sorted the last of the red and green tomatoes to work on over the weekend. Made 2 hot sauces... 5 more to go and if Daughter 4 ever buys her dad something like this again SHE can make the stuff instead of me LOL.We had meatloaf patties, mashed potatoes and hot pickled cauliflower. Apples for a snack.SaturdayI finished red tomatoes !!!!!Still have a wagon full of green ones. I did another hot sauce... four more to go.Hubby did some \"taxi\" driving for the Amish. They had a wedding on Thursday and a death of Friday. He helped get those that were needing to change bus tickets into town to get that done and then were they were staying over the weekend. He picked up calzones and popcorn chicken that a few of the Amish got together and paid for as a thank you for helping them as he didn't accept any money for being taxi. We don't when it's an emergency and having a family member die the night of a wedding qualifies in our mind.So we had the popcorn chicken with butter garlic dipping sauce and split a calzone. Sunday Day of rest... I did dishes and a load of laundry to hang on drying rack as the loads on Saturday were more than the drying racks could handle. Damp again today.Hubby carried down the canning to the pantry and I put them away. I went ahead and cleaned out the frigs... NOTHING TO TOSS 2nd wk in a row. I checked the finances for Daughter 4 and we decided we were going to run money for her from my personal acct instead of the joint acct. She put herself on a budget that is less than we figured and she wants it weekly like a paycheck since that is what she is used to and she knows what she pulls out when. She figures habit will work over the brain fog she knows she will get with the chemo when that starts. I have her set until Jan.I checked our finances, put in for the transfers (as I don't keep money sitting in accts that don't make much interest) and when it comes in so Nov will be mostly paid for. I cut our budget to cover Daughter 4 budget. Organic non processed food is going to take a good bite above what she normally buys.We had arugula salad with apple, pecans, bacon and feta cheese and split the second calzone for supper.I have at least 1 doctor appt due to problems with veins in my legs and maybe if the insurance processes the paperwork for the back injection I might get that one in also this week. Fingers crossed.How did your week go?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "On Budget", "date": "Monday, October 19, 2020", "text": "Since we are also supporting Daughter 4 we are double checking the budget every day. Granddaughter said something about money and Daughter 4 pointed out that she shared the budget with all 3 of them (2 sons and daughter) so they would know what was going on. They wanted a pizza and Daughter 4 wasn't willing to pull money for a pizza so the 3 kids chipped in and got a cauliflower crust loaded with veggies. Daughter 4 thinks she has automatically bought take out when ever the kids asked as they don't live with her,*her medical put her repeatedly in the hospital so the kids lived with their dads to stay stable. She was able to pick up some work this weekend (starts treatment Thursday) so used it for oil change, gas, vet bill, dog food and groceries. We went to the store and got hamburger for 36 meals (Shepherd pie, taco meat, eggroll meat, meatballs and meatloaf) to fix and put in freezers. I will make chili with some of it and can that . I found some beef roast marked down that I cut into chunks for stew and froze that also. I got 3 lbs zesty sausage for chili for Hubby. I eat the hamburger one.We caulked the north window in the front room. HAD the caulking. It was allowing air to come in from the sides of the window frame. No condensation on the inside window now.I have used the clothes lines or drying racks for the laundry. Been raining or 30 mph winds have been blowing.Hubby burnt some stumps to get that done off the punch list. He used scented oil for oil lamps that triggered my asthma so it was not wasted.I am still , some more, what ever canning red and green tomatoes. Apples are next and then brussels sprouts . Kale is being used as fresh  as I have plenty dried for soups. I dehydrated the tomato skins to grind into powder for my supplies. I got a bushel of 48 lbs. Honeycrisp apples for $22 Local store would have been $109.92. I got a bushel 48 lbs. Mutsu (crispin) apples for $11 for $80. but would have had to ordered them and was warned they would be bruised in shipping. I found a recipe for green tomato apple pie filling to can.A friend across state sent us a medium size box of medical supplies she no longer uses including a nebulizer that will be welcomed in the Amish community.We ate mostly from the menu. The one night we had pizza from our favorite place over in Sidney as I ended up with 2 doctor appts at the last minute and wasn't getting home until after 6. (homemade pot pie was on the menu) The pizza along with 2 salads made 4 meals. Gave me time to go later to the store to finish the shopping.Rest of YEAR groceries will be dairy, some produce and 1 turkey breast to smoke and at least 2 hams if not more depending on room in freezers. And 1 prime rib roast for Christmas eve size depending on that kids show up. Usually it's one of our boys. I have been having some vein issues in my legs. My primary decided to send me to a cardiologist instead of a vein specialist so I could get my heart failure check up at the same time. One co pay and one appt. Right now I have to have my legs up for 10-15 minutes a time,  4 times a day I harvested some volunteer kale and swiss chard from the north gardens. I might get one more pick.I mended a skort and one of Hubby's shirts.I turned the furnace off a couple days when it was warm with the sunshine. I found out that if I turn the bfast bar ceiling light it gives enough light off to see over the entire kitchen and dining room otherwise I have to turn on 2 or 3 lights.Hubby used dirt from a pile to contractors left 2 yrs ago from digging to install our water lines. I said something about I was tired of seeing the pile at the deck. He mentioned he had left there so he could use it to fill in holes on the property. SO I took white fence posts (used for electric fencing) and stuck on in every hole I had found. The dirt is now down by half and we know next spring we will need more since he burnt down 6 tree stumps and dug up the field tile.  At least we aren't buying dirt for filling.Have a safe week everyone.Blessed Be"},

{"title": "We have set the 2021 budget", "date": "Monday, October 12, 2020", "text": "On average since Jan 2, 2019 our budget has floated from $8794 to as low as $5062. I've tracked the changes which sometimes incurred every month and the reasons why it changed. The average is $6,690. SO with our health insurance changes, higher co pays and 1/3rd increase of out of pocket. (OUCH). AND doing worse scenario for Daughter 4 not working (her doctor doesn't know if she can handle doing Door Dash while in treatment) due to cancer and keeping her in her own home. I just added her $18000 (not counting medical costs) into our budget. She needs $1500 a month to run her home. AND I am paying extra each month on the mortgage. We come in at $5500 for us and her $1500 is $7000. Hubby asked how that could me when it's only $310 more than what the budget averaged with increased insurance and daughter. What did I change?Insulated curtains on windows. Keeps the propane down and the electric as the furnace is not kicking on all the time. Opening up house in morning to cool house down and closing curtains when the heat of the summer day comes in. Opening curtains in the winter to help keep lights off and warmth brought in. Covering the crawl space vents at the heater ductwork. Same thing.Turning down the heat when furnace is on, turning OFF the AC when we leave when it's on. Right now I turn the furnace off when the mornings are no cooler than 55 and I have the furnace set at 70 (68 in the dining room where the thermostat is is 63 in the front room and too cold for Hubby even with long sleeve flannel shirt over his tee shirt.)Turning off FANS when not in room.Not using the dryer except to defur dogs beds. I have started hanging out the pillows and blankets to air them out instead of fluffing in the dryer. They actually smell better that way.Using an oil lamp for mornings at the dining table and a candle at supper... Not for romance though he thought it was. Using LED through out the house, using LED for night lights so we are not turning on bigger or more lights. I turn off coffee pots. Unplug computers. Unplug phone chargers You would be surprised what vampire electric appliances cost you. Keeping frigs and freezers full (they run less). I changed where I get my BP meds because I can't take blue dye. I am now paying $5 for 90 instead of $25 for 30. Our prescription meds goes up next year and might costs us more than Good RX will. I just have keep track of what and where I get our meds to see if I can get this amount down. The electric bill hit over $200 last year for 5 months. It only hit $166 once this year the rest of the time it was $140 or lower. This month was $105... $45 lower than last year.I conserve water from showers etc. to water the dogs and plants so the softener isn't using as much salt.  We have dropped 4 bags a year in usage (our salt is based on water used). That saved us $32. PLUS we just have them bring 8 bags and what ever doesn't fit we add later saving 1 service call of $50/yr.We have rerouted the field tile to go to the pond except one that goes to the county. We will be having some more spouting put on the barn to tie into the pond field tile so we won't need to be running the water pump to put water in the pond to keep the fish alive. That should be happening in the next week or so. Amish is doing it when they get out of the field.He got the internet/house phone dropped down from $125 to $85.Our house insurance and car insurance dropped down  and then the umbrella insurance got cut in half. I started pricing dogs items and cut the price by 1/4th. Vet wants them to have dental treats as they fight if you try to brush their teeth. Instead of cutting them in 3rd I cut them in 4ths so I have and extra 10 days of the dental. Vet okayed that change. We changed vitamins for them that include the things that Wilbur and Rascal needs and it's okay if Charlotte has it also so I don't have two to three different pills to shove at them. They all hate taking pills but okay with chewable. They think it's a treat.I cut back on buying chips, Fritos, tortilla chips, chip dip, trail mix completely(he now makes his own) and granola bars. I cut back on candy bars (both of us). I buy these items at the dent store along with cold cereal there also. Though this time Dollar General brand cereal was actually cheaper. I will go back to making yogurt.I cook from scratch... that takes my time and has at times been an issue, but to stay healthy (so I am not spending so much out of pocket ) I need to cook from scratch.I buy bulk when it's cheaper, break it down and store it. I change the non food as the cleaning rags are right with the paper towels. I use Bounty select a size and still will tear them into 4ths when using them if that is all I need for a smashed stink bug, or in half for grease. I use less than needed with cleaners.  I always price out furnace and frig filters before buying and I buy for the year if I can get them cheaper.I grew a lot of my herbs/mint teas this year cutting that out of the budget. Last fall I spent over $250. On herbs and teas. I didn't need to buy any this fall.I cut the grocery budget by $400 a month... first I went back to only going every 2 wks instead of every week. Second I started back into making a lot of my own mixes. Third I change where I bought what I didn't grow and save a lot of money on produce that is organic. The garden budget has been cut in half. I have saved several of my own seeds and found Amish that are growing some of the produce that will save me money also as they are willing to barter.Since I am not running around much and not going to Son 2 's to take care of his cats as he's not going either for work. My maintenance and fuel has dropped by 3/4ths. It also dropped my car ins.Daughter 4 is looking over her budget again with her 3 children to see if there is any where for her to cut also. Paying off the house early is going to make the difference of living only on SS or needing the IRAS to help pay the bills. Do you set a budget for your finances?   I was walking up from the gardens and glanced across to E and M's and noticed their woods behind them. I just stopped and looked at all the colors that are changing. I went and got my phone to take a picture . I miss not having maple trees up at the house. We have 2 but they are across the acre behind the oak trees.  M's garden is pretty much down except what she left for fresh eating. Said she might have 1 or 2 canners left but she's thinking to just harvest it and put it in the spring house for fresh eating after this coming weekend that is suppose to be low 30s in the mornings. She was washing bedding Friday and Saturday. This week is curtains and her fall cleaning of both her house and the \"Dawdy Haus\" Grandpa house will be completed. Her parents used to live there before they moved back to Indiana to live with her brother. I have 136 things I want to get done before the end of the month. SIGH. I moved the rest of fall cleaning to Nov. Figured it would get me up and moving around since I know I will be sitting 3-4 hrs a day writing for NANOWRIMO. That's 50,000 words in 30 days (1667 about/ day). How is your Autumn going?"},
{"title": "Heaven's it's Wednesday. Hubby birthday on Friday", "date": "Sunday, October 11, 2020", "text": "Okay... Tuesday I did laundry and hung on kitchen porch line. I washed the curtains, shower curtains, bath mat of the wheelchair bathroom and shined the window and mirror. I washed the inside of the front room windows, took down summer sheers and curtains, washed them . Bathroom and front stuff went to yard line. I hung winter curtains in both rooms. I cooked the last of the 3lbs of hamburger and make taco meat. Divided by 3, put 2 in freezers for later and had tacos and tortilla chips with salsa for supper. I canned 8 pints of diced green tomato(first for doing this).Hubby did his last haul for the produce auction and picked up a load for Friday to deliver pipe for fencing. He finished the field tile.Wednesday... it's 11:30 and I am waiting for the second canner of diced green tomatoes to finish and then it's off to the gardens. Laundry is on the kitchen porch line and the dishwasher that didn't get ran last night is now running and I can reload when I come back in. I will check the dehydrators while waiting for the canner.Wednesday after supper. Hubby flex sealed the basement casement windows. He covered the crawl space vents to keep the cold from going across the heater vents. He put away the garden hoses, did a fly bomb in the pump house (said there wasn't many but did it anyways), he covered the AC. I reloaded dehydrators with more greens. Put laundry away. Set today's canning aside so I can check it tonight and again tomorrow. Cleared 40 of the 104 tomato plant. Was going to try to get half done but my back decide it had enough and I couldn't bend over. Guess that is better than not being able to straighten up or stand up. Hubby had elbow mac with chili over it. I had it with butter and mushrooms. And we have called it a day. OH wait. Daughter 4 said during her check up (and weekly covid test) they did another ultra sound and her doctor is checking with another doctor about instead of doing a port and Radiation ... they might do IV with radiation. Less chance of her getting infection and there is a slim chance of doing External radiation... For her sake I hope the external. ThursdayMy back is a bit cranky, Hubby suggested I wait another day before going back to the gardens for tomatoes. Work at winter curtains and dealing with what I have to process already in the house. We need chili in the pantry... so that has to go on the list.  Daughter 2 gave me 2 cases of chili I had made her (her money and my time)she found when she moved that are too old to eat(five yrs to be exact). They were still in the boxes and she thought the boys had finished them, the boys didn't realize the chili was in the boxes and thought it was gone. SIGH. Said now she takes everything out of the boxes and puts the boxes in the garage to put empty jars back into. Lesson learned. Her man cooks so he is now making chili this week. She's the \"Box and can\" cook in the family.Hubby started the morning (after coffee) turning the gas generator on and running the house on it as the \"test\" for this year. He will let it run low on fuel before turning it off to keep the fuel fresh during the season. He burnt another stoop. Cleaned out the purple martin bird house and covered it for the winter. He also cleaned out the other small two on the north side of the house the sparrows use. The only one left to clean is the wren house that is getting moved to the garden as that's were I found the nest. I don't think they like the dogs being that close.  He also moved more gravel around for the trailers to sit on instead of their back wheels sitting in dirt.I harvest the last of the herbs I am doing this year and they are in the dehydrator. I have grinded the last of the greens for the greens jar so done with that and the tomato skins for tomato powder. I dehydrated more kale and more red tomato skins as I finish the tomatoes.I finished the fall decorating. I washed more winter curtains and hung them in the bedroom(making due as I haven't found anything to make curtains for this room) the laundry room and the bathroom. Washed the bath mat and the shower curtains for this bath also. I put away summer dress clothes and brought down some sweaters and long skirts to wear. I have no closets in this home.  I use a pipe Hubby put up that will hold 7 hangers of clothes. The rest of my hanging clothes is on 2 clothes racks in the south loft. Hubby has 3 wardrobes for his hanging clothes, either in the wheelchair bath or right at that bathroom door. FridayMy favorite photo of him. Today  is his 62nd birthday. He is hauling pipe for fencing for the Amish. E is with him. M sent over caramel iced cinnamon rolls last night as she knew today was his birthday and it's his favorite that she makes. I told Hubby since we decided against going to Lock 16 for his birthday (we have a bridal shower and wedding coming up in Nov and Dec) He could decide what fast food he wanted to have for supper and I would order it, pay for it and go get it. He laughed as he knows I hate talking on the phone. I'm okay with paying or getting it.We spent a quiet morning until almost noon since he wasn't hauling produce to the auction and talked about his personal goals for this coming year. It's something we do on our birthdays. He decided that he wants to lose twelve pounds, practice his welding this winter (he used to weld all the time at the factory) and depending on the pandemic go deep sea fishing next  year with his buddy. Then he went off to haul pipe. I have did the finances for the last part of the month. Checked his business finances so he didn't have to. Did the regular laundry, then started washing bedding, dog beds and furniture throws since it is a great day for that type of stuff. Ironed dining room curtains and marked where the button holes will go as these will be hanging with shower curtain hooks at request of Hubby. Actual sewing will be on a rainy day. Cleaned the iron.  I ordered my Humira, making sure they were sending it to CVS and not my home. Aired out the bed pillows. Checked Facebook, emails and here. Checked on ALL the kids and a few of the grandkids that was dealing with crap due to pandemic.  Swatted stink bugs and spiders more than a dozen times that seem to come in every time I open the door. I've ignored the 2 dozen spam phone calls but it takes my time to go check the phone...will be thankful when the election is over.   He chose Philly steak subs , I added a side salad for me. He was definitely on the dirty side and was thankful E went with him as they had to hand lift all 350 pipe over a 4 ft high rail off the semi. The pipe weighed 150 lbs each. DOG TIRED.We called it an early night.SaturdayLeftovers are being ate today since there is enough of them instead of me cooking something else. Hubby off hauling hay. I have the second load of laundry going as I had to wash what he wore yesterday separate as they were that filthy.My morning jobs are, laundry, unloading the dishwasher and reloading the odds and ends,  clearing both emails, checking Facebook, checking here, vacuum packing frozen hamburger patties and frozen green tomato slices.  Updating our health insurance elections for next year.  THEN going to the gardens after that is done.  Be back later.I finished harvesting the last 8 bags of potatoes. I won't be growing potatoes next year. Take up way too much space for the little bit we get. I can buy the from the Amish or the Mennonite bulk store for less than what it costs me to plant them. I've tried 2 yrs now. This ground isn't good enough >>YET.I cleared 1 1/2 boxes of tomatoes before calling it a day.SundayDaughter 4 called to tell me I have been hacked on FB. I have yet to figure out how someone in Chicago can hack my acct without my password. I rewrote our to do list as there was so much marked off that we couldn't figure out what was needing to be done.  Hubby did paperwork for the business. I in with Daughter 4 to make sure she is staying on track with her budget. Her son was there visiting and he double checked what she was doing. All 3 of her kids are doing what they can for her.I wrote out the menu for dinner for the coming week. Hubby and I don't eat bfast very often and we  eat different times for lunch. Most time's he is walking out the door before dawn and doesn't come home for lunch . Since he doesn't do eat and drive, he might grab a couple granola bars or trail mix he makes for himself to eat while waiting to be loaded or unloaded.Sunday :(today) Tomato soup and lunch meat tortilla wrapsMonday :Beef roast (saving some meat and broth for noodles in a couple weeks) with carrots, red onions and white potatoes. Will have pickles and peaches alsoTuesday : Burritos , Spanish rice with black olives and carrots and celery with ranch dip. Custard or flan.Wednesday: Double crust Turkey pot pie *white potatoes, carrots and peas* with a veggie platter of celery, yellow and red bell peppers. Plums Thursday: Leftover pot pie and salad as we will be going to appts and the grocery store for the major stock for this month.Friday: homemade pizza, sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, banana peppers and a salad.Saturday: Philly Cheese eggrolls (new recipe), store bought frozen pot stickers , veggie tray and fruit bowl. Blessed Be everyone"},
{"title": "Fortune cookies/ Oct. goals", "date": "Monday, October 5, 2020", "text": "Hubby's was the top, mine the bottom and both of us was laughing. He had bought us take out the other night. He comment was the problem was Daughter 4's cancer, the stepping stone is because we are buying her organic food if we don't have it ourselves and the rule is now we (her daughter that is expecting, Daughter 4 and us ) must take a picture of what we are eating...maybe we all will be eating better. Finding her organic food, fresh veggies and fruit is going to be hard during the winter. Goals for Oct.Stay healthy as I know if I get cold and wet I will get sick. Decorate for fall.Clear the gardens including north flower gardenClear all pots.Finish processing the food from the gardens.Transplant spring bulbsTransplant fall bulbsTransplant walking onions Plant the garlic (after 1st frost)Shell the dried beansFinish making the hot sauces Daughter 4 gave Hubby for Father's day.Fill all the oil lamps Get hamburger, veal and ground pork and make meatloaf and meatballs for freezer.Make noodles to dry for pantry.Wash and dry (clothes line or drying rack) summer curtains and put in storage.Weather strip north front room storm window.Fix the dining room winter curtainsMake winter curtains for French doorsMake winter curtains for bedroomContinue seasonal cleaning. Still working through  drawers, cabinets and shelves. I'll start cleaning outside windows this week on warm days that are above 68.Hubby will help with clearing the gardens and planting the garlic. He also wants to finish the last field tile, burn the last two stumps , test the gas generator , cover the AC, cover the crawl space vents at dining room (they are right at the heater vents so sucks all the heat during the winter) Finish the air barrier in the north attic and the east/west attic. I would like to have this done BEFORE Nov 1st... why? Because Nov 1st is the start of National Novel Writers Month that I try to do yearly. That's 50,000 words during the month of Nov. Average is 1667 words a day or around 15 words per min for less than 2 hrs a day.Financially... Daughter 4 gave us her budget, her daughter will help keep her on track of paying the bills on time. We estimated the groceries on the high side as I figure I won't always be able to pull a variety for her to eat and she must eat a variety to stay healthy. She will pay everything she can first and then let us know if she needs help (a week before it's due). BUT in our finances I planned for the worse so we could cover her completely.Then we did the finances for the business for the slow time is already starting to happen. There has been a bit of an increase as several decided to change to pipe fence instead of wood or barb wire. Last a lot longer and the animals can't shove through it. That will give Hubby 2 jobs for this month that he didn't have. He has 2 maybe 4 for the produce auction and that will finish it.  We figure he needs 6 months for the business. The house budget got cut in some areas and increased in the others. We did decide to continue to pay extra on the mortgage.  When Daughter 4 is recovered and starts paying us back that money will also go on the mortgage. We figure 2 solid years after last treatment for her to be back up and ready to start repaying the debt.I need a basic grocery list... instead of I would like this on this week.  We will be going to the store once a month for basic, then Hubby will pick up milk when he is already out when needed. What do you have planned for Oct?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Thank the heavens it's a new month ", "date": "Sunday, October 4, 2020", "text": "My uncle (by marriage but we never count that part) just died and we were going to go to the viewing until my cousin let us know his sister has covid and is not quarantining and was going to be at the viewing. Cousin said the sister's kids had already warned the funeral home. Uncle Sam(yes that is his name) will understand why my brother, our kids and ourselves didn't go. I understand her need to see her brother...the funeral home offered a time for her to just come in so they could make sure everyone stayed safe and she refused. Just and FYI , he was a retired cop and his Buddy's know she's positive. Rock and hard place and I hope that she works with the funeral home. Meantime we all stayed home. It's been a rough week that we all got through.I had to rework the budget. Daughter 4 is working Door Dash and said she made enough this week to pay her mileage on her car and get her furnace fixed (which is taken off her rent)plus her credit card, phone and car ins so she's now working for mileage for the rest of the month and next month's bills... BUT we have agreed when she can't make the bills we will pay to keep her in her own home. Her budget  is $1500 a month including organic food. She is hoping she doesn't have to pay out of pocket for her Lupus meds but does have GOOD RX if she does. She is filling out paperwork every day, has some to take into her oncologist to finish filling out this week as she goes in for blood work etc. Her first radiation is supposed to be the 21st but she hasn't had that confirmed by the treatment center yet.Hubby had enough jobs to finish paying off his bills for Oct with his business except 2 filing fees that are due quarterly. He is sure the few jobs he has lined up this week will pay them. Makes he feel better that he is already working on paying Nov bills. Late Nov to mid Feb is his slow time for hauling. He burnt stumps that was here when we bought the house,  this past week along with mowing the entire 2 acres and E's pasture on the south side of us. AND did the trimming. He cleaned out the basement ramp and made sure that drain was cleared and redid it's roof as Charlotte had knocked part of it loose and I worried Wilbur would go across it and fall in. It's fixed so it won't shift now. Since Hubby jumped on it I can say the dogs won't fall in on it. GEEZE.We are looking at the to do list and decided we would see where we stood this coming weekend. I shelled dried beans and cooked up some hamburger to bag and freeze for quick meals. I have a list as long as my arm to do this week. Finish clearing the gardens (killing the mole GRR). Plant spring bulbs, transplant fall bulbs etc.Going to be a busy month. I thought about a menu, wrote it up and then after we didn't go the Uncle Sam's viewing I tossed it as I would have had to make a special trip to town for the stuff. We will just wait until we go to chiro and get it then. Hubby pulled out 1 lb. of frozen turkey breast for Monday. I think a pot pie might be nice or ala king over rice. I would like a good part of the to do list done this week... We will see how much gets done.Do you have plans for this month?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Daughter 4 with cancer and credit card fraud.", "date": "Monday, September 28, 2020", "text": "Start of my Monday was letting my youngest know I am thinking of her as she was in the waiting room at the Oncologist to start jumping the hoops to get the stage 1 ovarian cancer dealt with. 12 weeks radiation, 4 weeks break, 16 weeks chemo (iffy on whether she will lose her hair) and then maybe surgery. Her lupus is affecting her treatment.The Oncologist gave her the number and name of a company that hires those going through this stuff a part time job and works with them. AND his office is helping her get medical coverage as Amazon warehouse let her go so she has no income and no ins. The Oncologist changed her diet... she has lupus and the beginning of Crohn's and now cancer... Nothing processed, canned (glass jars ok , metal not) fresh not frozen best, no deep fried, fried, microwaved or fast food. Unbleached organic flour (bread and pasta). ORGANIC everything. In season for a price... well , it's OHIO there is cabbage, brussels sprouts kale and some beets. Winter Sq and pumpkins. Maybe sweet potatoes and potatoes but lets get real, give it a month if that and it will BE NOTHING in season. Even if she hadn't lost her income , living expenses with medical expenses (she had a 70/30 plan with $2000 oop) isn't going to leave much for organic food where she lives. She can't live with us (her 5 dogs won't get along with Rascal or Wilbur. Charlotte would be okay as 4 of the dogs are her parents and siblings) because our income stops her from getting assistance on the medical side We already know due to a friend paying her adult child's rent on a regular bases that if the money is regular it is considered income when they try to get help. Her daughter was in the hospital off and on for 6 months and couldn't keep a job because of it. We can't chance Daughter 4 not getting the assistance. What we can do is put food on the table and in the dogs bowls. We can pay the vet bill that happens ever 3 months. Her daughter is taking over the laundromat costs. I can pay for the gas in the car as it's MY car. She already contacted her utilities and they asked for her Oncologist to fax them a paper so her electric and gas are down low enough her 15 yr old and 13 yr old are going to cover it . Her trash can go to her daughter's also. That leaves rent, water, and car ins. We will figure it out. AS she will do better where she is as our nearest cancer treatment center is over 45 min from us and her's in 15 and they have a program that they have a nurse that will stay with her IN HER HOME for 30-60 min after treatments to make sure she is okay.While dealing with figuring out diet and getting her bills paid, my credit card texted and asked if I had made a purchase to Modere... I didn't even know what it was so the answer was no.Credit card fraud, Then found out my credit card was missing. I know where I used it last and the moron that stole it... actually had what they bought sent to their HOME. so it's not going to be hard to nail them. They had to have pulled it from my purse while I was at Walmart I had it in my wallet, I didn't zip up my purse until I was walking out the door because the card was with the receipt I showed at the door. I remember wrapping the receipt around it and putting it in the outside pocket of the wallet in my purse but I don't remember zipping my purse. Lesson learned. I am glad they caught it wasn't the norm for me and I did find 2 other charges I didn't do which is how they got the address of where the packages were sent to.  IFI hadn't been buying medical stuff I wouldn't have had my card out to begin, I'd paid with cash. I need to go deal with produce though at  this point I would rather take a nap."},
{"title": "Another week , the size of great grandbaby", "date": "Sunday, September 27, 2020", "text": "yep, baby is the size of a grape. My granddaughter tells me on a regular bases how big the baby is comparing it to food. She found an app for her phone that does that for her.  She said she hadn't checked this week as she was going to go to the doctor for a check up.It's Monday, clean frigs, gather trash and take to road, do the weekend laundry.... normal Monday chores... add on 2 bushels of green tomatoes that got sat on my front porch LATE Saturday NIGHT.  I have one bushel sliced onto cookies sheets and in the deep freezers. Tomorrow I will vacuum bag them. I took the core out and then put the end pieces in containers to make green tomato relish (NO CABBAGE). That will be when I have 7 lbs of ends as that is what the recipe calls for. I also canned 4 pints of pickled watermelon rind. We have never had them so not sure we will like them. I washed another load from the Rubbermaids. All the clothes lines are full along with both drying racks of sweaters. I think I only have curtains and bath towels left to do along with decorations. dog blankets... Yeah I know they are still needing washed. I still have red tomatoes to harvest and can. I really need more cookie sheets LOL. Homemade noodles and chicken over mashed potatoes and pickles Tuesday Hubby unloaded the dishwasher while he was making coffee and reloaded it and actually turned it ON.  He got a couple calls for rides. H and B needed a ride to go see B's cousin that was hurt bad in an accident. Then he had to take H to E as M's cousin in Indiana died from cancer. Funeral is Thursday. Trying to make sure the kids not going are taken care of and the farm animals are taken care. They will be back Friday morning. I vacuum bagged 140 some slices of green tomatoes that I had frozen on cookie sheets. I reloaded those sheets with more sliced green tomatoes. We batted around some thoughts on the finances for next year. Waiting to finalize it when we know what our health ins will be fore next year. We chose 2 different budgets also thinking things might change with the election.I washed and dried another load of winter odds and endschicken and dumplings with odds and ends of veggies and peaches for dessertWednesdayHubby was \"taxi\" today but did help me clear 5 garden boxes and mowed the north garden down after I finished picking what volunteered grew there. I pulled 6 different dried beans that I can shell later on a rainy or  this winter. I pulled turnips, kale, some red leafy (I think Asian red mustard but not something planted this year) cucumbers and some red chard. I harvest the last of the fennel bulbs and started cooking it to put in the freezer. I pulled small carrots the size on my thumb that I will clean and toss in with the relish of green tomatoes. I harvested chives.  Chives, greens, and carrots tops went into the dehydrators and I'll grind them up for the \"greens\" jar I washed the winter sweaters and let them dry on the drying rack.Leftovers for dinner.  ThursdayLousy day all around... the good news is I am not in the hospital... I ate barley flakes cereal and it triggered my tummy , thankful it didn't trigger the Crohn's but definitely can't eat a cup of that cereal and not end up in the bathroom most of the day. Doesn't help the tummy muscles are very sore with the amount of work I am doing that works the core. Five out of the 6 kids lost friends this week. Three of the death's were mutual friends. There was a total of 7 funerals.  I finished the paperwork for the life insurance Daddy left through his old employer. Was strange to get something from a company he retired from 33 yrs ago.I started the paper work to file for Social Security. I already know that I will get more (a lot more LOL) filing as hubby's spouse rather than my own. So I have to wait another month to file it. Since we didn't count on SS when we did our financial planning for retirement, it's an \"extra\". I Hubby ate leftovers. M sent cookies over before they left for a funeral on her cousin who died from cancer at age 31.FridayFelt decent but knew if I went full force I would go right back down. My uncle Sam is in the hospital dying from brain tumor that went into cancer. He has battled this for 2 yrs since my aunt died. They had gave him 6 months when she died.  We are praying he does not linger. I washed half of the winter curtains and found some winter blankets (not where they should have been) so washed those also. I shelled dried beans. But stayed out of the gardens since I knew I would over do it. We had loose meat tacos... not taco meat just hamburger that I had cooked for the freezer.SaturdayAll the winter curtains are washed and dried. The storm windows for the front room are washed and installed except one that the wind caught and flipped as we had it propped up to dry after washing. Shattered the glass so it's now at the repair shop getting new glass. Should be ready for pick up by Wednesday if not sooner.  I took the screen out of the kitchen window and washed both sides of window of it and put the screen back in. I harvest the sweet potatoes and treated the yard inside the fence for fire ants. Hubby mowed and did some trimming. He was hoping it was the last time but the back yard is already looking that it needs mowed and he did it 2 days ago. Hubby set a trap for a mole that is out by the road but working it's way up to the north gardens.I sorted green tomatoes out of some that are just turning red. I put the green ones in the frig as I will be processing them on Monday. We sat down , took a break and listed what jobs we NEEDED done by end of Nov. I broke it down to big jobs (all day or more than 1 day) vs small jobs that can be done in less than 4 hrs. He did admit the business costs more than he thought it would to run, it takes more time to make the money to break even let alone make money than he thought it would and he broke his own rule of NOT scheduling work on Thursdays( that's appts, errands and work at home day THAT HE CHOSE) and being home by 6. He is slowly starting the \"I can't do that today (when it's a late day haul) but I can do it at this time\".  He had one out of 6 tell him they would let him know as they would try to find someone else. They called him back in an hour to do the haul. Two of the other haulers have started it also as they were going through the same thing. One of the companies that they haul to closes at 3:30 so they have to have the load to them by 2 to be unloaded by closing. Twice now Hubby has had the load on his trailer over night. He now charges extra when that person waits to load him too late to get to the drop off.  since he can't take a load until that is unloaded. He told the other drivers he was doing that... the person quit waiting to the last minute to have the load hauled.Hubby picked up Wendy's since he was right across from it dropping off the broke window. Said he thought we needed to relax the rest of day. I think it was more he didn't want soup for supper and decided to take it out of his pocket money. SundayThe day of rest... I did pull a ham steak, box mac and cheese and a pint of green beans for supper. I pulled dinner sausage patties for tomorrow to go with sweet potatoes and cucumbers. M sent over a loaf of bread late last night. Hubby is updating some of his business files so when Oct hits he can just finish the last couple days and file. He has 2 reports to file in Oct. I paid the last bill for Sept... balanced the accounts and transferred the next month's income into the checking.How did your week Go? Blessed Be"},

{"title": "frugal days", "date": "Monday, September 21, 2020", "text": "Monday I canned 17 qrts of tomatoes. I put the tomatoes (core cut out) on a cookie sheet and put it in the grill. Five to seven minutes later the tomatoes skins were loose so they were put aside to cool. I did 4 cookie sheets per batch of 7 qrts. Doing it on the grill saved the propane that runs the house. I started harvesting the last of the sweet corn and we some for dinner. Brother texted me to let me know he was really sick. I reminded him that we nearly lost our Aunt due to infection in her teeth and he had just had an abscess under his bridge. YEP he has an infection along with low sugar (he is diabetic) and low red blood cells which runs in family. He is better, seeing his doctor on Friday for more testing and to schedule his \"70's testing... that's what he calls colonscope and prostrate testing. We finished the leftovers from the frig for our meals. Furnace to run at 70 at night only.Tuesday No canning or freezing though I did pick enough tomatoes to get a good start for Wednesday morning. Weather has cooled enough to cause to cause both of us to ache and be stiff. Still the furnace was turned off when the sun came up . I started washing flannel sheets. Put the clean summer sheets in the Rubber Maid to go out to the barn loft for storage. I am trying to do 1-2 loads each day of winter stuff and then put the summer in the empty Rubber Maids. They will go to the barn loft It's 101 days to Christmas or 95 days to Yule or 96 days to Kwanzaa... we are a family of several faiths.I ordered 10 shirts/sweaters from Thredup using discount and sales. I need something to cover the back of my arms and not long sleeve as it is annoying to have to keep pushing them up. I noticed the Amish women wear 3/4 length in sleeves so I ordered that. Brother texted, on bed rest... didn't remember he had already talked to me.... sugar was 59 .Hubby had a flat tire, one of the new ones and of course it was the inside tire of his truck (dually) . He lucked out that it could be fixed and only cost $20 and they put his spare back into it's place for him. Hamburger helper with carrots for dinner.WednesdayBeef roast was cooked for today and tomorrows meals. I will have enough broth(now in freezer) left to add some chunks of beef that are in the freezer to it and make noodles for this coming weekend.  I got 9 qrts of tomatoes canned and 2 garden beds cleared of tomatoes. I washed 2 loads of laundry and 5 loads of winter stuff... which Hubby for some reason decided to mow right at the clothes lines and threw grass all over every thing. Since I am allergic to grass... fresh mowed grass triggers my asthma horribly. I will be rewashing everything tomorrow on top of appts and errands. He took a picture of the busted drainage tile and took it with him to go buy field tile. The guy at the local lumber yard took one look and told him he didn't need to replace the whole tile as they had what he could use to splice it and make sure it didn't leak (2 different tiles coming together was the issue) . SO once more the cost of fixing this had dropped... Cost him $10. and 30 mins to fix it and fill in the hole. Still need to reroute the far drain... BLESSINGS ALL AROUND... except for rewashing laundry .... Thursday Leftover beef for supper... what a day. Hubby got a email from the state requesting a drug test in 24 hrs.... they do random testing. So he had to stop what he was doing and we pushed back going to do errands until he got back home, about 2 hrs. after we had planned to start out. I did get all the laundry rewashed and on line before we left.  We paid the truck payment here in town and then went to Sidney to make a deposit at our bank( they closed our local bank), went to chiropractor. Hubby dropped me off at CVS and I did the shopping (saved 50%)there while he went to Walmart to pick up sugar for M. He picked me back up and dropped me off at Kroger's( ours is closing next month so I am trying to get in the habit of going after chiro) while he went for fuel. Saved 45%. We shouldn't need anything until late Oct or even Nov besides dairy. FridayI got the flannel sheets and a blanket on the bed. Changed all the furniture covers to winter (we use old sheets due to dogs but Hubby likes a sheet in his recliner since that's his bed. Thankful a recliner worked for him since a cpap made his breathing worse. I roasted chicken and baked potatoes in the oven to help warm the house. At 1 pm I turned the furnace on and increased the temp from 70 to 72. It was 62 in the house. No sun what so ever to help warm the house. We did find we were going to have to find a new place to fax. Our library is only curb side right now and the local Kroger's is closing. Our phone company charges an arm and leg for that to be in the home. We ordered our brains AKA calendars, 5 subject note books as neither of us remembered to go get them when school supplies came out. Daughter 2 said I spent half what she did getting them for her youngest. I also ordered my journals for the next 2 years since they were on clearance and the style I prefer. SaturdayN showed up and said he was cleaning the hoop house so I could get my green tomatoes. Hubby went over to pick them and N had already picked half of them. Hubby picked the other half. N didn't want any money, but since Hubby was insisting he asked for $5 since it took him 30 minutes to gather them. Hubby gave him $10 . The common amount of an hour's work around here for pretty much everything. I got 2 bushels of green tomatoes for $10. N's wife E canned over 200 quarts of tomato juice during the week not touching what she had already put up. Hubby said there was close to 4 bushels of red tomatoes waiting for her on the table at her canning stove that she would be starting to work on Monday morning. I went through the green tomatoes, some I will allow to ripen, most will be sliced and froze. I did find  athttps://pickyourown.org/GreenTomatoes_WhatToDoWithThem.php#:~:text=Freeze%20Green%20Tomatoes%3A&text=Select%20firm%2C%20sound%20green%20tomatoes,freezer%20wrap%20between%20the%20slices.She doesn't flour or anything her green tomatoes before freezing. I will be trying this out this year. I still have tomatoes in the garden.Green tomato ends from slicing the green tomatoes for the freezer and the small greet tomatoes from the garden will make relish. Not thrilled with green tomato relish but won't waste it. Red will be canned as whole tomatoes. Looks like a good solid week of putting food in the pantry. The summer bedding and the furniture throws are in the rubber maid to be taken to the barn loft. I already brought the next one in to start on Monday.I made noodles to use the leftover beef and broth. Made enough of it and mashed potatoes to have for Sunday dinner. We hade watermelon as I sliced the one up and froze it to be bagged on Monday. I cleared the kitchen side of the bfast bar so I could roll out the noodles. I did a brain drain  HA HA. Wrote down in no certain order, everything that was needing done. INCLUDING using a cleaning routine for this house. I pointed out hot spots (places that gather clutter including the cardboard box sitting next to Hubby's wardrobe) that bug me but keep filling back up. The cardboard box has the American flag that needs fixed... wind ripped the hook ( not the flag) that holds it to the top of the pole. AND the old \"barn\" coat that Hubby was going to through away as it is ripped up and worn out beyond even rags. He said he kept it so he wouldn't ruin another coat. I asked him how many coats he has because I can tell you now he has another one he could use as a barn coat as the cuffs of it are almost gone. We looked at our punch list per room and realized we had stopped looking for some things that we wanted to use for organizing the house. We decided to order a lamp to go between the recliner and couch, a roll cart to go between the washer and dryer and a roll cart to slide in the cubby hole in the bathroom.   I looked around for the correct size, the best blah blah blah and decided to wait one more day to order.SundayI checked what I had put on hold to order. Two things had went down by 25 % so I ordered everything. I played a bit with the finances as we know starting next year we will both have social security (2nd and 3rd Wed of the month) My IRA from Daddy will come in the 15th (date he had used so I kept it). We have bounced around when to get Hubby's IRA set for.... Hubby said the 1st but by time it comes all the way through it's the 3rd or 4th which puts the mortgage late. I can pay the mortgage with the social security but what we had planned out isn't set for that. So I will rework it to see if that is the way we should go and still get his IRA on the 1st. Otherwise we need to cover an extra month before we start his IRA next year. I'll work both it both ways and let Hubby decided since it's his IRA.We got a FEDX delivery... on Sunday... not the norm for around here. Down in Son 2's area he even gets regular mail on Sunday.  It was the doughnut pan and doughnut mix for baked doughnuts for Hubby's birthday. He was excited even though his bday isn't for a couple more weeks. I usually bake a carrot cake for Autumn celebration, he asked for his apple cinnamon and his pumpkin spice doughnuts to be made instead. I got part of my shirts from Thredup. We had the last of the beef and noodles and mashed potatoes for dinner.He decided to finish the field tile so it was done and off the list completely. He will be working on it this week when he has time. I will start prepping the house for winter. Getting around for storm windows to be put on next weekend and hanging winter curtains. He will put the insulation boards back up around the foundation in a couple areas. Blessed be"},
{"title": "When needing a lift.", "date": "Tuesday, September 15, 2020", "text": "I found this picture on the internet several years ago. I wish I could find who posted it and thank them. The lady looks close to how my Nonna looked and that is my favorite apron style, more of a canning apron style. The kitchen looks like the one I grew up in. Not a kitchen she ever cooked in but she did sit in the rocker and watched. When I am being over ran in the gardens, canning and freezing until I stumble in tiredness like today, along with a bruised knee due to Charlotte running head first into me. She was chasing a bunny. At least she didn't knock me down though she staggered herself .  I go down to my pantry and look at the full freezers and then the pantry shelves.If I have empty spots going into fall I do NOT have enough. We decided to have at least 18 months solid of food in the pantry/freezers and with acknowledgement it could stretch to 2 yrs.YES really... Hubby said something about the  freezers, I told him we have to eat 2 whole chickens, a pork butt, 6 lbs of  shredded turkey and two beef roasts before Thanksgiving. I need room for the hams that goes on sale at Christmas. I know I need more tomatoes (which are right out there in the garden that needs cleared for winter and I need to do my own so if I need more I can let N know) I need green tomatoes which are coming in the end of the month or the beginning of next month when N clears his hoop house for the winter. I need 180 qrts of tomatoes for the year. If I can in pints, double that to 360. Pizza sauce is done and that's not in that count.. I have 30 of the 6 oz jars.I have a dozen of store bought tomato paste.  I have 63 qrts. I am short 117.If I can the same amount as I did yesterday I will be done in a week... Need to really focus on that... 9 days as I don't can on Sunday. Means I will know if I am short before N closes down his hoop house. If I can I will go help him close it down so I get a discount on the tomatoes or even free.E ran into the guy that built our home. He said the spouting on the south side of the house and off the east and south side of the barn should be running to the field tile that goes to the pond.The only thing that should be running to the county tile is the west side of the barn and it goes to the corner of the property towards the county line.  So E and Hubby went out and checked. They found blockage on two of the lines that was mud.... M remembered her brother who lived here before N did  used to wash the garden stuff in the pump house (main drain to the pond) BUT they wouldn't have used much water to do that so the dirt from the veggies blocked the line. N and E, when they lived here used the water they used to wash veggies to water in the hoop house so it didn't get\"wasted\". E helped Hubby unplug the two lines so we only have 1 line to repair and then Hubby can put in a field tile out at the corner of the property to run the barn tile to the pond. SAVING hundreds of dollars. Other savings... We decided to not turn the furnace on even though it was 42 this morning , high is to be mid to high 70's, until the house drops to 68. That makes the front room 64. Hubby can't handle anything colder when he is sleeping. I am hoping this year that room won't be 4 degrees lower than the rest of the house. As we keep insulating /caulking where we find air leaks. I've had to use the drying rack a couple times at night to finish drying the clothes that didn't dry on the clothes line after hanging for hours.I open curtains and blinds to the sun to warm the house, shut the windows and doors in afternoon before it starts cooling down to keep the warmth in the house.Hubby got milk when he was picking up meds so no special trips to the store.We got a free meal from an Amish couple. Hubby and they had went to an Auction... we didn't get anything but on the way back the wife asked if I had supper waiting. He said no, I would fix it when he got in. They asked if they could use his phone to order pizza. Sure , he even had the number in his contacts. They placed their order while Hubby secured the load. When he stopped for them to get their pizza , they had ordered 3 for their family and 1 for us. We ate it for 3 meals. Instead of using the whole package of smoked sausage I split it between baked beans and jambalaya. Other wise Hubby would have ate 3/4 of the package by himself. I made corn bread to go with the baked beans and sausage (cooked it together) and Hubby ate the last of the corn bread for his bfast. We bought 1/2 gal of orange juice. Daughter 4 bought a kit to make hot sauce for Hubby for Father's day. I have tomatoes and onions and lime juice but the one called for OJ. Hubby got the cheapest he could get. SO we will have to focus on drinking what we don't use. He was taking back a med I had gotten that I can't take due to blue dye. They found out the warning system they have wasn't working so they gave me free meds along with several coupons... they also switched it to cash payment instead of insurance as it saved me $200 as they used GOOD RX for the cash. I said something to Daughter 4 and she said she very seldom uses her ins for meds as she usually can get it cheaper with GOOD RX. Even if it means there are dishes sitting in the sink, I do not run the dish washer. unless it's completely full. So instead of every day it might be every one and half days.   If I am washing pots and pans by hand, all gets washed by hand. Same amount of water is being used.We are saving shower water, canner water etc to pour down the drain that goes to the pond. Even with the 5 inches of rain we have had last week , the pond is down 3 feet from where it should be but the fish are no longer in danger of dying from lack. I thought it was 2 ft but Hubby and E measured it when tracing for the tile. Scary thought as the pond is only 8 ft deep at it's deepest. We know because we had pump put in to circulate the water,aerate, in it for the fish that is tied to the windmill we had put in.I harvest seeds for lettuce, red noodle beans (heirloom) and Bergen dried beans.I traded a large \"family\" size of toilet paper I can't use due to allergies for a loaf of bread and 2 pies.We are reworking our plans for the garden. Hubby now knows who will grow what on a regular bases and they water (hose and Honda motor ran by gas on their wells) so we can figure out what we REALLY need to grow on our own.We would like to add more fruit trees and get rid of 3 trees that are not making anything.We bought some trees to plant last year. When I sent a picture to the company they refunded my money as there are 6 that didn't get get leaves or show any signs of growth. I really felt when they sent them, they were sending by zone not by what the weather was doing. I also let them know they were delivered when we had freezing temps and that's when they told me to send pictures to them this fall if they didn't do anything. Was nice they kept their word but I won't refer them or order from them again.I started washing the winter bedding, did some of the sheets today and hung them on the line. Are you prepping for the fall and winter to come? Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Hubby cracked a joke ", "date": "Saturday, September 12, 2020", "text": "about me writing out everything that should be done in next 4 weeks which is when we usually get our first frost which last year was a freeze.... then I handed him the list and got a lot of \"I forgot that wasn't done, I need to find where I put the stuff to do that (aka lost in the barn)... and finally, guess that wasn't a bad idea to do.I came back with \"does that mean it was a good idea?\" Sometime we annoy the crap out of each other. I definitely annoyed him when I called him as he was in Kroger's picking up my meds and told him to bring supper home when he knew I had supper already planned ... I had burnt my hand 3 times and decided I wasn't touching the stove the rest of the night. ALONG with I stepped offthe kitchen porch NOT at the steps while turning to see what the dogs were doing.... not bad but it's a 2 foot drop to the ground and I ended up grabbing the tree branches to slow that jolt down. I was done for the day. A little sore this morning but have had worse working in the gardens. He was MORE annoyed I stepped off the porch. When we redo the kitchen porch (stuff is here) we will widen it so there is actual flooring on both sides of that kitchen clothes line. PLUS I can put pots there to get rain instead of moving my pots out into the yard when it's going to rain. Which annoys him when I forget to put them back up on the porch and he has to stop mowing and move them.I broke down the lists... produce. gardens.outside work. fall prep. insulation. and projects not done but the stuff is here. Produce:fire roasted tomatoes (starting that today), green tomatoes, relish, 7 types of hot sauce (thanks to Daughter 4 that got that gift for Hubby for father's day knowing I would be the one making it) pickled onions , more tomatoes as I clear the gardens. I have potatoes, sweet potatoes and onions to still dig, dried beans for soups to pick and shell and beans to pick and shell for seed for next year. I need to clean the north garden of the volunteers of turnips, red chard, and 3 kales. I need to pull and process  seed from the field paste tomatoes in my garden. I need to pull the corn for the seed corn for next year. I need to cook and dehydrate the 5 pie pumpkins and dehydrate celery.I need to freeze Brussels sprouts. I need to clean out the produce gardens boxes  in the south garden and prep for transplanting strawberries in the spring.I need to make noodles and dry them as this can also be a gift at Christmas.I need to dig out the north flower garden that over flows with weeds every year. I am going to clear it (again) Move the hosta that is huge and over the sidewalk in the spring to the south garden area. I have artisan lilies that will do very well in that area and over whelm the weeds (that I will pull out by roots) like they did when we lived on Staley. I have cedar chips (termites and other bugs don't like them) to use as mulch. I need to transplant the walking onions as they have out grown were they are and are trying to plant themselves on the sidewalk. I will be having seed garlic coming in that will need planted also. Didn't get the varieties I ordered as they didn't grow well this year but am getting what I have ordered in the past.It helps when you order from the same company year after year.I need to prep the large pots to transplant the fruit trees in spring. I need to clear all the flower pots and clean them for next year.Garden stuff needs cleaned and put away, not tossed in garden shed like Hubby did last year. Winter snow shovels and deicer pellets (pet safe) needs put on porches and deck.Window scrappers put in vehicles . He can't remember where he put the shovels and scrappers and thinks we need one for the deck as Wilbur and Rascal are starting to come in that way more using the ramp instead of stairs.Garden hoses out to the horses need drained and put away, probably end of Nov as Eli usually keeps his horses closer to the barn in the winter time. I need to get the winter bedding, furniture throws, curtains and clothes out of barn loft and wash and dry (on clothes line). Need to pull all of the summer bedding, furniture throws, curtains and clothes and put in the barn loft for storage. I know I didn't get 2 sets of curtains made last year and have 3 curtains to change how they hang on the rod. Hubby needs to finish air barrier installation in north attic and dining room attic. Material is here. He forgot.Caulking, insulation board (on back of doors to attics and crawl spaces ) and outlet/switch insulation is still needing finished.He forgot this also.Not touching the deep seasonal cleaning ... I am still doing week 2 of drawers, cabinets and shelves but have done week 3 and 4. Week 5 is windows and curtains.I do https://nanowrimo.org/ the WHOLE month of Nov. Writing 50,000 words in 30 days.Kids want cookies and candy for Christmas. Projects not done but stuff is here.Fencing to replace the fence the old wire fence between yard and pond.Brace for deck top railing.Side boards for deck ramp Basement ramp walls and kitchen porch...this will be better done AFTER we fix the drainage problem. Was advised by ditch witch person to mark where we want the drainage and THEN measure for the tile so we don't buy what we don't need. Tower and antenna put up.Gravel spread on driveways. Probably a 4 day job with the tractor.SIGH but first is dealing with marking the place for the tile to be put. We might do that tomorrow as Hubby has 3-4 jobs already lined up and we have chiro and banking on Thursday.I have today's meal(what was suppose to be last night's) and tomorrow's meal.  So I need to plan menu tomorrow including what to bake. On to roasting tomatoes on the grill to can."},
{"title": "Why field tile called tile.", "date": "Thursday, September 10, 2020", "text": "The phrase \"tile drainage\" derives from its original composition from tiles of fired clay, i. e., ceramic, which were similar to terracotta pipes yet not always shaped as are pipes. In the 19th century a \"C\" shaped channel tile commonly was placed like an arch atop a flat tile, denominated the \"mug\" and \"sole\", respectively. Today, tile drainage is any variation of this original system that functions in the same mode. Commonly HDPE and PVC tubing denominated \"tile line\" is used, although precast concrete and ceramic tiles are still used."},
{"title": "Going line by line of the budget", "date": "Wednesday, September 9, 2020", "text": "this is field tile. Worse would be we need 1500 ft of it to fix the drainage here.That would be total replacement of what is here and add to what should have been here. That alone is $750. We know we can rent a ditch witch (machine that cuts the ground into a 5 inch ditch to put tile in at the correct slope for drainage) for $2000 for 2 days since it's takes a half of day to get it and take it back we lose that time plus Hubby would have to not work himself to do it losing more money that way. He is calling the guy a lot of the Amish use even though they say he is expensive...we know what it cost for us to do it.We can lay the tile our selves and cover it ourselves saving there. MEANTIME I need to figure out where the money is coming from.We could pull it from the IRAs or main savings but I would like to not have to pull it from there or all of it from there if we can get by I don't mind if we pull from month savings accts as I put each month in a separate savings to keep things straight for our son if something happens.Sept and Oct are in joint checking, Nov and Dec are in personal savings.Emergency fund is in main savings.I know Hubby will most likely not break even in his business Oct thru March as the produce auction won't be open and pallets have not picked back up. Amish won't be needing grain hauled or seed hauled or even animals hauled much.So we don't count on the business at all at this time.This year according to our tax person is BREAK EVEN which is is most likely going to do or be close to doing even with the pandemic which is AMAZING.Hubby gets his SS in Nov. That can cover Nov budget as we use that money in the savings to pay for the ditch witch. Daddy left an insurance policy that we didn't know about that will also help cover that month (it was through the plant he retired from so it's not much of one) and brother and I was wondering if someone was trying to scam us since we didn't know he had one still there after he retired 33 yrs ago. That should come in late this month.OKAY ... I need $750 .We cut 27% off the electric bill from last month (GO ME for following Hubby around and turning off fans and not turning on the AC until supper time if then) so that will cover 100 ft.... leaving 1400 ft to go.The jar money we made off the garden and making ice will cover 200 ft leaving 1200 ft to go.I can cut the dog budget for Sept and Oct (money in the checking) as no one needs shots until Dec and I have their vitamins and meds. That is another 200 ft leaving 1000.The kids and grandkids have asked for cookies and candy for Christmas... two also asked for measuring cups and spoons (yard sale if I don't have extra myself as I think I have Daddy's in the barn) as they would like to start baking (out on their own) I have everything to do that except peanut butter (they like buckeyes).  SO I can take the grocery budget over to the tile for Sept and Oct (in checking ) . Use  the money we get from making the ice for E and M for milk and peanut butter for Sept and Oct that adds another 200 ft leaving 800.I can take part of the money that is put back for Christmas and put on the tile, the other part will go to replace baking supplies. That's another 600 ft  leaving 200 ft. We give per family not person we have 6 kids, 8 grandkids out on their own. Great grandkids(5 with the 6th on the way) get cash, their parents put it in a savings as they all have like 6 -8 sets of grandparents/great grandparents etc so they don't want a lot of presents or it over whelms everyone.I paid the school taxes in advanced so I can move that over to cover the last 200 ft. Hubby is hoping that it's only half that . As we already pulled some from the Dec budget to pay for the rain gutters being fixed and added to."},
{"title": "Not a frugal week", "date": "Tuesday, September 8, 2020", "text": "unless you count we dropped off stuff to the 4 kids needing it and picked up the motorcycle at the same time. The rest was a down hill slide. Then we still forgot to get the lawn chairs from Daughter 2 SIGH. IT's okay Son 2 forgot to get the title to the motorcycle notarized so he will be heading this way or us that way again. Maybe Daughter 2 will bring it to us if she decides to come fishing LOL.We started checking out the field tiles that run to the pond... only one worked, it blew while we were running the water to fill pond so it was hunt to find where it blew since it didn't blow UP any where we knew it had to blow downwards and could cause a sinkhole. Two hours of digging, Hubby came in and said he couldn't even find the line... I went out and pointed out the TRACTOR was sitting on top of where the line should be. He moved the tractor and dug 1 ft from where he was digging and found it.One tile had a crack in it... the other one blew.He called a friend that had a ditch witch (digs  a ditch for field tile) and it was broke down. SO he is going to have to call a business to see when they can come do it. Triple the cost but got to be done. We will have to add more tile to connect everything like it should be but better in the long run.PLUS we are having the 2 yr old rain gutters fixed and they said it would be easier to run it so everything goes towards the tile or the pond it's self. They don't know why the contractors changed it since they didn't put it in any or the tiles that was already here and at down spouts. The head contractor already stopped using them right after we had them come back and fix areas that weren't right at all.We got beets in that we had bartered for and Hubby's mother then requested twice as much as she had ordered. I just gave her ours as I know that was pretty much the end of the beets. I repeatedly asked her if she was sure that's all she wanted and she said yes. We are fine with what we have but I definitely will be starting her order in the spring so when she says she needs more it will be easier to get her some. She also started looking for veggies to can relish (I call it picadilly) since she found canning lids in her basement. Hubby made arrangements to pick it up for her Friday when hauling produce. She will be paying for those as Hubby pointed out he had bartered for us to have half those beets and paid for hers. She could pay for the veggies she was asking for now. I thought it was strange as we don't usually have any of the family pay. His siblings that actually live closer and his brother that oversees his parents told him to quit giving everything to the parents. I guess  they are tossing food out left and right and then going out to eat or get take out. Except the beets... his dad eats the beets. Hubby went to get prescriptions, milk , dog food (on sale) and flex seal. He also picked up a fogger for the pump house as he has been battling flies there.We finally got rain.... way too much at one time as it was 4.5 inches (1/2 mile away got 6.5) in hours. Basement has some water in it. We got it blocked when I realized last night it was coming through the door and casement sills. That will be taken care of as soon as it dries out. A few things will be moved in case it happens again but most of it was up off the floor so it would get wet . We still need to add water to the pond. The guy that built the house told E he filled the pond himself running the pump 5 hrs a day for 7 days... it was completely empty when he started it. So that's nice to know.After we talked it over I ordered another dehydrator , plastic lids for canning jars for storage and more Tattler lids. These were not in the budget.Hubby felt we should get them now while we could and not chance waiting for next year. To keep the budget in line I moved several areas over to cover this. We can go without for a bit in those areas. How it things going for you?Blessed Be"},

We have an umbrella that will go between the two chairs on the left and I need to spray paint the small table.North railing. Metal chair needs welded, Hubby thinks he can get one of the repair shops that work on Amish stuff to fix it  and then I can repaint it... we had 6, I am not sure where they are in the barn but I want to make sure they are fixed and repainted by next year. We were going to put the grill here... no way now. That railing is vinyl just like siding and Hubby has already melted vinyl siding on 2 houses with the grill. Grill will stay on the front porch. Not a bad place as I very seldom get rain there but I do get wind so we put up a wind block.Rascal's crook of his tail at bottom of photo... that is what we see when he is walking on the ground besides this railing. Wilbur and Charlotte are watching Hubby pull the flat bed trailer in and parking. This is the west railing. The bottom . of all the rails are low enough to stop one of Rascal's balls from going off the deck.We might put lattice later in the open spots but right now I love the way it is."},

I did get the cool whip that was on sale and shoved 12 of them in the freezers and 1 in the frig as I am planning to make a icebox cake tomorrow. Poultry creamy enchiladas using https://theprudenthomemaker.com/creamy-chicken-enchiladas/  recipe. is for tonight. We changed dentist and my appt was today. I save $250 by switching as I was due for xrays. I got 5% also off as I wrote a check instead of using a debit or credit card. Hubby goes the 10th.I got the knack of canning with Tattler lids.I bought a case and figured if I use them 3 times, I can then count the rest of the times I use them as free compared to metal canning lids. They were also in supply where metal canning lids aren't.I made an extra payment of the principal of the mortgage. That saved us $958.40 in interest.. Our mortgage guy actually looked to see if it was better to refinance the loan or just pay it off early... when I told him how we were going to pay it. He figured we would saved 39% and next year it will be more as I plan to pay off this loan off in the next 10 yrs not 28 yrs as we have left on the loan. I really would like to do it in 6 yrs but with how things are going in the world I am not sure I can do that.We had ordered bushels of tomatoes (2 red and 1 green). Red will be juice and diced tomatoes. The Amish guy said if we were willing to wait until he cleans his hoop house where he grows them he would discount them by 50%. I've done this the last couple years. I even have gotten some for free as no one wanted them and he knows I am sharing with my kids and grandkids (GEEZE , grandkids living on their own SIGH) I mended my slippers.I harvest lettuce seeds and dried bean seed for next year.I harvested volunteer turnips, red and green kale and lettuce. I harvested the red Pontiac potatoes and set them to cure on the porch. I grew potatoes is grow bags. I put the \"used\" dirt in other garden box beds so I won't have to buy more dirt. Everything gets a good dose of fertilizer this fall and again in the spring.  I canned 5 pints of crushed tomatoes and 2 pints of tomato juice. I am surprised I got that with how bad the blossom rot is but there was one or two paste tomatoes per bush that was good even though they are about 1/3rd of their normal size.. Hubby's uncle lost ALL of his tomatoes to blossom rot. We worked on the deck and almost have the railing finished. We ran out of the one board so will be picking it up this week when we are already over to Sidney for appts and can go to Menards. I have rebate credit we can use for that. I mixed water with dish soap, shampoo, conditioner and switched to bar soap for hand soap in the bathrooms and liquid soap( scraps of bar soap mixed with water) at the sinks in the kitchen and mudroom.  I made laundry soap. I gave daughter 4 and granddaughter (her daughter) dishes and silverware we were not using. Our local thrift shop is not accepting anything at this time still.Keeps me from paying extra on the trash service.Blessed be everyone"},

When the statement is I don't know what we are going to do, do you have any extra?Canning lids for the Amish is the difference between having food during the year and going hungry.They even can their meat. M said she still had green beans and tomatoes to can. She still has meat to can...she can kill the chickens as needed and the pig could be smoked but the cow has to be canned.  Veggies and fruit are regular lids. Meat is wide mouth. I have 12 cases of wide mouth jars and 3 cases of regular jars with their lids and bands. I moved to the side for her. I gave her 10 boxes of regular lids I had. FYI she cans over 3000 jars of meat.It takes 3 qrts of meat a MEAL to feed her family. She does over 11,000 of veggies and over 6,000 of fruit. Today I am going down to sort through what I can and see what else I can come up with for her.  Hubby said worse would be we buy a freezer for their usage, that's a 16 ft freezer just for the cow.Going to be a rough winter for a lot of people"},

Even after googling the site it kept coming up a \"real\"... it wasn't. I am thankful my bank had not paid it yet so I could cancel it (easier than fighting a fraud claim).  Amazon also caught a fraud company stopped a withdraw and let me know about it.I questioned my car and home ins agent about a bill I got in my email (we get all those bills in paper mail) and it was fraud.Hubby got a bill for the business... when he checked it out, found it was fraud.Daughter 4's daughter totaled her car about 2 wks ago... her boyfriend when to pick her up at doctor appt beginning of this week and his wheel bearing went out and the axle broke. Yesterday Daughter 4 who was the one driving everyone to work (they work same place and same hours) had a hit and run driver hit her car while parked in front of her home while she slept. NO one in the neighborhood heard anything and it looks like it was intentional as it's square hit from behind to shove her trunk up into her back seat and moved her car 8 ft. Paint chip from the car that hit her was left behind so the cops are now checking repair shops but doubt if that does any good. She didn't have full coverage and doesn't have enough for another car or even a down payment as she just got back to work from the pandemic. SIGH. We took our jeep down to her and specified only she could drive the car.Charlotte broke out in hives. We took all 3 to vet ,boys got nails clipped and she got nails clipped and shot and meds that she has already figured out how to eat the treat and spit the pills back out. SO it's pin her and shove them down her throat. Wilbur is the best for taking meds. We also corrected Wilbur's birth date. Daughter 2 told us he was born in 2010 then grandson said, no because they lived in the old homestead when he was born...that's 2008 so Wilbur is 12 . SO I had the vet pull Rascal's original records when I noticed they had him as 9 ...he is 8 not 9 which is what I thought , they don't know who changed it on the record.  SO they are 12, 8 and 3 ... While at the vet, I ended up with Rascal and Charlotte and got pulled down by Charlotte who tried to run to the truck and Rascal stepped sideways in front of me... Lucky he wasn't hurt. I have a banged up knee and sore wrist. Hubby gets her for now on if on regular leash. I wrap a leash around Wilbur like a harness and can control him . I told Hubby we need to do the same for Charlotte as she has a lot of pulling strength and with a harness I could pull her up to her back feet to stop that. I do think I only fell because of Rascal stepping in front of me. Back to work ..."},

She had a sense of humor to the day she died. Even in her obit that she wrote in her final days asked for hats and silly masks to be worn so she could look down and laugh at us. She was 88.  I thought about how hard is has been to get seeds and canning supplies. I got some Tattler canning lids and STILL don't have it down how to get it right... I decided I was going to practice canning water LOL this week until I do have it right since I am already canning. I went through my canning supplies. I would get about half way through canning and be out of lids. So I am looking NOW until I find enough as I can over 1200 jars a year. I did find some at a decent price at https://www.ballofficial.com/.  I went through my seeds, checked what I needed. Bookmarked the orders (as there is 7 different places to get them ) and now am looking to see if I can find them cheaper somewhere. This spring I didn't get some varieties the do better in this area for summer planting. We need to order water for the pond. It is down dangerously low and we don't want the fish (over 200) to die. If we can't find a supplier we will be running the garden hose out to it to add to it daily to try to keep it where it is.Hopefully the rain that is in the forecast will actually come HERE.I am now dehydrating corn as I have enough room left for watermelon, cantaloupe and green tomatoes in the freezers. We have decided to start Sept 1st on eating from the pantry(that includes the freezers) instead of waiting until Nov/Dec. Mainly because with making ice for E we don't have that freezer for the turkeys and hams I buy in the fall. I do already have enough butter by buying here and there when it was under $2 a lb.  I am back to waiting on the dried beans to stop blooming and dry LOL. I have peach chutney to make and can, orange marmalade to make and can, cantaloupe and watermelon to cut and freeze. Then green tomato relish, picadilly, green tomatoes for freezer and canned for chili, tomatoes diced, chunked, sauce (pints and qrts) and maybe some juice to do ,tomatoes and green tomatoes are to be in this week or next. Hubby wants to change some things in the finances but we need to wait until we have the costs for the pond, canning supplies and seeds.How are you doing?"},

In the other dehydrator is celery from M and what I had picked up. That will give me enough for the winter as I will buy some fresh for celery salad and stir fries.I froze cauliflower and broccoli I had gotten. Not a lot but enough for a meal or two.I started canning the last of the beets M sent over last week when her daughter L knocked on the door and had 1 plastic grocery bag of green beans with the news of  her brother was bringing the second bag. OH well add that to the growing list. Hubby called to tell me he had local honey to bring home and we were being gifted with a fresh chicken as one of the guys had butchered 40 plus chickens.. Tonight is beef roast with M's onions and my potatoes... tomorrow is now chicken. I have cantaloupe ,watermelon and corn to process for the freezer.I have more kale, garlic chives and chives to dehydrate.I have plums, green beans, pears, (another gift)peaches (yes again) pickled watermelon rind, and pickled red onions to can.Within a week or 2  I will have beets for pickled beets from A, green tomatoes(sliced and breaded for freezer and made in to relish) red tomatoes ( picadilly , salsa  and sauce ) from N .I will dehydrate the tomato skins for powder to make paste out of when needed or add to taco meat etc Making noodles is still on the list also."},
{"title": "How many legs are your milk stool?", "date": "Monday, August 17, 2020", "text": "We had a real nice ride to grandson's parents in laws for his son's 4th birthday. She is half way between them and us. We had a nice masks/social distancing birthday party. We stopped to get baby formula for M at their local Walmart (was out like ours) but I got tomato paste, 25 lbs of flour ,25 lbs of sugar, 6 pack of root beer, 12 pack of Vernor's ginger soda (the only either of us can drink when sick), red ink pens and lighter fluid. I went through The Prudent Homemaker's site https://theprudenthomemaker.com/blog/  and ordered onion powder as I am not going to have enough onions to dehydrate and grind and yet do some as pickled, garlic powder as I didn't plant garlic last fall (I do hard neck over winter and will be planting them this year), cumin and thyme. I have a couple thyme plants planted this year and they are doing okay but not enough to get me next month let alone a year from now. I made 3 spice blends that I was out of. Emeril's essence, Tightwad Gazette taco seasoning and Paula Deen's house blend. There is an ad on tv that the spokesman (I think Tom Selleck) talks about retirement and reverse mortgages.... comment is you want at least 3 legs on the retirement milk stool to stay stable. We started talking about our milk stool and how one of us dying would affect the other's milk stool..Hubby will have Social Security, he has his IRAs , he has his business that he knows he could run into his late 70s as there are more than one hauling in their 70s around here.He would have my IRA's from Daddy if I died first.He has a life ins policy that if the loan is paid off it would have an annuity for him.I will have Social Security (based on his as there was no way my income would come close to what he was earning), I have Daddy's IRA's  I have my life ins that has an annuity that I would still get even though I have a small loan on it .I would have Hubby IRAs .That's not a bad milk stool for either of us... together the milk stool has 7 legs. IF the house is paid off we could do a reverse mortgage that gives us the 8th leg  None of the kids or grandkids want to live in this area so the house would be sold anyways.And since in 2008 at age 81 Daddy went to living on his SS only and what ever he made on side jobs and stopped using his IRAs to allow them time to recover from the nasty hit they took we looked hard to see if something happened could we do the same. We are short $100 a month IF we have the mortgage and the work truck paid off. I think we could handle it even if we didn't make that amount to cover it.Daddy's only issue (he had full coverage NO out of pocket FREE health ins from the company he retired from. Even when they sold the local plant they kept him covered under the home plant, he was very grateful) was putting food on the table.Brother, myself and Daddy's granddaughter from stepmother's side, put the food on the table for a year so Daddy was only paying for his milk and bread. When his IRA stabilized and he started drawing them again, he spent $40 a week at Aldi's and $60 a month at Walmart for non food items... He had enough TP, and paper towels stocked that when we cleaned out his house the 3 of us split it between us and none of us bought for 4 months. Hubby went down to the pantry with me (believe me he doesn't do that much) and we counted up meals with 5 veggies and 3 fruit a day along with 2 proteins.. can we go a solid year with only buying a bit of fresh and dairy? YES. THEN he stopped on the steps coming back up and asked if we could go 2 yrs. I was like... I could safely say yes to 18 months... Are we helping the kids or grandkids any or the neighbors? He immediately said yes to 3 of the neighbors, M &E as we could barter meat from them(they usually are yeast, flour, sugar and white vinegar (I know when she is canning pickles) and oil. I already have an extra month of that for that reason ... The other two are elderly (same age but in bad health and one is a vegetarian ). He thought about the kids  and knew who came to get food this last time.We have 6 kids and 8 grandkids out on their own.. of that group I would say only 4 of the kids and maybe only 2 and 2 of the grandkids would ask for help. But they would be looking for green beans, pasta sauce. pasta dried beans and rice, the one would be looking for Navy beans.I think he is more Daddy's than mine when it comes to his eating habits.They would take tomato juice and make sauce themselves. They would be happier with homemade noodles in water if need be. yeast and flour to make bread maybe.. I told him I would add 3 months extra to help neighbors and kids/grandkids. BUT I would need to change what we planted in the gardens or get off the Amish to build that supply. He thought about it for awhile and came back and said... 2 yrs pantry with the acknowledgement we might give 3 months away. So I went back down and spent Sunday, the day of rest, really checking the pantry...since I was down there I finished cleaning the shelves in there and did the herbs and spices. I decided to add more veggies. I am dehydrating celery (out completely). I can do pickled watermelon rind (will be the first time, the watermelon was given to us and I will freeze some of it) I can do tomato chutney and green tomato relish.  More salsa (easy with getting tomatoes from N in a couple weeks) Beets for plain and pickling are coming in then also from A. I can dehydrate the tomato skins to make paste or sauce as needed... that's just time pulling the skins when making sauce. I can dehydrate any greens we have come in including lettuce to make \"green\" powder to add to dishes. I will need to get carrots to can.  I have some odds and ends coming in from the garden to help fill the pantry out. Hubby told me to figure a way out to at least use the hoop house cover to extend the growing season some... I need to do that today. To me , having the full pantry is another leg on that milk stool. I can focus on the money going to the bills and not worry about feeding us as long as I have seeds... I will be focusing more on heirloom and open pollinated."},

Mother LOVED her stove and I definitely through the years had one close to this also. I would have had it here but wouldn't have had room for the Hoosier and sheet pan roll cart (used to be Son 2's computer tower roll cart) and the trash can. This is going in the barn. Goal is to have the front bay cleared, cleaned and set up as a summer canning kitchen by May. The front bay is where the young Englisher man lived while building this home. Then he sold it to Amish and doubled his money. I have 18 cups (1 cup is a meal for us) of corn in the freezer, more coming in from the garden. And 6 quarts of plain red beets with more coming in from the M and A that are being over ran. I am sharing beets with Mother in law. I already know she will be asking in the middle of Jan if I have any canned that she can have as she never cans enough for Father in law. We get tomatoes for canning in 2-3 weeks including green tomatoes for the freezer for us and fresh eating for Daughter 3.Drawers, shelves and cabinets has been this week's deep cleaning. It's hard to not stop and wipe down the outside of what ever but that goes with washing the walls week.I have finished drawers, shelves and cabinets in  the bathroom, bedroom except 2 of Hubby's drawers by bed(I ain't touching that), laundry room, bathroom, kitchen * not bfast bar *, dining room *not enamel table or one cabinet* front room , *not file cabinets* wheel chair bathroom, mudroom, north loft, and south loft.

The small desk there is not working at all for me and I end up at the dining table or the bfast bar as I use my laptop for recipes also.East loft ...was suppose to be my sewing room... it's a I don't know where to put it but it has to be in the house room. It's going to take a lot of work to figure that one out.Basement:freezer room, I have 3 shelving units that I need to change, some is stuff we were using that we aren't now and have not for awhile so probably box up and take down to the kids when we are taking tomatoes and other stuff to them in 2-3 wks. I have one that has claimed extra dishes and another wanting pots and pans while the 3rd wants baking dishes. Two of the grandkids have just went out on their own.bucket room (AKA washer room as Hubby always calls it due to the wringer washer sitting there)  The cabinet is done but there is a dresser and a pile of bags and boxes sitting at the buckets from where we moved in and it was brought in.Deadline for this area is also 2-3 wks as I know there will be stuff the kids can have.Pantry... this is okay... but I have 3 shelves a mess with spices and herbs along with I need more room for things that I have still coming in other areas.  My dried fruit has over ran the dried fruit area. I already know if I don't keep things together, things get missed and then goes bad.

I know I know but really.Shelves, drawers, and cabinets are on this week's deep cleaning list. Today it's the kitchen. AND instead of putting extra what ever's in the basement. It's in a box to give to Daughter 4 that will pass to those in need. I keep telling myself that.I found the pizza box in the oven on Sunday, it was supposed have been burnt over a week ago in the burn barrel. Washed the skillet and cleaned things off. moved the spices and put the bread box on that end as it keeps getting buried on the bfast counter... Lasted 2 days and it's a mess again BUT at least the bread box is not buried. I think the problem here is Hubby unloads the dishwasher when he is making coffee in the morning. He puts down the dishes that come to dining room on the north side of bfast bar either on the roll cart or the bfast bar.He also puts stuff the goes to the basement on roll cart instead of basement door in crate.It did look like this...it does not stay looking like this. At this moment there is hummingbird food, a bottle of original Listerine (for feet soaking) a tea kettle that belongs on the stove, sanitizer spray I made for wiping door knobs, switches and faucets on a daily bases, the clean bacon grease tin and a can of furniture polish added to the clutter... why furniture polish? As M, my Amish neighbor told me she uses furniture polish on her cook stove (wood burning) to keep things like boiled over milk from sticking. She suggested I use it on mine but make sure I didn't get it on the actual gas burners. Which of course I got the spray on them, Hubby took a wire brush and cleaned them and we found if I take a wire brush once a week to clean the burners they work BETTER and yes the polish keeps things from sticking to the stove top. AKA the boiled over potato soup... the milk crud wiped right off instead of baking and needing scrapped off.It looked so good but now I can't even see the radio or any of the table top. I don't know why Hubby put a Styrofoam cooler on the table but the rest of the crap is on me... extra plates I pulled from the china cupboard and paper crap . GRRR the eggs are put away and the tea chest is there now. There is sacks of food that needs repacked for storage and a cookie jar we don't use as it doesn't keep cookies fresh. A bouquet of flowers on the corner instead of the sprayer. There is two piles of papers and both my laptops (one on top of the other) sitting on the other side. This is always a battle ground. SO today is what L (M's oldest girl) calls kitchen work."},

He has all his papers together and asked I verify that so he didn't get started on it and then have to stop and go find something. He is filing on line, no person to person contact allowed. Will have to send his birth certificate.He went through his business books as he knows he has a limit on net earnings from his business. Said he needed to make sure the bills were paid before he bought things like new tires. If he had waited 1 wk he wouldn't have had to borrow money from the house acct to pay his truck payment. He has paid the house acct back. He got 20% off the tires by writing a check and not using his business credit card.He could have waited the week or month for fact until he got the money up for it. Lesson learned... on the good new side.... he is not only breaking even for the year, he has earned a profit of $500 a month on average... that's not a lot of profit (HA HA) but for the first year to even break even is a celebration and definitely not near the $18000 a yr limit of earned income for SS.I came back with I was taking the truck payment off the house budget completely so if he doesn't make what he needs it has to come from his personal acct. He's done well about not using that acct much since he retired so he could keep it open. His SS will go in that acct.Since J had asked I bring a budget in to decide on withdraws off Daddy's IRA , we pulled up this year's budget and did 2021's budget...I asked what our goal was ...Hubby said OUT OF DEBT... no loans, no mortgage... OKAY 2021 budget was not going to help that at all as it looked like it was the life of Riley. I went line by line. A few we disagreed on but as I said , if it is too tight we can always change it and pull more monthly from either IRA... He was thinking of paying off the mortgage in 10 yrs ... I set the budget ...the rest of this year, 2021 (and hopefully until end of 2026) to PAY OFF THE MORTGAGE and the loans.He asked how... simple, we pulled $110,000 minus 26% taxes for this passed year. Paid off little things and bought most the supplies for the projects (rest of gravel,front porch, windows and siding is the only thing NOT bought). We aren't going to get some of the projects done this year so they can go to next year while we save for the next projects. IN 2021 we will only pull $76,500 minus 26% taxes (we pay school taxes). That saved $33,500 up front What did I cut? I can't change the mortgage payment or the health ins payment (which might change depending on Hubby's old employer)and out of pocket BUT I can lower how much is going towards the out of pocket. Hubby never maxs that part so I cut what he don't use off our budget. I usually max out.BUT I just had my colonscope($17000) , Gyn and mammogram those bills won't be coming through for awhile. I can change over the counter costs so that was cut in half by using generic only.Electric bill: budget is $125/month... it hit $166 highest it's been since we moved here. July was hotter than normal with over 12- 90 degree days. Even was listed on the bill. ALSO we have fans running and 2 dehydrators. Hubby is bad about not turning off fans when he leaves the room or turning the AC to lower. HE won't be doing that now. I do not run the dehydrators during the day to try to keep the heat out of the house. I baked a meatloaf and some bread in the oven the other night instead of the airfryer and ran us out of the kitchen and dining room. Lesson learned. Bread has to be done early morning and the rest in the airfryer OUTSIDE on porch as it raises the temp in the room by 10 degrees it's self. Laptops have been left plugged in also.My duh moment.Water softener. We only use half of the average 2 person household. I collect water from showers and rinse water from hand wash dishes for watering potted plants or the herb beds. The water for the gardens do not go through the water softener.Our trash collector is the lowest in the area. Our internet gives us a land line for free and is the ONLY service in this are but is only $80 compared to my kids that are spending over $100 for just internet. Son quit Spectrum due to being over $100 after two years.I already got our house and car ins loweredWe use MS 365 programs (Hubby uses it for business and I for budget etc) We tried Open office but had problems with it working with other business programs he is required to use.Our cell phones are straight talk. Hubby changed from Net 10 to get a better and more up to date phone. and lowered his bill by $5 /month.We have Amazon prime... this might go away. At this point it saves more than it costs. I also have Kindle and it definitely saves as I don't buy books and our library doesn't always get the books AKA cook books  I want to read.Bday  Christmas/Graduation fund.... 55 people... we cut it in half. Depending of costs I might be making Christmas gifts for some.Dogs.... sigh..Wilbur had racked up the money in this area so far, I've postponed Rascal being checked for his ACL (he is not limping right now or holding his foot up) until we get the money from Dad's Ira. I don't see us paying for surgery(over $8000) and he is NOT in any pain even when he is holding it up. I do see a joint med being needed and Wilbur was on it and then came back off and needs to go back on it but our vet said to wait until Rascal was checked and see what the ortho vet suggested and just put both on it. Still I cut that budget. Instead of snapping the treats(actually dental stuff they need but if I call them treats they take them without issues) in 3rds I am snapping them in 4ths with an okay from the vet. That cut that budget by 1/4th and I always search for the cheapest before buying. Fuel... this is for tractor, lawn mowers, both generators, Red (dog truck) and Jeep Cut 3rd. Will use the gas generator with diesel as back up as gas is cheaper than diesel. That will leave the diesel for the tractor to mow and shovel snow. Hubby has a 500 gallon tank and is looking to see if it would be cheaper to fill it instead of running to town for diesel.Savings remains the same.Non food at zero for the rest of the year, $25 for next year. I will buy to replace what is used that way I will stay stocked up. The limit is set... groceries $65 for the rest of this year ($50 for stocking flour and sugar needed $15 for milk and maybe something we both decide on) Budget for next year $125 a month. I cut junk food... chips, (we will get tortilla chips from Menards using the rebate we got back) Peanut, cashews, M&Ms(Hubby mixes for trail mix) and candy bars(both of us). Soda pop (me me me... withdraw already as I stopped end of July to see if it was soda pop causing the high cholesterol as it's not what I eat, if this don't change it then it's family trait)Ice cream... I came make semifreddo instead as I do not have an ice cream maker. I cut dairy... cottage cheese, yogurt and assorted cheeses. This will be limited to occasionally instead of all the time. Fresh veggies and fruit will be in season meaning from late Nov to late April there is none since the hoop house went to the pond. I talked to M and asked how she got through the winter without the fresh... She said once a month to 6 wks she gets ice burg lettuce, carrots ,celery ,bananas, cream cheese and cool whip....if she is hosting church during that time she will also get cream of mushroom soup,mackerel and jello. She said she usually has winter squash until end of Dec. So she is just buying Jan thru April. We might add fresh mushrooms or bell peppers in that. She stores apples from fall until they start getting soft then she makes them into applesauce. Pears are the same. It puts a little bit of fresh on the table during the long winter... her words.Garden is zero 2020 and 2021 is $20 for preen and feed as I am stocked with miracle grow.House maintenance zero 2020 (have all needed) $25/month . If I buy 1 filter a month I can keep to that amount instead of buying a year's supply at a time. OR I can put it in an envelope and hold it. I've done that before.Vehicle maintenance ... cut in half ...work truck and the 3 trailers are taken care of through the business(HURRAH) Tractor, riding lawn mower, push mower, weed whacker, Red (dog truck) and Jeep come from the house budget.  Hubby can do some of it himself. We have mechanic that allows payments and doesn't hold your car until it's paid off. A Mennonite gave him a name of someone that works on mowers, that person gave him the name that works on weed whackers. They were 1/4th the cost of the place we had been taking them .Still have to take the tractor into a dealer but when it's in there they go over everything and they call to give an estimate before they start work in case you can't afford to get it all done. AARP... $2... not many places get us a discount around here but the couple times we had to rent a car it has saved enough to pay for 3-4 yrs membership.School taxes...we pay quarterly.These are paid in full for this year. I paid them early. Next year they will go up but I was already given the estimate of that now.SO the goal is to be out of debt in 10 yrs... I will add goal 2 to be as close to possible of living on SS ONLY and only pulling medical from Hubby's IRA in the same time frame.I pulled up a calculator for paying off the mortgage. I found if we put our part of our SS and part of Daddy's IRA on the mortgage we could have it paid off in 7 yrs not 28.... Saving over $150,000 in interest.... I also can take any tax returns to pay off the loans on the life ins. I already arranged payments on both that at least covers the interest on the loans.Propane will be pulled as a lump sum instead of a monthly leaving the money in to draw better interest. Also air barrier and insulation boards will be installed this fall to help keep the heat in and that should lower the propane needed next year. This year instead of needing a tank full that we had to buy off the contract we had 1 1/2 tanks left on the contract. I would like to see this get down to using 3 tanks a year instead of 4 1/2 to 5.We have an umbrella ins on the farm. Our agent rolled it over to the same as the other insurance when I had ins redone. I added it to the mortgage amt as that is were the rest of it is. I really struggle with change... but here  it goes anyways."},

I had to turn sideways to my left to not cause my right knee to give way. Banister is on the right... Hubby put this upNice and sturdy black pipe (my choice) and figures I stopped having problems with my knee LOLHe got this done off the to listFINALLY the gate. We will need to change how it is hooked to make it easier for someone in a wheelchair but right now it's hooked with chain and clasp like all of our other gates.I got the posts for the deck painted. Will have to touch up 3 of them when he cuts them. Though he was talking of flex sealing those areas as they will be against the deck it's self when ever he gets time to do that.Hubby had NO work scheduled for Aug. We were figuring maybe a couple pop up of jobs... He is now ran over. One job is twice a week for the whole month. He now has 12 jobs in the next 4 days (not counting Sunday).John, my financial guy handling my inheritance from Daddy, called and asked for a budget of what I needed for $$ for the rest of this year and next. He wants to make sure we are on same page. He also sold some stock that almost doubled my worth. Two days after he sold them, they dropped in worth about 50% so glad he is on top this crap instead of me. I hated reading the Morning star and following all that.He moved the \"profit\" over to the three stocks I told him I liked to be invested in more. Said it was a really good move and my brother also told him to do it since I said that. Tomatoes ripened over night, they are paste tomatoes and very small due to weather. I lost 3/4ths of them to blossom rot that took over half of each tomato. I did get enough to collect seeds for next year and make a small batch of sauce.I can always go over to N and get tomatoes off him as his is a hoop house and he grows to sell at produce auction and it looks like the blossom rot problem is improving. Got a couple cucumbers also that I will make refrigerator pickles with to go along with the couple that was given to us by V.I had to dig up the entire 2 x 16 box to find the last of the red onions . Meant digging up the petunias also that was with them.Not sure it the petunias will survive the transplant. That was an 8 hr job. AND I have another box of candy sweet onions to dig up still. The red ones covered a 2 ft by 8 ft section on the front porch.It cooled down and rained ... the dried beans have bloomed again or bloomed for the first time so I am back to picking them. I have 18 trays in the dehydrator of herbs and still have more herbs that need dealt with. I dug the Yukon Gold potatoes out of the 7 grow bags. Not as good as crop as usually. The other potatoes are still growing and blooming so I think these took a hit with the heat . Eight pounds when I usually get 15 to 20.I picked another round of blackberries. These will make syrup.4 made 1/2 cup worthHubby picked corn late last night also and put it in frig until I get to it today.  M sent over lettuce and 5 cantaloupe. E then brought home ground beef from a job where the women folk was the canning ground beef . No one wanted the last of the ground beef. M canned over 40 quarts and sent us the last 8 lbs as she wasn't even wanting to see it on the table for a meal LOL It filled a 1 gal ice cream container. We had hamburger patties, and today I am making a  meat loaf and a hamburger zucchini casserole(using the last of the zucchini that V gave us) for the freezer and some cooked to put in the freezer for tacos or what ever.So the weekly cleaning, and the deep cleaning is on hold. Food comes first. How is your week coming along?"},
{"title": "Good night Tuesday...Good morning Wednesday", "date": "Wednesday, August 5, 2020", "text": "UP at 5:45 as Hubby has 3 jobs today and had to leave at 6:45. He was suppose to only have 1 to haul to the produce auction but E was told at Church on Sunday to have Hubby call a person that needed pallets hauled to Tuesday...E forgot to come say something and forgot what he was suppose to say when Hubby went and asked after he got a phone call because the guy figured it would be confirmed by Monday afternoon. He also picked up another load of a person needing a haul this morning early. He ate bfast and grabbed a snack to eat while waiting to be loaded or unloaded at lunch time. Wasn't sure what time he would get back in so I am making tuna noodle casserole with shredded zucchini so he can reheat it if needed. I have been fixing supper at 5 (dinner to me supper to Hubby) and then watching the weather at 6. I ground up the dehydrated basil and jarred it.I jarred the dehydrated zucchini.I ground up the dehydrated carrot tops and jarred it with the other ground up greens.It keeps raining so I don't think I will be able to get out in the gardens. ...yes I was. It stopped raining after dinner so I went out and picked blackberries.I have dried beans I can shell while watching the weather tonight.Have harvested and shelled enough small red beans to replace the seed I had bought and put a couple meals in the pantry. Heirloom is good.Laundry is on the drying rack due to rain and wind. I spent the morning helping Daughter 4 figure out health,dental,eye and life ins from her new job. I spent last night after going to bed helping her figure out if she should take the legal offer and what her over time would be during the Christmas season.Then spent the rest of the morning helping Daughter 3 deal with a dog that needs a different home. She took in a friend's then found out the reason the dog needed to go was it is not good with young kids even though her kids are teens she doesn't feel comfortable with the dog. Daughter 4 helped find a home for the dog with a trainer.I finished checking rooms for repairs,replacements. I need a few things that might be in the barn in storage of Mother's or Daddy's stuff . So when we get to the cleaning of the barn (HA HA) I can pull that out.Nothing as in NEED right now.The ironing is done.Mending is done.I still have both bathrooms to clean but the towels and bath mats are washed and on the drying rack....did the Wheel chair bathroom that Hubby uses and moved my bathroom to a different day. Cleaning products odor got to me. I will pass the one cleaner to my daughter as she uses it but I can't stand the smell.I need to update finances before I do the bathrooms as a couple bills came in yesterday. Didn't get done and got 2 more bills.Bfast was oatmeal, lunch grilled cheese with cucumbers /onions in mayo dressing. We are out of milk so Hubby is getting that on the way home when he stops to get gas , the store is right around the corner from there. Hubby forgot the milk and didn't text me when he was getting gas... so when he went back out to deliver a message and drop his trailer off to be loaded , he went into town and got milk, and 2 bottles of Lysol cleaner and some flowers. GOOD MORNING Wednesday.Up at 5:30 as Hubby is hauling spelt (hulled wheat) to Holmes county. 2 hrs drive there, 2 hrs to wait for bags to be emptied (he will eat lunch then) and 2 hrs back. I have laundry out on the line, cool day (51 this morning) but no rain. Front room, front porch, which means dealing with the onions that are cured. Mudroom and back stoop is on the cleaning for the day.The cured onions will be dealt with. I am putting them in knee high hose and putting garden ties between them. The ones that won't hold well will be sliced and put in dehydrator that can sit on the smoker on the barn porch. Later this afternoon when the garden has dried up some I will harvest. I need to pay the bills and rework the budget. Dad's finance guy , John  wants me to bring our budget in so he can figure out the best way to get me the money to do what I want but not cost me my arm and leg for taxes. Hope you are having a good week."},
{"title": "GOOD MORNING  Monday", "date": "Tuesday, August 4, 2020", "text": "We were up earlier than usual this Monday so Hubby could take Wilbur to the vet to have surgery to remove a tumor on his right eye . One of us will go back to get him at 3.I had laundry on the clothesline at 7 a good hour or so before normal. I unloaded the dishes and put them away. I tidied all the rooms did a 15 min decluttering in the laundry room and walked through all the rooms to check for repairs or things that needed replaced or adjusted. Made that list so I can figure out what is needed to deal with that. GOOD start to this week.I harvested 3 out of the 7 grow bags of Yukon gold potatoes and 2 of the boxes of dried beans before the storms drove me back inside. I cut basil for the dehydrator.I put items that came in on Saturday away. Hubby went and got Wilbur... the tumor was on the eye lid not his actual eye (thank heavens) it had infected 2 teeth severely so the vet also pulled those and a 3rd tooth that he had broke in half from grinding his teeth. Hubby picked up 6 months of the Heartgard and Frontline for the 3 dogs. The vet is cheaper than every where I priced (I price it every time we go to buy it) saving us $35.97... then the vet office had a rebate that we could sign over to the vet and it gave us another $100 off the bill... so Wilbur's surgery, teeth pulling and meds sent home came out as FREE.They cut his toenails for free also. We had bagels for bfast , I had oatmeal for lunch and we had a skillet dinner of fried potatoes, ham chunks and onion for supper with bread and mandarin oranges."},
{"title": "How my parents made their living.", "date": "Monday, August 3, 2020", "text": "Mother worked as a bartender, housekeeper, grill cook, waitress, baby sitter, first aid worker for our small community, worked for the junk man who picked up junk on the streets and at the dump and would resell after Mother cleaned it and did repairs if needed. She took in laundry and did ironing. After the divorce she finally got a job at a western shop (we are in OH) and worked her way up to manager. In her 60s she went to being housekeeping at the local hospital.Then got married and went to working in a nursing home, then a tobacco farm, then running a apartment complex then working as receptionist at a community action center and her last job in her late 70s when she got multiple melanoma was cooking and delivering meals to seniors and shut ins.She helped my step dad work flea markets. She was very knowledgeable about dishes,furniture and jewelry. Daddy worked as his Dad's plow horse for the one horse plow Grandpa used when working the gardens. He was working with his dad cutting rail road ties with a two man hand saw when he was 9. He sold pelts to help his dad when he was in his early teens. They buried his mom on his 16th birthday. The next day Dad worked a half of day in the coal mines beside his dad. When he came out at lunch he told his dad he was not working the mines, he went to live with his oldest sister (14 yrs older than him (he was in southern Ohio hills and she was in Marion OH) and started working the lumberyards until he was drafted at 18 for WW2. He was medically released due to a busted appendix a year later. He went back to the lumber yard, then went to construction (his favorite) worked at the ice house, steel company, odd jobs when the plant shut down and then to tool and dye that he worked closed to 35 yrs at retiring as plant manager and did scrapping for metal through all those years... but he made his money being a gambler... he played cards (didn't matter what game) pool, dice, shooting contests and lottery. The only thing he didn't bet on was the pony's...that was my great aunt and she usually won...she also won regularly like Daddy at the lottery. It's how he paid off the house and saved for 4 yrs of private college for Brother."},
{"title": "August 1st... work to get done, changing the fall cleaning routine.", "date": "Sunday, August 2, 2020", "text": "There are several projects that hasn't gotten done that needs knocked out this month. We won't be redoing the broken hoop house this fall but if I can figure something out I might get another round of lettuce and radishes planted.Deck railing isn't done, nor is fixing the patio table from the storm damage.The basement ramp is not done.The kitchen porch is not done.The tower is not up.The gravel is not leveled out.I have peaches to finish, blackberries, tomatoes, kale, dried beans, onions, potatoes and herbs to deal with this week. I need to make noodles for the pantry also.I need to take the propane contract in and get that paid.I need to call the ortho vet  to schedule Rascal to have his ACL checked.I need to call the dentist that the Amish use here and see if they are taking new patients.There is 150 things still on the punch list of things to do on this home. The list is 2 yrs old at the end of this month. It started over 1000. It's August... time I start fall cleaning and getting things around for winter. Which means I change my routine...only I don't have a routine since we moved here. It's been more of fly by the seat of my pants kind of thing. Which is now bothering not only me but Hubby. I usually just clean one room at a time for fall cleaning after weekly cleaning.... since I only get the daily done and not the weekly I googled and checked out housekeeping routines and deep cleaning.During the 1950's the average time a stay at home woman spent cleaning the home was 42 hrs. Followed by 20 hrs of deep cleaning on top of 18 hrs dealing with meals. I added a few things to my daily. Changed the weekly and then worked on the deep cleaning. I ended up with 10 weeks with the acknowledgement it might be closer to 12. I don't see daughter 4 coming up to help as she just changed jobs. I made a menu of bfast, lunch and supper... I need to decide on snacks and desserts for this week. Tomorrow bfast is oatmeal. I placed it on the table. I can see Hubby grabbing toast as he is taking Wilbur to the vet at 6 am for surgery to remove a growth from his eye lid. They were going to do it over a week ago but his allergies kicked up and he had a nasty cough. Four days on steroids and it was gone but I kept him on them until they are gone as I know if I don't he will get the cough right back. Always does until middle of August. Deep cleaning schedule with decluttering/organizing included.Week 1Checking each room for needed repairs...do those repairs if we have what it takes to do so or put on buy list of what is needed to fix it.Make list of things needed replaced or remove things not needed Week 2 ALL cabinets and shelves...granted most in the pantry have already been doneWeek 3Closets (we don't have any but have 2 racks and 3 wardrobes) and knick knacks which actually belong to Mother and Daddy. Week 4Kitchen, all refrigerators, and check freezers to make sure none need defrosted (usually a spring thing)Week 5Pantry and the entrance to the basement from the ramp commonly referred to as either the washer room (wringer washer is there) or the bucket room as all the buckets of food sit there .Week 6 Lights, windows inside and out , winter curtains washed and hung, summer curtains washed and put awayWeek 7Walls... I have 19 areas of walls. I divided them up as four rooms a day ... and this is the week that might extend the amount of weeks. Week 8Floors...I have door rugs that will need cleaned.I am hoping to talk Son 2 into bringing his rug cleaner up and cleaning the door rugs and the upholstery furniture at the same time for me instead of just lending me the cleaner. Week 9 Give the furniture a good polish . Wash winter furniture covers and throws and put them out, clean the summer ones and put them in storage. Week 10 Clean out the garden shed and set up for seed starting in Jan and planting next spring. Week 11 Start cleaning the barn which will take a very long time to go through LOL But got to start sometimeThat puts starting on the barn mid Oct. Probably a good times as it's freaking hot in there since it's ALL metal. Do you do seasonal cleaning? Do you have a routine of daily or weekly cleaning?Blessed be everyoneDaddy retired at 60 and invested $30,000...that was what was left of his pension he took a cash payout of over 30 yrs of work  after he paid for a car in cash and paid off his and step mom's mortgage. Three years later he had to pay $20,000 for medical bills for experimental treatment that didn't save my step mom. So Brother and I thinking that even with Daddy living frugal etc and we knew he bought a storage unit company then sold it( or so we thought) we were thinking maybe a couple thousand left in his accounts. The man made his living as a gambler when him and Mother got married. His finance guy said he still was when he died, just did it with the stock market instead and he WON. He still had stock in the storage company sold it but kept stock in it, that has a dividend that pays around 4%. Oh yeah Brother and I kept that stock. With that inheritance and thinking of being respective of Daddy and having to close his IRA's within 10 yrs due to the current law... We are changing the finances. I talked it over with Daddy's finance guy who was his financial guy for over 30 yrs. He thought it was a good plan.Our guy was still against us filing for SS before 67.UNTIL I told him that Daddy's nursing home cost $9,000 a month, a friends mother in law's assistant living was $12,000 a month. Its suggested that you should have over $100,000 back for medical after you take medicare along with any medigap to cover medical expenses those ins do not cover.He changed his tune.What is the same... we are filing for SS at age 62...Hubby as soon as he gets a copy of his birth certificate as he didn't want to mail the original (can't take it in as we planned due to pandemic) as his birthday is Oct. I will file afterwards on him as I turn in Jan. IF the cut happens in 2035 in SS like they forecast it to be, we would lose over $11,000 a year so better now than later is our thoughts. PLUS it's money not coming out of our IRA.Also the same... Hubby's business pays for those expenses  and the truck. He can earn up to a bit over $18,000 NET profit before it affects his SS benefit...The hauler making the most money around here is working 6 days a week 12-14 hrs a day (hubby is more part time) and his net profit is $16,000. All of his equipment is paid off and Hubby still has 6 yrs to pay on the truck. Six and 1/2 months out of 7 he broke even. Some people think that is horrible and he should quit... as long as he breaks even he is paying off that truck and it's not coming out of the IRAs. To us that is a win.Difference is I will be pulling from Daddy's IRA and that money will go towards 2 loans against our life ins (from 2008 that we have been paying the interest only on the loans) and then extra to the mortgage.  We will pull from our IRA to cover what is left. Our SS together is close to what covers the bills now.As we were looking at how bad it could get and what we want to do... I looked at Hubby and told him 2008... when he went to 3 days a week  for over 2 yrs and we lost the house we had for us and the old homestead the Daughter 2 was living in and she wasn't making enough to even cover her utilities let alone the rent.What lesson did we learn then??? To have the pantry stocked (Daughter 4 , Son 2 and a friend kept food on the table and TP in the bathroom) to have a savings of 3-6 months and to have cash in small bills on hand.To grow a large garden and preserve it. We figured what we would have to pay on the mortgage to have it paid off in 10 yrs. that cuts off 18 yrs off the loan. Even it we get it paid off in 15 yrs that is still saving us money.So we went out and finished stocking what we could find, ordered some stuff and I updated the stock list. The only NEED is the OTC med I use during the winter/spring to keep from getting problems with bronchitis. I would like more Lysol aerosol spray... I use a can a month during regular flu season... but it's no where to be found right now. I have Clorox so I can make my own wipes. I stocked borax, washing soda, castile soap for general cleaning also. I do have Lysol and Mr Clean to clean with also. Our normal go to on stocking is 1 yr. But since I also bought dried beans (I can't grow enough)... I am going to focus on going 2 yrs.except for canning garden. We will see how this one rolls."},
{"title": "How we saved $5000 of the IRA withdrawl.", "date": "Tuesday, July 28, 2020", "text": "What is the magic formula? It's EVERY DAY CHOICES.We pulled  from our IRA in March enough to go to Dec.. We put part in each of our  4 savings acct and the rest in a CD. At this point we could go to end of Jan before needing to pull again from the IRA.First we saved some every month from the IRA because Hubby changed where and when he was hauling. Since a couple of the \"single\" haulers are more willing to haul out of state(Hubby has a nicer truck and longer flat bed trailer so got most of those hauls) and earn bigger bucks... there was a gap needing filled in the local hauls. He has started picking up hauls in the evening *something he hasn't done before. We just moved supper/dinner  to earlier and added a fruit or dairy snack later. SO he is now covering all his bills for the business !!! AND has two contacts where he will be hauling for the one once a week and the other one every 6 wks. Steady work helps. Right now what ever job he can get he takes. Thursday is doctor appts and errands. I switched an appt to later in the afternoon so he could haul in the morning.There has only been one month he only made half of what he needed.... we actually counted on having to cover a total of 6 months for this first year in the business. We only had to cover 1/2 month. WE know there will be a bigger bill when his renewal for legal stuff comes in during Oct to mid Jan which is low earning months.I turn off the AC and all the fans in the morning, open windows and doors if it's below 77 degrees. I will not turn the AC back on until after 3 or even after dinner unless Wilbur, our oldest dog pants heavy. Rascal a year younger and black doesn't pant as quickly as Wilbur. Still I will not turn on the AC I turn on the ceiling fans and floor fans if that doesn't help him I turn the AC on 78.. I keep the curtains shut and the windows shut if it's above 77 degrees. I found that the Amish do this a lot as it keeps the hot air and humidity from coming in as soon. Our electric dropped by $50 in 30 days. Hubby was a little grumpy but since the AC at 76, will run with a ceiling fan while he sleeps he has adjusted. We found if we put a fans in front of the vents on the floor it helps move the air and the AC doesn't run as much.110 is cheaper to run than 220. I also opened the old cast iron floor vent in the ceiling in the front room to the east loft, allows the hot air to go up to the loft so Hubby is more comfortable.I got Hubby to take 5 min showers instead of 20 min showers. His excuse was his shoulder length thin  hair... mine is almost to my hips and still very thick,so that didn't float with me. He also realized after I shoved a bucket in his shower that he was letting it run a lot more than he thought before getting in it. My 2 inches of water compared to his over flowing same size as mine bucket . I also pointed out that his bathroom in the farthest from the water heater so we needed to run the hot water at the mudroom (used to be the kitchen)sink first to help get the hot water faster to his shower... Simple solution was I wash the hand wash dishes in that sink instead the kitchen sink BEFORE he takes his shower, if we have no hand wash dishes or he wants to take one sooner he uses the other bathroom which is a lot closer to the water heater. His bucket is now just at a quart a little more than mine.  That also lowered the electric but in that one switch of timing showers we saved a bag of salt which costs us $10/month with delivery. I checked our farm insurance and our vehicle ins and got it lowered by 10 % saving us $350 total a month ... some how the over hangs on barn on the original  ins got flipped to lean too's and they still had the old truck which has not been tagged in over 2 months and now sold listed. We don't drive the dog truck or the jeep much either. So that was changed and I got the over charge back as a credit.  We take the jeep as it's best on gas, Hubby has finally gotten in the habit that when he is checking with the Amish about pick ups and drop offs to take the jeep instead of the work truck.He has an app on his phone that tracks mileage for personal, medical and business so it doesn't matter what he is driving.Our escrow on the mortgage was over by $50 a month. I got that lowered so it's not a refund at the end of the year  due to over payment.I got a discount for paying the propane in full in cash instead of credit card. That savings comes out to $100 a month.I changed 2 different meds that dropped the price to $5 for a 3 month supply saving $10 a month.Instead of buying a soccer ball for my PT I am using a foam cooler that is the same width. Daughter 3 suggested this as she does the same exercise for her C.P. also.We needed new silverware as Hubby can't hold on to the ones we have now. Instead of buying what I would love to have in style etc, I focused on what would work for him. It was half of what I wanted. Granddaughter B said if we find out he could not use them she would buy them from us as she just moved out on her own. I cut $50 a month by no longer ordering books (cookbooks are my go to and I read them like novels)for my kindle or paperbacks. I read a lot. A book every other day.I have went to free library and free unlimited kindle. IF I really want the book It has to come out money I make either ice for the Amish neighbor, selling asparagus that ran us over or driving someone some where. I am saving that money to help replace hoop house next year.The biggest saving has came to how I have stocked everything back up. My stock up budget is separate from my grocery budget. When things were tighter it was part of that budget. Now it's not. First I know I spend $500 a month (eating out is included in this)( a year of no garden when we moved here and not having much to bring with us) so for stocking up I budget $400 a month for stocking up (figuring that $100 is fresh produce and dairy)  That's $4800 for stocking up medical, filters for things in the house, non food, personal, dogs and food to go 12 months.I changed where I am shopping, what brand I am buying and setting lower limits. YES lower limits. IF I can go without it, or make due (think Clorox  in a bucket with rags instead of wipes) I will. I went to Aldi's, Dollar General, Family Dollar, CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Save A Lot, Amish bulk stores, dent can store , home improvement stores (Home depot, Lowes and Mendards) and old fashion hardware stores when I was already in area. Hubby also did it when he was stopping while hauling for Amish ( they will ask to stop at certain stores). I checked prices on line between Kroger's, Walmart, Sam's club,Target and Amazon. Except for buying the dogs meds, flour, sugar and yeast I could go without what is still on the list. I made sure the medical and household filters were first. I have a written lists that is updated every time something comes through the door. I take a picture of the lists and send it to Hubby so we both don't waste money by buying too much of something. By doing it this way.... I still have $2400 in the stock up acct...which is earning a bit of interest, not much but a bit. It's the daily"},

I know some that are unemployed are not longer being counted as they didn't qualify for it.SO I am willing to bet it's a lot higher.I know that some banks are quietly closing credit cards and or lowering the amount you can charge. It's in the news and a couple friends already went through this.I just read where Wells Fargo put some clients in forbearance of their mortgages without consent from the client and then reported it to the credit score companies... against the CARE act. https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/more-wells-fargo-customers-say-bank-decided-pause-their-mortgage-n1234610I understand the limits of things we having be dealing with... but when I walked into Mendards yesterday to get the household filters and cleaning products AND SHELVES are empty in a place that hasn't been empty in the first part of this pandemic. AND limits of disinfection products down to ONE per person. It was, a stop and think about this.Hubby and I had already talked between trying to buy stuff as needed or stocking now (I usually start in Aug.) 6 months. We decided to stock for a full year. Money will be tight if the business doesn't stay stable (right now he is hauling farm equipment crops... animals). Taking the hit now financially, cutting other places as we see the prices going up, and inventory going down. He asked for a list of what was needed to bring us up to a year's supply of everything except perishables. Six notebook sheets later with 2 having stuff on the back side... we sat down and went over it. I separated it out by over the counter medical, dogs medical, non food, household filters,booze , yes booze,extra for the cordial I will be making, food(evaporated and condensed milk etc , things I normally stock in the fall) and the veggies we don't have in the freezer. Yes, I know how much of anything my home takes to run a year. I have tracked it for years. There as some differences in this home and during this pandemic I am using disinfectants not just cleaners. White vinegar does not touch this virus and bleach triggers problems with breathing (can't even be in the house when using it in the laundry)Lysol does, Mr Clean does, I have to watch what I use due to asthma and allergies.https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19.Before my doctor appt about the MRI results of my knee (bad news articular cartage broke, good news the break is over 30 yrs old so no surgery, bad news it's catching when my knee is bent at a certain degree and my cerebral palsy doesn't let me catch my balance fast enough when it happens, good news back to cerebral palsy physical therapy AT HOME.) I stopped at Menards and used the last of our rebates. After my appt. I stopped at CVS in Sidney as it has a better selection of medical than here in Kenton. Then I went to Kroger's as that's the state liquor store and soda pop, club soda and hard cider for Hubby. Then I went to our favorite pizza place and got a 16 inch take and bake and chef salad for dinner ...it's will make 2 dinners actually.Hubby has been putting off getting new boots even though he needs them. I told him he had to get them now. We took a hard hit during the storm that went through a couple days ago.... I probably would handle it better if we had gotten a decent rain instead of the .03 inch we got. Hoop house that was going to be for fall and winter planting got ripped out of the ground , floated as a parachute (E saw it go and decided he should just keep himself and his boys in the equipment shed for a bit as hoop house was at the back of our barn he had a good view of it coming up), ended at the pond over 400 ft from where it was. The only thing that stopped in from going in the pond is the metal bar on the end hooked to the metal fence post for barb wire (keep horse out of the windmill) at the windmill. We were all thankful the horses were not in that pasture. Under deductible of our farm ins even adding to what got taken the last storm. Hubby looked to see if we ordered new how long it would take.. on back order until after end of Nov.  Metal frame completely destroyed. Plastic has a few hole that can be patched with screen and flex seal.I told Hubby to let it dry out and then we would fold it up and store it. I would work on a design over the winter  to build something next spring. Compare prices of ordering a new frame which might not work with the cover we got or building it.I might have enough scrap lumber to build with. Are you reading/listening to the news or stocking for another down turn?"},

{"title": "We are tired.", "date": "Monday, July 20, 2020", "text": "Emotional and physically just tired. Hubby slept off and on yesterday while I piddled at getting things caught up. Tired but can't sleep.Brother called to check in today, let me know they were ok, and our niece and her girls that were Daddy's care takers along with us are okay also. He has 5 appointments and 2 funerals he is speaking at he needs to get through before he makes the appointment with Daddy's IRA guy. Both of us are going to leave them in that guy's care, He's been taking care of Daddy's IRAs from the beginning over 30 yrs.We just need to know what the RMD's are so we can adjust our own withdraw from our own IRA's. Daddy got his wish.... he didn't die broke. There was a life insurance policy I signed off of so Brother got all of it. I know darn well he paid some of the house bills after Daddy went to the nursing home out of his own pocket.Daddy had 95 % of his funeral and burial paid for. Was a relief to not have to deal with what to do etc.Hubby told me this afternoon he is no longer doing out of state trips until this covid runs it's course and is going to limit where else he hauls to. He is hoping he can cover his expenses of the business with cutting those out of state trips out.I was happy to read thishttps://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/health/epa-lysol-disinfectant-covid-19-trnd/index.htmlthey say that the spray kills covid within 2 minutes. It's what I use during flu season anyways. We are having bacon,lettuce (on the bitter side but oh well) and tomatoes on tortilla wraps. Peach for dessert. I will be refiguring the projects as Hubby doesn't think he can get them all finished this summer.  No rain still.... only had 0.57 this whole month. My grass crunches when I walk on it and I am watering every 2-3 days with the 100 heat index we are getting. Take care everyone, stay safe Blessed Be"},
{"title": "our winter forecaster and repairing storm damage", "date": "Wednesday, July 15, 2020", "text": "The winter here in this area of Ohio is considered to be 13 weeks.... that goes along with the 13 sections of the wooly bear aka wooly worm. Supposedly if the head is black that means the start of winter will be sever. The longer the brown section the length of normal winter and the end is black that means winter will end cold. NOW after saying that I do know the colors on the \"forecaster\" is actually due to where it was born, how old it is etc. This little guy is about 1-1 1/2 months early since I don't usually see them until late Aug early Sept.... I really hope that doesn't mean an early winter but I will be prepared just in case.the white blur at the end of the deck ramp (black blur is Rascal) is the outhouse on it's side. It took the fence out that was behind it. We were going to get rid of it (still was in good condition) but decided after a friend and our son talked about not being able to get fuel to run generators when they were hit with tornadoes.... we decide to put it back up at least I won't be hunting for water for toilets.. Hubby  got set up yesterday. Fixed the fence also. He decided to go get some round posts and added stabilize outhouse to put a gate in at the end of the ramp. That is going to be done this month as his mother had to go clear out to the barn to come in and up the ramp and she let him know that should have already been done (thank you MIL as I've been asking for over a year).what was left of the glass patio table is only the frame. It wasn't hurt. When we went to Menards to get the last of the stuff for the deck railing, we looked at patio tables... What I would like, Hubby could not lift with one hand and knew I wouldn't be able to move it at all.  I went back to paint while he got lumber and was talking to the young man there as he asked what projects we were doing... when I mentioned not finding something for a patio table and didn't really want wood I had to maintain and we had got PVC boards for the fence, he showed me a picture of what he had just made from PVC boards for his patio table. THANK YOU.  That is now on the project list. We had over $800 in rebates and figured we would have to use some of the cash... nope came in under $650... cool, that means barring any more storm damage this year we can put what is left back towards the front porch that is the project for next year.Tomorrow is Daddy's graveside service... possible storms are in the forecast of course. So what is new?It's at 2 pm in the heat of a summer day.I am praying it's just my brother and me and our kids (and my grandkids). The kids and grandkids have volunteered to be pallbearers.... funeral home asked for 8-10, I stopped counting at 10 and just told them to squeeze together to carry him. Funeral home said they actually had two groups one time, one to carry the casket to the hearse and the other to carry the casket to the grave. Knowing where Daddy's grave is, the hearse would be the farther walk. I mean really we could back the hearse up and roll him out into the grave , it's that freaking close to the drive.I have more onions curing, more greens in the dehydrator, and more black berries in the freezer. I have 10 quart of blackberry pie filling, 14 pints of blackberries in syrup and 8-12 oz jars of blackberry jelly... I know I have some in the freezer but oh well. I still have more that haven't turned yet.I appealed a claim that was denied for reimbursement. I won so that money is in to pay that bill. Yack at you Friday. Blessed be"},
{"title": "Life keeps right on rolling", "date": "Monday, July 13, 2020", "text": "Yesterday I spent the morning scanning pictures for the funeral home. I sent a couple of them along to brother. I found a couple more for brother of him holding me, our younger brother and the neighbor's baby girl that died when she was young that I will scan today and send to him. M had sent over 5 steaks that were 6 inches by 9 inches and at least 1 inch thick late ( like around 9 pm)Saturday night. I froze 4 of them and we had one on Sunday. It was too late for her to grind them, cook it and then can it and they don't eat steak. Told me if I didn't want them to feed them to the dogs. YES REALLY .They had butchered a steer for an Englisher who couldn't find a place to take it to be butchered... earliest to get in to butcher was late August. The steak had great flavor. One is going to be a roast LOL.I pulled onions again, now covering a 1 ft wide by 25 ft on my front porch to start curing while the first batch is curing on the table in the hoop house that isn't all together yet..the hoop house not the onions. I cut the dried tops off the hoop house onions this morning... a few still need to be drier before I cut the last of the tops. Ones that have damage will most likely end up in dehydrator to become onion powder.I harvest thyme and blackberries yesterday. Blackberries are going into jam and syrup this round. I have some dehydrated, frozen and canned as fruit and pie filling.We talked about getting rid of the outhouse since it blew over. Decided against it. IF we lose power we have a generator... but if we run out of fuel for it we have no water. A friend in Alabama told us that getting fuel after a tornado was next to impossible for almost a month. Our son said when his area was hit he was driving almost 40 miles to get fuel and it was limited gallons. SO we have a fuel tank... we just need to decide diesel or gas.  We have 2 generators one of each.I am thankful the Amish that lived here put it over the septic tank. We just have to move it when it gets pumped out. I changed several medical appts that was going to be Thursday so that's off my to do list.We didn't have pallbears, wasn't sure who could take off work. I think everyone of the grandkids that can get off work are carrying their great grandpa. My oldest granddaughter who just came out of military is going to carry him also. People thought Daddy was weird because he always went to baby showers and played the games with the women... She is walking is his footsteps.. a soldier carrying a soldier. Washer buzzing.. Charlotte cut her paw on something last night when Hubby left her out... she had blood smears on every pillow right through the pillow case. So pillows are now in washer...Be safe  and let your loved ones know you think of them.Blessed beFrom 18 to 93 is a lot of living. Funeral is this coming Thursday. Brother and I are glad Daddy made several choices.First ,,, he had a will , living will, power of attorney and medical power of attorney and kept it updated. HE had already put Brother's name on all accounts. The life ins and IRAs were already done for who they went to.Second he prepaid and PLANNED his funeral in 1996... some where along the line he had lost the obit he had wrote and hadn't given the funeral home a copy to put in his file... They had a lot of the info just needed updated. The young man was wonderful to work with as he wrote the obit as if it was his own dad using the info we gave him to fill in. It was part of their services that Daddy had paid for. Daddy had already paid for the flowers and chose what he wanted. Since it's covid and Brother and I both are leary of a open service, we decided private family viewing with a graveside service that we will officiate , nothing Daddy hated more than a preacher preaching over a casket instead of focusing on the deceased and the families . With what he chose and paid for and how we adjusted it for the times there was a savings of over $15,000... yeah his solid oak casket is now $8000 and he paid $2000.Third his grave is paid for along with his marker except for engraving the death date as my step mother and two of the three stepbrothers are already buried.  We do have to pay for opening and closing the grave. The cemetery would not do prepaid at that time. Since we sold the house last year to pay for his medical that wasn't covered under his 2 insurances... there is no property to deal with... I do still have some of his stuff from the house but it's now pretty much down to what needs donated or into a dumpster. I cut the cord off the non steaming iron he still had and gave it to M... works great on her wood burning cook stove and she was in need of an iron anyways.I will add that lawyer and the Funeral home told us what Daddy saved by doing it all ahead ... beside us grieving and not thinking clear and not having to make choices.... close to $15,000 was saved.... that is a LOT of money and he definitely didn't have that left in any accounts when he died so it would have been OUT OF OUR POCKETS."},

I had already said good bye when I saw him in March but went again.. Always hoped he would go in his sleep... HE IS STILL ALIVE... getting worse every day but still alive with no help from medical.  Daddy always said he didn't want to linger... but that's exactly what he is doing.Hubby's parents came to visit, had cabin fever and was a bit upset Hubby made them sit 6 ft away from us in OUR home. He made them wash their hands as soon as they came in also. He sprayed disinfectant and cleaned where they sat and the bathroom they used was the one he uses instead of mine. They said they had only been to the doctors(his mother fell and she has blisters on her eyes) and grocery. For some reason they thought no one was dying of Covid in our state (Ohio) and that it had pretty much ran it's course. Hubby contacted his 3 siblings about it. Big concern as we know they have some dementia also. Sister texted the next day and said the parents made her wash her hands when she came in and sit 6 ft from them because Hubby (who is an EMT) told them that was how it was to be...she's a nurse and she backed us up. She did take them to be tested for Covid, tests came back negative.SIGH OF RELIEF. M gave me 4 large zucchinis. I am going to dehydrate most of it , put a small amount in the freezer and have some for deep fried zucchini. I put 18 trays in the dehydrators of herbs. Will probably be the last of them as they are burning up even with watering daily. I also dehydrated a mixture of greens to blend into powder when I get finished with the rest of the greens.I picked the last of the purple pod beans and most of the lettuce. Might get one or two more small salads of lettuce. I have one batch that I am waiting for it to bolt and produce seeds. I have dried clothes on the lines, Hubby has chose to wear wrinkled shirts instead of me running the dryer or turning on the iron. Said they absorb sweat better when not ironed and didn't figure I needed to turn the dryer on.I bought some new slips from Amazon that Brandy over at The Prudent Homemaker recommended... LOVE LOVE LOVE them..as even working in 90 plus heat they didn't stick to me like nylon does. I cut the last of the red kale, it's in the dehydrator now(Thursday).I put dried milk on the tomato plants to fight bottom blossom rot. I am now out of dried milk."},

Relieved for my brother that I know he was paying for some of the care out of his own retirement and he didn't want me to know about it or how much. Daddy will always be with me, he taught me to garden and preserve. He taught me to sew and repair. He taught me to cook. But Lord, I miss the hugs, the kisses, him calling me at bedtime to talk over our day. Tomorrow Brother and I go to make arrangements...Daddy did most of it 8 yrs ago when Mother died and I spent Thanksgiving writting her obit. I was surprised he didn't do it when my step mom died several years before that.We took a hit with storm that came through right before we pulled in , 34 mph winds took out the glass picnic table, 3 potted plants and the outhouse...

Not only did it stop it faster... after 2 days I haven't had a nose bleed since. He thinks I was allergic to the lotion in the tissue as it was not a bad bleeder.  Generic saline spray a couple times of day (can't do nasal rinse as they cause headaches) and things are good in that area.Ate lettuce, radishes, strawberries and onions out of the gardens, peas out of M's gardens and tomatoes out of N's hoop house.  Covered blackberries and blueberries with bird netting .Have small green paste tomatoes, beans have blooms , onions are starting to have dried tips but I don't think the Brussels sprouts are going to make. Battles with bugs every day. Started getting blackberries about a hand full a day. M gave me zucchini.Put up electric fence to protect sweet corn from deer and coons.Thought if we shocked them now they would leave it alone with the corn started making.IT's on solar power instead of our electric.Our township had a clean up day that accepted any trash our normal trash didn't take in weekly trash pick up (no commercial or hazard stuff and 8 tire limit) we took enough that would have put 1 layer across the floor of a single car garage. Since it was OUR trash company I asked what we saved ...around $250 of extra charges.We kept enough cardboard to finish the air barrier in the last 2 attics.Cardboard was over whelming. Sent in medical claims to RRA for reimbursement.Since I already paid these bills I will put the money towards Aug bills( which includes the propane order for winter heating) as we just paid off July that needed checks written and the rest is auto withdraw.Last month we had to use household money to cover the business bills... Mid June to mid July is a slow time without a pandemic and Mid Nov to late Jan is another one. Hubby made half of what was needed so that wasn't bad.He is picking up one time haul jobs to help fill in the lack in the steady work.Bought clothes from ThredUp using a discount code, finding pants that actually fit me without hemming or taking in. We bought a $4800 motorcycle for $3200.... we were looking to upgrade and hadn't found anything we liked and in our price range( cash not loan) as the bike we have now was good for Hubby to take back and forth to work when he was in the factory  but not really comfortable for us to do any riding. We both have license and have rode since we were kids. Son 2 was going to trade his in as he went to a Honda goldwing trike (bad knee) and sold us his for what they were going to give him for trade in. Since we both have been on this bike we know it will work for us. We hope in a few years he will upgrade his trike and we will get to buy the one he just got. We already started that kitty. LOL We can ride the bike to go see his parents, if we go some where with them we always take their car as neither can get in and out of our car very well (Jeep is small) and they can't climb up in either truck.We can use it to visit the kids or go riding with Son 2Hubby asked why I was using the kitchen porch clothes line on such a nice day instead of the yard clothes line . I had him stand at the kitchen window and took down one of the shirt off the line. The sun blasted him in the eyes. Blocks the sun out of the kitchen and keeps the house cooler. I keep an old white shower cloth curtain that I hang on that porch to block the sun from the dogs water to help keep it from getting as hot also blocks the sun from the bedroom. We check the morning temp... if it's going to be lower than 76 we turn off the AC (we only run it in afternoons and evenings) and open the windows to allow the cooler night air to come in. I've shut the windows and curtains on days of NO breeze and kept the house around 78 doing that without the AC. until around 1 pm.  I always check the windmill to see where the wind is coming from to know which side of the house to open.Yard clothes line is for towels, bedding etc that are too big for the kitchen line.I still would like to have 24 cans of mushrooms (or 12 large), 14 cans of spinach and 2 gals. of apple cider vinegar.IF I get fresh apples and fresh pears this fall and  3-4 pie pumpkins we will be in great shape. I still am cooking down last year's tomato juice for sauce. I even have essential oils, etc to make my own hand sanitizer and cleaners as I KNOW this pandemic is going to last at LEAST another 6 months (they all last at least a year if not 2 yrs) and things are most likely turn worse this fall rather than better. I am now seeing majors order masks to be worn by ALL when in the city  when people are out. I think we are headed for another shut down.I took some masks that Son 2 had that was too big and he wanted ties instead of elastic and remade them for him. He had some ribbon that a friend of his gave him as she sews and I used it for his ties. NO money for either of us.I use my meter to gauge how much to water the gardens. Helps to not over or under water. Saves water and electric running the pump. I don't pay for water or sewage but we are very careful as the water table dropped really low last year and a few around us had to pay for water to be hauled in as their wells were not deep enough. I use the air fryer to bake and I use it OUTSIDE so it doesn't heat up the house. It will raise the temp in the kitchen 10 degrees. I used the grill for meat and some of the sides, been eating more cold meals than hot anyways. I have about one more week of salad and then I will have to wait for it to grow again as the heat wave is going to bolt what I have. Ham salad, chicken salad, chef salads, cold meat in tortilla wraps have been pretty common.I did grill some extra meat last week and tossed it in the freezer to be reheated in the microwave if needed. We have taken to eating our dinner on the kitchen porch and morning coffee on the deck (west side of house).I put lemon peel and slices in the dehydrator. I put lemon zest and slices in the freezer and I juiced the last of the lemons and froze the juice in a ice cube tray.I chopped what was left up and put it in the gardens. I found Tattler wide mouth rings AND  regular mouth. Had to wait as they were on back order but they have finally came in. I was told to practice canning with them with jars of water as you need more head room and you don't tighten them as tight as a regular canning lid... sounds like a learning curve but that is okay. If I decide I don't care for them I already know who I can give them too that already uses them.I finished dehydrating the butternut squash from last fall. We watched fireworks from our porch as the neighbor down a few houses set some  (not big ones) off for the kids in the neighborhood since our local ones were cancelled. My brother sent a video of the ones he was at.Hubby found spinach for 54 cents/ can and mushrooms for 64 cents for 8 oz can and cannellini beans for 56 cent/ can and bought enough to finish the pantry. YEA!!!!How is it going for you?"},
{"title": "July projects ", "date": "Wednesday, July 1, 2020", "text": "With permission from these two I post this picture. Son 2 is on the right. Grandson S on the left. Grandson started his 1st day in the Army today July 1st.He wants to follow in his uncle's foot steps.I finished the gardens... mostly. I will be working on an irrigation system for next year. Hubby is looking for a better way to control weeds around the area. He does still have to put the electric fence up around the sweet corn in the south garden . That's about 4 hrs of work. I need to move the red rhubarb. I mentioned moving it up under the grape vine but Hubby really doesn't like that since he would have to do more trimming.E came over with his boys a bit back and help move the metal frame (was a garage in a box that we lost the cover in a wind storm) to an area south of the barn, gets shade during the summer from the tree on the north west side there but will get light during the winter and the barn it's self will block a good part of the north winter winds. We think we have it set where it will be good, I pulled out the pots I am using and the cover so we can get it on this week.Goal is to be planted by July 15th. We found some old wood fencing that matches the wood fencing in front of the house. I found a paint scraper in Daddy's stuff that I was going through. I told Hubby I could scrape it and paint it when I paint the posts for the deck railing and we could use it for the railing on the deck instead of wire fencing.  We just need to buy paint with primer which we need anyways for other stuff that needs painted. Something outside always needs painted.Other projects..basement ramp, Hubby wants to start on this as he doesn't want to lose that entrance. kitchen porch after the ramp as the ramp will affect the south end of the porch. tower for antenna in cubby hole (which means he might finish the weed barrier in that area. I am collecting field stone/rocks to lay in that area to have a rock garden (which Wilbur won't go on and do his business there ). E said to remind him when he plows this fall and I can go to a couple of his fields for rocks. I already did his pasture.Gravel that is here spread out.But my first project is to get over food poisoning that I got from my own frig. Neither of us thought about the deep fried onions I reheated was 5 days old not 3... I usually don't eat any leftovers over 2 days old anyways.SIGH. Doc was not happy with me and told me to not be surprised if it takes a month due to my Crohn's to get over it. Mean time every day is a bit better. I actually slept all night last night. I made it through getting my MRI of my knee. I was glad the worse part of the food poisoning was over before that.I would love to have one of the parts completely cleaned in the barn, the pantry nice and clean and organized and clutter out of the mudroom (which reappears every time Hubby comes through the door carrying something that belongs in the barn that he just walked through and forgot to put it away out there). BUT realistic it is not going to happen this month."},
{"title": "Saturday afternoon...nap time", "date": "Saturday, June 27, 2020", "text": "This week has went by in a blur. Monday Hubby took H and B to their doctor appt. I went to mine... MRI needed... but can't see doctor to go over MRI until July 23rd...sigh, now have a soft brace to wear when the knee is giving me trouble or I am going to be walking a lot. Monday late evening Hubby got an emergency call that  another hauler blew his engine and couldn't go get a load of equipment in TN. SO Hubby left at 1 am Tuesday morning.I have been having problems with calluses  on feet due to knee shifting how I walk. I was told to use equal parts of Listerine (no other mouth wash will work)apple cider vinegar and warm water and soak my feet for 15 minutes then use wash cloth to \"wipe\" my feet. THIS WORKS. and it didn't do anything to the skin that wasn't callused. I will have to do it a few more times for the one callus on my heel but at least my feet are not hurting or bleeding due to calluses.  Tuesday I had to go get my truck from Son 2 and give him the jeep as his car was going to be in the shop longer and I need the truck to take dogs to vet. Total day was gone by time I got back as my knee was killing me...can't drive or sit in car with brace as it binds up on the back of my knee and causes MORE issues. I argued with myself about stopping for drive thru or fixing something when I got home.Drive thru won because I know myself well and know I wouldn't bother to fix anything at all.Wednesday,I actually got crap done, several herbs in the dehydrators, laundry including bedding, furniture throws and extra stuff was washed, dried on clothes line... it was a nice day. Hubby got in worn out and after he ate he was asleep in his recliner before 5 pm.Repair guy called to change appt due to his grandmother dying. Thursday Reloaded dehydrators with more herbs, mints are going a bit nuts, glad they are in pots. Chiro went well, dropped of some things that are son 2's into his car at the shop as he was going to be picking it up with in an hour. Mechanic is keeping our jeep Son 2 was driving to do oil change, tire repair etc. Did not go to vet as our finance guy called early and needed to move up our conference. Repair man ran late. Friday took all 3 dogs to vet. Charlotte got her nails done and allergy shot. Wilbur got his nails done and now has surgery to remove a growth on his eye lid July 22nd. He now has to have an antibiotic gel put in his eye 3-4 times a day. I found if I reach from behind him and put a bit on his top eyelid he will not fight me over it and he blinks enough to get it into his eye.I put it to the side according to vet's directions. Rascal got his annual shot,nails clipped and has a torn ACL. They don't treat that type of injury and wanted to send us over to OSU in over an hour away..I found an orthopedic vet right here that the Amish use and will be making an appt for him through them. Not sure we can afford the surgery as I was warned it was expensive but he might be able to use a brace . He is not in any pain and that is the big one for me. He has good days (like today) and bad days (like I do). Both Wilbur and Rascal need to take a supplement for their joints. Good thing I had already got some on sale through PetJoy.comWhen we got home we spent 2 hrs gathering stuff to take to the township clean up... think 1 car garage of crap (1 layer not stacked) going . LORD Hubby had kept broken small appliances from when we lived at the old place.Said he thought to throw it in the dumpster when we first had it here     and forgot.We pulled enough cardboard to finish the air barrier in the last 2 attics and got rid of the rest.We had odds and ends for dinner and called it a nightSaturday , took the stuff to the township clean up, was in and out and thanked that we had things as organized as we did on the trailer. Since it was our trash company Hubby asked what we just saved since this was free for as the township was paying for it...$250. So thankful our township does this. They usually do it spring and fall but not sure what they will do...this one was to replace the spring one.Hubby had a hauling job that was suppose to be in afternoon, he got it moved up and was done with it by 11 right as the storms started in...so we called it a day. Didn't really have anything other than checking the gardens(rather have the rain so I don't need to water) today anyways. I put the dried herbs away out of the dehydrators, straightened some of the pantry...never ending job. Checked the non food and ordered frig filters, water filter (main line of water into the house) and furnace filters that we will be out of next round. Found them on sale on Amazon so ordered them and got enough to go a year. Maybe Covid will be done running around so much by then. A couple weeks ago ,I had ordered 12 bottles of Clorox toilet cleaner , the big bottle... found at less than $2 a bottle,figured that covered us and any kids... well the company selling them didn't have the size I ordered so sent  me 24 of the size below what I ordered (no extra charge) My kids were just cracking up over it...figured they would get some as Christmas presents. I pulled hamburger patties to go with lettuce and green onions from our gardens, tomato from N's garden and the leftover onion rings, with possible cheese sticks .M sent over peas she had just picked (she's not had baby yet...week 41) I plan to have a few of them tonight and freeze the rest or make pea salad.... Hubby likes pea salad. Maybe I will just make him pea salad.We are both tired. I hurt from so many car rides and the storms rolling through just makes it worse... best news is I have nice wide walking paths through the piles of crap in the barn. Next section to clear is the area where the broken old chest freezer is that E wants to use as an ice \"house\". Hubby pulled some tires and tossed them in the back of the old truck that he is getting rid of this week. THEN maybe he will finish getting the rest of the scrap metal out of  here after that. LOLHow did your week go?"},
{"title": "Busy week ahead", "date": "Sunday, June 21, 2020", "text": "Daily work of course, meals, dishes, laundry, dust mop so the dogs don't bury us in fur and gather things together for the township clean up day that is Saturday. It's for things that costs extra with your regular trash... they usually have a clean up day twice a year but they aren't sure about the fall one right now.Maintaining the gardens and harvesting what ever. Right now it's lettuce, radishes, green onions and herb... a few strawberries here and there. Township clean up is Saturday.Tomorrow I have to be up at 5 am to leave at 6:30 to be at a doctor appt for my knee that I messed up over 4 weeks ago falling on Rascal. Hubby is taking H and B to the doctor in the opposite direction so I am driving myself. When I get home the to do list is as long as the legal notebook paper it's written on. I have some chicken salad made for lunch and some odds and ends that might be a stir fry for supper.Tuesday it's work on what ever didn't get done on Monday. E and his older 3 boys helped Hubby move the metal frame we are using for the hoop house to where we decided to put it. I dug out some of the pots we are going to use.I need to get the cover out of the box and let it \"relax\" before trying to put it up on the frame. I think casserole or pasta would be good.Because with the rain and heat we are getting I know the weeds will be up in the gardensWednesday ... the part for the clothes washer is in so the repairman is coming Wed morning, he did offer to come late morning so I could get my laundry washed before he works on it. We measured the area we need cardboard for in the attic for air barrier... I will be breaking down card board boxes and seeing if we have enough. I think we do,, But I don't want to start using the bigger boxes for pathways in the gardens and find we needed it for the air barrier.Thursday... We have a chiropractic appt (YEAH) first time from March and my back is definitely telling me about. I stepped AGAIN in the dip and messed up my back over the weekend. Hubby FINALLY after 2 yrs of nagging went around the property filling in holes. He also turned the compost pile since he was on the tractor. THEN after our appt all 3 dogs have appts with the vet... saves gas since the Chiro and vet are an hour away and only about 15 mins apart. Lots of shots, nails clipped (no office call charge with we get  a nail clip) and talk of Wilbur's surgery to remove growth on eye lid, Charlotte's allergies and Rascal's struggle to walk (back legs. I think he has hip dysplasia like our dog Tashy did. Right now he can get around decent on most days. He is falling on stairs so we have been letting him out on the deck which is ramped. Doesn't seem to get it that he doesn't need to go up and down the stairs since he thinks he has to follow me right now.He has gotten so he goes up or down the stairs (main living and bedroom 1st floor)with Wilbur or me. Wilbur is heavier and bigger than him so can stop him from falling far. I just sit on my butt and go down with him. If he is going up I have my hands so I can lift his back feet if needed. Today was a good day, no problems at all and even ran to chase the horses at the pond. Friday is focus on getting as much as possible to go to the township clean up on Saturday morningWe have an old 27 cubic chest deep freezer that got dropped and ruined when we moved here. E looked at is and said when we were to the place to move it, he would take it to use as a ice chest as it has a drain that he could attach a hose to and drain the water when his ice melts so M wouldn't have to bail it out by hand. We have some oven racks that don't work for our stove that he will get also as he can prop them up on old bricks so everything would sit above the water from melted ice. Hubby moved some gravel so he only has 3 and a partial left to move around.Next project to get done is the hoop house... SO I am hoping by next week that is done.What does your week look like?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "FRUGAL ", "date": "Sunday, June 14, 2020", "text": "My brother called (always know it's bad when he calls instead of texts) Daddy was not breathing well and the nursing home sent him to the hospital... Covid test came back NEGATIVE. He has a UTI and pneumonia, still bad for a 93 yr old man. He improved to the point he could talk (which he doesn't do much of anyways) without losing his breath and hasn't improved in the last 5 days. Hubby and I are getting a text once a day of the status he is at.I reused canning lids for dry goods, I write a capital D on it in magic marker.I bought Tattler canning lids, I was told to practice canning water first as it has a learning curve as you can't fill the jars as much and be careful of how tight the metal band is.I am canning tomato sauce this week so I figure to do a couple different size jars with water and see how it goes. I had a person who is going into assistant living give me her canning jars. I gave the regular mouth quarts to M and kept the wide mouth (M doesn't use them) for myself.I reused a piece of foil 5 times. I used silicone covers for my bowls instead of plastic wrap. Son 2 needs to borrow the truck (Red is now it's name) while his car is in the shop... he is trying to get it scheduled so it works with my doc appt in the same area to save both of us money.Son 2 left his change bag in my car when he gave it back. He finally told me to keep it as he didn't want to brother to change it in at the machine in the grocery store. I bought 3 food saver bag rolls, 3 lbs of Almond flour and a miracle grow universal feeder for the pump house hose from his change. I have 2 cents left LOL. It was over $75. Daughter 4 told Son 2 next time to meet her when she picks up her son at school and she will take it to the store and give him back half. I told him to ask the VFW that he is an officer for if they wanted to buy the change.I now wrap the green onions I harvest in a dish towel instead of a paper towel. I pick what we are eating each day. I turned ceiling fans and floor fans on where Wilbur lays when the house is at 80 (he is old and can't handle the heat, Rascal is a year younger and black but he hunts for shaded spots instead of the sun like Wilbur)and not turn the AC. Cheaper to run 110*fans* that 220*AC*I also close curtains that are on the side of the sun.If it's to be hot 75 and above in the mornings, I don't open the east curtains,I'll open the west instead. and then around 1 pm when the sun gets to the west side I close them and open the east side. That way I am not turning on lights or using the oil lamp to see.Last night and tonight the night temps are in the high 40s or low 50s. The furnace was turned on when I went to bed and Hubby turned it off at 7 when the outside was up to 60. We will do the same tonight.IF we get the house up to 75 with sun light during the day, it will hold around 62-65 thru the night without the furnace.Our electric bill was down $25.Our summer fill of propane was 50 cents/gal cheaper.(300 gals for 1 tank.) We buy a set amount at a certain price each fall. If its higher we still don't pay more but if it's cheaper we get the cheaper price at the time of the fill. We have enough credit for 2 tanks to be filled... but it was a really warm winter for us. So we will ordered the set amount again (4 tanks or 2000 gals)and use the credit to help pay for it.E came over and helped put up barb wire (he gave us the wire in exchange for watering his 2 horses) He also gave us some clips to fix the wire fence we have along the pond side of the land.I told Hubby to pick up some plastic zip ties for the rest of that fence. Cheaper than metal straps and it holds the dogs in.I submitted a claim on the RRA medical acct we still have from Hubby's old employer. By the end of this year we will have that closed as there isn't much left in it. A friend lost my PH/moist/light meter and replaced it finally. I now can check to see if something needs watered BEFORE I water. Saves water and my time.I told Hubby we were out of carrots, celery, heavy cream,half and half, buttermilk, almost milk, fresh fruit (H another Amish neighbor gave us some strawberries). I asked Hubby if I should use what we have stored in pantry as canned, dried or frozen and he thought about it for 2 days and decided we would not eat it because he fears of a second and possible third round of the virus and loss of income as this month he has not made enough to pay the out go and had to use saving to cover it. July will be the same (it's the \"down\" month along with the time between Thanksgiving and New Year's day). M is giving me head lettuce and I have leaf lettuce coming in. I have radishes, turnips and green onions coming in. Kale,baby spinach are also coming in. The Swiss chard did not grow 😕😞Yesterday morning we went to the store. Those that didn't have mask were making sure they were practicing social distance. The store didn't have arrows (said it didn't work anyways as most forgot to follow them). Kids told me to plan on 2 hrs in store. We spent 1 1/2 hrs. I had to walk slower than normal to stay at social distance even though I had a mask on.I went through and got veggies and fruit. I had several coupons and things were on sale. Hubby checked out with that cart while I did the meat and dairy.I had coupons for all the meat and it was on sale. Dairy, I focused on expiration dates at least 3 wks out even if it meant I paid more. Means I won't have to go back except for a gal of milk and I won't have something going bad within a week.I bought my tomatoes from N who we bought the house from. He has a green house that he uses to start his plants and then opens it up when it gets warm. His plants are IN GROUND. His tomatoes were a bit more than the store but I try to buy from the Amish as first I know where it's grown and how and two is supports the community.Still we saved 25% almost 26% on the total and have points for fuel. Hubby uses the fuel points for Red (Chevy truck) and Jeep. I prepped produce for salads including fruit salads.I will prep meat Monday(tomorrow) so the packages they came in go straight out to the road with the trash. That will pretty much stop the running to town for something because I side tracked and forgot to thaw something and put in marinade and then put it on to cook.I have made a list of 30 different salads and we have all the ingredients to make them. I started the list with the salads we eat at our favorite restaurants or fast food places. Added a few of the \"bistro\" salads that I have ate at Son 2's. Watch about 2 wks from now we will run out of lettuce since the storm destroyed what I had planted for next month.I need to find a different pot to put lettuce and one to start Swiss chard in. I made a list of different meals we can eat that I can have at least half prepped if not all the way prepped.We have a township clean up day in a couple weeks. I told Hubby we have some things he was going to take to the dump that we needed to gather them and take them on the clean up day for free. We also will have scrap metal to go to the scrap yard, we won't get much out of that but better than paying for it to be taken away.I have 8 medical bills coming in with another 5 within 3 months and a large vet bill within a week or so... money is very tight.How are things on your end?"},
{"title": "Last of the garden plants", "date": "Thursday, June 11, 2020", "text": "I ran out of room in the gardens, and I ran out of soil but Hubby finally found some after looking at 5 other places. This is the one that lost it's soil during the storm yesterday. I had moved it from here to the north side of the house... should had just left it here. I had planted different leaf lettuce in it. Now I have the walking onions laying over on it they were flattened on to the sidewalk from the storm.my over flow is mostly herbs. I was going to put this table in the south gardens to wash the veggies before I bring them in. I will have to figure something else out More potted plants here, most are different mints...Next project is the railing for this deck. We have the stuff here, just need to paint posts and get it up.Wilbur and Rascal love this ramp,they would love it if I let them in and out of this door in the winter but I don't. These plants get watered every other day unless there is a heavy dew or rain.Now I can start planning on it all coming in .These will get watered every 3-4 day depending on rain fall. I am looking at drip lines or PVC piping when I put it in.This is the annual plantings. I do have a herb that will stay in this area. what is not showing is 16 grow bags (25 qrt) of sweet potato plants...they would be to the left of this picture along with 2 patches of sweet corn. I tried 3 varieties this year to see if we could find one we liked for the freezer. I don't want a small kernel for my freezer corn. If none of these work I will grow the \"canning\" corn that the Amish grow for canning (they use white or bicolor for sweet corn eating) for my freezer corn next year.I companion plant. There are a lot of runner beans for dried beans between the 50 some tomato plants. There are also bush beans for dried beans in there also.These \"big\" boxes are just under 12 inches deep. This is the herbs that will remain in this garden. I have some chives and garlic chives I will move from the north garden over to this area next spring. My Brussels sprouts have taken off with this last rain... you can see the unpainted box (treated lumber leftover from house remodel) that has the red candy onions and petunias Grow bags are potatoes, there are 3 varieties we bought and 2 varieties of what sprouted in the pantry so I planted them.the unpainted box on this side has white candy onions and petunias. The big box has the same as the other one, tomatoes, Brussels, lettuce, carrots, radishes, spinach etc. The lettuce is about done, maybe with luck and this cooler weather I will get enough for another 10 days. The storm we got yesterday blew all the dirt out of the pot I have planted the next lettuce batch in... and it was on the north side of the house in a protected area."},

This fall I will move them to the south side The red pot has artisan lilies.the weed barrier on the left is the first row of raspberries... Hubby will be cutting grass when the heat breaks on Friday. I one handedly pulled weeds from around the actual plants. He is planning of some different mulch to help with that issue.There are some runner beans between the raspberry bushes on the first 2 rows as they are just starting to get leaves and the beans will be done before they come up the trellisThe black pot is a maple tree we started from SEED from the old maple tree of the old farm, terra cot pot is a lilac start that actually bloomed this year so I will be finding a place to put it in the spring. The trellis to the left is the blackberry vines... they are covered with blooms so if I get to them before the birds do we should have a decent harvest. The brown bare dirt is popcorn and sweet corn and zucchini, yellow squash and cantaloupe.red pots are blueberry bushes... first year to even get blueberries and we thought we wouldn't because the freeze hit after they had blooms. I would like a couple more bushes,  Two of the green buckets have bay laurels trees  and the other green and white one have wintergreen in them.  There are 6 boxes of 6 different strawberries ...They will be transplanted to the south gardens next spring. There are some onions (being pulled daily) and lettuces in with them. This is the first year for them and they are filling out the boxes faster than I expected since they also got hit with the freeze right after I planted them.There is rhubarb along the left side that blends into the tree line. It's red rhubarb and didn't do well this year, no one's has either. I am transplanting them next spring but not sure if over to the south gardens or towards the east end closer to where the popcorn is. close up of one of the boxes.I spent 3 hrs today fertilizing and watering everything.

{"title": "Gratitude...", "date": "Saturday, June 6, 2020", "text": "I have read more than a few bloggers and some FB friends that are struggling with gratitude. When I start feeling ungrateful I remind myself of the followingsI wasn't suppose to live from birth... I am alive...as my parents put it I am a miracle.I wasn't suppose to crawl ... I didn't ...I walked which I definitely wasn't suppose to be able to do.I had horrible speech problem... I don't now after years of speech therapyI have went without food as a child and teen ... I don't go without now (and neither do my kids unless they don't say something since they no longer live at home).I went without decent clothes, I was a girl and in how my parents were raised girls were not important as they didn't carry on the name, they were workers in the home and that was all. Daddy stopped be that way when  I had my first as she was a girl. Mother never got over Brother not having children until he was 50 and then it was a girl and he made sure there wasn't going to be any more (he has a step son). Mother before she got cancer ,even offered to pay for him to adopt a boy as my brother is the last on Daddy's side.I have been homeless while trying to go to college, been homeless when I had part of my kids. I am not now and neither or they as they all know they can come home if needed.I have been abused , emotionally, verbally and physically by family ... I am not now.My parents were raised abused... they started breaking that cycle with my brother and me, I would love to say we have broke it even more as not only do we not abuse...we don't take abuse either.My late husband died from a heart attack at age 39 leaving me with our 6 kids, no health ins, no life ins and no will. Lots of back utilities bills (he handled the money). I had just given up my part time job to be with the kids as a babysitter was more than I was earning. I had no money coming in. We made it, I paid the bills off, worked jobs when the kids were in school or not at home, sold things we could go without. Made clothes from other clothes or what other people said were rags like ripped sheets. Daddy was raised by an Amish grandmother (his mom was an invalid) and his Dad was Old German Baptist. Mom's family were non believers and Spiritualist(her great grandma was Native American). I still remember the fight Mother had with Daddy when he bought a huge Bible for me when I was 7 yrs old.She didn't want it in her home and it was the first time Daddy ever ruled the home. Brother got one when he graduated the same year as me but he had been allowed to go to the local church because he went with friends and connected him to those he played sports with... the image Mother wanted for her son. Still, raised in that home I had my faith and I hold that faith tight with gratitude as it is what gets me through those times. I try to remember to learn the lessons even if it's I don't ever want to go through this again lesson. When the gardens don't produce enough more than a meal I am grateful as I had the chance to raise the gardens unlike the city folk surrounded by concrete with no where try to grow food.When you are feeling ungrateful, count the hard times you have made it through, count the family and friends you have, the four legged ones also. Count the things you have , home, a way to get to places, medical care, food (I lived in a food desert). What you are wanting or not wanting ... might not be the plan that is for you at this time... what ever your faith is... be silent and listen... you can't hear if you are not silent.  Time will bring what is best if you keep doing what is good.  If you read the Bible...

{"title": "In the pantry", "date": "Friday, May 29, 2020", "text": "Okay... the pantry is mostly stocked except for what comes in from the garden that I process.My thoughts are to only buy dairy, celery, carrots(if they don't grow and I need fresh as I am pretty stocked with dried), bell peppers and maybe once a month fresh mushrooms and lettuce. Flour and sugar as needed from Sam's club as the limits are just too low in regular stores. Non food... I need paper towels (bounty select a size) and toilet cleaner. I can do without both if needed as I do use rags most the time and have some regular size paper towels I can cut in half and will clean toilets with baking soda.I haven't got enough apple cider vinegar so I will have to be frugal on what I use it for. I haven't found canned spinach. I am not canning my own spinach as I am not growing that amount (18 lbs for 7 pints).AND I am not taking up freezer room for spinach.  If it becomes more available I will get it. I usually eat spinach once a week. I have enough to have a can every 2 months. I will eat fresh if I can get it to grow and I have some planted. Will plant another crop of it when I do the 3rd round of lettuce and radishes.I haven't found pears in juice... right now we can have 1 can every 6 wks. M said she is out completely. A lot of the fruit trees around here got hit with the freeze that took the blooms.I still need 3 dozen cans of mushrooms... I use a can a week... if I don't find them we will be going without.I will not grow mushrooms nor buy them to can. If I have money we can have some fresh once a month to stretch out the canned mushrooms. Hubby prefers fresh on his steak anyways.I have 1 lb of frozen peas and 1 lbs of frozen peas and carrots. My peas are up but not far enough along to see if they are going to make. I will plant peas again this fall along with a double crop of green beans. We use 12 lbs of peas and 12 lbs of peas and carrots a year. I don't care for snow peas but Hubby likes them raw and in stir fries so I am growing some of them also.They will be frozen if he doesn't eat all of them raw LOL.I am lower of canned corned beef and corned beef hash than I like but will make do. Maybe every 3 wks right now, I prefer once a week as one on one week and the other on the next.I have Spam and Treet (canned meat) that I can used to fill out that area.As celebration of having the pantry close enough to being filled. I ordered calzones from our local pizza place. N who I get my tomatoes from said his crop is sluggish and not sure how much he will have at the end of the season . I help him clean his green house in exchange for free tomatoes.He just wanted to give me a heads up.He was over to get asparagus as his didn't produce anyways.He is who we bought the house from.I have planted several varieties of dried beans and will plant more. I am cooking down the tomato juice from last year to make tomato sauce. I won't season this as I am looking at using it for pizza, enchiladas and pasta. I will can it in different jar sizes.I plan to cook down what is left of the grape juice to make jelly IF the grapes produce enough to make juice other wise we will just go without the jelly and use the juice.The goal is to have every single shelf full. I do have 1 freezer not full... it's being used to make ice for E and M... They are paying us $4- $6 a week for ice and a dessert of M's choice every other week. She is also baking us a loaf of bread each week until I can knead bread again. (2 to 4 more weeks) The ice will be needed until next Jan/Feb. I do have 26 lbs of butter in it. back to work for me... one handed that is."},
{"title": "I started my Autumn stocking early", "date": "Saturday, May 23, 2020", "text": "I started to say fall stocking but considering I just got the results back from the second more detailed xray I am not using the word FALL. Just a FYI... what the Urgent care thought was a hairline break was actually an old break (that is common to show up as a new one) BUT it is broke at the capitate which is in the wrist at the bottom of the middle finger. They were surprised there was nothing else broke as it usually doesn't break by it's self. Now I have a different splint that Velcro's so I can take it off to rub the arm or wash. No lifting or pulling... of course I have tried to open the dishwasher twice now and immediately STOP. OUCH.We turned the furnace back on when the temp in the house hit 66. Hubby can't handle that cold after 30 plus years of working around furnaces in the die shop.The wind is from the north east and that sucks the heat right out of the house. By Saturday afternoon it should be warm again and hopefully stay there.Sorry side track there..I decided since we were going to Sidney to my bone doc appt that we would stop at Aldi's. I let M know and she gave me her list but it included diabetes test strips from Walmart (right behind Aldi's) since she is having issues with her sugar during her pregnancy, her 9th. Hubby went to Walmart to get the test strips and a few other things we know Aldi's doesn't care while I was at the bone doc appt. Which worked out well.We went to Aldi's... Hubby got M's list. He found out at check out that he could only buy 2 five pound bags and she needed 25 lbs.  Another person bought 2 of the other bags for him and the cashier took the 5th one back. I found out that I can only buy can goods at 4 at a time... really? Even my girls open 6 at a meal for their families. I understand setting limits but there is no acknowledgement of the larger families. I am glad I started my stocking up NOW.We stopped at the IGA to get my pepperoni. I usually buy the whole stick?LOG? I was allowed a pound as they haven't gotten any in a month and are looking at another 2-3 months before they start getting pepperoni.I do not eat what comes in plastic bags. My Italian grandmother spoiled me, the other tastes off and like old grease to me. I grabbed another 5 lb bag of flour for M.We unloaded at M's and then unloaded ours at home and while I taking things out of bags Hubby mentioned he noticed everything was costing about 4 times a much as it used to. Yep.We sat down and reworked the budget. Made some changes so we can get to next year. Shifted some things. I told Hubby I was going on line to finish out stocking. We won't have as much as we like to have, won't have all the varieties we are used to  having but we won't have to worry about going to the store.I priced out Sam's club, (that will be sugar and flour in bulk) Target,Krogers, Walmart and Amazon. I ordered from Krogers, Walmart and Amazon (through the Prudent Homemaker) Now we aren't running all over trying to find stuff, aren't taking a chance of getting sick especially important with me having a colonoscopy on Tuesday (sucks no cook out for me on Memorial day as that is a liquid diet day).... and it's being delivered free from all of the places.About 3 more weeks I will have radishes, lettuces, green onions, spinach, Chinese mustard and kale for salads so we won't be buying that at the store. I have 1 1/2 deep freezers of different meats, I have canned meat.I have pastas, rice,beans, lentils,dried and canned potatoes and I am growing potatoes and sweet potatoes.I have veggies canned and in the freezer and more that with prayers will grow well in the gardens.I have rhubarb for our fruit. We have berry bushes that won't make for another year or two and just planted 12 fruit trees. We have 2 apple trees that haven't done well even after pruning and spraying so they might only be cider apples. But I know where I can get apples for a good price along with peaches. We planted 8 grape vines as the old one is concord and good for juice and jelly but we got nothing off it last year. I am going to try to start a new vine off of starts from it next spring. We will also be splitting the asparagus as it's not growing as well. Too crowded.I bought canned fruit.We won't buy anything but dairy from the store.... might get red bell peppers and fresh mushrooms, two things I don't grow nor do any around me grow.Are you planing to stock up ?"},
{"title": "frugal moments ", "date": "Monday, May 18, 2020", "text": "I would rather plan ahead for the worse and make the sacrifices now and prepare then get hit with bad and it cripple us.When I broke my wrist I went to the Urgent care instead of the ER... that saved us $450.As we planted the garden, I am setting aside seeds for the next year to two years even though that reduces what I will plant this late summer for fall harvest and fall planting for winter harvest in the hoop house (plastic green house with no heat). I am also planting things I want to harvest the seed from to have more seed away from the garden so I don't accidentally cross pollinate anything.I have set aside 6 cu ft of dirt to start seeds in this winter. I got enough fertilizer to go this year and start next year, more if we get manure off E. I have kept the empty soil bags to use as trash bags.I've washed foil, switched to a reusable cover on my bowls instead of plastic wrap. Leftovers are every other night instead on only on Monday night. So it's cook once and reheat or remake the next night. We have already heard this summer will be hotter than the last 5 yrs and that the heat will run through Oct.We had over 100 degrees last Oct here in Ohio, not anywhere close to the norm.  Hot summer means gardens can burn up. Wells that supply our water can drop low also and there is no place to buy water from. That means we need to hook up rain barrels NOW while we are getting rain and conserve our water as much as possible.We have a 400 gal tank (cistern) that is connected to the rain down spouts now.We average 65 gals. in the winter and 95 gal during the summer per day. Difference it the gardens and canning and the amount of water the dogs drink. It also means our Amish neighbors are going to have struggles as no one around here was able to harvest ice last winter since the river and ponds didn't freeze. Our small freezer in the barn is almost empty so we offered to freeze buckets (we sanitized kitty litter square buckets then put in plastic liners ) for E and M. Right now she is using 2 a week... we asked her what she used last Oct.during 100 degree days.. 1 a day. Okay.We can get 4 in this small freezer (they pay us for the ice even though it saves us money have that freezer  full). I told Hubby I if got the one corner of the larger freezer cleared out we could start putting some in that one to build up a bit for them. They tried saving it in their ice house but it melted on them.Their spring house keeps it about a week... but if water levels go down like they did last year that won't be a good deal either.M has offered to teach me to can meat.I have the furnace off (finally) completely. I am using the airfryer (outside on the table) over then oven to save propane. I dug out the crock pot so it can be in use this summer. I have a grill and 3 turkey fryers .  I can use the turkey fryers for water bath canning (keeps the heat out of the kitchen and off the main propane tank) and the grill off the stove and the main propane tank. After June 1st I will call to have the tank filled (it's at 35%, need to fill at 30%) as summer fill is cheaper. The I will know how much we will need to get us through next summer and how much credit we have left from this past year so I can figure out what we need to pull from savings to pay for next year's. We get a discount for paying in full for a reserved amount and then the price doesn't go up on us but can come down.Hubby retired from Honda Engine plant a couple years ago. Our health ins is through them with them paying part of it. They have put out that the health ins is going to change and some will have to go to public health providers. We figure the retires that are not old enough for Medicare is going to be the ones looking for health ins. Hubby has some money in his RRA (to help pay medical that the company gave him for years of service). We were just going to leave it sit there, but decided to use it to pay off the medical bills I just ran up and close that acct out which earns NO interest for us and keep our own money where it is earning interest for us. I have already started asking others that pay for their own ins of who they have and how well they like their ins.We are eating from the pantry,keeping meals simple so I can cook with only one hand and not dirty a lot of pots and pans that Hubby will have to wash himself. LOL.I cancelled a couple memberships even though I was using them regularly. Choices have to be made are not always comfortable. I kept Milk Street because Hubby asked me to as he watches it often and finds cheap meals that we usually like from other countries.I reread  https://theprudenthomemaker.com/ website to \"refresh\" my thoughts on cutting budget and saving in areas How is your week going?Blessed be"},
{"title": "I should not have asked ", "date": "Saturday, May 16, 2020", "text": "what else could break and need fixed or replaced.weed trimmer head fell off.push mower quit runningSo the grass is going to look rough with trimming not being done.The hot air  now blows on the drivers side in the chevy when you turn on the AC while the passenger side gets cold air.Hubby spent 2 hrs yesterday putting together one box for the garden. He had to make a stand so he had something to hold the boards while he nailed. I asked why he didn't use the screws we just bought for it... blank look back to me as he admitted he forgot to go to the machine shop and get them.I fell... okay I fall a lot as I have a twisted spine on top of cerebral palsy.  My limbs do not always do what my mind tells them to do.. I compare them to a 2 yr old.But this time, I was hanging Hubby's bibs over the drying rack and noticed the knees weren't as clean as I wanted them to be so I was taking them back to the washer.I KNOW Rascal lays here all the time.so instead of watching where I was walking I fell on him. He's okay. I did land a bit on his bad leg  so he limped a bit more but by supper he was back to four legsI, on the other hand, have a bashed right knee that is bruised and aching anda hairline fracture between the wrist and little finger...SIGH.AKA boxer fracture. LOLOLOL.    I am surprised it wasn't shattered, so my bone meds must be working.It's new fangled splint, part plaster.This morning I woke up to thisSince Hubby was already gone to an auction over in Holmes co. I called the ER and asked ... they had me take off the top wrap and keep moving my fingers and keep my hand up above my heart when I can.Its has been almost 3 hrs and they are close to be normal.I am going to sort plants this afternoon ,Urgent care told me to cover the hand with a trash bag when in dirt or tub. I have to have a follow up with the orthopedic which is hard to get an appt during this time. Urgent care did say it would probably be healed before I got in. Which the nearest date I can see the actual doctor is in June in 3 wks. I did get a return message from my ortho doc office to call Monday morning at 8:15 ish and they would see if they could get a PA to come in to check it.On the good news side. Hubby decided after he paid all the business bills for this month and half of next month that he wanted to buy something for our 25th anniversary which was in Feb. ....he wanted new dishes... yes really. We have Corelle, white was bought when we got married, I added Iris pattern on our 10th anniversary. . They have slight chips in them. I also have an Asian style stoneware we use  that has chips in it. He wanted all off them replaced.I got these from Oneida on sale  with discount. They are already in. Hubby loves the cups as he can get his hand in the handle.These are stoneware. They are the reverse of the colors I am replacing.I then went to Corelle and ordered the followingPlain white: 2 - 10 inch plates/2- 8 inch plates/4 cereal bowls/ 2 coffee cups/ 2 appetizer plates and 1 appetizer trayfrost pattern :2 - 10 inch plates/2- 8 inch plates/ 2 appetizer plates and 1 appetizer trayIris pattern:2 - 10 inch plates/2- 8 inch plates/ 2 appetizer plates and 1 appetizerBandhani pattern: on clearance 2-10 inch plates... it's red band around the plate and will go well with the rest and good for red white and blue(dining room is blue and white woodwork) or Christmas.The white and the iris replaces exactly what we have.I only ordered 2 instead of set of 4 as it's only the two of us. If we have a couple come in to eat,  the patterns will work together. If the girls come in and bring kids we use paper plates.My granddaughter Becka that just graduated.asked for the dishes even if chipped as she is getting her own place come fall and has nothing. Guess hope chests are out of fashion. Her mother is trying to talk her into living with her for a year (she lives with her dad and step mom ) and just focus on college. Instead of trying to work full time and go to college.She definitely won't be staying with her dad as he constantly condemns us... until my granddaughter pointed out he would have not had his diploma if it had not been for us and his parents encouraged him to quit school  and it showed how stupid he could be by slamming us because we are of a different faith (same one we were when he married our daughter in our church). She said it at his parents house family dinner where two of her dad's uncles are good friends(one is a cop) of mine and my late husband.Nothing like getting a lecture from your uncle that verbal abuse is still abused while the other uncle who works for a funeral home pointed out that we paid for his other daughter's funeral when his parents said she didn't exist in GOD's eye because she had not been baptized... she died at birth and they didn't even attend the funeral. OH YEAH, she is her mother's child.This is our grandson that graduated. Skyler is going into the Army, constantly says he wants to be like his uncle (son 2). He is a lot like Son 2 in personality.He will continue his education as he can. He like law a lotTime to prop arm up to above heart level...Blessed be"},
{"title": "Can anything else need replaced or fixed?", "date": "Tuesday, May 12, 2020", "text": "YES, ALWAYS!! FOREVER!!!Water softener was checked out this morning. Nothing wrong with it , white flakes coming from ice maker in frig is what our water ions are showing up. UNLESS we want to pay for osmosis system and move where the water softener is at... white flakes will be wiped up daily. Salt level was on the low side due to the fact we don't use the average amount of water. They went ahead and ran ALL the tests on the water. They do it every 2 yrs which will be Aug. Figured since there was a trip fee they would do that so they don't have to come back in Aug.The new to us truck needs some work done on it. Our mechanic said  to schedule it before fall and he would take payments...which means it's over $300.My sturdy baking sheets are starting to have rust on them. SIGH. Can't complain as they are over 25 yrs old and I know my kids (and probably Hubby) have cut things in the pans. I found a good deal that got better when I was offered 10% offThe rubber maid we store dog food in, now has a family of mice. 52 lbs of dog food wasted along with a rubber maid that we used to haul stuff in the bed of the trucks.Two of E's work horses got loose while they were at church yesterday. We finally got them to the barn. OUR GATE had broke in the wind and that was how they got out. That's another bill.This MORNING Molly (one of E's horses that pastures on the other side of us and uses our pond for water) decided she wanted to be in the yard with Charlotte... now I have a broken wire fence, Hubby rigged it and E is coming over tomorrow to install barb wire to keep horse out of yard and dog in the yard. But we know we need to replace that section with new fence as it's the original fence that was here.Since it was freezing this morning *OHIO* and then suppose to be up almost to the 80s by next week. I decided against planting any more cool weather crops. I will try to get some in late summer early fall.I will divide my bean seeds by 3. Beans are usually good 4 yrs so to make sure I have seeds 3 yrs from now I am dividing them up.I will try to gather some so I can more to plant year 4.We had taco casserole, using stale tortilla chips (refreshed in micro wave) taco meat using homemade seasoning, and cheese. Salad and sour cream were options.I then put 3 more meals of taco meat in freezer in a container that can go in microwave.We had a ground pork with 5 spice seasoning that we both hated. We finished it by mixing it with eggs for a frittia.. still disliked it but didn't go to waste.I made Philly steak cheese pizza using left over prime rib from Christmas that I shaved on my meat slices, onions and mushrooms and cheese on homemade pizza dough. Made a second pizza crust and prebaked it and shoved in freezer. Can be for taco pizza or regular pizza later this week.Tonight is turkey (1 Lb  bag that was cooked and frozen couple months ago), since I was chitting (cutting the eye sections of potatoes to plant in a couple days) the Yukon gold potatoes I ended up with a small pan full of pieces that had no eyes. They are now half way cooked so I can pan fry them to go with the turkey. A veggie and fruit to round it out.Tomorrow as the plants in front of the grill should be IN the garden we will have GRILLED steak (cut from prime rib roast at Christmas before baking) baked potatoes and salad.How is your week going?Blessed Be"},

{"title": "This past weekend", "date": "Monday, May 4, 2020", "text": "Hubby moving gravel. We had a strip of grass next to the fence that I thought shouldn't have been left when we first moved in but hey, what do I know? Well I knew it would be a pain in the butt to keep mowed and it was. First thing Hubby did was deal with that pain in the butt then he smoothed out the part of driveway that was tailgated. Needs a bit more at the road. He will be moving stone around for 2 wks. OF course since we got the stone in , his hauling has picked  up. He has Saturday still open, not really as he might be helping son 2 deal with a lawnmower and trimmer that isn't working. He also needs to finish cutting boxes so I can paint them.Plus the stone needs moved and the yard needs mowed... No he doesn't have Saturday open LOLI planted the 125 strawberries. Five varieties so give us strawberries for a longer season and enough hopefully to not have to buy any. That gives us a total of 150 strawberries if all survive the transplanting . Next year they should start producing so one more year of making do. M gave me a few pints of strawberry pie filling and strawberry jam to help get us through this year. Pints were given to her from the family of a person that died. Wasn't enough to help her but she thought of us and with the blessings of the family gave them to us.I planted 150 red candy onions... now have 600 in the gardens. Some will be ate as green onions, others canned as pickled besides just stored. I figure we eat at least 1 onion as green for each of us during the 90 days of summer that's 180... Hubby is known to eat green onion sandwiches like his grandma so that is a LOW count. I have a friend that asked to buy about 15 lbs if we have it this fall.I was able to get a hold of onion seeds to start for winter onions. I've not had much luck doing that before but try try and try again.My walking onions are not far enough along to start using. Did not help that HubbyI have the Brussels sprouts hardening off that I will put in the garden next week. This week we still are in the 30s in the mornings and 40s to low 50s in the day.I have  2 types of  potatoes \"warming\" to chit and plant next week.Had to order my red potatoes from another company that let me know they are shipping this week.We planted 7 more fruit trees. I should transplant the maple and the lilac to bigger pots, still too small to put in ground.I got 3 more boxes painted and Hubby got them together and moved to the gardens so it's just fill with dirt. He still has the smaller in depth boxes to put together as they are painted and ready to be put together. If there gets a warm day I will paint more. This week is on the cooler side. I don't think we get out of the low 50s all week and couple times the morning temp is the high for the day as it spirals downward the rest of the day. Welcome to Ohio.We got the last of the porch order in and picked up more dirt while at Menards.Hubby saw that Arby's had their orange cream shake back so picked up sandwiches and the shakes. We have been trying to do 1 take out a week to help our local restaurants stay in business.There are 2 closed, no longer even doing take out. Talk of they might not reopen. Hard for the one as it has been here over 125 yrs. A little store with a lunch special Monday thru Friday. You could buy Amish baked goods and jams also.I need to make a menu of simple meals this week as the work load is heavy and going to get heavier.Neither of us has went to get groceries. I need a good solid day in the kitchen to make tortillas and bread and put some casseroles together. Might be doing that today since it's not much to be done in this temp outside.I started making masks for Daughter 4 and Son 2, mid way through of Daughter 4's I sent a pic of what I was making and she was, that's not going to work so I changed the style to be more like how a N95 elastic band is and that works for her. Son 2 said his style didn't matter as he wears any and all.What are you doing?"},

Chose what plants will go out to be hardened off starting today.Was going out to start sitting up to paint the garden boxes when the rain started. So that's off the list until this afternoon. Not going to plant in the rain, not bad for the plants but the last thing I need is a cold from a cold wet rain.So thought I would go up to the office where I set my sewing machine up and sew masks..NOPEHubby is half way across the state and got the call the 115,000 tons of gravel will be coming in TODAY IN ONE HOUR.Nothing had been moved as they said they would call the day before. SO I had to go out and clear areas for it to be dumped as it can't be tailgated due to the trailers being in the way. I had to pull the chevy and jeep into the yard, hope they don't get stuck because it's pretty soggy in the yard. Thankful it's not the whole order of 250,000 tons. I was a little upset Hubby didn't order it all at once but after he got off the phone he said he wanted to fill in the hard areas they can't tailgate it (where they dump out the tailgate while they drive) before he had the rest brought in case he needed MORE than we thought since we are adding 2 parking areas for trailers and more around the barn perimeter and then widening the lane which is over 300 ft long.SO I swished and swiped both bathrooms.Now it's sit and wait.This is when I wished I had thought to make a sewing area on the first floor.ER follow up with GI doctor isn't until May 6th and on the phone then.I still am trying to get a hold of my family doctor. I was told by a mutual friend that they thought there was a family emergency out of state. Which closes his office as his wife is his nurse and receptionist.It's a good thing I am staying at home... ER Doctor called that the only test result not back was the Covid 19 but since my lungs are clear and my bloodwork was good he is looking at me testing negative. For me to continue staying at home, wearing my mask and gloves when out. I am wearing my mask while making masks and then washing in hot water and drying in hot dryer and then with gloves and mask on putting them in a plastic bag to mail and then Son 2 will dump them directly into washer and rewash as he doesn't like the smell of my laundry soap LOL.The masks are cut waiting to be sewn.I was just sewing for Son 2 but he caught wind that Daughter 4 now needs them also to go to work as her company only bring back who has their own face coverings.My washer is acting up... mother board is doing weird things. Will get a hold of Maytag to see if this is under warranty. Either way I can't get it fixed until I have my test results back.The is now 8 raspberry bushes, 125 strawberries, 6 trees and 8 grapevines sitting on my porch to be planted. OF course they came in when Hubby will be working the next 2 days. Going to be a couple late nights for him.I have to finish painting the sq ft boxes so Hubby can put them together.There is 10 lbs of potatoes to plant.There is over 5 dozen tomato plants to start hardening offThere is 9 Brussels Sprouts to start hardening offThere is 6 apple mint and 3 rosemary plants to start hardening offThere is 3 dozen seedling (assorted veggies ) to be transplanted.I have seeds that need planted.I have to build 3 trellisesThere are another 150 onions to plant because I marked can substitute on the order form when I ordered SETS instead of plants ( I wanted sets for fall planting)Asparagus is coming in. I canned 5 pints of dill pickled asparagus and blanched enough to cover a cookie sheet and freeze it. I will vacuum seal it today. Probably going to be harvesting asparagus daily for the next 3 weeks.The Amish produce auction is working with the Health dept on how to open back up.What's on your to do list?Dust bunnies are breeding here"},

The rest can go into masks.Had a Crohn's attack and end up in ER (not frugal) had a ton of testing that also checked my heart(I have left sided heart failure). Which actually saved me from having 4 other visits to other doctors and testing appts so I guess that was frugal.My GI call me today with a couple recipes for homemade electrolytes drinks that I need to start using on  a daily bases. That was frugal as he knew I wouldn't spend the money on it for daily use."},
{"title": "ER during Covid 19", "date": "Monday, April 27, 2020", "text": "I had Hubby call to make sure we could go to the ER....I wasn't feeling right yesterday so took my Humira early...good thing I did as at 5 am this morning I had pain, diarrhea and dry heaves AND I passed out twice.... I NEVER have passed out and do not care to do it again.Second time Hubby found me on the bathroom floor, he thought I had died as my body voided.... aka I puked and crapped when I passed out. That happens when you die and they call it voided. When he stepped in I moved my hand. He is an EMT so he dealt with it and helped clean me up. AND BLESS HIS SOULtook me to the ER and then had to sit in the truck for 5 hrs when they released me. Crohn's not blocked just cranky, possible food poisoning from the turkey I roasted the day before, bruised diaphragm, dehydrated and orthostatic hypotension. Er doc thinks my heart failure meds needs to be changed as it's a diuretic and  I keep having problems with dehydration. Summer will only be worse.   I was tested for several things, 3 flu, Covid 19, congestion heart failure, kidneys, liver, red cell and white cell counts, Hiatal hernia flaring a bit. I should get my covid 19 results within a week. So I just need to stay in until then. If I got it, Hubby gave it to me.SO I'm home, not painting or doing much of anything. Both of us worn out due to the day.We had transplanted about 6 strawberry plants to the north field last year. They didn't do well but there was 12 last fall so I decided I would dig them back up and put them in a sq ft garden (this was the old sand box). There was over 2 dozen when I was done digging. They are too close in this box but it will be better than the grass they were growing in.These are what was left of the old sq ft gardens. We made them out of vinyl decking a co worker had given away when he replaced his deck. I now have snowpeas, peas, beets, carrots, onions, lettuce, spinach, kale, mustard greens etc in the first 2. I will wait a bit before I plant the other 2.This year's onion patches. 425 (as 25 is in sq ft gardens) of candy onion, big daddy and red candy apple onions. Hubby was a little questioning until I mentioned use 2 a day for green onion for 3 months... that is 180 onions. That leaves 270 onions for storage.... for 270 days so it's only 1 onion a day.I cut 3 asparagus and diced them to put in the tuna noodle casserole and cut one of the patches of rhubarb and cooked it. What ever is left on Tuesday will go to freezer or into a crisp."},
{"title": "Kroger delivery", "date": "Thursday, April 23, 2020", "text": "My kids were laughing at me as I am not real thrilled with Hubby getting anything of produce as it is.Delivery charge was $9.95 ... if I hadn't been looking for it I wouldn't have noticed it. The tip was set at 10%, you can change the tip... if you don't change it that is what it's going to be... If you set it to NO tip....then I had to have a good reason... you have set time to change the tip... but you still have to give a good reason. I gave 20%. That is what I tip servers at a restuarant except buffets. A good server at the buffet gets 10-15 %. IF you have never worked as a server or had family/friend worked as one you don't understand their pay check does NOT pay their bills, it pays the taxes and SS and maybe the cost of an apron or uniform if that's required. TIPS is what SUPPORTS them. These instant cart workers(which is who is doing most of the grocery deliveries around here) are minimum wage.I forgot to take a picture of the dairy. I got 1 gal of milk, 1/2 gal of buttermilk, 1/2 gal of half and half and 1 qrt of heavy cream. I got 2 cottage cheese, 2 sour cream , 2 sour cream squeeze bottles, 3 Dean dip and large package of American cheese. I still have some heavy cream and yogurt. AND tons of other cheese.I have onions so don't need any of those. We also still have a few apples.I do have a few fresh potatoes left but I know potato salad is going to be on the menu. We have 3 cans of sweet potatoes left but Hubby really doesn't like canned sweet potatoes, he likes his sweet potato baked. Since I will be starting to use the grill, nuked baked sweet potatoes and potatoes go on the menu a lot.I still have a half of head of lettuce.I got nonfood ..not my container of sugar that sits as my coffee pot.I got Home chef... We like Home Chef, Son 2 used it about a year, I have a lot of the recipes from him. But I am just at the point I don't want to do anything especially cook. I have digital coupon and it was on sale. Was limited, young lady had to text me as what I chose wasn't available, there was a beef roast kit that was to serve 2 but she really thought the roast was too small LOL. I got the pork chop one as we have had it before so I know we like it. I also got buy one get one of the pastas. I ate mine for lunch.IF this stay at home continues longer than a month. I will do it again.MEANTIME today I am going out to finish putting potting soil in the 5 sq ft gardens. When Hubby gets in from his hauling job we will be potting trees... even if it's raining."},
{"title": "when you feel like ", "date": "Tuesday, April 21, 2020", "text": "you never get anything done...you screwed up royallyyou are just too freaking tired of the daily grind...YOU ARE NOT ALONE.If I don't dust mop at least every other day, by day 3 I have tons of fur balls. Doesn't matter the season... with these 3 it's ALWAYS.Dishes are always in the sink waiting for the dishwasher to finish or be unloaded.A good homeblessing is me praying over the house instead of me cleaning the house (Flylady term)Ironing is still behind.I haven't even cut out the mask pattern so I can start on the masks and I have 3 kids essential that are running out of masks. Which means not only do I need to get them done but I need to get them in the mail BY the 27th.I am planting seeds to go under grow lights daily and moving grow lights up as the plants grow taller.We have 6 trees that need to be planted, 450 onions that this freaky weather has on hold so daily I am doing what I can to keep them alive and healthy knowing the weather will turn and I will be SO FAR BEHIND on painting garden boxes and getting them together SIGH.Three of my kids have told me they have friends that screwed up when paying their bills so I will share that... One is my ex son in law's mother..She's 65.She paid the gas bill but not the electric... she heats with gas... but she cooks with electric, the frig is electric and the 3 space heaters and water heater are electric. DUH moment when she realized she should have paid the electric and called the gas about not being able to pay.Another is an ex of my kid that paid his cable and internet bill but not the electric bill and then wondered why he couldn't get on line or watch the cable. This is the same one that didn't pay the water/trash bill when my kid was married to them and stuffed all the trash in the soon to be baby's room. At the hospital he told us what he had done and that there was no water at the house either... His parents paid the bill and we hauled out the trash. His kids ripped him.Another friend said they ordered dog food and treats but forgot to order the groceries and they were now out of money. My kid got them groceries.Hubby was paying the credit cards his ex ran up with cash advances and not paying his mortgage and him and his kids almost ended up homeless with a foreclosure. I paid the mortgage to catch them up (we were all classmates and friends) AND this is why he doesn't do the finances alone. LOLI've tossed food more than I want to, I don't keep in mind that even though today is a good day it can change in a heart beat like two nights ago when I woke up in the middle of a Crohn's attack and have been struggling through the days.Yesterday I got 12 out of 24 done on my to do listToday I got 8 out of 24 ..I am trying to keep in mind I \"lost\" 4 hours due to going after Son 2's car that was fixed and taking it to him at work and bringing my jeep back home FIGHTING THE WIND all the way. Jeep doesn't do well in high winds as it is very light weight.Hubby's day hasn't been any better than mine and the rest of the week isn't going to get better either. He figured out a way to put his DOT #s on the truck but not on the actual paint. AND then the job he was supposed to have this afternoon was canceled. THEN he was called and asked to go find out what an order from an Amish guy wasn't delivered (because the guy forgot he canceled it ) and then the order he was to do tomorrow is iffy and won't find out until he gets there to pick it up and another one called and said his was ready but his driver didn't show up. AND NOW Friday and Saturday have small jobs AND all of them are at OUR meal times. It happens when the time changes as Amish do not do daylight saving time.Soooo..my thought tonight as I head to bed at 6 pm is that it's okay it's not done. DUH moments and lazy or just plan tired of it all are okay moments too...AS long as we realize it and move on.Tomorrow is another day. And if I die tonight... the kids will get a good pantry as their inheritance because Hubby will definitely won't be cooking from scratch."},
{"title": "frugal steps", "date": "Monday, April 20, 2020", "text": "we saved money for the projects we just got, waited until the 11% rebate and then got the stimulus check to lower what came out of savings. We are looking at what we have that we can reuse for projects as we go.I washed freezer bags and foil. I once in awhile have to thunk Hubby or he will use a paper plate to eat his snack on instead a of a dish that can be washed. I don't keep a lot to begin with. I use one to cover dishes in the microwave.I stretch our meals as far as I can go. I ordered more dried beans to be planted and more seeds that are varieties to grow in a UNHEATED green house during the winter.I started more seeds for plants to input in the gardens in May and June.I am going to be making masks for us and Son 2, I pulled my wire from my garden to make the \"nose\" place . I also am making ties and elastic for ears to give our ears a break. I am using old tee shirts, some cotton fabric I have and some flannel. I do have shirt gauze to use as the second layer. That's not the the gauze you use for medical bandages.I have more plants that I can harvest the seeds to replant next year.Some things I do without thought. Like making the peels thick on potatoes when peeling for mashed potatoes so I can make potato skins for another meal. Making extra rice so I can do fried rice or rice pudding. Making extra mashed potatoes to make mashed potato patties. Boil extra potatoes when making mashed potatoes to also make home fries., If I have 1/2 serving of anything I think what I am use it in. Might only be tossed into eggs , pasta, soups or casseroles.We wear our clothes out, mend what we can. Hubby darns his own socks.The old saying  Quote by Boyd K. Packer: “Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.” Is how I was raised , not Hubby , but I was. Another one which is how I raised my own kids“I’m teaching you how to survive in a difficult world. You can’t be under your parents’ thumb forever. You have to take charge of your own life now you’re going to be twenty-one.”― Rhys Bowen, The Victory GardenAnother one  isFood will win the warHerbert HooverTrue, you have to eat health to be healthy and the Victory garden pamphlets suggested assorted veggies and fruit and how much to eat per week per person to stay healthy..Stay stay, Stay home Stay well We saved money to finish the deck, add more gravel to the lane/drive way, to redo the front porch including a ramp, redoing the kitchen porch to make it wider and repair the east wall of the basement ramp, input of garden boxes. We saved for a greenhouse.This weekend we ordered everyone on line for a pick up at Menards.On Saturday we got about part of it this weekend with the money we saved and 11% rebate at Menards. You can't really tell there is several boards towards the truck.Greenhouse is on order along with all the stuff for the kitchen porch. We got the green house for less than 50% (on top of rebate) by using the frame work from the old garage (garage in a box we had bought on clearance).Sunday we picked up a Sam's club curb side order for the sugar, vinegar, oil along with junk food. Yes junk food. 😍The money from the stimulus helped pay for it instead of pulling more money from savings.I wrote out a to do list for this week. I am running 7 days behind where I wanted to be... JINXED myself as of 2 AM this morning I started into a Crohn's attack.I did call my GI, I do NOT feel I should go to the hospital but wanted to have a plan... I might have to take another biologic (took my injection Sunday morning, probably why it's not bad, just got my 3 months order), soft foods, I have meds that I can take. IF it gets worse I am to call before going because our little hospital here might be a better option. We have 50 tests ran, 17 were negative, 33 positive and 2 have recovered. NONE are in our hospital...they are all at home as the hospital I would go has Covid 19 patients.I had 24 items on my to do list today... I got 15 done. I don't know what else I will get done."},

Dewine.", "date": "Friday, April 17, 2020", "text": "Did half the ironing while watching him as the man is doing his best to get OH back to work but protect the people.Don't want to open it up too much and have a nasty spike in this covid 19It's been a rough morning. Freeze warning, snow, then rain and then snow again AND THEN freeze again until tomorrow noon... geeze OHIO in April. The next week is supposed to be warmer. I got tons of things to get done once the nasty weather breaks.Hubby was to have 2 jobs this morning. One canceled within 5 min of him being there to pick up the load.No pay, of course. The company that was suppose to get the load wasn't happy when he let them know as it was what they needed today.THEN I had to call him and tell him Son 2 was broke down and needed our jeep and his car trailered to our mechanic (his mechanic also). He did limp the car to work as he was closer to work than home. He also called a co worker(he is the only one reporting for work and the rest is working from home) and ask if he could raid the guy's desk drawer for candy bars because he had no lunch. The co worker told him to wait 30 mins. Twenty min later the coworker dropped a lunch off at the front door from the local fast food. Since Son 2 has gloves, wipes etc at work he was able to get a decent meal. He will be packing more and at least putting stuff in his office frig that he can eat if necessary.  The hope is that the car can be fixed and quickly.While talking to Son 2 about things (aka calming him down from a really bad timing issue) he told me he was sorry for all the times he crabbed at me for the large pantry, the large gardens etc. He really understands why now. He also said he couldn't believe what was about to come out of his mouth, then silence..then a sigh...he advised me to have his dad build me a green house... I started laughing and told him we had already decided on that BEFORE this all hit. But definitely were going to be doing it. We are using the old garage (called garage in a box that tore away during wind storm last yr.) and getting a green house cover for it.He did ask if we both die what he was to do with the pantry as he is in charge of our estate. Told him for him and the other 5 get what they want and then give the rest to E and M and they would put it was it was needed in the community.I will be starting on making masks this coming week.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "on my basement door...", "date": "Tuesday, April 14, 2020", "text": "just something I had when I was worried about not having enough in the pantry even things over flowed the shelvesI sent it to my brother... https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-12/fed-s-kashkari-says-u-s-may-face-18-months-of-rolling-shutdownsWhen this started I had several people ask me how long I thought it would go on... my answer, 2 years... why did I answer that way?... because Covid 19 (true name of this crap) mimics the Spanish pandemic (which did not start in Spain... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu). I also knew that jobs lost causes recession... big enough one that last long time  and we will have another Depression. Weather gets nuts on us and flooding or drought can make things worse.SO I am preparing (as I was raised to) to do what ever it takes to make it through these times....When we decided to retire and move,we made up our minds to be as self sufficient as possible. When we bought this house with no heat, running water , and an outhouse (it was Amish) we knew the first year we would be working on the inside of the house to handle me (or Hubby) but mostly me as I know I will be in a wheelchair some day as my spine will give(it's twisted like a cork screw). We still need closets and one room needs finished. Supplies are here to finish it. I sometimes wonder if we should have had 2 furnaces until I remember the propane bill.We also knew we would be adding fruit trees and maple trees (neighbor taps for sap to make maple syrup) and a garden that we knew where the veggies and fruit came from and what was used on them.Last year there was 1,041 recalls on food and drink.... 1,041 times what you ate, what you fed your families could have caused you to be sick, even die. With my Crohn's already causing problems I don't need the extra sickness and I definitely don't need the worry that comes with those recalls.I was asked on my last post if I knew what it costs me for dirt, seeds, plants etc... YES, right down to the last dime. This year will be high.... fruit trees, berry bushes, dirt, building material for the sq ft gardens will increase that. and was put in the budget when we bought the house.But next year it won't be like that.... I will add fertilizer just like I would every year, etc... that will put the cost down to where organic fruits and veggies is in the stores. I also buy veggies and fruits I don't grow (and won't ) from the Amish. They pay property taxes just like the rest of us.SO starting with the the gardens... yes, I will be putting up at over a thousand canning jars of food. I will take care of us, and most likely at least 3 of my kids... if not 4. The other 2 either have a garden or are in an area they can get garden goods.Those 3 rent and have either no place to put even a pot or not allowed according to their lease. If the season it good I will be more than that. I already know that the season will on average have 2 to 3 back to back below average harvests. Then we get 1-2 above and then it slides back down. I would rather have too much than not enough. I swear M got gray hair when she started running low and it wasn't fit to grow anything. Her brother has a greenhouse and grew some salad stuff for her. I gave her 2 cases of tomato juice (seemed right since E's brother gave me the tomatoes) and 2 cased of green beans.  We got pork loin when she sent the jars back.My Amish neighbors (on each side) has offered to supply meat .They also told me of the butcher shop that buys the animals from the Amish to butcher. I can barter or pay for what I get. They know where their meat comes from and how it's raise... mostly grass fed during the summer and corn they grew them selves in the winter.I have my buy list that I usually pick up from the store. I am going to learn to make more of it myself aka sour cream to start. Wait...it might be an almond chocolate bar. I am craving chocolate.We have several budgets... house, land/gardens, business, clothing, etc.The business right now can carry it's self 3 months. For the 1st year of starting a business, that is unusual. So Hubby isn't looking for work to pay this week's bills but bills 3 months from now.Land and Garden budget is funded( from when we bought the house) I am spending it now instead of later. I am getting some great deals with how I am buying things right now. I am growing my own paste tomato plants which I will harvest the seed from when the tomatoes ripen. Will bring it down pretty low with the four projects we are doing this summer.We are putting up a green house next to the barn. We were going to put up something like thisTHEN Hubby found he could put a greenhouse plastic on the old garage frame that we had over the basement ramp. SO we will only need to buy greenhouse plastic and he knows the Amish guy that sells it. IT's still going at the barn so the north side of it will not be hit by the colder weather.I looked at where I can cut the household budget I will drop the full coverage on my car to what we have on the dog truck we just bought.We can just order enough propane to get us 2 additional tanks as we should have at least 1 tank left at that time. We use 3 1/2 tanks a year so if I just need to watch how I use my gas cook stove. Use the turkey fryers to do the water bath canning instead of the cooks stove. Multi dishes in the oven or use the air fryer (which is really nice in the summer as I sit it outside so it doesn't heat up the house..We can change going to the chiro (when the stay at home goes away) every 3 wks instead of 2 or me go alone if Hubby is working.We cut the fuel budget for the car and the dog truckWe cut the grocery budget to $75, we was going to do $50 but I will need pickling salt , vinegar and spices for canning. I won't buy ice, there is room in the barn freezer with E's ice to put ice I make myself for blanching.Our OTC and meds has dropped due to me coming off 3 meds, dropping to half.We dropped the household maintenance to half. I have what we need for 6 more months I can buy them on sale instead of \"OH we need to change this\"We are not saving for next year's bdays  or Christmas. We have 2 graduating next year (We have 2 this year also) so I will save for that. IF we have money at Christmas they will get that or baked goods. I think they would like baked goods more this year since it has been mentioned. Bdays will be decided later.I am grooming and cutting toe nails at home unless its shot time, then I save office visit by getting the dogs toe nails (which is cheaper than office visit) done along with shot.Hubby now gets the dog food at TSC which is cheapest around here.Non food... I hope we have enough tp to last until fall. Geeze. Son 2 who never has stocked more to than what he uses in a pay period since it's just him, bought a 24 pack just because he is closer to his 2 sisters than we are and they might need a couple rolls. Other wise he has enough for 4 months. I have 4 months supply of cleaning products and personal products. I have bar soap when the liquid soap runs out.We have no eat out money, no spending money and no clothing money. I do have money put back for Hubby to get new boots. He no longer needs steel toes and would like the next pair to not have that. That will probably happen when the stay at home goes off and he can go to the store in Sidney that carrys his style of boot.Eighteen months of this roller coaster can be smoothed out by you in your home.Think of this It was during this time that Calvin Coolidge was quoted as saying “Eat it up, Wear it out, Make it do, or Do without” (Later, the phrase became more popular with, “Use it up.”)Blessed be I spotted old sq ft boxes behind the garden shed that we could use in the north garden.Hubby pulled them out and fixed what needed to be fixed (I get to remove the string as I will be using them for strawberries and onions. This is from the house, 4 of the red pots has blueberry bushes, one doesn't look like it's going to make itThe red pot towards the burn barrel has flowers in it. I have a couple smaller pots over by the blueberries that have a maple tree started from seed from the old farm. The tree had been started by landlords grandfather and given as a gift as a young tree when landlords Dad started building the house. The tree had been hit by lighting and they knew it was going to come down so I started seeds from it. I kept one for myself and gave him 6 when they got about a foot tall. I also have a lilac bush that was started for me.This is that garden from the road . The patch on the left side is the asparagus... about 80 ft long and 5 ft wide. Thankful it's not over flowing at this point. We have 3 people that are wanting to take crowns next spring.If it does any better than last year they will find asparagus on their doorsteps instead of the zucchini LOL.Hubby pulled out the boxes to the north garden. We walked what I thought I wanted then I changed it as soon as I mentions I was putting trellis on the strawberries this year to grow peas and beans... had to move the boxes as I didn't want to shade the rhubarb that grows the length of the garden... 18 patches. Good thing we like it.He hates getting his picture taking LOL. The stakes are holding the trellis to the blackberries.. He is putting weed barrier down for the sq fts that bunts up against the barrier that is there for the berries. NO TRIMMING this way between the boxes or between the boxes and berries.This is the sand box we had for Pat when he lived with us for a year while his mom (Daughter 4) went through recovery (clean and sober almost 6 yrs and got her Lupus and bipolar under control). This box will be for the strawberries that are already here... about 10 plants. They are in the grass so I want to move them.The nectarine, peach, and apricot trees are in. Too bad of weather to plant right now so they are protected on the front porch. Hubby priced stone to put in the bottom of the pots.Planting them in pots for 1-2 yrs until we know for sure where we want them. Local place wants $15 for what would be each pot...Menard's is $3 for the same stone per pot. SO Hubby is going to Menard's. Not today as the high winds would make it hard to drive in. He wished he had already ordered the gravel for the driveway.Since he is going to Menards, I asked him for a list for all the projects we decided to do. A trip to Menards wipes at the morning or afternoon. If we go ahead and get the stuff(money already set aside) then it's here, no running back and forth, no waiting until we are in that area anyways. Saves gas and time."},
{"title": "question for those that raise chickens or buy farm fresh eggs.", "date": "Sunday, April 12, 2020", "text": "I kept 2 dozen fresh from the neighbor ,back for 12 weeks (then tested them to make sure they were good) to make deviled eggs. Did different batches... one with baking soda ..suppose to help... it was worse.  one with a steamer... that was not as bad as the baking soda. One batch with vinegar... better but half was still going into the egg salad... the last batch was cracking the shell the last 2 min of cooking... good but still at least 1/4 is going into egg salad.ANY SUGGESTIONS?I now have enough boiled eggs for deviled eggs and chicken salad(have leftover chicken) ham salad (ham tomorrow), potato salad and possible egg salad. Can you tell what is on the menu this week???Dogs got 1 1/2 dozen medium eggs fried for them today.I have a dozen of medium for dogs (yes I weigh my eggs, culinary training), 2 dozen large for baking and 4 dozen extra large/jumbo for other in the basement for next week.I also have a dozen large on the counter for the baking this weekend and 3 dozen extra large/jumbo for French toast, custard , bread pudding, cheese cake ( I have a couple jumbos equal to 2 large eggs. I marked them so I can use them for pie actually not a cake) and homemade noodles to be done this week. I am over ran with eggs.I also had 2 1/2 gal of milk that have the expiration date of yesterday. Last night's potato soup took care of 1/2 gal... Enough soup left of Monday lunch. I am down 1 3/4 gals now... figured custard, bread pudding , cheese cake and sausage gravy will bring it down especially when I use it in my coffee. Hubby is out Monday working so he will pick up milk then.I pulled the last of the sliced bread from the freezer for the bread pudding and will make French toast with half of it. More milk and eggs usedSince I am baking ham (found in the bottom of barn freezer that we cleared out... more about that) I decided I would make augratin potatoes from dehydrated potatoes and Scalloped potatoes from dehydrated potatoes. I haven't tried this. I use dehydrate diced potatoes in soups and casseroles and dehydrate hash browns. But I have a nice bucket full of slices and decided to start using them. Also more milk used.Between the kids getting food from us and what we have eaten ,I had enough space to move everything that was in the barn deep freezer except the unsalted butter into the basement deep freezers. Hubby was amazed. He then took a couple buckets we had cleaned and put water in them and put them in the freezer.... WHY?It never got cold enough to freeze ponds or river for the Amish to harvest ice so they are ALL OUT OF ICE. E has a spring house so it stays on the cool side but not enough to put the calf meds in . So he was asking around and one of the Mennonites was able to sell him a bit of ice. We decided to take our square buckets, sanitize them  as they were kitty litter and kitty food buckets. We made the first block and took it over today. M was happy and then cried when Hubby told her we have 2 more freezing. Takes about 3-4 days to freeze solid. One block last 7 days this time a year, early summer is two a week and the dogs days of summer 3 a week .Days of 100 it can get to one EACH DAY. So we figured we would just keep making it and taking it over. They can always store the extra in the ice house. It won't fill their ice house but she won't be worrying about her dairy spoiling or him about the calves meds going bad. Things are bad enough that we need to help ease each other's burden.Son 2 has several older friends (like older than us) that don't have family around so he is cooking Easter dinner and delivering plates of food to them. He mentioned he didn't want anyone to eat alone and I told him his youngest sister (daughter 4)  is going to be alone. Her kids are going to be there for lunch but that was it. She texted me this morning he was going to drop off food to her tomorrow evening. AND then they are going to video chat to each other while eating their dinners. Got to love technologyWe made a judgement call to wait on trying to refill the pantry of non food or sugar , flour,  and pasta.I will make a curb pick up order at Krogers for later this week or early next week.We are digging through Daddy's stuff and another friend's stuff he got from his mom for canning jars. Yep.... tis the season. Asparagus is coming in and rhubarb is right behind it.We found canning jars at $12 a case if not cheaper. I figured $16 at I couldn't find them less than $15 last year. SO the budget allowed me to get 1/2 gal canning jars. Not that I will can in them but I can put the pasta and dried beans in them and move those quart jars to the regular canning jars.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Getting nothing done but spending money , reading new book", "date": "Tuesday, April 7, 2020", "text": "Our county health dept mailed these out to everyone. Mine is now posted on my doorI scanned it and sent it to a couple of friends that said their county health dept told them they wasn't doing that.Work truck aka Ford in shop for tie rods and ball joints... so they checked the rest of the truck because Hubby hauls... needs brakes also along with an oil change. Chung $5000Flatbed trailer was in for tires $$New dog truck aka Chevy is in different shop being gone over completely since we just bought it and it is used. If needs more than oil change and fluids topped off our mechanic will call. $$Quarterly taxes are coming due within a month.$$Need more dirt, more paint for the garden boxes I am building ($$). I did find a total of 5 of the old sq ft boxes. Hubby checked them out and told me 2 need repairs and all need new string if I am going to section them off and we are out of clothes line (now ordered along with another drying rack so I can dry bedding in house without the dryer). I use clothes line to section off 1 ft sqs. He flipped when he saw all the pots and grow bags I had dug around and pulled out and put on front porch. Asked if I was hoarding pots LOL. Not really as I usually give back the pots after I plant when I buy from the Amish. Glad I didn't do that last year.We decided that green house I thought would work is doable. ($$)It will go on the south end of the barn where the sliding door is so when it gets too warm I can just crack open the door and the heat will go in the barn. ALSO I don't have to open an outside door to get in so there is no cold air hitting the plants. Water hydrant is on the on the other side by Hubby felt he could install the 50 gal water barrel we HAVE and just fill it as needed and then I am not dragging a water hose through snow. E said he would help with it if he has time. He has increased his gardens 1/3rd also at the request of M. Plus is putting in 2 more acres of feed corn. He is planting oats behind us. We might have enough stuff to build it and only need the plastic.Larger garden,more seeds and plants($$) AND canning jars and food saver bags(jars and bags ordered) $$.Is Hubby panicking? Maybe. Enough that he asked E if he could pay the land rent(he rents our back 3 acres) a month early (usually pays in May) but Hubby has the repair bill on the truck plus he might need tires on the livestock trailer and he has to pay for 3 inspections to finish his stuff for the state and work is to a crawl of 1-2 days and then maybe 1-2 loads instead of the normal 3-5 loads a day 5 days a week. I did cover his expenses for the year when we pulled the money, he just doesn't want to have to use it unless he can't cover what ever bill.It seems like a flood of $$ going out the door, but the retirement fund has already made 1/2 of what we pulled out so that's good.I am not panicking. I am not worrying though I might stress a bit about getting it all done without putting myself in the hospital. My moods are swinging right along with the weather and I miss my daddy so bad, grieving because I face I might not see him alive again since we can't see him in the nursing home. We get reports, got distant family and friends that work in that nursing home. He doesn't recognize us anyways... but still... Gardening has been what we shared and this spring is hitting hard of not having him to share it with. He was getting worse (dementia and not being able to eat more than baby food when this started.... it's only going to be worse by time we can see him.Trucks and car need maintenance... granted I didn't think any of them would need $5000 in one trip but it is what it is. That's the truck that makes the money so it's fix it.Changing how we grow and what we grow and adding fruit trees and berry bushes and winter green house costs money.. in the long run it will SAVE money and be healthier for us. I don't see me doing a recall on my own lettuce that I am eating.Hubby brought home flowers along with a free pizza .I am reading this bookI need to go through my seeds as he says what ones grow the best with how he is growing them. NO HEAT source which is a biggie for me.As it is a rainy day I have several projects I can do ...right after the nap."},
{"title": "sitting down and  shuffling ", "date": "Friday, April 3, 2020", "text": "projects, money and food.First We need the basement ramp wall and the kitchen porch fixed this summer. Hubby thinks the drain in the area is broke and it's washing dirt out from the porch causing it to drop and forcing the wall on ramp to shift.Hubby priced it out at $1200... I looked over his figures and made it $2000 and told him he forgot he would (whether it's good or bad) replace the drain as it is over 20 yrs old. Nor did he count on replacing any of the porch frame if it was bad. I can use the old floor to build more garden boxes or other stuff.SecondThen we looked at the deck railing. Hubby is going to pull out what we have left of the building supplies and then we will figure out what we still need. We will definitely designing it to hang hummingbird feeders and plants.Priced it at $1000.... neither of us think the railing for the ramp is here because we weren't sure how long it was going to be.ThirdDrive way needs finished and widened....Hubby was going to stone around the pond but decided not to. E is planning to have a couple colts graze his land on the other side of us so we could just leave the gate open to the pond so they can have a water supply. Side benefit would be we wouldn't be mowing it every 4-5 days as the horses would graze closer to the pond.Propane truck can't cross our concrete sidewalk as it would break it so it's a debate whether to finish the driveway to the basement....We do have to widen the driveway. Hubby's truck has one side or the other in the yard... I had wanted it to be 2 car wide to begin with... looks like I am getting my way.Priced out at $2000. That's on the high side but we thought we might have to move the mail box about 3 ft and Hubby will use concrete there so the mail carrier doesn't get stuck in that area. A small culvert will have to be installed where the ditch runs under the driveway. Two types of stone will be used.. base stone is expensive but necessary .FourthGardens...we have probably all the boards we need to make sq.ft garden boxes to get us started. Not including what boards can be reused from kitchen porch project.I will be painting the boards as they are not treated. I have done this before and the boards lasted 5 -6 yrs before I had to replaced...longer than the vinyl ones did.I have at least 1 if not two sq ft boxes we brought from the old farm.I have large pots for trees to be put in until planted.I have 15 gal grow bags and 25 gal grow bags for the potatoesI have several of pots of different sizes I can use.If I say I have all my seeds and plants I will probably realized I missed something. I actually have went back and ordered seeds to grow dried beans as I realized after seeing a pound of Navy beans selling for over $5 I needed to make room to grow more than what I was.I asked before we even moved in to have a winter growing house. Hubby put me off last fall.... I even pointed out a couple styles that is around us that is NOT heated.....He agreed this summer we would get one up, might not be what I wanted but we would get something up. He misses his salads during the winter and I am get stressed thinking I bought something on recall (usually after we ate it). I think this style will be good for the two of usWe can put it on the south side of the barn( taking the cost of the that side off the building costs) and I can enter through the barn. The barn has a water hydrant on that side also so running a garden house that we already have would do. I saw this on this sitehttps://extension.umn.edu/growing-systems/deep-winter-greenhousesThis works in Minnesota so it should work here.It does look like they are growing the crops in rain spouting... not a big deal as there is an Amish about 4 miles from us that makes spouting to order.Money Retirement is back to making some money after we pulled money. I put part of the money we pulled  in Hubby's savings to help him cover what ever with the business.He went from hauling 2-3 loads of pallets 5 days a week to only hauling 2 loads once or twice a week. BUT he has picked up hauling livestock, corn seed, food (was on pallet) and Amish farm equipment a load averaging twice a week.  Still he is going to be a bit short if it continues all summer.The Amish produce auction is not going to open this month so that is 4 jobs he knows isn't going to happen. I can see him being short on money to cover the business for a few more months.I put 3 months of house hold bill money in Ally savings... keeps our fingers out of it.I put 5 months household ( or 3 if we need more to cover business) in a CD.We bought a new to us truck to transport dogs. We use the car about twice a week to run Amish on short trips. The bank they use here in town (our bank also) is closing it's branch so they have to go 5 miles one way... it's an hour to 1 1/2 hrs trip for those in this area... I am now getting asked at least every other week to take some one to the bank.They have even starting asking others if they need something at the bank and take it with them when I take them. Last week we stopped 3 times on the way back (all on the way) to drop off deposit slips.New dog truckWe offered 2/3 rds of their asking price, a few minutes later they accepted. Has less than 100,000 miles so even though it's a 2005, we should get it to out last the dogs. Well , maybe not Charlotte as she's only 2 going to be 3 on Father's day.As for the balance of what we pulled I am sitting on until we get some of the project supplies in. Then what is left will go to a CD.FoodHEAVENS... We have enough for at least 6 month to year That gets us to the harvest and praying that it doesn't get flooded out like last year or burnt up like 2011. The 6 months is if we need to share. We have 2 daughters that are not working. One will get unemployment, probably by time she is back to work. The other one is a server.... so are 2 of her 3 boys living with her... All income has stopped. Their unemployment check together won't even pay the rent let alone utilities and food.We told them to not go to the food pantries that we would help. I sent money for milk. Both are now baking bread including the one that doesn't cook from scratch EVERY and she's 40.AND then 2 wks ago Son 2 lets me know he can't find Navy beans and is on a CALL LIST for when they come in. He checked on Monday and was told MAYBE a month... so he asked the price $5.50 for a pound. I sent him 3- 1 lb bags of Navy beans, 1 lb of pinto( soup then refried or bean burgers), 1 lb of small red beans (red beans and rice (he was stationed in Georgia for 4 yrs or bean burgers) and 1 lb of black beans with a package of sazon seasoning for Cuban black beans and rice...bean burger or soup also... 2 lbs of minute rice and the last 3 Jiffy corn meal boxes that my brother gave me that was Daddy's. Expiration date was 12/31/2019... still good as Daughter 4 just used one of the two she took.  Was less than him buying the beans.SO that sent me off pricing soup beans.... I then ordered more seed to plant for soup beans LOL. I will pay that amount to grow them, I am not paying that amount to make 1 pot of bean soup.Asparagus is coming up... I will do a test of freezing it and seeing if we will eat it that way. I pickled most of it last year of what we didn't eat or give away. I do have 3 people willing to come pick if we get ran over... Patch is 4 ft wide and at least 80 ft long.I told Hubby if we worked hard at it this year, we should be self sufficient in 3 yrs. IF the fruit trees produce then. We will have to buy tropical fruit always. Not enough heat in long enough season to grow them here. BUT that also means I need more canning jars and canning lids.Temperature is now warm enough to paint the garden boxes..Blessed be everyone"},

Young men that ran in and out of my daughter's home like their were her own.  A young woman still unidentified was shot in the head on the sidewalk in front of the apt.A young man (who my granddaughter does not know) went to the cops and said he was robbed in the hall way in front of that apt door by 1 guy he knew 100 % that had a gun and threatened to blow his brains out if he didn't give him his money and what ever drugs he had on him ( he had pot and he told the cops he how much he had) He was 80% sure of the guy that came up behind him and put him in a head lock. He figured they thought he wouldn't tell the cops they robbed him even after hearing of the murders. Broke his heart as he wondered if they actually followed him there and thought the 2 murdered would have more... they didn't even do drugs, he was just stopping due to stay in place was going into effect and wanted to make sure they had enough groceries while he was out getting stuff for his mom.Triggered MY kids as they had a friend murdered who was not in to drugs or anything but his brother who was in that kind of world was in a territory battle with another drug \"king\" and he thought they murdered his brother to get to him.HARD enough times without this on top of it.None had life ins so parents are now trying to find money to bury their children when they don't even have jobs and can't get through to unemployment to file even online..."},

Of things I want to mark off punch list and this is bugging me list.So here is this week's listI can take bread off the list as when Hubby pit stopped at Save a Lot when he got fuel around the corner he grabbed a gal of milk and a large loaf of bread.Kt is marked off also.Tomorrow is Tuesday. So that's ironing, shine windows and mirror, swish and swipe the bathrooms. Hubby is home so it's go over the finances of his business and our home finances.Since Hubby is home he can help clear the mudroom of the extra boxes.I took another one of the pizza crusts and made taco pizza for supper I did wash the rags after dinner and they are now on the drying rack.Hubby hauling pallets as usual.I made the bed.I remade the couch. We put a comforter on the couch for the dogs to lay on... Charlotte tinkled on it yesterday when the boys were petting her. Didn't got through to the couch. I washed it last night and tossed it in the dryer. I took the dog blanket I had laid on couch and put back on the floor beside the bed where Wilbur will lay when he is hot.I did the laundry and have it on the drying rack, walkers and shower curtains. Really damp outside but at least the snow is gone because we got RAIN when we warmed up a bit.I unloaded the dishwasher.I dusted.I walked down the lane and got the mail after I waved Hi to the mail lady.I topped off the oil in the containers in kitchenI cooked the dogs eggs, keeps Wilbur from having dandruffI've held Charlotte that is constantly pacing... Wilbur and Rascal are snoozing so I don't know what is going on since Rascal is my scaredy  cat.I ordered herb plants for the gardens. I wasn't going to with the way the IRA is dropping but I have the money now and in long run it keeps the home running.I restocked the kitchen from pantry and freezers, needed yeast, salted butter, unsalted butter and cheese. Pulled phyllo shells to put choc pudding in, brownie mix, pumpkin whoopie cookies and a box of frozen waffles Son 2 gave me.I took the jars that had been in the dishwasher, put new canning lids on and took to basement and put with the rest of the empty canning jars.I've ate , took meds and figure out that I would be taking another pizza crust and making taco pizza as I have a couple of tomatoes that need used and know I have lettuce.AND IT'S NOT EVEN 1 PM... sighDaughter 2 let me know she was coming up Sunday, her boyfriend (ha ha they are over 40) was bringing her. She's laid off. Two of her sons and the one girlfriend came in their own car. JD told me he came to see us because he knows if I get this I most likely won't make it. He wanted me to know he loved me, respected me and was thankful for all that I had done for him and his mom and brothers. DN told me the same thing. They understand the reality better than a lot of adults. Daughter 2 said she was glad we were in this area with neighbors that will help. Her boyfriend (actually a kid that was in and out of our home when they were growing up) was in shock over my pantry. BUT they both agreed they should be doing the same. Daughter 2 who has NEVER baked bread (but makes popovers) asked for 1lb of yeast. She's been out of bread for 4 days.I packed this up over Saturday and we added 2 coolers of meat to it SundayI had steak, onions and mushrooms fajitas Saturday nightWe had it as leftovers SundayI have 2 more pizza crusts that need used up.When I went  to bed Sunday night this was what we hadyep it snowed... Laundry was washed and hung on kitchen porch line then quickly brought back in an hour later when the down pour and wind hit. Most was dry so it was just a few things to hang on the drying rack.New shower liners for if one of us gets sick and needs to hibernate in bedroom and need hung in hall  have been washed  and dried so they won't smell and make me sick that way.Hutch now has some of Mother's kitchen stuff on top of itThe Hoosier is decluttered and I no longer have strainers falling on my head. Nor is there odds and ends waiting to be put away.This was my parents table when they got married 70 yrs ago. Mr Johnson who was in his 50s gave it to him after his wife died told Mother and Daddy they had bought it new when they got married so it's close to 100 yrs old. I tossed a lot of paper clutter off this.

So today is going to be taken care of.keep a schedule. get up at a set time, eat meals at a set time, go to bed at a set time... DO NOT DRIFT through the days. It's not a vacation.Plan daily chores, cleaning needs to be done daily in the bathrooms and kitchen and where ever you are just hanging out. Wipe remotes and PHONES.Plan an enjoyable activity... game, movie, get outside in the yard (not with a group of people over 10.)Fix snacks... limit how much they  or yourself can have.Plan physical activities especially for children... if you just sit around you won't sleep well which means your mind will worry about what you can not control.Focus on what you CAN control... look up new recipes that will stretch your food or find substitutes for what you are out of. I get at least one text a week asking what to replace what with.Sheltering in place sucks even for a homebody. I did ask Hubby if we could once or twice a week take a ride around the block in the dog truck... which means I want to take the dogs for the ride also.Monday Amish got a letter from the state asking them to close their schools and for those 70 and older to shelter in place.Hubby got 3 calls to haul so he was off to work. Since he has a package coming in that had to be signed for I had to stay on the first floor since I can't hear the door in the loft or in the basement. His new phone is in which is very good as his old one is no longer updating his apps and he needs to put another app on it for his businessSO No I didn't get to start my seeds.I did laundry as usual, cleaned 3 frigs as usual since Tuesday at 6:15-6:45 trash is picked up.I decluttered the bedroom which I hadn't realized was that bad. I replaced a broken curtain rod also.I decluttered the laundry room including the dresser. I am thinking of changing the table linen from the dresser so I can put the bed sheets/pillowcases in the dresser and get rid of the hamper that holds the bed stuff. Then I could hang the rack to hold the dust mop and mop .Broom sits by trash can always. dust pan hang at top of basement steps which share the kitchen wall where the trash can is.I decluttered the hall.I answered the door 6 times... 3 deliveries from Fed x. 2 from post office (they have someone delivering packages as the carrier can't lift at the moment)  and one from a neighbor down the road checking to make sure we didn't need anything.We talked through my glass door.Hubby called four times and son called twice and then daughter 2 blew up my phone with texts... She finally decided she was coming up Sunday to get food and cleaning supplies but did mention if she was sick, she would still be here but she would let me know to put the stuff on the porch or somewhere else and just let her know. She is a server and will barely make enough to pay her rent. Her 3 teenage sons are working some and they are going to try to cover the utilities. She has enough to make it to Monday.TuesdayIt's 10:30 and I have already answered the door for a package then Mail lady then pulled in (wearing gloves) to give me a package for Hubby's business. Amish neighbor H came over to use the house phone. He stayed out side because he deals a lot with the public and doesn't want to share germs since he knows I am sheltered in place. He  walked away from door until I put the phone outside and shut the door again.Laundry is washed and hung to dry.I gathered some cleaning products for Daughter 2 and decluttered the south and north lofts while doingI decluttered wheelchair bathroom which wasn't much.I plan (ha ha) to declutter the kitchen and dining room and start seeds and get hangers out of the basement.Wednesday list islaundry as usualdecluttering front room and mudroomironing about 21 shirts.ThursdayNo errands or doctor appts.laundry as usualdeclutter the basementdeclutter the office (west loft)Friday depending on weathereither out in the gardens prepping areas for sq ft gardensor starting in the barn of declutteringSaturdayIs going to be  a thorough cleaning since Daughter 2 is suppose to come up.

But she is a NURSE so definitely understands...I want to stay current with the news but not be sucked into the depression of it. I keep Hubby up to date as the Amish he is around is counting on him to keep them current with this news.I don't want to focus on what I don't have but the blessings I do have.I imagine our elders had many a new way of life.... WW1 and WW2, Great Depression. Spanish flu pandemic which was the worst one that lasted 2 yrs.SO take care, stay safe, make sure information you pass on is correct. I've nailed a couple friends on FB for false information. FACT NOT FEAR needs to be the motto right along with THIS TOO SHALL PASS.Blessed BeDaughter 4 who also has a suppressed immune system and her 3 drove a 4 hr round trip to come get toilet paper. I filled her car with food and cleaning supplies. Kids had food sitting on their laps and under their feet besides the full trunk. Even Daughter had 5 dozen eggs sitting on her lap as she drove. I don't think the kids will ever make another comment about how I stock for a year to two years. She is looking for her factory to shut down soon as two of the four plants they supply have shut down effective immediately.Son 2 called to make sure I had what I needed... He had been to the store and grabbed the limit of 2 toilet paper in case one of his sisters or elderly friends needed some. He had enough at home barring diarrhea to go to May.Hubby went and got 156 lbs of dog food...that will take us to May.He also stopped today after getting his CDL physical and drug test to get me 2 bottles of Jack Daniels Tn Honey.(HE was glad I insisted he have hand sanitizer  in his truck)  I use it for hot toddy's when I am sick, I don't usually keep it this time of year but with the way things are going...I was going to cut back in the gardens...nope, that's not happening. Even Son 2 has asked me to grow kale and Brussels sprouts for him.Daughter 4 wants what ever she can get due to knowing she's not going to have money for food and won't qualify for food stamps as her kids don't live with her.I ordered 2 shower curtains, hooks and a tension rod to put in the hall if one of us gets sick  we can quarantine in the bedroom and that bathroom (and laundry room )  and the other one can still get to the pantry without having to go outside and down the ramp.I will be changing the routine for home blessing... It's going to be more than normal especially with Hubby still working in public. I don't greet him at the door any more, he goes straight to the bathroom and washes his hands.With the stock market rolling and knowing his work will be cut down or completely off... we are looking at our finances a bit harder. We just got propane and if the weather stays decent we won't need more until late summer. We don't have cable. Our internet and home phone are a fixed amt though we could drop cell service but since I had a heart attack while driving in the middle of the boonies and didn't have a phone to call for help. I can see Hubby refusing to go that route.I would not be surprised if this doesn't trigger something along the Great Depression."},
{"title": "Why TP is in high demand", "date": "Friday, March 13, 2020", "text": "Most of people are used to going to the store when ever, doing pit stops for something they are out of or want. Ordering in, eating out, grabbing a meal from the grocery store...This is changing fast.I'm in Ohio, Nursing homes are allowing no visitors (I miss my Daddy, but Brother gets a phone call daily from nursing home with status report, Daddy okay). K-12 schools closed for 3 weeks (if not more), grandkids not in school won't get free meals and will be using the TP at home. Only grandchild needing care while his parents work is great grandson and his great grandparents on the other side live within a mile of him so it's covered. BUT he will be using their TP instead of the daycare's. There is a BAN of any gathering of 100 or more in any 1 room. Right now that does not include retail or factories but that could be coming sooner rather than later. TP, sanitizer and cleaning products are being hoarded ...WHY?First the average person uses 2 rolls of TP a week... multiply that by how many you have in your home or could if you are taking care of someone that doesn't live in your home. Now you have your weekly amount.NOW times that by at least a 3 wk amount if you had to be quarantined... 2 weeks to recover and 1 week to be well enough to actually go to the store... I will use Daughter 4 as example as she is down to her last roll (and is kicking herself) and has 3 kids. SO that is 4 times 2 equals 8... she knows they use about 2 rolls a week for kleenex with out colds and adds 2 more if they all have colds so that is 12 rolls a week... now times that by 3 wks... that is 36 rolls just for 3 weeks. BUT she has only been buying the small packs and didn't stock any more. She now is going to have to drive 4 hrs round trip to get tp from me...All the rest of the kids had already stocked up.SECOND OKAY ... FLU causes diarrhea... if you are already using 10 a week normally that is going to increase with diarrhea. I know I personally will double the usage.. Daughter 4 says her family does also so she now needs 72 rolls of tp to cover regular and flu usage.Third... quarantine... we already know it's 2 wks... but you might not feel well enough to go shopping or worse your home goes on quarantine because instead of everyone getting it at once you went one by one with a week or two between ... now add that it could be 4 wks.... Stocking up is good, hide sight is always 20 20 . Things could get worse , factories and retail shut down and you won't even have a place to go get tp...  What are you going to use instead.You can use corn husks if available.. soak in water if they are dried.. and toss in trash not your toilet.You can use a rag and wash just like you would a cloth diaper...those that don't know about using a cloth diaper or how to clean one, google it.Do you have prescription meds for the month or for 3 months? DO you have stuff for colds and flu for the entire family ?Do you have cleaners for the home ? You will be cleaning more with the flu in the home.DO you have sick food and drinks for 3 weeks for the entire family?IF you are touching someone as soon as you come through the door STOP. GO WASH YOUR HANDS FIRST.We went out yesterday. Hubby is an EMT so we practice hygiene probably more... BUT we caught ourselves a couple times doing things we shouldn't.touching the screen at the ATM and gas pump without gloves or a paper towel (which there was none so now I have it in the car and Hubby is getting a pair of old gloves to use for fuel pumping).I have now gloves in the car for shopping.Not sanitizing our hands BEFORE we got in the car from shopping and eating at a restuarant. I had to spray my car when we got home. We did sanitize our hands BEFORE we entered the house.Touching the door at the restaurant... I used my arm to open it, Daughter 4 pointed out that you sneeze and cough on your arm, to use my foot or my back to open door, if I have to pull them open to use a cloth or towel. She is still wearing her winter gloves, washed them out every night with hot water and soap and hangs them up to dry for morning. YES same kid that didn't stock TP.NOT SHARING FOOD OR DRINK... okay , this is something we have always done... especially when eating out and asking the other one do you want a bite to try this? Not happening any more.Hubby is not worried about me giving him it but of me getting it from him. He works for a community of people that do not vaccinate. Stop and think, what you need... TP will be back on the shelves, they haven't stopped making it but they aren't going to build factories to cover the shortish.They have workers that are getting sick too.If you have the habit of buying a meal and not cooking much at home, make sure you have a month's supply of shelf stable food to feed your family 3 meals a day and 1-2 snacks. ALONG with drinks.There are guidelines for stocking for a pandemic... google them"},
{"title": "when you think you weren't frugal all week", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2020", "text": "and realize you really were more than you thoughtHubby is dotting i's and crossing t's for his hobby turned business. He ball parked it costing $6,000 to start, I said $8000... it's closer to $10,000... almost to the dollar of the trailer he paid off last year.He called our farm ins guy and asked for referrals for a business inc..... Our guy came back with 8 quotes... he marked 3 that he felt offered the best coverage. We chose 1, and paid for the year (ouch) to save us over $1000.When Legal zoom called to verify all they did (which saved us $2000 compared to local lawyer) they offered to do the state stuff... Hubby turned down the offer saving us $1600, he has spent 8 hrs so far doing the state stuff himself.He still have to get a DOT physical and drug test.He still has to have both trailers and the truck inspected.He has to change the plates on the one trailer to commercial , tags are due in June anyways.He has to finish his UCR  (some registration) and the IFTA (fuel stuff)..it's in process. When DOT called him, to go over what was needed , they were surprised he had so much done or in process. Said it normally takes 4-6 months to get someone through it. They did send him an email so he can check it off and then send them back the info they need when he is finished. Might be because we both have been self employed and know what needs done. He got his business bank acct.Now I am running 4 checking and 4 savings on top of the IRA. He hate paperwork and I do better at saving than he does.Hubby took pet screen that we bought to replace a window screen and cut it and made covers for the ends of our rain gutters... there is a screen over the top to stop birds from making nests but they didn't put end caps on it so the birds just wiggled in through the ends. We figure if the dogs can't cut it with their nails the birds can't with their beaks.I washed all the towels, bedding, dog blankets aka beds and throw blankets and dried them on the yard clothes line when we had a warm breezy day yesterday. I dried 2 pillows I washed from the couch (Wilbur lays on them) in the dryer.We sat down with the punch list we created when we bought the house 2 yrs ago. and updated repeatedly through those two years. We have 163 still listed.I cleared the blue berry bushes pots, made a note for Hubby as he is usually the one to make the coffee for us, to not toss the coffee grounds to use in the blueberries.I cleared the black berry vines , need 2 more trellis added as they have grown past the trellis that is there.I cleared the 12 rhubarb mounds, E told me to take the manure that is he spread in the pasture last month if I needed if for my rhubarb because it would be well rotted by now and next Feb to use 10-10-10 fertilizer before they come up.I cleared the flower hill and the small lily patch at the mudroom door.I cleared the herb garden that Hubby mowed over 3 times last year. Since they came back up Hubby has requested I move them to a sq ft garden.I cleared the strawberry patch and I requested they be moved to a sq ft garden as the grass in that area is over taking the strawberries.I cleared the walking onions patch. Looks like I might be able to start getting a few this year.I started a rock garden in the cubby area that grows weeds and the dogs run through. I used weed barrier we already had that Hubby took up last fall and gathered large rocks out of the gardens and where ever I find them around here. E told me to walk the back field after he plows as there are several back there.I started clearing the flower garden on the north side of the house. I have some bulbs I am going to plant there that did well on the north side of the old farm.We cleared a 6 x 6 ft area in the barn to put stuff we are giving to Daughter 4 (she takes our donations and passes them to people that are in need) PLUS she figures her daughter who is graduating this year is probably going to get her own place, she's talked of a studio or a 1 bedroom as she doesn't want to have a room mate at first.Clothing budget came in under.New phone came in a bit over budget but I needed ear buds so I can be hands free for our law in state. I am going to have to learn talk to text and how to voice command my GPS LOL.. Son 2 can help me with that as he uses it all the time. Hubby connects through his truck radio. I might do that also. I usually just don't bother to answer it if I get a call or text but I have clicked to check GPS which means it is in hand... I bought a weather tech phone cup holder as I don't have any place to put a phone on my dash that won't block my view.Nor will the vent clip that Hubby uses work with my vents.We ate from the freezer in the kitchen... All that is left is fish patties(4 for 1 meal) ice cream, orange zest, 3 small packages of lunch meat to wrap around pickles with cream cheese and ice packs. I will have to reload it from one of the other freezers for this coming week.I have to straighten the spices and herbs, can winter sq, and do the ironing. Not sure what I will get done . I woke up buried in dogs and my back is complaining about it. I think I heard a rumble of thunder while I was sleeping. Charlotte and Rascal don't like thunder. Rascal hates wind I definitely heard it. Might have to take a nap instead LOLHow is your week going?"},
{"title": "Preparing to buy list for buying clothes", "date": "Monday, March 2, 2020", "text": "Two years ago we bought this house. Now that we have been here we have noticed how we dress different and how clothes and shoes/boots are wearing out. Hubby wore uniforms when he worked factory. So he didn't wear out clothes much.We set the budget at $1000... that sounds like a lot but actually we have more than that in the clothing budget. We both need winter coats. Hubby wears carhartt... not cheap but they will last him about 5 yrs... He usually only replaces one set (coat and bibs) for good and then moves the old good one down. He picked up about 4 inches on his waist and can't get the good set zipped. I told him to put that set back (as he is trying to lose the weight) and get 2 new sets.First thing we did was go through Hubby's clothes. His clothes are ragged and stained so I pulled most of them. Daughter 4 is going to use them for rags and donate what ever she doesn't use. He has nice tee shirts (that were in a bottom drawer where there was 2 dozen from when he told the kids to buy him colored tees ), nice undies and socks. Jeans for work... he is down to 4 pairs and 2 of them should be replaced ASAP due to where they are worn thin in areas it would be an issue if it gave way. He has 3 pairs of dress pants *he very seldom wears* His work long sleeve jean shirts he always wears year around... toast.. all 8 of them are toast.  I ordered one from Amazon(wardrobe prime) and if he likes how it fits I will order more *$10 each*.  He like Rural King carpenter pants but they were out of his size for awhile. I just found them again on line so ordered him 3 pairs *$10 each*He needs 2 carhartt bibs *1 work 1 other* and 2 carhartt coats *1 work 1 other*. But those he will have to suck it up and try on when we go to doctor's appt and run errands on Thursday.I will need a new winter coat. SIGH... Mother used to buy a coat a little big on her and than give it to me. Daddy would give me which ever coat he decided he didn't want anymore as he was always shopping at the thrift shops for leather coats.I haven't bought a winter coat for a decades.I need one pair of dress pants in brown and one in black.I need one pair of white jeans(ordered with sale of half price).I need no sleeve blouses  (ordered with sale of half price).I need long sleeve white blouse (ordered with sale of half price).I need 2 maxi skirts (ordered with sale of half price).I do not know about skorts as those are still in storage of the barn but I have new shorts from last year,I hope they still fit as I have found most of what I had to be about 2 sizes to big even after I took things in last year.I am hoping that's not the case with the shorts I bought last year.I need shoes for summer... slip on tennis shoes. I started looking last year, made due with 2 pairs my granddaughter passed down to me... Still looking.I wear a chef croc in the gardens so I can spray the dirt off.A men's work boot when mowing. I have nice dress shoes and sandals. I have light weight coats and jackets and hoodies. I have shawls and scarfs.I tried on my jeans. Passed 3 pairs to Daughter 4 as I have lost weight, rotated the pair I have been wearing with another pair.Decided to do some clothing capsules to get more wear out the nice clothes but for right now tee shirts and sweat pants are my around the home clothesHow do you work your wardrobe and replacing things?"},
{"title": "PS", "date": "Friday, February 28, 2020", "text": "a friend just asked me if we were quarantined if we would have enough food and meds for our dogs...we have 156 lbs of dog food in the barn and I can always cook food from the freezers if needed.  Meds..  we would make it 3 months.I didn't get two of the books read I wanted to read .... Killing Fog by Jeff Wheeler and the Journey Without You by Teresa Carter Kissie.I didn't do any winter sowing. Temperatures have been swinging from high 50s to teens. No wonder everyone is sick.I didn't start any seeds before I went to Son 2's so Hubby didn't have to worry about watering them.  I didn't start them when I got home because I had an allergy attack and figured I best get over it before I start messing in potting soil and stuff.I didn't feel well most of Feb and the week I did I was babysitting son 2 HA HASo for MarchHubby wants to have his LLC and DOT/PUCO numbers and a sign for his truck all set up. He still needs a digital log also but is looking for one to run on his phone. He is also looking at getting a better phone. His is several years old and it would handle what he is doing better if he had a more up to date phone.He wants to have the sq foot garden boxes cut and ready for me to paint by mid March. At this point I am thinking it will be probably closer to end of March due to 1 hauler being out of state for next 10 days, one still working on repairing his truck for next 2 wks and one out sick for next 5 days.He also wants to have his cost estimate of repair of basement ramp and kitchen porch around.Mine isstart seeds in grow light cart.paint and seal square foot garden boxes (going to be 2 ft wide, 8 ft long and 1 ft deep)I can do this in the barnFill sq ft garden boxes with soil and cover to warm.  Then start planting cool weather crops.That's the priority ...getting the food started.I want to also go through my clothes and down size again. I've lost inches so a lot of things are just \"hanging\" on me.We are eating from the freezers. I would like to see the 3 refrigerators freezers empty so I can start pulling food from the deep freezers. This should be very doable as I emptied on of the freezer drawers on the kitchen refrigerator last week and refilled it from the other freezers.I have a couple chuck roasts (buy 1 get 1 free plus $ off if I bought so much in the meat dept) to cook to make pot roast, Channel 10 (Columbus OH) Dom Tiberi pot roast chili (to can), beef veg soup (to can) and beef pot pie. Maybe beef and noodles if there is enough left.I need to put the house maintenance stuff in to storage that we got yesterday. I already put the OTC meds away.I need to put the non food stuff away. Freezer bags, foil, sandwich bags etc.I need to put the odds and ends of food we got also. Tortilla chips (we do nacho's a lot in warm weather) Fritos for Hubby when he eats chili. Potato chips for the sandwich meals  Coffee that was on sale for $2 off and then you got another $1 off if you bought 5, so basically I got 2 free. Coke/Sprite I am down to 1 coke every other day. Sprite for when I am sick.I got 3 lbs of frozen chicken breast for $1/lb due to being on sale and having coupon for the chicken. Going to cook all of it at one time for chicken salad and stir fry and chicken broccoli and rice dish.I got broccoli (for broccoli salad, stir fry and chicken dish)I got asparagus... too cold yet for ours but it's was $1.99 for a lb. I have none left in freezer but we have some jars of it pickled left.I got mushrooms half priced. Milk, heavy cream and half and half marked half priced.I got 4 large red bell peppers for the same price of 3 tricolor bells.  I can't eat green ones.I got 1 bunch of green onions.The only thing I didn't get on the list was wonton wraps and egg roll wraps because the store here doesn't carry it. I will get them next week when we have a doctor appt in Sidney as they carry them all the time. I have hamburger and bean sprouts and cabbage to make egg rolls with. And some recipes to make wonton soup since I have all the rest of the ingredients.I got tomatoes on the vine and shredded lettuce for tacos and enchiladasI got steakhouse salad mix with my coupon and marked down so we could have some fresh salad to help me adjust to eating raw veggies before they start coming in from the garden in May.I pulled Angel food cake slices today for dessert to go with mixed berry pie filling.We just finished the rhubarb strawberry pie.I would really really like to not be sick and tired during March as I am sick and tired of being sick and tired. I sure don't remember my parents every being as ill as my brother and me... Now Aunt Hazel and Grandma on Daddy's side was always sick. He always said I took after them."},
{"title": "Feb 25th Meals from the freezer... Talk of pandemic ", "date": "Tuesday, February 25, 2020", "text": "Hubby asked for a rhubarb or strawberry rhubarb pie... I pulled 1 qrt of rhubarb pie filling and 1 pint of strawberry pie filling, mixed them together and used store bought pie crust that had been in the freezer. It's now in the oven.He wants an apple crumb pie next.I pulled turkey noodles and sliced turkey out of the freezer to go with instant mashed potatoes, fruit cocktail and some veggie that I will find in the freezer for tonight's dinner.I pulled strata out of the freezer for tomorrow . There is enough for 2 meals with adding sides.I bombed the Feb pantry challenge of being efficient in the kitchen. Good Cheap Eats pantry challenge is to FILL the freezer... My freezers are FULL so we decide to empty the freezers. We also decided to go back to going to the store once a week until fresh produce starts coming in the gardens(late April /early May) as I've tossed enough that I am not trying to go every 2 wks anything more.Hubby is an EMT... emergency medical technician... it is a level above first responder. He asked if we went on quarantine due to the pandemic coronavirus aka Covid-19, would we be okay including medical supplies. Unless we needed the antiviral shot, we are covered.During the Black Death plague epidemic(7 yrs long ) quarantine ran up to 40 days.SO I thought would our children and grandchildren have enough food to go that long?Out of 6 kids, 2 would be in trouble, both live in apartments with limited storage, I told them to shove canned goods under the furniture. Out of 6 adult grandkids... ZERO would be in trouble. Well two might resort to using clothes or towels for diapers. I suggested ordering some cloth diapers and rubber pants.Hubby's parents have enough for 60 days including medications. Two daughter would need their meds brought to them , their pharmacy does deliver. Not life sustaining meds but I don't think their kids want to be around them when they are off their meds.I also told Hubby that I know it could get worse for us if we have no access to fresh veggies during the winter. Daddy and Mother always talked about how sick people got because of that. So that is something we would have to deal with also."},
{"title": "SIGH at home again... going back to wearing make up ", "date": "Monday, February 24, 2020", "text": "SaturdayI had to promise to not post anywhere any pictures of Son 2 before or after surgery. Except for a white pad as a mustache he didn't look any different that when he has a head cold. No bruising etc. Did very well... about 6 wks ahead of how I recovered... I didn't sleep well. Couldn't figure out why because I usually sleep very well at his house and then last night when Wilbur started snoring I realized I kept waking up and checking on Son 2 because he was NOT snoring. Which used to be a bad sign and I would get him to move. Doctor said he was maybe getting 50% of air through his nose the septum was so bad due to hand to hand combat it was broke two different directions. He said his cat wasn't smacking him either which Cuddles would do when he was asleep.AND Bailey was sleeping with him, she would leave when he started snoring.Son 2 gave us a 5 lb pork loin... I almost didn't have room for it.SO I am home... laundry on the kitchen porch line. Hubby is running errands for neighbors as E is working maple trees and has over 1000 bags/taps to deal with. I'm dragging butt.While we were talking last night I mentioned that March's pantry challenge it to eat from the freezer and asked which one he wanted us to start on. I bombed the efficient kitchen pantry challenge. I bought too much because I forgot that it was the 3rd week I would be gone not the 4th and I was battling feeling like crap the first 2 weeks.This is the one he wants to start on.yeah, right... it is the one with the chocolate chips, cool whip,nuts and cheese.SO he asked which one I wanted ...I can be a wise butt also... at least it has fruit, nuts and bacon and frozen hash browns.Be nice if these were in the same frig but nope.SundayWoke up with E knocking on the door, his dog Linda was over in the ditch barking and in pain... being Amish and Sunday he couldn't use his gun to put her down and didn't want to bash her head in with a shovel. Hubby dealt with her. She was not hit by a car, her tumor was twice the size it usually is and Hubby figures is was blocking her from using the bathroom like Rascal's would have if we hadn't had it removed. Since Linda had seen the vet and had this fatty tumor for 4 yrs... E didn't think of about it blocking her. ANYWAYS. She is over the rainbow bridge running around healthy and happy. While those in the neighborhood mourn for her.We went and saw Daddy. The man has a H..L of a grip even in sleep. He woke up enough to take my hand and then went back to sleep. My hand aches today. He did wake up again and say bye.  I really liked how things were going there. They had him out in the community room and had the fire doors shut so no one could go roaming around,that keeps him out of trouble.We went to Menards. We found we need 2 of the larger humidifiers to keep the house humidity where it should be. I now have Daddy's old one back in the hall where the bedroom, bath and laundry room is . New one (on sale) is in the front room and is a lot quieter than the old one so we don't have to blast the tv to hear over it. We also picked up 6 bottles of dishwasher soap and some cleaner for the copper kitchen sink. Both humidifiers take the same 2 filters and both use regular tap water.On the way home Hubby asked me when I was going to order my make up/skin care... My dermatologist had already been on me. I've had friends and total strangers ask if someone hit me... I have dark spots that look like bruises. I just sighed. I was taught as a child to always wash my face with Noxzema not soap and to use a face cream twice a day. Mother used Pond's. I am allergic to it. I tried Avon... nope. I finally found Olay that  was good. I did every day \"make up\" of cleaning, moisturizing, perfume, mascara and lip balm. Mascara and lip balm to shut my 4 girls and Mother up and get off my back LOL. Out for work ... it was what I called the works.... notice I said what I called the works....So Hubby said something to Son 2 and now I get a list of what I need, what to buy and the ORDER to apply it from Son 2's ex who used to sell make up and except for the eye liner and shadow never looked like she wore make up. But she did... Son 2 vouched as he watched her spend 15 mins doing her hair and make up every day before work. AND I NOW KNOW WHAT THE WORKS REALLY IS . GEEZEOkay... I can do 15 mins on hair and make up IF it helps my old dried skin and stops people from asking me if I am being abused. I also am happy this young lady knows me and listed 3 routines... yes more expensive (and not what she sells) BUT acknowledges I AM OUTSIDE,I have allergies, I have dry skin, I have dark spots and wrinkles and I am 61 and I do not want to spend much time to deal with my face and I don't want to feel as it I am wearing a mask. While at it she told me what sun screen to get and to NOT MIX MAKE UP BRANDS. It can cause allergic reactions.  She also suggested to get bins or some kind of open containers that I keep it corralled in based on when I am using it.I had switched from Olay when the price got too high for me to Neutrogena and found I liked it better also because it doesn't feel like I mudded my face.I will see how this works for me when it comes in. She told me to \"play\" make up a couple weeks to what looks I like"},
{"title": "Hubby's thoughts and death in the community", "date": "Monday, February 17, 2020", "text": "I whined about being behind due to health and what ever. Yes whined about being sick... sick and tired of being sick and tired.Thing we planned to do over the winter not getting finished ...whine whine whine. I need a glass of wine, with cheese and bread sticks... running joke with Son 2 who is our #1 whiner.Hubby listened or tuned out, can't ever tell with him 😀And then quietly said.... Have you been in the hospital?  NO                                        Are you laying in the hospital? NOthen you are doing what you set out to do ... not be in hospital for 1 yr so they will lower your biologic to once a month... nothing else is as important as that... staying out of the hospital, not having Crohn's attack which triggers hiatal hernia attack. Then he hugged me...Hubby is not affectionate.I told him I was sorry for the whine and he was right... he understood as when he was 16 and had to lay in bed 6 months due to rheumatic fever, he learned the lesson himself. He figured I needed to get the whine out before I went to stay with #1 whiner. 😛This morning he let me know that the Amish community had lost a child... really just a baby that he had taken more than once to the hospital in Columbus for testing and treatment for the seizures.  Community in mourning , funeral tomorrow.  My heart aches for them.Hubby suggested I figure out what our outdoor priorities are and what our inside priorities are so depending on the weather we can get things done for March.I am taking all the garden stuff to plan what is going where and when to Son 2's.My laptop,kindle and some reading books."},
{"title": "Feb 16th... In 2 days I will be at ", "date": "Sunday, February 16, 2020", "text": "Son 2's home... normally I call this my vacation as it's usually babysitting the cats and doing sewing or what ever I want to do that I can't get done at home...Well Son 2 promised me he would deal with his snoring... and for my birthday last month he made the appt with his doctor. I guess our 25th anniversary present is me babysitting HIM while he goes in for surgery for his septum surgery. I won't be back home until late Friday... Was suppose to be late Saturday afternoon but a friend of his doesn't have to work Friday night so they are going to stay with him Friday to Saturday so I can come home after taking him to get the stents removed. He is mean when he is in pain... SIGH.I know I won't get anything done Monday and Tuesday and will pretty crash when I get home on Friday. SO where does that land me with getting things done for Feb.First I moved finances around and we now have the 2 months of bills saved. So that's marked off.Second since I was moving finances around I moved a bit over to the medical and we are now over half way to that goal for the end of the year.Third while with our tax preparer Hubby brought up switching from his hobby to a LLC business. She worked everything both ways and he has decided to do the LLC. So he started that process.SINCE our preparer is very familiar with Social Security stuff, we asked about that. Her advice was wait until 63 and 8 months for Hubby at least as long as we can pay for our medical. Too easy for the business to go over the earnings amount in a month and mess up the social security and cause us headaches of pay back etc.Fourth. We went over the punch list. We have 2 things completed that we had only done over the entire of winter... Can tell we were worn out and I was down sick.We are going to focus on the basement ramp and kitchen porch due to losing ground there. Widening the driveway because I don't like the ruts or that Hubby drags the mud from the ruts up the driveway where we actually walk. Putting railing on the deck I decided on two designs based on what we have already on hand. The gate to the fence at the deck ramp and the fence to replace the gate is already here so that's a to do. The tower and the antenna is already here so that is a to do. Painting the ceiling of the kitchen porch and putting the 2 outside ceiling fans up there are here so that is a to do.  Getting the square foot gardens (2 ft by 8 ft by 11 inches deep) each bed size to equal 1200 sq ft total. Most of the seeds are bought and the plants ordered. I just need to deal with getting the soil in and painting, sealing and putting them together after Hubby cuts them.  Basic warmer weather than what we are getting to do stuff.I got 9 things done off the declutter 365 list so only have 5 things left for the month.I am taking my garden list, Sq Foot garden books, etc with me to Son 2's .... I have read everything else that was on my reading challenge list this month.We found we owed a bit more on the life ins loans than what we thought... more like HUBBY owed more than he told me. SO that is going to be paid on and hopefully off as I am not willing to go pay interest on a personal loan to pay them off even though it's less interest but a higher payment then the truck payment.March is going to be interesting"},
{"title": "What can I do that is frugal?", "date": "Tuesday, February 11, 2020", "text": "Besides all the regular stuff...laundry cold water, homemade laundry soap, vinegar for softener, line or rack drying.Always checking for best prices for anything we have to buy.  Any service that isn't required by warranty aka Truck and tractor is priced out.Hubby thought me spending several hours yesterday figuring out medical mileage was a waste of time since it's a deduction of 20 cents a mile. Until I showed him proof we had over 4500 miles. That is well worth the time I spent.I cleaned the frigs and made note of what produce needed used up first or froze so nothing wasted. Made a note of what I don't need to stock this spring. Pickled asparagus is a biggie need.I hung my head upside down and cut my own hair. It's past my waist so I am able to cut it in a U or V shape in that position.I topped off everything in the dry goods bookcase  and checked the pantry making note that there was a few things that was going to be on the stock up list but there is enough to wait for a sale. I am down 60 lbs of sugar and by next week will be down 60 lbs of flour and 9 lbs of almond flour. That has been since last fall and I still have 90 lbs of sugar and 140 lbs of flours not counting specialty flours like cake flour, semolina etcHubby is with friends and they did a pit stop at an Amish bulk store. He found 1 LB yeast and called to find out what was a good price. A 2 lb package is about $2 cheaper than what I find it around here. I told him to get one for M also as I know she will be happy to have it. That will bring my yeast back up to a year supply and hers up to one month supply. Woman bakes 36 loaves of bread a week not counting sweet rolls.Laundry is on the drying racks. Dishwasher is running on hi temp (only use it when cleaning it, never use the dry cycle) with a cup of vinegar in it. Clothes washer with Afresh will be done after the dishwasher is done.Hubby asked how I was feeling... Mother Nature has ran over me with a Mac truck with this weather. He asked what I would do if I was growing up, single and widowed widowed... I had to laugh because when he makes comments about me doing something he had planned to do I always respond I did it when I was growing up, single and widowed. I would probably take a nap and other than laundry and meals not worry about getting anything else done.SO I guess I won't go out in the cold drizzle to the extra lumber pile and see how many 4 x 4 x 8 posts we have so I know how many to buy for the deck railing that I have part way figured out. The rest is what to put on the top of the fencing we are using between the railings so then I will know what style of growing pots to get or make. Trying to use up what we have and save money.While talking to Son 2 last night about what we were going to eat while he is down with nose surgery and I am down there since he isn't allowed to be alone of drive for 2 days, he mentioned he had a pork tenderloin for us that he had shoved in the freezer as he got one free. I might take it out while down there (don't need meat here but will use it since he bought it) and make him pork tapas cut in very small sizes. I just need to take my spices with me.He made the comment about eating steak  or something and I cracked up ... he didn't think about not being able to breath while he chewed since he will have stints and packing in his nose for 2 days.I I thought I was going to have to stay until Sat but he has a friend that can come stay with him on Friday so it's Tuesday night (our 25th anniversary) to Friday afternoon after I drive him over to Columbus to get his stents removed. He does have a friend whose son just had this very surgery so he is getting a hold of her and seeing what he could eat.I had a friend suggest some reading material about inflammation and eating . Her hubby had bought it for her and she first thought was what a waste of money. But she said with just doing 1/4th of it has helped her. So she was now going to focus on doing 1/3rd... small steps is better than no steps and I don't see her giving up her coke a cola or coffee or butter any more than I will. The suggestion of using coconut oil in coffee instead of cream just doesn't sound good. I might try it but HUM.I finished Family Feasts for $75 a week by Mary Ostyn. I should probably look at going to the store every 2 weeks for fresh produce and not try to get it to last 3-4 wks with just a milk run at 2 wks. I need to serve soup or casseroles more to use up leftovers of 1 servings. Though Hubby can eat those from this week while I baby sit Son 2 LOL. As I have shoved 2 meals in the freezer and might put a 3rd one in if he eats dinner with his friends... if they are going to be getting in after dinner they always stop for sandwiches.What are you doing to save money ?"},
{"title": "I think Feb is going to be a no save ", "date": "Monday, February 10, 2020", "text": "Month instead of a no spend month.Hubby blew a tire on the trailer while fully loaded. When he took it in to get it replaced he was grateful he didn't ruin the rim but was told he actually needed 2 tires.Daughter 4 bought a car (paid cash, so proud) and then cleaned my car (smells great and looks better) AND filled the tank up AND gave me the money for an oil change (surprised). Our mechanic went over it completely and told me it needs brakes and rotors.. He is good about making sure our vehicles can drive out of state. He is going to check belts when I bring it in for the brakes and oil change.I thought we had filters for everything (furnace, kitchen cold air vent, 2 frigs, sweeper, whole house water) until June... NOPE, need them NOW . Now have that ordered except for furnace as we get that one cheapest at Menards on Thursday when we have tons of errands in that area.I went to change the ink in the printer and couldn't find the extra ink.... Hubby got to thinking about it when I asked if he knew were it was and then realized he had gave it to his parents last month when they were printing tax stuff and he forgot to go get some (I didn't ask why he didn't just go get some for them since he drives past the store on the way to their house instead of taking ours) ... I ordered that since I was already ordering office stuff with a discount and coupons combo.  Got free shipping and 35% of when all said and done.While checking the water filter I realized we needed salt for the softener... should have clicked when we just got propane as they have been matching all winter. Ordered that to be delivered, they will do a check to make sure everything is working as it should while here.I finally got everything around that we need for taxes...then our tax lady reminded me of medical mileage, she said usually it's not enough to add but she knew I was going a long distance for mine so told me to bring it.... over 4500 miles for last year (which was why I needed ink for the printer) when I finished that.I finished the book Daily Rituals. It included several types of artists and how they did their work or days. Was interesting as a lot of them had trouble sleeping.Compared to Jan of 2019 we reduced our electric bill by 302 KW for the month. That was nice to see.I paid the bills, got a couple due this weekend that I will pay on Friday.  I am waiting to see where the money is in all the accts after we deal with the all the bills on Thursday.We ate leftovers yesterday with some fruit. Tonight I fixed taco meat for quesadillas. I will have refried beans, guac and tomatoes along with canned mango for the fruit.Definitely on the tired side, but got enough done to feel good about what is left to do."},

{"title": "1/4th of Feb gone, goals for next week.", "date": "Friday, February 7, 2020", "text": "What do I have done?Taxes are gathered and appt is for the 13th along with our chiro appt... at which time we will also have our Valentine's Day and Anniversary (18th) meal out. I am thinking Lock 16 steak house in Lima. Bills are paid until the 10th. I am focusing on doing the finances on the 2nd of the money and then the 2nd Wed (as that is when Hubby will get his SS) and then the 3rd Wed (when I would get mine). This is the routine Hubby's parents use. I got a hold of Social Security (heavens what that a pain) and asked about the income test for those that file before full retirement age. She acknowledged it is written and is very confusing but the 45 hrs was suppose to be for professionals that work part time like doctors... and Hubby would fall under the part that is monthly earnings of NET income. She was polite enough to send it to me in writing also. Hubby doesn't have a net income with his hobby.Propane is delivered. We have enough credit to get 3 more tank fulls.... that should actually put us in to next spring.We have not saved any money on the chart :( unless you want to count the ZERO blockI ordered what we were out of on spices and condiments. I can sub on Mexican food but not Asian and we do eat it a lot.We went to store and I bought a lot of fresh produce as I am trying to work that back into my diet. I can eat 1/2 cup total a day without problems. Goals by end of March is 2 cups a day.Hubby paid for his oil change for the truck and maintenance.Daughter 4 is getting a car this weekend so I can go get mine back from her (4 hr trip to get it)... It will need an oil change (she is paying me for the oil change), and brakes. So more money not saved.Hubby was in getting a new converter (used with lawn mower battery for nebulizers for Amish as the one he had bought the fuses blew and he found he could not replace the fuses,will not buy that style again) and saw dog food was on sale for $1 off. He had a coupon for 10% off total amount. So he saved $3 on each 52 lb bag. They go through 2-3 bags a month. That should take us to end of March unless they become horses, as they already eat like piggies.For Modern Mrs Darcy challenge I have read The Year of Yes By Shonda Rhimes. The Family Garden by Melissa K. Norris, Starting over by Jackie Clay, A Day In An Amish Kitchen by Bob Ottum, and We Had Everything But Money  by Reimen Publications. I am reading Daily Rituals by Mason Currey , Original Square Foot garden by Mel Bartholomew and Family Feast for $75 a week by Mary Ostyn  right now. I float through 4-5 books a day. Read a chapter or two and then do another book. My \"sleep\" book is always a reread book which is Nora Roberts trilogy of The Sign of Seven.Grocery pantry challenge...We are eating from the pantry of course. Just adding dairy and fresh produce. I did buy some cans of fire roasted tomatoes since I didn't get any roma/paste tomatoes last year. I got 1 can per month until tomatoes should be in to make my own. I lent 1 lb of yeast to M as when E went to the bulk store they boxed the groceries up while he was loading something else and he didn't think to check the boxes and the yeast that was on the list was forgotten. I told her to just replace it when she gets hers but that should last her 2 wks according to her. E now knows to double check before leaving the bulk store. I keep 2-4 lbs of yeast in the freezer as it lasts a good year after date that way. I need to work on being more efficient in the kitchen which is the challenge for Feb.I am slowly changing from buy stuff premade like Creme Fraiche, Kimchi and sour cream, things we don't eat a lot of but use enough to make it but not to buy it and then it go to waste.I decided against winter sowing since the weather is bouncing from teens to 60s on a regular bases. I haven't planned out the spring planting yet. I do have the list for my grow cart plants to start.On Declutter 365 I have 15 left to do of 29 days. One of them is from Jan and that's the decluttering on the spice cabinet which is in the dining room. I will do that when I spring clean the kitchen in which I add the dry goods book case, china cupboard and spice cabinet.I spring cleaned my bedroom... took 3 days. Probably would have only taken two (I am showing my age by not having it done in 6 hrs) I did move some furniture around and boxes out from under the bed. The only thing under the bed now is my shoe boxes... two take up half the area under the bed. Shoes I am wearing now are in the shoe rack hanging on the back of the door and boots are behind the door or beside the bookcase. Easier to dust mop now.Goals for this weekend and next weekChange dentist appts for us to a Thursday from Tuesday as Hubby wants to make errands and such all one day a week when it is both of us so he doesn't have to check the calendar if someone calls and asks if he can help... he knows not on Thursdays.fill out Kroger survey for 50 bonus points.Scan and send verification for health insScan medical bills and send to RRA for reimbursement. We decided to use the RRA for copays,deductibles and just pay the health ins out of our pocket like it will come out of the SS when we go on medicare .finish printing stuff for taxesAppts... taxes and chiro, Valentine and anniversary dinner on Thursday, I guess we can add celebrating getting the taxes done???Start seeds in grow cart.straighten the pantry, make note of what is out/low and what needs used more.spring clean the kitchen, set up to be efficient.Design deck railing... figure out costs."},
{"title": "Wednesday ...worn out dealing with Brother and Daddy.", "date": "Wednesday, February 5, 2020", "text": "kind of....Yesterday I woke up to my brother , who is 10 yrs older than me blowing my phone up with texts (he was at work,he has retired 3 times already and is back to work) because Daddy had to be moved from the nursing home he is in because he roams. Brother darling told me he had to find a place that took non violent Alzheimer with medicaid...Okay, research mode with friends that work or did work in the nursing homes... A place for Mom web site their phone calls back to me... I found some in the area. Now it was Brother who had to call them and find and opening...MEANTIMEHubby and I go to the nursing home... BROTHER either has dementia himself (wouldn't be surprised as his wife and daughter crack jokes all the time about it) and he freaked out, not the first time as he did more than once when Mother was dying, and had a melt down. BUT they were glad we were there and caught us up to what was really going on. Daddy is roaming and going in other peoples rooms, taking crocs(he thought they were mine), and tried to crawl in a lady's bed as she was crying because he wanted to hold her why she cried BUT STILL... A couple other residents threatened him and they are being moved to a violent Alzheimer's ward. But Daddy needed a different set up that would allow him to roam (at night) and keep him and everyone else safe. They also took him off most of his meds except his insulin and he is doing better.First Hospice had found a place for him and Brother was told the day before they had found him a place 7 different times and he was being moved RIGHT THEN. Glad we went because we got to help move him, he felt better with us being with him until he settled in the new place which had a dog and was going to have singing .... waved me off and told me to go take a nap... most he has spoke in weeks.  He now has a room mate and shares a bathroom... Daddy has been a widower for 30 yrs , not sure if him sharing is going to work but the other guy plays guitar and Daddy loves music so it might be very good .. PRAYERS FOR BOTH OF THEMSecond he is NOT on Medicaid... and since my brother pays the bills he should know that???? SO now I have his wife taking him to the doctor for dementia check up.The Hospice lady told me she called Brother at work...told him it was fine, Daddy was moving to the new nursing home, I was there... he actually took a breathe and then  asked her if Hubby was there, since she didn't know Hubby she told him a man by this name is dealing with Daddy (he didn't want anyone to push his wheelchair but Hubby). She said there was a silence... and then a sigh of relief and said Ok, sis has this.  She thought it was weird for him to ask about Hubby... first my own health is worse than my older brother's and second , no matter how bad Daddy is , he won't buck Hubby. She was like... okay that make sense.The new nursing home gave us a couple tips... if we get dentures make sure they are engraved with our name (daddy's is) so if we are in the nursing home and lose them they will come back to us where a lot of them without names end up being tossed... they can't just stick them in your mouth to see if they are yours.ALSO if we buy a wheelchair to make sure we can remove the feet rests in case we are a scooter like Daddy (he uses his feet not hands to move the chair) as they can't take off the feet rest like the old nursing home did.  You can take your own cane, walker and wheelchair to the nursing home. I have a cane and a walker so I just need to start checking for used wheelchairs that feet can be removed.So since we were in town and my coupons were expiring that day, we went to the store that was close by instead of driving 40 min to the store we usually go to. I saved 25% with sales and coupons. Got everything that was on the list with a couple substitutions as I wasn't up to another stop. AND we ate AT HOME. There are no leftovers of any kind in the frig as Hubby found out today when he was home for lunch and had to eat summer sausage instead of leftovers. I think I will start going to the store when we go see parents and then to Aldi's when we have doc appts . That would make no extra trips unless for milk and Hubby can stop at Save A Lot for milk when he get fuel.Since I am now worn out to the point I don't even want to change out of the long sleeve tee shirt and sweat pants I slept in I decided pot stickers and egg rolls for dinner with fruit and pickles. I am not sure if a nap isn't on the schedule.I did call in and order propane.... we are having a fill every 7 weeks instead of the 6 weeks we did that year. So we have \"saved\" 21 days of fuel. So what we have done so far to help with the energy audit has helped already.I sat down and researched social security. Might be to worn to physically work so will do mental work.The first thing several of told me to do was ask for the estimate of what our medicare would cost and deduct that from what our lower benefit would be since we are looking at not waiting until full retirement age. and it would come out when we turned 65. Same price of what we are paying now pretty much and I matched it to be the same coverage.Second... look at earned income test that will change the amt of benefit when below the full retirement age.... We are okay there  EXCEPT there is one clause of 45 hrs worked PER MONTH... even though Hubby is doing a paying hobby ( no he is not making too much to lower his benefit) we have never tracked his hours... Which is not a problem to do.We do know rules and amounts change all the time. A paying hobby might be considered as self employed or might not be... no one could really answer this at social security without an appt so we are figuring it as the worse and is considered self employed to see where that set us.Most don't realize that social security can be taxable when added to your other income. We did because Daddy paid taxes on his and so does Hubby's parents.I figured out and our financial guy did also.... we would have enough SS to cover the medical now and when we turned 65 and the mortgage. Which is what we had always planned it to pay. Meaning Hubby's hobby which is paying his truck and that ins would be the same and the only money pulled from IRA would be utilities/ house and my car ins and things like that which cuts what we pull by half.  So Hubby it going to think about it. My SS is based on his as I couldn't come anywhere near to what he was earning while I worked odd jobs as a Widow and raised the kids. That makes our IRA last twice as long if not longer.At least that is a concern off our shoulders.I scheduled our appt with our tax preparer. She feels after this year I should be able to handle doing the form myself (I used to work for H&R Block). I am just a little iffy about the hobby work... self employed no problem , been self employed most of my life...hobby never done before.When you are making money and getting 1099s from it hobby or no, you claim it and deal with the taxes.I am tracking what we are spending money on each day to see if there are holes we can plugBlessed Be"},

I printed a one month calendar to keep track of how much we spend on what. To close the holes where $$ is going through.Paid all of Jan bills and 1st 10 days of Feb. AND still have $$ in bank.Gathered everything for taxes...waiting for the 1099s from the bank and from one of Hubby's hobby jobs.Made the menu for the month and then realized I won't be home for a week since I will be staying with Son 2 when he has surgery. SO need to put in freezer meals Hubby can warm in microwave. Which fruit we are to eat is listed every day. I will base the second part of the month which will actually only be 8 days due to me being gone, to using up what is in the house . So far that means I get milk and maybe kale or fresh salad the second part of the month.I ordered from Amazon (no where around here to get this) my special condiments and spices. I was completely out and was putting off some of the meals because of it. I kept putting the ingredients on the wish list and then ordered it today after we talked over about the menu AFTER I remembered I would be gone.Figured out when I need to start my seeds as a couple years ago I started too soon and ended up transplanting my tomato plants 3 times before it was time to put them out.Declutter 365... everything on the Jan calendar except the spice and herbs cabinet. Printed off the Feb calendar of decluttering.Modern Day Mrs. Darcy read Nora Roberts The Guardians Trilogy: Stars of Fortune,Bay of Sighs and Island of Glass.

{"title": "Planning the garden.", "date": "Friday, January 31, 2020", "text": "Step 1 .... what do we eat. Easy to figure out since I have a pantry  inventory. I also noted what we have finished eating that I do not need to replace AKA Great Northern canned beans for one.Step 2 ... how much do we eat of each thing, I based it on WHAT amounts we should be eating.Since we haven't been eating as good as we should be.Cheaper than paying medical bills and such according to our doctor.PLUS I can pretty much eat everything since starting my biologic.Step 3... What can I buy for stock up that is regularly sold from the Amish and Farmers market. I can buy acorn squash, butternut squash, spaghetti squash, pie pumpkins, jack be little pumpkins, Jade green beans, zucchini, cucumbers, fall beets and tomatoes for juice and whole tomatoes and green tomatoes for the freezer. Banana peppers, red bell peppers, sweet *white or bicolor*corn for fresh eating, and canning corn for freezer (sweet but yellow). I can get horseradish also along with onions to store, dry and pickle.Step 4 So what do we want in the pantry that isn't grown in the area or I should say sold due to they grow enough for themselves and what do we want for fresh eating during the summer.Salad... different lettuces leaf and head,spinach, kale, mustard, Swiss chard.  Carrots... short and sweet or Little finger, radishes, white, red and black for fall/early winter. Scallions. Cherry tomatoes. Goal is to have salad at least 6 months and Hubby asked for 9 months,  this year with future to work to year around. I will do repeats of plantings to keep it going through until fall. I have a shady spot that I can roll carts into to keep the heat off them. Nasturtiums also.Other with the goal to eat from the garden and not the pantry during the growing season.Will get the older stuff used up and less work canning something I don't need to can.peas...for fresh eating and freezer. This can be a spring and fall crop. We use 24 lbs of peas a year, half of it has carrots added to it.snow peas for fresh and freezer. No one grows these that we can find. Another spring and fall crop.beets for spring... beets for sale are in the late summer as everyone is eating and canning their spring beets. It's served at Church so they need more than just their family needs. They only grow red beets. I would like some for fresh eating but of different colors like spiral red and white or golden. Plus beet greensturnips more for fresh eating but willing to put some in freezer plus turnip greens.pepperoncini peppers for fresh eating and canning.cucumbers... salad, fresh eating and if I have more than that I can always pickle them. Armenian cucumber so if I don't pick it, it becomes a melon.Yellow wax beans. I used them to make my own 3 bean salad but also as a side that a different color. I will can 3 bean salad this year as a pint is enough for us instead of opening 2 separate pints of canned beans and a pint of kidney or black beans.Eggplant, fresh eating, canned as caponata or frozen breaded.Tomatoes... paste tomatoes (not much available around here) I like fire roasted, red sauce and pasta sauce, along with pizza sauce and enchilada sauce. We usually grow over 100 tomato plants. But since I can get tomatoes for juice and whole tomatoes from N I dropped that down to around 25. I am trying a couple different varieties this year that are new hybrids.Red noodle beans and purple beans for stir fries.Scarlet runner and sunset runner for the humming birds. I will keep the beans picked to keep it blooming.zucchini and crookneck... I always only get  4 to 6 off them before I kill them. Have never figured out what I do but I struggle to grow them. I bought a spiralizer so noodles also.Garlic. I didn't plant any this fall so we will be out and I will have to buy them else where or at store. I grow hardneck. Might try growing some soft neck as the one Amish said they will be small but she can get them to grow. She doesn't get enough to sell.Dried beans, black, small red, navy, lazy wife (planted with popcorn) cannelino, kidney, and pinto.Sweet potatoes. Mine didn't grow at all last year. I have my sweet potato in water that I will cut slips fromBroccoli.. last time I am trying to grow it. We use 36 lbs a year between broccoli, broccoli and cauliflower and California blend of broccoli, cauliflower and carrotsGave up cauliflower last year I will just have to buy it to can hot pickled cauliflower.Cabbage ... hard to find for sale around here because they make it into kraut. IF I grow too much I have several willing to take it off my hands.At Hubby's request Ancho chile, Guajillo chile,cayenne chile and Pasilla chile.I have 2 apple trees but they are not good producers so I can order apples from the Amish or get some from the Amish store. BUT if I pick these E our neighbor said he would take them to the cider press for us. Hubby likes apple cider.Pears... I will tell the neighbor as they also look for these and usually find someone that has extra.Peaches that is the Amish store because I want cling free.Assorted berries. I have blackberry bushes... I really hope they produce and I have blueberry bushes I hope they produce. We lost most of our rhubarb and strawberries plus all of the raspberry bushes. Grape vines didn't do well either. I didn't get anything off the grape vine when the year before I got 14 qrts of grape juice. IF I get grapes this year I would like to try to make grape butter instead of jelly.Then comes the herbs and spices. Some of these won't get planted this year. My goal is to have all of them planted by next year.I use ancho chile powder so when Hubby asked for it to be grown I was okay with it.Basil. ON average I use a gal. of dried basil, not touching what I use fresh during the season.Borage. Flowers in salad and leaves for herbscayenne about 1 qrt.chervil about  1 ptChile powder, I make my own combination of what chiles I grow. Been using cayenne and red bell pepper with store bought paprika.Crushed red pepper ...cayenne or red jalapenos (get from friend) with red bell peppersgarlic chives and regular chives tons fresh and 1/2 gal each in cabinetdried cilantro leaves... we don't use much fresh but like the flavor when I dry it about 1 pt BUT cilantro is the leaves of coriander and we like coriander seeds ground 1 ptDill weed... I use the weed and the seeds I never grow enough to use in the pickling of asparagus and pickles.garlic... fresh and powderedlavender especially with teaslemon balm ...teasmarjoram leaves and groundonion powder I grind up my own dried onions but very seldom use onion powder so it's grounded as needed I have 3 qrts of dried onions one being dried red onion.oregano ...

Hubby woke him up and Daddy told us he had threw up in the neighbor's drawers. He was really upset he had threw up (I can remember my dad ever throwing up). I asked the nurse about it. He spit up at lunch in the lunchroom. He talked more than he had since Christmas eve. Could answer questions correctly except where he threw up. He mentioned he needed changed as his diaper was wet ... so they changed his pants also as he had some spit up on them that they had missed before due to being in his crotch. I tucked him in for a nap. I got a good hug and a kiss and a I love you Sis. Good visits are becoming very rare.We stopped and visited Hubby's parents. His dad had been sick with the flu a week ago and was mostly recovered. They were staying close to home.We went to Kroger's that was around the corner from them. Had a decent selection but check out was a nightmare. They are pushing the scan and go and click list. I got mascara , granddaughter gave me money to get blue mascara for my birthday. I had a coupon so was able to black also for $1 more. Then got a $5 coupon at check out off of ANYTHING because I bought 2. I also got nail file boards. Paid out of gift $ and personal money budget.I got 3 boxes of dog biscuits. I get the small ones otherwise I break them in half. A box lasts a month usually as they only get 1 each night. ON SALEI got 2 boxes of large dog dental styx. I break these in 3rd each night. ON SALEDogs don't get tartar and Wilbur doesn't have the gum issues as much that is common with boxers. Paid out of dog budget.I got a package of 4 baking potatoes COUPON and a bag of red potatoes. Since our own potatoes went bad. I have some dried so didn't need muchI got 1 gal of milk since I still have 1/2 gal. I figured that would get me to Feb.I got 5 lb chub of hamburger to cook up for taco meat and sloppy joe meat with COUPON and ON SALE.I got 3 lbs of bacon for the price of 1 1/2 lbs with COUPON and on SALE.$33.24 out of food budget.It also made enough with the survey for Hubby to get 10 cents/gal of his fuel for the truck.We got home, I made biscuits for the sausage gravy and ran the dishwasher.THEN Daughter 4 texts she has fluid coming out of her ear and it reminds her of the liquid off raw chicken. Tell her to go to Urgent care immediately. They sent her to ER. She had cerebral fluid draining due to pressure from her sinus infection (she thought allergies) and is on meds, after they cleaned her ear they couldn't find any more leakage but told her to see her primary immediately (see her after work and yes she went to work as she doesn't have medical leave at the new job yet.) She checked in at lunch and said she was doing better and had no more leakage.THENSon 2 calls, he cut his finger while slicing potatoes and it wouldn't stop bleeding. Sent him to urgent care. He cut the pad off (will have to get new finger prints done at work after it heals) and they had to use silver nitrate to burn it shut. Can't use his finger for 10 days, can't get it wet either. He is single so dishes is an issue and he works in a office at a computer all day. He checked in at lunch and said it was throbbing but manageable and he put it in a freezer bag and sealed it to wash his dishes and shower. Like we did his leg when he had a cast up to his hip with a trash bag.THEN Hubby's parents let us know his older brother who was on vacation out of the country had flown in to NY. He was on his way to the hospital in OH due to having to have a catheter because he couldn't pee. He had prostrate problems before he left but thought he would be okay until he got home from vacation. NOPE.  They ran tests, changed the catheter and sent him at 3 am. He sees urologist at 1 pm today. I baked gingerbread cake. Frozen some of it.I baked brownie cookie (Aldi mix that comes out at Christmas). Frozen some of it.I baked cranberry orange muffins (King Arthur Flour mix) Froze some of it.I baked eggnog custard pie. Hubby ate 2/3rds of it in one day. Must have hit the spot.I am canning the last of the bean soup and freezing the last of the corn bread muffins.I am canning ham broth and freezing the little bit of ham left.I have laundry on the drying rack, dishwasher running, humidifier filled and spent an hour on the phone to get my biologic refilled in 3 month fills but was warned the computer might flip it back to monthly. My ins doesn't pay more than for 3 fills on long term meds so I will have to CALL to make sure it's done in 3 month fills not monthly each refill.WHILE waiting for the pharmacy to pick up (on hold for 20 min) I down loaded paper work for taxes for our tax lady. How has your week gone?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "take a breath... eating from pantry, what I am doing and store 1st time ", "date": "Tuesday, January 21, 2020", "text": "Sit down with your favorite beverage and just rest for a moment or so.Yesterday and today was days of rest. We really didn't do anything.Kind of a stay-cation???Jan 19thHubby had leftovers and I had popcorn. I haven't been able to eat popcorn in over a year. It was wonderful. I dropped a couple popcorn and Charlotte and Wilbur thought it was great. Rascal spit it out and looked at me like where is the butter? He definitely remembered that part. I gave them all a handful (Rascal's with butter). I noticed that Wilbur and Charlotte both sniffed Rascal's but didn't want it. Now if it had bacon grease Wilbur and Charlotte would have ate it but Rascal wouldn't.I sorted seeds and organized them by the temperature of the soil. Realized I had forgot to order crookneck squash, zucchini, yellow wax beans, turnips, a couple kales, a couple mustards and a couple nasturtiums. So I did that , between the sale, discount, coupon and rebate I saved 45%. I am definitely growing in square foot gardens and pots/grow bags but figuring that out is later this week.I dug out of the box in the east loft the cds I used to play while cleaning and driving back and forth to Georgia.I have missed my music, missed my candles and missed serving dinner on different plates. I've missed giving myself a mini spa at home. Miss walking the perimeter with the dogs. All that went away when we started working on this house March of 2019. I am working at putting it all back in.The projects we had planned for this year got shoved back due to the kitchen porch dropping 2 inches, wall starting to give on the basement ramp . Which is at the end of the kitchen porch, Hubby thinks it is a drain that broke and is washing the soil away. The lane needing to be widened due to the truck actually being wider than the lane. Hubby now has some nasty ruts beside it.I was talking to a homesteader that gave me this advice.What you plan to do in 1 yr will take 5  and the 5 yr might never happen. Just remember each small step you take is more than you had yesterday and that is all that really matters. Keeping ahead, not going backwards.Jan 20thLaundry on the drying rack and walkers I have over heat vents. My morning routine is done.I have beans with water on simmering and when that's been an hour I will drain and rinse it and then put it back on with ham broth to simmer another hour. That's how Daddy always cooked his beans and I always liked them over Mother's. She only used water and no broth. I haven't had bean soup in 3 yrs. All food restrictions are off and that is  wonderful thing. I still have some issues with eating a lot of fresh fruit and veggies but I am sure as work increasing it those issues will go away.Jan 21st  I limited myself to 1/2 cup of fried potatoes, 1 cup of bean soup and 1 tablespoon of diced onions and a corn bread muffin with a slice of gingerbread cake with 1/2 cup applesauce on top of it last night. I had 2 cranberry orange muffins and a small bar of brownie cookie for a snack.Felt proud on myself for turning off the light at 9:45 to go to sleep....my phone beeped due to my fit bit and Charlotte was up and running...then she had Rascal up also. Wilbur was to the point of growling at them because he was sleeping and they kept getting up and down off the bed. They went to the door, nope didn't want out. Went back to bed and back up and down. Finally at 12:30 I got them out and then had to go out at 1 and get Rascal to come back in as Charlotte had already been in. He laid down and went to sleep and I pinned her down in my arms until she went to sleep. GEEZE.2 AM UP and in the bathroom until 4 when I let all the dogs out and made Hubby's coffee. I would say for the 1st time of eating beans in 3 yrs... it was like eating 2 large bowls of fiber cereal and the onions gave me heart burn. BUT didn't trigger my Crohn's and I don't have any lingering affects so beans is going to be in the diet regularly... I can eat refried beans with no issues at all. I will soak my onions in ice water for now on when I am eating them and take my meds a little closer to meal time if I am having onions. If I had chewed Mento's I would have not woke up with heart burn. Just bathroom time LOL.Hubby and I are going to the store for the 1st time this month. I need milk, dog biscuits and dog dental. Wilbur has teeth issues as common for boxers but the dental seems to keeping it down quite a bit according to the vet that checks him.I am tired, but I told Hubby I want to see Daddy and his parents, go to the store and then come home for dinner. Sausage gravy and biscuits... he said something about needing biscuits and I told him he could wait the 30 min it takes me to make them from scratch and bake them... he looked like he had a duh moment.Take care , stay wellBlessed Be"},

Both of us grabbed apples and peanut butter to smear on them and was done with it.Jan 17th... ham wraps for lunch. Homemade pizza for dinnerJan 18th Chinese takeout as it is my 61st birthday but I don't want to go out due to the crappy cold wet weather so Hubby suggested he go get Chinese since I didn't want to go out and he didn't want me to cook on my birthday.I plan bean soup(first time for eating it in over a year.) tomorrow with fried potatoes and white corn bread.I am good at flying by the seat of my pants...it's not healthy for me though as it triggers the fight or flight syndrome In 2001 Daughter 4 gave me Flylady.net  web site since the last  4 kids were leaving home within a couple months and I was going to be cleaning alone and I became a flybaby. LOL I admit I have been off and on that bandwagon a lot.I sat down yesterday and started working out a routine that I can handle and get done the work I want without triggering my flight or flight... I hope .I started with my bedtime routine as I do it pretty much all the timeThen I went to the morning routine which is most the time, lunch time routine, after 3 routine then I added  a home blessing and zone work. I decided to work on the punch list when I am working in that zone.I will start this Feb 2. Seems like a good day Groundhogs day along with Imbolic and St. Bridget day.Just and FYIImbolc is traditionally the great festival and honouring of Brigid (Brighid, Bride, Brigit), so loved as a pagan Goddess that her worship was woven into the Christian church as St Bridget. She is a Goddess of healing, poetry and smithcraft. She is a Goddess of Fire, of the Sun and of the Hearth. She brings fertility to the land and its people and is closely connected to midwives and new-born babies.

{"title": "we completed one chart", "date": "Thursday, January 16, 2020", "text": "Mediumsizedfamily.com had this. It is the chart Kim at Outmywindowtoday.blogspot.com has used this chart.Hubby and I was both surprised to complete the chart before the end of the month.Most the bills are paid and the potting soil for the winter sowing was bought.Hubby figured up where he stood with his paying hobby. He broke even until we added the 2 trailers he bought. He had bought 3 but sold the one and bought a larger one. I did remind him that for a hobby it was decent for the 1st year. He did talk to another hauler that does it to make his living and he said he was just barely breaking even and was going to have to start hauling longer distances. He doesn't take out of state trips.We figured up our net worth and were okay with that. Not where we thought we would be but the stock market has been down since Hubby retired.I shared our goals for this year with our IRA guy and he reminded us that we have an account with money for 1 yrs worth of health ins with him... yes we had forgot. IT's okay we forgot Hubby had a pension on top of his 401k. YES REALLY.SO we can take the medical off the save for. Put that over on to the saving for the 3rd month of the \"bills\" and the new to us dog truck because I am not willing to add another car loan to the debt and everything I am seeing that would work is over $12000Going to call it a night.. The cold wet from today has made me achy.Blessed Be everyone"},

Hubby paid with his hobby money as an early bday present to me. And here I thought it was because I didn't have any cavities.... Pushing 61 and have never had a cavity.Jan 10th. leftover wings and hot pickled cauliflower and crackersJan 11th spaghetti, meatballs (finished bag in freezer) homemade pasta sauce, sub buns (from freezer) as garlic bread.NOTE made 6 batches of noodles, shared 2 batches with daughter 4 and dried the rest for our pantry. One batch is thin noodles to add to soups at the last minute, the other 3 for us is our sturdy , thicker wider noodle for main dish like beef and noodles over mashed potatoes.Jan 12, took stuff to daughter 4 including the 2 batches of noodles and 4 1/2 dozen eggs.  ATE the last of the spag and meatballs adding the half of the left over mushrooms and onions I cooked the other day. FOR LUNCH as we both were starving when we got home. Had summer sausage, cheese, crackers and apples for supper.Tomorrow I will have Freezer to plate meal Daughter 2 talked me into buying a while back. It's for frozen chicken so you don't have to thaw the chicken and it's rice and peas and carrots. I have a doc appt early afternoon so figured this would work plus get a box out of the cabinet.Hubby brought a ham in from the barn freezer for Tuesday's meal. I already have planned to bake some acorn squash along with it. He mentioned there was a nice size hole in the freezer. LOL"},

Once again my fight or flight has stuck in overdrive.SINCE he does NOT feel that MORE medication is the answer he  gave suggestions on how to lower it. I have had this problem more than so some it is just going back to an old routine. Like no tv,computer, phone an hour before bed so I  am back to reading for an hour before bed. AND that triggers me to go to sleep. I keep water cup that has a lid and straw by the bed instead of the coke... Yeah I know but I am down to less than 2 20 oz bottles of coke or sprite... I try to do one of both otherwise I am definitely a coke a cola classic gal.I've went from sleeping maybe 4 hrs to sleeping 11 every other day. Doc said to average it out and see what I am averaging. As of today I am averaging around 7, he wants me at 9... so at least it's getting better. Even though I feel like a walking zombie.The fatigue is as haunting as the feeling of needing to push through is. Neither are good.Hubby is making my daily to do list and it in my view is next to nothing but he knows how this goes since it's not the first rodeo for us.I did put hamburger for Salisbury steak and country fried steak in the freezer from the hamburger log I bought. We had cheeseburgers for dinner. I also cooked the rest of it and got 5-1 cup bags of meat for the freezer for either taco pizza, sloppy joes or hamburger pie or just some quick casserole.I made laundry soap for both us and Daughter 4.I've hung laundry out on porch line and drying rack daily.While seeing Daddy we went over and visited with Hubby's parents as they are only a few miles apart.Went to get dental check up( we scheduled together to lower fuel costs) stopped and got car tags, then went to bank , then to the post office then to Menards to use rebate to get distilled water for the humidifier in the bedroom.Averaged out what the electric bill ran 2019. We lowered it by the average of $14.50 a month even with the increase per kilowatt.Ordered seeds/plants for the garden this year using rakuten,codes and coupons. We are raising mostly fresh or what we can't find at the Amish farms. We really missed eggplant and Roma tomatoes. I will raise plants from the seeds I already have. We use chiles that are not grown in this area.Meantime I need to walk some to not stiffen up.Blessed Be"},

We now turn the furnace down 2 degrees when going to bed.We went back over the budget to see if we could find any other place to cut back or cut out completely. We have $500 in medical going out above the cost of our health ins this month. Also I have truck and car tags to get. I washed clothes in cold water using homemade laundry soap and hung either on drying rack or porch clothes line.All Christmas lights was turned off Dec 31 at 11 pm. That is the day when our electric bill is read at 11:59 pm by computer. So the holiday lights are only on 1 bill instead of 3 like last year.We changed 3 nightlights...still LED but light up the rooms better with 1 bulb instead of a dozen.Hubby installed more air barrier. Still more to go. But we can really tell the difference in the house.We ate from the pantry and didn't order anything on line or go shopping.We spent time just resting over the holidays and talking about goals and plans and taking care of our health.We wrote out what our 2020 goals were and I posted them on the wall at the calendar so we would see them daily.We batted around thoughts on how to have fresh produce, produce for stocking and the costs of it all. We both understand we need some garden and Hubby now acknowledges he didn't think it would be that much work by putting it in ground where I wanted to stay with square foot gardening for the majority of it.We also know we have to find a better place to store potatoes and winter squash as the area we used is still too warm (thanks to warmer winter) and we are starting to lose it 3 months before usually. I Will be canning a lot this week.I washed out 3 plastic bags and the insert to a box of cold cereal that we bought at the discount store for 99 cents.How did your first week of the new year go?Blessed BeWeek 2 of eating from the pantry.

Grass is brown and not covered as the last few days have been warm and we've had rain.  I have 2 towels still out of the porch line, the drying rack is full, both sock racks are full of kitchen hot pads and towels, and 2 walkers are over vents holding aprons and towels to dry. BUT except for the Christmas tree skirt the Christmas stuff is washed. When it is dry I will box it up. Monday I will run the vacuum and get all the throw rugs done and boxed up also. That will be the last of Christmas.I flipped out the thick bath towels for the thinner ones for winter. Since we seem to have damp weather where I can't hang clothes on the line weekly the thick ones dry too slow on the drying rack.This week I am going to be canning winter squash. The basement is staying too warm and we will be losing it if I don't get it done as I found one today that was bad. I still have 3 spag sq... or 4 I can't remember that we will need to get in the frig and eat them as they can't be canned.My 5 gallon bucket that holds homemade noodles is empty so I need to get noodles made. By making them now I can make a quick meal later of them.I have some veggies getting old so I need to make some veggie stock so they don't go to waste.I have hamburger to make Salisbury steak, country fried steak, taco meat and sloppy joe. I might cook some plain to help with making casseroles.I have to make some sour dough starter. I need sour dough bread for garlic soup and I need bread dough for pigs in the blanket. Might as well make that with the sour dough also.I need to cook some bulk sausage for pizza, calzones and casseroles.Finances are caught up until the 8th.We started following the money chart from Mediumsizedfamily.com  http://outmywindowtoday.blogspot.com/ also uses this chart. It helped her get her house paid off so I am hoping we can use it to pay for the newer to us truck when we find one.I will also can the leftover  of Sara Moulton white chicken chili (I used turkey and great northern beans). Won't be a biggie since I will be canning squash also.This week I will also move the chair( and clean it) I always sat in at Daddy's into the front room where the Christmas tree was. He had bought a chair for me so I could touch the floor when I sat to visit with him. My brother made sure I got it  when we cleared the house. I will have figure out a different place for the Christmas tree next year. I have Mother's in my bedroom as she was a good 2-3 inches shorter than me.We are doing well on the pantry challenge as we are in our second week. We are also focusing on eating at least 80% real food aka from scratch.Doing well in the no spend and looking forward to marking off squares on the money chart.I am also trying to do stretches on my yoga mat every day this month. That is on top of my daily 10,000 steps and 4 trips on the staircases since I decided to not spend the money on an elliptical or gym membership.I also am doing a reading challenge from https://modernmrsdarcy.com/This month I am reading the trilogy of The One from Nora Roberts.Hubby bought the last book for me for Christmas.I will also read Starting Over by Jackie Clay *Backwoods Home magazine*I am also checking my seeds and deciding what to plant for fresh eating. We really missed having eggplant and fresh salads. I will be buying my \"stock up\" goods from the Amish and the auction.Best get doing the evening routine."},

I could get her to laugh when in a mad rant by asking who urinated her off.Nov 16, 2009 she sat beside me in a coffee house in Springfield OH to help me write the first blog here.

About 6 of them I have everything except cilantro, lime and avocado (and not it'a not all Mexican). Only 3 did I need meat and that is because I do not keep ground pork and ground poultry in the freezers, they are very seldom on sale so I don't stock up.

He nearly broke my hand with his grip when he decided he had to hold my hand while he walked his wheelchair.  Was a good day as he said as we were leaving.We stopped in a visited for several hours Hubby's parents , not only for Christmas but it was their 63rd anniversary. They are having several family in on Christmas and invited us. Hubby is not sure he wants to go since she is talking about over 50 in a very small house with 1 bathroom. He is not treated right by his two brothers. His sister does try even though there are several years between them. I told him we could go visit his siblings in Jan if he would rather do that but should at least call his parents and wish them Merry Christmas.Son 2 cooked us Christmas meal last night as our schedules are not mashing at all this holiday. Was a wonderful meal of pot roast he did in the crock pot and baked onions from the oven (he got a smaller crock pot for himself and forgot that when he went to cook everything). I got him an instant pot as he had melted his when he forgot his glass stove top was still hot and put it on the stove. I also got him all the little extras that he could use in it. Came out the same amount of money as we gave the rest and since he is single it was the only gifts he had under his tree. He left a couple of the smaller ones under it for Christmas day.Tonight, Christmas eve, Son 1 will be here (he usually refuses to get his picture taken) and I will have prime rib (using crock pot, new recipe, will let you know how that goes) sauteed onions and mushrooms, leftover carrots from Son 2 meal, baked potato (actually baked as the oven will be on anyways) and homemade bread rolls , which is why the oven will be on.  Shrimp cocktail and salad .We have fruit cake for dessert but I doubt if anyone will want any of it.Tomorrow we will go back in to see Daddy again.Hubby worked this morning as he didn't get the job done last night since we needed to be at Son 2.

{"title": "Talking about 2020", "date": "Saturday, December 21, 2019", "text": "Yesterday was a good day as we are trying to be on the same page of next month being a NO spend with NO exceptions month and eat from the pantry * 80 % real food minimum. We were eating dinner of prime rib scrap I pulled from the fat I cooked, mixed with cooked onions and mushrooms and on sub buns from the freezer with odd and ends shredded cheeses. We talked about our 2020 goalsBoth us working on the projects we have chosen from the punch list.Both agreed we needed better routines of meal times and eating healthier ( Pantry challenge GOOD CHEAP EATS, real food reboot DON't WASTE THE CRUMBS)Hubby want to lose 24 lbs this coming year.Hubby is going to also focus on that his HOBBY does not need to over run him to the point he does not get his work at home done. Something I have heard E and his family bring up to him several times. They all understand he has work here that needs done and he just needs to say NO I CAN'T like they do.I have chosen because I MUST focus on my health. I need to continue add foods back into my diet SLOWLY. I need to rebuild bone density through what I eat, exercise and yoga (new mat ordered as old mat worn out and slides). Hubby considers the mat as medical. I need to get back to the sinus rinse to lower issues with my allergies.  I will need a routine of exercising.I need to finish designing the railing for deck to have herbs grow there. Wilbur pees on pots or will back up to do business in them SIGH. I need to finish working out the new garden plan which is closer to what I was doing on the old farm.I need to do Swagbucks regularly to help pay for my Amazon Prime (is has saved us more than I pay for prime)I need POST the laundry routine because I am tired of repeating it to Hubby. I will put it in his bathroom on the wall above his laundry cart.I need to get a sewing/mending routine. I had mending routine until we moved my chair out of the front room and upstairs. I am going to take Mother's chair out of the bedroom and put it in front room where the Christmas tree is and set up a mending area there. I need to declutter the east loft to set up the sewing room. I can put the chair I always sat in at Daddy's in the bedroom.I need a home blessing routine along with a decluttering routine ( DECLUTTER 365) I need to get out of my comfort zone and expand what I read (READING CHALLENGE)Hubby brought up the budget for 2020 (yes I rolled my eyes but kept my mouth shut, easy to do when you are stuffing your face).I had suggested we turn down the furnace when we leave for longer than an hour more than once. He agreed to that finally.  He is gotten a lot better of turning off lights and unplugging the LED strand of lights over the kitchen sink that we use for a night light to see the door (and black dog) in the middle of the night in the mornings.He finally quit opening the curtains at 5 am when he opened on in the front room on the north side and felt the cold coming through. I have insulated curtains up but still these old windows can only do so much. He does open the one dining room curtain so he can see the sun rise. I close the curtains around 4:45 just before dusk. We talked about making appts so we don't miss a meal and to eat before we leave for an afternoon appt so we aren't coming out hungry and 90 min from home. Next month he has 2 and I have 3 appts at times so there is not excuse to eat out or pick up pizza at the gas station.He DECIDED we needed to set the grocery list.I agreed because I already have a basic list I use but wondered where he was going with this. Then he DECIDED we would only go every 2 wks, which means some of the fresh produce he PREFERS won't be here at the end of the 2nd week.He did acknowledge my GI wants me to eat a small amount  of fresh produce daily to get my digestive system used to it again. In Jan it will be to add more beans which will put my back on my diet I was on during remission years ago.I danced in the office.I just kept letting him talk...Then it was if I could make it at home, we were not to buy it...I opened my mouth ( with no food in it HA HA) I am NOT making cottage cheese, and any other cheese. I have done both.I will make tortilla wraps (his go to for sandwiches) , bagels, (his) English muffins(both) rolls, loaf bread , yogurt, buttermilk (I have learned to let the powder sit for 30 min to over night when made to get it more like regular buttermilk) etc. I have enough pasta but can make noodles, ravioli,and lasagna noodle. I cook from scratch most the time anyways. Except brownie and cake mixes.  I will make granola bars at which he frowned because he likes store bought better because they are not sticky and travel nicer in a hot truck which made him realize he was eating several of them along with his lunch... which explains why he gained weight when he should have lost.I have not made potato chips or tortilla chips but can. We decided to quit the potato chips and only have tortilla chips as we eat salsa and cheese dip with those.He brought up sour cream. I have had iffy tries on that as the heavy cream is ultra pasteurized. We don't use it a lot so when needed we could buy it.I have used plain yogurt instead.Since he said twice a month I decided to split what produce was being bought at a time.What will be bought both times to the storemilk 2 gallons each timehalf and half .I have made my own but ended up spending more on milk and heavy cream than I did on the half and half ... 1/2 gallon each timeheavy cream 1/2 gallon each timecottage cheese. 3 each time5 bananas each time2 lbs white mushrooms each time2 lbs portabella mushrooms each timeONCE a month2 bunches of green onions2 packages of tri color bell peppers (I can't eat green)1 head of cauliflower or 2 bags of pearl cauliflower3 heads of broccoli4 lbs of carrots 2 bunches of celery3 lbs of apples (instead of 6 lbs)We will see how this goes along with the pantry challengeI did ask his sister for her recipe for canning meatloaf and her recipe. Her boys use it for sandwiches on a regular bases."},
{"title": "The week before Christmas", "date": "Thursday, December 19, 2019", "text": "I sit here with some \"down\" time waiting on the canner. Last quart of turkey broth and 3 quarts of beef broth in it. I got 12 cubes (used old ice cube trays) of beef fat for the freezer. I have 2 more things to do today of my get 8 done list.Decorations are up. I will be adding a little to next year's if I have the money and it's on sale cheap. OR I find it in mother's stuff in the barn. I have 2 windows, both bathrooms, kitchen porch (non-chewable by Charlotte) and the deck that I would like stuff for...not sure what stuff but stuff.I wrapped Son 2's gifts. Son 1 (single, never married, no kids)gets cash as he uses it to pay for his vacation in Jan. The girls all get cash as they all have kids (one has grandson) and they use theirs for eating out. It's not how we would like it but since it's their present (I give what we would spend) I give them what they want. I do miss buying presents and doing gag gifts. But Son 2 (single, never married, no kids) is okay with gifts or cash. I usually get him something small and cash.... but this year he has mentioned a couple things he wanted and was having to chose between because he had to replace his furnace and AC. He told me what he had chosen and why and that he was going to buy it AFTER Christmas. So I got the other for him. He will think it's funny as I reused the wrapping paper that was on our presents from him last year (that he reused from his grandmother) and wrapped the one present with freezer paper. I wasn't going out to buy Christmas paper for 1 present.  I ordered the last 2 gifts. Roses for Daddy(it's his favorite flower) and a Christmas wicker basket flower arrangement for Hubby's parents that they can sit on the table or the end stand in the front room.  Hubby and I don't \"do\" Christmas for each other...he does not like to buy gifts but I did wrap some different variety trail mixes I bought him from Aldi's since that is now on the do not buy list for next year.Dogs got new chew bones.I will do some baking this weekend and do the Christmas cards(one of the 8 to do list for today).Christmas eve is shrimp with cocktail sauce, prime rib roast and baked potato. Hubby would like a salad that we will have to buy. I have a Christmas pudding for dessert and Fruit cake for dessert. Son 1 will be here for Christmas eve. Not sure when we will connect with Son 2 as he is already over booked between two jobs and two groups he belongs to. I know the Sunday before Christmas he will be giving gifts out at the VA Hospital . The girls are booked solid between work and kids and their other sides. I still get thank you's for us canceling Christmas get togethers about 10 yrs ago. SO much stress on the girls. We try to do a couple get togethers in \"off\" times. Like during the summer (not July 4th any more) and in Sept for the family reunion. I am thankful for Facebook so we can stay in each other's life by long distance. I am thankful my parents and in laws didn't make us chose either.Especially when you are already part of a blended family and then belong to another blended family.Other than a good cleaning on Monday and Tuesday morning, that's it for Christmas.I still have garlic and onions to preserve but they can wait until after the holiday."},
{"title": "not even a week... pantry update.", "date": "Wednesday, December 18, 2019", "text": "I sent Hubby down to get a pound of the unsalted butter and he came back up with his Hard cider (forgot the butter)and asked where I put the food from the black refrigerator ....we ate it or I took it to the Christmas party and I froze the prime rib. The eggs were behind the prime rib roast.Now it looks like thisThe citrus is now in the bottom drawer.  The veggies have been ate, what cheese was left after the Christmas party is now in the other refrigerator drawer combining all the cheese. The brown sacks are mushrooms, they last longer in a paper bag. These didn't have a chance as four of the bags went in the cauliflower stuffing(dressing),half on the 5th one went in a casserole. What is left is in the hole that was in the kitchen refrigerator.I will be going without fresh mushrooms until Jan. The prime rib roast is now 3 smaller roasts, 4 steaks and 4 meals of shaved rib roast for philly steak pizza, philly steak subs and two stir fries and in the barn freezer.That is beef scraps and broth on the top shelf from me dealing with the prime rib. That's on the to do list for tomorrow so by tomorrow that shelf will also be empty.I had a good hole in the barn freezer but since we brought home a ham bone with enough meat to make to good meals and the broth and put the prime rib in it.  My hole is small again. I could get about 6 lbs of meat in it.Normally I would be looking to fill in the empty spots in this frig but I know this coming week there will be lots of cooking so I will need places to put the leftovers.  Also I want to get the gray refrigerator down so I can transfer most of the stuff to the black on as the gray one is the one that has issues with freezing up and shutting down about once a year.I have realized I under estimated how much dishwasher soap and dish soap I would need since I am cooking from the pantry. Two to three times with the dishwasher and at least one load of the big pans in the mudroom sink.It has one huge bowl so it's easier to wash big stuff in it.Time to fix supper.. leftovers tonightto include 15 months of medical instead of 12AND2 months of monthly billsANDa new to us \"dog\" truck.  I am willing to sell or trade my car for the truck as the car is definitely too small to transport my 3 dogs. ALSO it would take a car off the car ins.ANDhe decide to not file for Social Security this year.I told him that a couple of the chosen projects might not get done but he needs to price out the ones he has chosen for himself.The big question was is there going to be battles when I mention he is wanting to buy it's not in the budget? OR that he hasn't done something and it's costing us money? His answer... Probably.I am okay with these changes. I really struggle to see us saving all of that and replacing the truck but if you don't plan it don't happen."},

Hubby turns 62 this year. Thoughts of living on only social security *which is really only meant to replace 40% of your income during retirement* is what we looked at.Five times in 2019 I have changed the budget1/1/2019 $87948/1/2019 $61239/12/2019 $588312/1/19 $ 5062.50I went on social security and pulled what Hubby would get at 62 and then at the beginning of next year myself . Living on the budget I set for this coming year. We would be short the medical and would have to pull that amount from the IRAs' and that is a lot less than what we are pulling now and would make it last 3 times as long as now. Hubby would like to have his truck paid off or at least half off before pulling SS.I don't see that happening  along with the projects.It also lets me know how much must be in the savings to cover us between him starting SS and me starting SS. That really is not a bad scenario since we don't count on his hobby to pay anything He has declined several jobs as he doesn't want a business, doesn't want the headache of paper work even though he has to keep track of some of it for a hobby, just something to have purpose in his days. He enjoys the travel but limits that as he wants to be home to sleep in his own bed.I think the no spend month with written down exceptions is going to continue in to 2020 but with the line of do you want to draw SS or keep drawing the IRA  ? to push us to be more conscious of our choices.Dec 8thThe day of rest was spent at home doing bedding and hanging outside on the porch clothesline to dry. Probably won't see another day good enough to do that that doesn't freeze dry the clothes. Ate leftovers from the frig as we also moved the the black frig down to the basement FINALLY and put the Christmas tree where the frig had been.Dec 9thDid laundry and got it on the drying rack before leaving for appt and errands. Made a note of what we were having for supper so if Hubby got home before me he could start it.I had follow up appt with my GI  that is 2 hrs away. Got that done, pit stopped at Son 2's house,the stopped at store for the non food items needed  and the last of the unsalted butter. I had some odds and ends in the frig so used them to make a casserole for supper.Hubby went over to deliver a message to E and he asked if we could get them dried milk as they use it in their summer sausage that them were going to make the next night.Dec 10th.I did laundry and hung on drying rack before leaving.Primary doc appt for both of us. Good news is my blood work was great. Even my calcium and Vit D was were great which made doc decide the loss of bone density had to come from the steroids I was on the last 2 yrs. Diet is changed along with having to add more walking. I average 3 miles a day, looking to increase to 5. Hubby and I already had priced out local gyms/YMCA's since we don't qualify for silver sneakers yet. Decided to set up a \"gym\" in the basement. I have an area that I can clear (was going to get rid of most of it and no that wasn't in the pantry pics) for Daddy's exercise bike and the elliptical we will buy in Jan. I picked out 2 on Amazon as everything around here is running over $800.I need to do yoga also... going to ask Son 2 where he got his mat as it is nice and long.Went to chiropractor and was adjusted. The pain I was getting in my left side of chest was actually from my right shoulder being out of place. Since Doc had just ruled out it coming from my heart it was kind of like \"What now\" feeling. Glad to find out it was my shoulder that I had operated on a few years back.We ate out between doctor appts. Hubby paid for it using his spending money ($50 for each of us.) We got the senior citizen discount and left a 20% tip and still was under $25. We brought home leftovers for our supper that I could add veggies and fruit to.Stopped at store to get dried milk for E. Got dried milk for us, not sure how I missed we were completely out. Got the last of the stuff for Christmas dinner this weekend and a few of the veggies that doc wants me to eat (broccoli and cauliflower that I do not have in the freezers as they didn't grow this year). We won't be having fresh salad for Christmas dinner. Too many recalls.We stopped to pick up the 4-5 bone in prime rib I ordered and paid for.That is our standard Christmas eve dinner (Son 1 is coming this year). Hubby came out and put a huge roast in the truck. Before I could say any thing he said. \"The order got messed up and it came in boneless. They gave us $3 off a pound so I decided to take a whole boneless prime rib roast since the price was the same. You can do 2 roasts, some rib eye steaks and shave some for philly steak pizza and philly steak subs.\"  Personally I would have taken the money but that actually comes out to paying $3/ lb for the meat. We finished our leftovers from lunch for supperDec 11thI did laundry and since there was a good breeze I hung the clothes on the porch line to freeze dry. I brought them in when it started to snow and hung them on the drying rack to finish.We had French toast (using up the last of loaf of bread that had been in frig for awhile and a good dozen of eggs) ham slice and hash brown patties. We used blueberry pie filling for the French toast and had 8 oz of V8 fusion (1 serving  each of fruit and veggies). We will eat the rest of the French toast for bfasts the rest of this week.It was nice to have the day at home so I could straighten the pantry (and take pics and post on blog). Check recipes of what I want to make for the dinner party on Saturday and do a bit of decorating. I pulled the meat off the two turkeys I had roasted and put 1 lb in each bag. Have 8 more lbs of turkey meat in freezer. I put the carcasses to simmer to make broth.Dec 12thlaundry is on the drying rack.We got the lights on the outside Christmas tree.I have the fat off the first batch of broth. There is 5 qrts in the canner.I got 4 swags put together for the fence line by the front porch.Dish washer is running with stuff that was from straining the broth.Carcass meat will be next after it is done as it has the pitchers that I strain broth into to refrigerate over night to get the fat to raise. I got 4 more lbs of meat for the freezer. Broth is is pitchers in the frig.Dinner was leftoversDec 13thI baked a pandoro cake ...it's a yeast cake for the dinner we are going to tomorrow. I also put together a bean party snack (not hummus) but will have to stop and get tortilla scoops for it ( I am using my spending money).I did not do laundry as I was running the dishwasher 3 times today and too much water going into the septic line at the same time can cause issues.Dinner was potato soup as I had 4 potatoes in the frig that I had brought home from Son 2's house that he had bought and had not ate...that was Aug. The potatoes was still good and made enough soup for our dinner.Dec 14thHubby unloaded the dishwasher and put what wasn't dry on the drying mat before leaving for a last minute hauling job.I started finishing the decorations. Keep taking breaks at the weather system has triggered my fibro and arthritis. I still have to decorate the cake and cook the cauliflower stuffing (actually it's a dressing as you do NOT put it in a bird) and get dressed for the holiday meal ..stop and get tortilla scoops (reminder to myself).Half the laundry is washed and the drying rack is full. I will put the rest in later and set the delay start to start tonight so when we head home the washer should kick on so I can hang that laundry when I get home after the Christmas dinner tonight.Enough of the clothes on rack was dry so I finished the laundry and got it hanging to dry.Finished the cake and the dressing. Hubby got boxes to transport everything and we are both thankful he is no longer deep frying turkeys for this dinner.We will check out Christmas lights on the way to the dinner and then take a different route home to see more lights.Have bad weather coming in late tomorrow which means I will be in pain in the morning, need to remember to take something before bed to help head that off."},

{"title": "Dec 1st of pantry challenge no spending.", "date": "Monday, December 9, 2019", "text": "We have 10 items on the exception list for buying this month . One is getting bumped to Jan, 7 are for Christmas, 1 is distilled water for the humidifier in the bedroom and the last is butter for stocking with the price at $1.99. I might pay a bit more but not much.This morning we talked over the dinner menu as 2 days will be crammed and the 3rd day Hubby might be out of state with a friend. When the day is crammed is a day we usually eat out.So this week...Sunday left over pizza from last night ( Advent)Monday Soup of choice. He will probably do chili and I will do tomato.(crammed day)Tuesday Corned beef hash and eggs.(crammed day)Wednesday Butternut sq, black bean, cauliflower crust pizza (using left over sq from last week)Thursday stuffed shell or manicotti pastaFriday oven meal of some kind (Hubby may be gone at which I will probably do something from the freezers that is a leftover) (St Nick's day)Saturday roast with root veggies.Sunday (Advent) Leftovers.We went over the basic grocery list. MY goal is every two weeks. Hubby thinks every 10 days.Milk ( including to make yogurt so yogurt got taken off)heavy creamhalf and half ( I have dried buttermilk so that got taken off )cottage cheese (requirement of diet put on by doc)fresh mushrooms ( canned is high in sodium , I have heart failure), higher is sugar and lower in protein PLUS fresh white mushrooms are the only veggie with VIT D.colored bell peppers (I can't eat green)celerycarrotsonions ( am to eat daily)sweet potatoes (I have plenty of dried , canned and other white potatoes.)ONE TIME A MONTHice cream (Hubby)3- 6 pk of coke.(me) I get 1/2 bottle a day. Yes I drink room temp flat pop.2- packages of thick sliced baconOther note is I can find tons of info on filling your pantry and how to store it. I can also find some about what winter sq to eat first (spag sq , acorn, followed by butternut and pumpkin) but finding style of menu or how to get it all ate even as a homestead was next to nothing. Then I found one that actually made sense. EVERY MEAL....one from the garden (fruit/veggie) one from the barn (eggs, dairy, meat) and one from the kitchen (food from scratch with grains).Dec 2nd, we got part of the exception list. I did not get butter today. Aldi's was out. I will check tomorrow at two other Aldi's that are in that area.  Hubby paid for a cheap lunch for the two of us since my appt ran late so we missed getting home for lunch. Not good as we were already having errands after the appt. He usually has granola bars in the truck but he took them out since the truck goes in for maintenance tomorrow. Came in under what we had budgeted for what we bought. Hope to finish it tomorrow when we take truck in for maintenance, get blood work done and take the dogs to vets. If not I will end up finishing it by myself later.Hubby said something about getting groceries. No need except for French vanilla ice cream for hot buttered rum. It can wait until I need milk also.This week in honor of Advent we gave E & M 2 gamma lids for their food buckets. The smiles on their faces when they realized what they were was priceless. Both have asked about the costs in the past but with finishing paying off the hospital bills for Baby A, E needing surgery for a hernia in Jan and building a bigger calf barn this summer ... the money was not there on top on the gardens doing poorly and his corn for his animals getting ate by the deer and coons.Dec 3rd  Hubby rechecked the grocery list we wrote. Bananas was not on it. I am suppose to be eating bananas on a regular bases so they went on the list. Since we dropped his truck off for maintenance on the way to blood work and then to vet (Wilbur and Charlotte shots and Rascal's tumor check , his surgery is the 17th and he will go in the night before since he can't even have water through the night and we are not removing water from the other two. All 3 got nails clipped. Getting nails clipped at $10 per dog removes the $25 per dog office visit so basically we save $45 by getting the nails clipped)...we picked the truck up after we were done at the vet's and stopped at 2 Aldi's in that area...they had called around and at this point everyone is waiting on delivery of unsalted butter. BUT I did get bananas and blueberry goat cheese to replace the cottage cheese. I am a bit tired of cottage cheese. I found a couple recipes for leftover rice I would like to try.I like rice pudding but Hubby doesn't. We had odds and ends left in the frig so we ate those for lunch and supper. There still is grilled butternut left and a baked sweet potato. I will put the butternut on pizza (project fire tv show recipe) and make twice baked sweet potato for another meal.Dec 4th.HUMMM I think Hubby is going to be very tired of me saying we are doing a no spend month when he mentions buying something. I had looked up a couple recipes we would like to try, you have to order the cook book ...I think that is fair for the chef as he does put other recipes on the internet for free. Hubby asked how much the book was. I did not check because we are in a no spend month. He wanted to know how much so I told him to look it up himself but see if a kindle version is offered as it is usually cheaper. I found a bag of O'Brien potatoes in the freezer so I cooked them and added eggs to make a frittia. Hubby calls it big egg. A friend calls it lazy omelet. It went will with of the rolls I had baked and the cookies M had sent over tonight with green and red sprinkles.The butternut and sweet potato went in the freezer.I said something to Hubby about focusing on clearing at least one freezer so when I had something that needed to be frozen I had room. He was agreeable and immediately mentioned there was breaded chicken and sweet potato French fries a couple bags of frozen mixed fruit and meatballs in the one freezer. Sounded like a hint to me.I did the finances and realized we had came in UNDER budget last month even though my credit card was higher than normal.I called my GI about needing my biologic prescription refilled ( I have enough to go a couple months since I as sick)and that my insurance will probably request preauthorization again. I will see him next week to talk about whether I should stay at the same dosage or change. Hubby called the one utility about an over charge and got that corrected. I am glad I caught  it before the automatic payment went out.I decorated the laundry room, hall, both bathrooms, and bedroom for Christmas. I found the Christmas cards so I can get those done.  I still have to clean the basement to move the black frig down so we can put the tree in the front room. That is the job for tomorrow as Sunday is suppose to be decent and dry and that will be good for moving it. I still have to decorate the mudroom, front room, dining room, and kitchen. I would like something for the kitchen porch and the deck. I need to finish the swags for the fence line at the driveway from the branches Hubby cut off the Christmas trees. I found the wire for that today. Hubby said he was putting the lights on the outside tree on Sunday.Guess that is fair as I do the inside tree.Dec 5thBfast was the left over egg/potatoes and lunch was cheese crackers and apples.I cleaned part of the basement for the frig to go down. Found 5 packages of paper plates. Some will go to the reunion as we are the ones that provide the paper goods for the family reunion in Sept. I definitely do NOT need more. I also found paper napkins I never buy as we use cloth. Must have been in a box that came from Mother as she was the only I know of that bought paper napkins. Hubby found a very small salt and pepper shaker ... yep stuff from Mother. I was looking for a salt shaker so I wouldn't have to buy a sea salt grinder as I found fine ground sea salt at the discount store  last month.When carrying out a cabinet that was falling apart and taking up the outside ramp from the basement, I caught the top of the cabinet on the roof (very low roof) and bashed my mouth and gave myself whip lash. I am thankful I did not break my front teeth or make them loose. I iced it so not to get a fat lip and to help with the bleeding. Went from having a sinus headache to a migraine within minutes. Still thankful that is all I got. Hubby did go down and carry out the last part of the cabinet.We had freezer meal... it wasn't sweet potatoes but home fries, bread shrimp and breaded chicken strips. I used the air fryer for all of it since there was not much of any of it. Added green beans ,yogurt with the last of some cherry pie filling and a topping of grape nuts on it. Hubby is going out of state for the day with a friend so I am on my own for meals tomorrow.Dec 6thSt Nick's day.Hubby left at 4 am to go out of state with a friend. They are going to go visit another friend in Illinois and do a drop off for one person and a pick up for another. I think half the conversations in this area are started with \"I am going to ... do you need anything? That is actually a benefit as those that need something, share the cost of the trip. I grew up in a community that was the same. So to me this feels more like home. I realized this week the Hubby has finally adjusted to it. He was some where to get a tool for his truck replaced (out of his hobby money) and saw a set of tools E had been looking for under E's price point of $600. Not only below the price E was willing to pay it had a couple tools in the kit that E had mentioned he would like down the line but couldn't afford right now. The set was worth over $1000 but on sale for $200. A new style is coming out in Jan.Hubby put in on his credit card and brought it home. He took it over to E and A business yesterday afternoon,E's dad was there also. They were so excited and thankful.Hubby told them he put it on his credit card and the payment wouldn't be due until next month so they had time to pay it back. When E got done with chores last night he brought the money over. He told Hubby all three of them cried after he left because it was going to cut their time with labor in half and for an ENGLISHER to be so thoughtful of them was just something that did not happen much if at all. We do see that often Englishers try to take advantage of them.Today's meals are oatmeal for bfast, leftover steak fries and leftover breaded chicken strips for lunch, ramen noodles with mushrooms and garlic for dinner since I am on my own. Hubby had banana and granola bars for bfast before he left. His friend brought homemade cookies for a morning snack. They will stop for lunch and dinner. Hubby said if he was hungry when he got home he could have summer sausage,cheese and crackers.Dec 7ththe menu for this week was a bust. Hubby has only been home at meal times a couple days. Today was another time, he had to leave early because he brought back a saw for the saw mill (cuts logs into lumber) since it was dark when he got home he didn't drop it off. SO off he went , got that done, did the hauling he was scheduled to haul and was home by noon. He was given lunch since they thought he would be late. I had eggs. Within an hour our friends were calling as they needed help patrolling the Christmas parade where we used to live. Hubby went but I stayed home. I already am achy and do not want to walk 3 mile in the dark cold weather. I had a bowl of cold cereal for dinner. Finished up that box. Hubby is moving the refrigerator from the front room (finally) to the basement tomorrow so I moved all the butter I have bought so far to the barn deep freezer and some of the things I use all the time to the kitchen frig. I will be walking down the stairs daily to the basement to get food from the pantry and the 2 other refrigerators. I do not count on the old one to hold anything for any time as it has broke down more than once and would have been gone if I had any say about it. It's good for carrots, cabbage, celery , that type of stuff.I washed bed linen and throw blankets today after I did the laundry. Was cold but nice sunshine and breeze to help things dry. Only  had to run the dryer for 20 minutes to finish the comforter as I have no place to put it to finish drying. I hope the weather holds tomorrow as I have 5 more blankets and 1 set of sheets to wash yet even though it will be the day of rest.Tomorrow we go to the store for house and then later this week I will go for what I need for the two dishes we are taking to the Christmas party that we got invited to yesterday. I have what I need for the one. But the other one is cauliflower dressing since several at this party don't eat grains due to their diabetes."},
{"title": "The conversation started", "date": "Saturday, November 30, 2019", "text": "Like this...Me: we will start doing the pantry challenge in Jan. I am thinking about doing a no spend challenge at the same time. What do you think?Hubby: explain no spend.Me: no money spent on extras. Like clothes, eating out, wants instead of needs. You know like that.Hubby: okay, can we list exceptions?Me: like what?Hubby: like the two timers I need for the Christmas lights and ....I know he said more but I heard Christmas and thinking we are buying those next week...so I stopped him and said... I said Jan.Hubby: might as well start Dec 1st. We could do it for Advent.Oh well glad I was sitting down. After listing some things we KNOW we have to have in the next 6 weeks and then I figure out half of to be dealt with WITHOUT buying anything after thinking about it a couple days. We decided there will be a 3 day wait on anything that we think we need before we buy it.We have a small list of things to buy with most connected to Christmas like the flowers I order Hubby's parents and Daddy. Then we listed the basic grocery list and then rewrote it as we talked about it. Makes sense to do it Dec with Charlotte and Wilbur having their annual shots and Rascal looking to have surgery to remove the tumor. I have 9 medical appts during the next 6 wks also so fuel costs will be up.We decided no eating out except with our one friends and that is about every 6 wks or more and we just went out with them with Son 2.We decided no buying clothes for a year. So I went on line and researched prices for Hubby's undies which he said he was low on (LOL). The go to place that is usually the cheapest had ONE pack of 7 for $32 marked down from $42 (yes really) I went to the company site that makes them and got FOUR packs of 8 for the same price as the first place of 1 pack with free shipping.  The mending basket is going to over flow as Hubby is rough on clothes. BUT we are set.I checked cleaning products, paper goods, and personal products and think we are good.THEN I asked what to do with the money we save.... we bounced a few things around and then decided to split it. First , taxes that we might owe, second the medical fund. We have enough to pay 1 yr of ins right now. Hubby would like to have four years in it. We also could use a couple more months in the other savings. He would also like to pay his truck off earlier than we had planned( we planned a year earlier)So this is going to be interesting. We came in at budget for Nov."},
{"title": "What I did this week", "date": "Wednesday, November 27, 2019", "text": "I cooked 2 17 lbs turkeys over the weekend.Monday morning I deboned the meat and made broth out of the carcass. Got 14 -1 lbs bags of turkey in the freezer and 2 gallons of broth. Did laundry and hung it on the drying rack. Ran the dishwasher and put those dishes away. Ran the dust mop. Washed out the outside dog water bucket all by 10 am. At 11 we left for my back injections that is a 4 hr round trip not counting the doc time. We stopped after my injections at a local restaurant, the cashier let us know if we waited 7 min we would save $6 as we were senior citizens. We waited. We have found I do better on the 2 hr ride back home if I eat within 15 min and stay PUT for thirty. Eating at this buffet works. I will now plan my appts so we stop after 2 pm. I came home, did the ice routine and went to sleep at normal time.Tuesday... woke up at 3 wide awake, got up at 4 to let dogs out which meant Hubby got to sleep longer. Made coffee, started laundry, unloaded dishwasher. That will be the work for the day as I am LIMITED the first 24 hrs as the injections make my cerebral palsy flare a bit. No risking messing anything up. The  pain is way down. My hands did not go numb while I slept. We are having leftovers to clean what is left in the frig. Started listing what Christmas decorations we used in what rooms while living on the farm. Then started looking at that list to see what can be done here. We had a lot of decorations that died and are wanting to stay mostly LED. Jan 1st to Jan 31 is the highest electric bill we have of the year. Even beats 100 degree heat running AC in the summer.Wednesday ... I slept through the night, woke up  to let Charlotte out, she went to Hubby's chair (he left early to haul a Styrofoam ice house to neighbor's family) so I went back to bed. Woke up at 8:30 feeling like a zombie and it wouldn't take much for me to go back to sleep. Laundry is rolling, 1st cup of coffee is sitting by my side. I researched Christmas decorations. Ordered undies for myself since they are no longer making the style I prefer. It looks like I might be making bras as I will not pay $30 each for that and I am very hard to fit. Did some cleaning in the mudroom . Moved the airfryer off the bfast bar to the mudroom by the sink. I use it often enough I don't want it in basement but I need the bfast bar for baking. Mudroom was the original kitchen and really small. We ate leftovers. Have one more leftover to use up before I cook again.Thursday....  I got laundry washed and hung on drying rack. Got ready to go run errands before my appointments. Called the local shop for price on a full stick(log) of deli pepperoni (from Italy). They wanted $5.50 a lb. Decided to stop at the old IGA store where I used to get it when we lived on the farm. They gave me $2.50/lb OFF the price for buying the whole stick.  I carry a cooler when I am stopping at stores.I went to Aldi's and got 6 butter and 6 boxes of brownie cookie (has choc chip cookie dough on top of brownie) and 2 boxes of graham crackers. I have not found a recipe for a brownie we like, either too dry or too moist. Wouldn't be hard to make my own choc chip cookie dough. I have that recipe.I got a rosemary tree... Hubby thought first it was a small pine until he looked close and realized it was an herb. I will probably kill it off before spring but for right not it looks nice on the bfast counter.I had a mammogram and dexa study (bone density test). Thankful the hospital spent over 1 million dollars to get the new 3D mammogram (I have dense tissue and always end up with an Ultra sound also because of it) and bone density scanner. NO CRUSHING .... I stopped at CVS and got last of OTC meds we were missing.Stopped at Walmart and got cup hooks for the front room curtain ties, clear 3M hooks for Christmas stockings, 3 small strands of lights (one for pumpkin decoration that died, one for a gallon jar for the laundry room and one white strand because I remember we needed white but can't remember what for). 2 dry mixes of oatmeal cookies I use on fruit crisps  or I should say Hubby does when I am down and he wants fruit crisp. I also got 3 choc chip cookie mixes for gifts for the one that does not cook from scratch. A 3 pack of caramel apples. I did check to see if they had my undies...had 5 pairs , none in my size and at $15 a pair. I was glad I found them on line for a lot less than that.We do not have clothing in the budget at all. We buy if we have extra money and then we try to buy enough to go at least 1 yr.Stopped back at Aldi's and got 6 more butter (still 24 lbs short for the year, I did decide to switch completely to unsalted (might be repeating myself) even though I prefer salted for food, no sense having both and then getting upset when Hubby uses the unsalted instead of the salted). Six more of the brownie cookie mixes, 12 of the brownie mixes (M needs them) 2 boxes of graham crackers (M needs them), 3 blueberry preserves, 4 boxes of golden raisins. (I want to make my old recipe of fruit cake) 4 boxes of ugly sweater cookie mixes for some friends that wear that type of sweater to a Christmas dinner every year. Bananas, milk, fresh cranberries,orange juice and pomegranates . Turkey cranberry dressing ravioli ( if we like it I will figure out how to make my own) strawberries, mushrooms, cucumber (to go in cream cheese dip) pumpkin roll (as Hubby requested it) prosciutto(my Italian adopted grandmother pops in to my cooking  at this time of year) and cheeses.... SIGH... I knew better, I really did. I just needed some shredded cheese as we are real low due to casseroles and soups as Hubby puts it in what ever soup we have for what ever reason. I needed ricotta ( pasta and calzones) and parmesan, mild cheddar (cheddar biscuits) mozzarella and Mexican style. We are completely out of sliced provolone so I got 1 package. Picked up 2 of slice Havarti cheeses as it is Hubby's favorite. Got a small block of colby my favorite... I really know better to even look but I did. This Aldi's brings in different cheeses for the holidays.  I got Brie (will go in puff pastry), spreadable cheddar cheese with horseradish (Christmas ham?), spreadable cream milk cheese with garlic and herbs,goat cheese crumbles, sun dried tomatoes with basil goat cheese crumbles, Boursin garlic and herbs ( old favorite of ours but I won't buy it at when it runs over $4 and really look for it at $3 if I have a coupon, this was less than $3.) Cranberry white cheddar cheese round, mini ash brie round, 2 blocks of Havarti Jalapeno for Hubby, 1 block of champagne cheddar cheese (New year's eve), 2 crimson cranberry white Stilton, Blue Stilton ( which I do not like but like a cheese ball that it is in so I bought it) AND as if that was not enough I started in the goat cheese rolls >>> 2 small rolls of plain goat cheese (put in soups or eat) 1 small roll of garlic & herbs goat cheese (soups or eat) 1 small roll of truffle goat cheese (Christmas day) 2 medium rolls of cranberry cinnamon goat cheese (cranberry or cinnamon bread toasted?) Large roll of Chevre Mollie goat cheese ( culinary class recipe of tomato soup with it) and 4 small rolls apple cinnamon goat cheese (apple pancakes, apple bread toasted or as French toast, apple cake, cinnamon bread), I lost track of everything Hubby named he thought he would like to try it on, I might have to get more just for that reason. I will admit we are cheese hounds. We don't go to the cheese factory for that reason.We also like a lot of different cheeses. I told Hubby Merry Christmas when I told him what cheese I bought.I had pulled a jar from the freezer, looked like thick pasta sauce. It was, I warmed it up, put it on sub buns that needed used up and topped it with mozzarella cheese. Hubby said it hit the spot. I still have a bit left so I will melt Velveeta in it for a dip over the weekend to go with tortilla chips.  Called it a day about 2 hrs before normal and went to bed and passed out.Friday... ugh... Slept a solid 6 hrs (haven't done that in awhile) got up, saw Hubby off that was going with a friend to get hay. Went back to bed and slept another 5 hrs. ZOMBIE ... Got the laundry washed and on the drying rack.  I need to get the golden raisins into jars and into the pantry. Deal with the pomegranates and fresh cranberries. Makes something for dessert for this weekend. Need to slice and freeze the pepperoni or I will just chunk it and have it gone in a month. IF I slice it, it will last about 4 months if not longer. Replace the lights in the pumpkin decoration, wash the gallon jar for the other lights. Put the cup hooks up for the front room curtains and hook the ties on them. Instead I am sitting here drinking the fourth cup of coffee (usually only drink 3) not wanting to move at all.   Still doing National novel Writing month so need to do some catching up on that. Looking around knowing I should be doing something even though Hubby just checked in on me and told me to rest. Maybe I will make pizza for dinner. I have pepperoni LOLI did not do anything except work on list of daily until Jan 6th and writing...Hubby grabbed a $10 pizza on his way home from the gas station. It was loaded with veggies.Saturday. Hubby off and running. Yesterday another hauler went in the hospital sick , has pneumonia and everyone else split his work load until he gets back out.I got up with him to have a cup of coffee and talk over what we had going on today. I did get laundry done and on the drying rack so if I fall back to sleep it is done. Having omelets and ham for dinner."},

{"title": "We went shopping ", "date": "Friday, November 15, 2019", "text": "First we went to Menards to use our rebates. Need coat hooks for the coat rack Hubby made in the front room. Need another hook for the wheelchair bathroom because I am tired of Hubby tossing his PJ bottoms around and he has no place to hang them since we have barn doors on the bathroom and the over the door hooks don't work. We got the cheap ones that were on clearance for $2 instead of the $15 ones we found first. Since it was the 11% rebate We picked up pet safe ice melt in 20 lb bags to refill the salt containers aka kitty litter buckets son 2 gave us, dishwasher soap,a 3 pack of distilled water for my sinus rinse and bedroom humidifier, toilet paper (had a sale of 24 rolls of 2 ply for half of what it runs every where else so we bought 2 packages) Chi chi tortilla chips and mild Chi chi salsa dip (the only dip that does not trigger my acid reflux) Rebates we had paid for 70% of the bill. The rest was covered by non food budget and grocery budget.Then to Aldi's.. Thanks to Lana who said they had butter on sale with a limit of 6. Hubby and I both went in. Which is good as he decided he want to GRILL a turkey for our Thanksgiving dinner. You have to brine it ( I have the ingredients for that) and grill on indirect heat but it is a smaller turkey than I normally buy if we are not deep frying. SO in his cart was a 17 lbs Honeysuckle turkey 57/lb , 20 lb Butterball turkey 87/lb, a ham butt roast $1.49/lb and 6 of the butter at $1.99 ea. Total $56.26 Out of stock up money. I got the very same thing at $56.96. Both hams and the 2 smaller turkeys are in the barn small freezer. The 2 larger turkeys are thawing to be roasted. Which means the roaster is not going back to the basement today. Hubby has informed me the last freezer is completely full. I did pull out the peach juice to thaw so I can process it and can so the black refrigerator freezer is pretty much empty so I can put the cooked turkey there.I did ask him if he pulled the bag of ice out that was in the bottom of that freezer. He said it's now on top with the shrimp and fish. He did note that there was no butter left in there.  I pulled the last of it out last month to bring in the house. Then it was silence.... does that mean we are going to run low on butter this year like last? Only if I don't pick up more. We use the canned butter for the table and for cooking with like in mashed potatoes, stick butter for the rest.  As I pointed out we have half of our wanted supply and prices usually go down around Thanksgiving to Christmas so I should be able to get it and put it in the black refrigerator freezer with the cooked turkey.Especially with grilling a turkey in 2 weeks that will clear more room in the freezer. Leaving that the only thing left to stock up on as I already stocked the sugar.Then we went to chiropractic ... Hubby went first as he still have to pay a copay and I don't and he did that while Doc worked on me, including putting my ribs back in place that I threw out leaning into the washer to get the sock out of the bottom. Yes I was standing on a step and still threw them out. and YES I am that short.Since Dollar General is right next door I went there to check on over counter meds as we are low (gee I wonder why) Still need 2 they don't carry. AND I got a pair of tongs to get the things in the bottom of the washer. It is now hanging on a hook I installed this morning after I started laundry. I remembered to say I had digital coupons and she told me the one I was wanting to use was less than if she used the four others I had.... I thought I only had one. SO YEA!!!. I saved $8 instead of $4 and spent less on the meds there then if I had went to any where else.We did a pit stop to visit a friend that can not drive due to sixth nerve eye palsy affecting one eye and having cataract surgery on the other and is driving his wife batty as he is used to going a lot and he also can't go work out for the 3-4 hrs daily he was (plays volley ball etc at the wellness center), can't go work at the SCARES unit or EMA building. No one has came to see him. Limited computer time and can't hardly read a text on his phone. Going NUTS but refuses to wear the glasses that are to help correct the problem. We told them we would be back to go eat out (at Hong Kong as it is a favorite) and wife makes the comment if he can see better.  HUM I did not think before I said we can pick you both up if you don't feel like driving (we go right by their house to the restuarant) and he could be blind and still go out to eat. We have a friend that is blind and would have no problem spending time helping this one learn to deal with the blindness.  I even pointed out we have an ex son in law that is blind in one eye and he drives. Yes things are different, he should wear his glasses as our granddaughter did for 2 yrs. But she did not need to limit him more than what he was. She texted me later and said she had told their sons what I had said and both backed me, they felt she was making things worse instead of being supportive but they didn't know how to tell her.  Meantime the date is set for Hong Kong.AND he called the doctor and told him the glasses cause migraines. IF he had told his wife they did that she would have took him back the next day.Son 2 is coming up tomorrow to help put in air barrier in the attics so I am making his favorite soup Autumn stew that uses a butternut squash , Home Chef recipe since he will be here during lunch.I am going to keep a few slices of it to grill to put on a cauliflower pizza crust"},
{"title": "SNOW", "date": "Tuesday, November 12, 2019", "text": "We got at least 2 inches if not closer to 3. I am just not willing to go out and measure on the ramp. Temp was 9 this morning with windchill at 5 but as soon as the sun broke out of the clouds it warmed up to 14 and the wind pretty much slowed down. Winds coming from the north west.Our Amish neighbor M's sister in law, F is fighting cancer. Hubby has taken her several time for her chemo. Her doctors are now sending her to Mexico as there is nothing left stateside to try to help her. Heartbreaking. She knows she might not make it back from Mexico as she is in so bad of shape and she has young ones. We are doing what we can for them. The blessing is F lives next to a brother and his 12 children are a bit older than hers so they are helping take care of the kids so the parents and parents in law can help take care of F.Trash went to the road last night to be picked up this morning. We had a talk about the 1/2 piece of chicken and 1 cup of rice that got tossed due to him telling me he wanted it for lunch and then eating cheese and crackers instead and then the next day an egg sandwich. I thought he had ate the chicken and rice as he had shoved it in a veggie drawer instead of leaving it sit where I put leftovers. GRR.He was upset he had to take a partial bag to the trash can because it had the chicken and rice in it. My answer was you should have left it sitting in the leftovers shelf and I would have ate it or reminded you to eat it. Then we wouldn't be wasting trash sacks.We got a free pizza from one of the guys Hubby used to work with. He had a free pizza coupon from buying his lunch at the gas station but they don't eat pizza so he gave it to Hubby. Got 2 meals from it.We ate from the pantry. I have pulled 3 days of food from the pantry and brought it up to the kitchen with a note of what to pull from the freezers the night before needed. It seems to be working as I was sick yesterday(weather change whacks me out on top of still fighting my allergies) and was able to flip meals without even thinking about what to fix.We put a thermometer where we intended to store root veggies. It was too warm so we started moving the thermometer to other places. Looks like the north loft wins again.We went to Kroger's for their sale that matched my rebates from Ibota and coupons.I got the butter that has been running around $5.97/ lb for the last few months that was on sale for $2.99. If you bought 10 you got it at $2.49. So I got 10. My Ibota had a rebate of 50 cents on 5 of them. Hubby figure it out that meant I save 25 cents on 10 bringing the price down to $2.24.  Saving $3.73 on each for a total savings of $37.30. I use 52 lbs of butter a year total between table use and baking. I do have canned butter still so that will be table use.That should put me at 26 lbs for this year for baking. Canned butter doesn't do well in baking.I got tea that was marked on clearance as this store doesn't carry it during the winter(family size bags) and had coupons so I got tea for 99 cents each normally closer to $2.99. Saving $4.00I got flavored creamer. I only buy it during the holidays when it's on sale and I have coupons. Normal price was $3.99 on sale for $2.49, Buy 5 and it goes to $1.99. I had 3 coupons of 50 cents off. I also had Ibota for 50 cents for each up to 5. Hubby figure that to take 80 cents off each for $1.19. Saving $14.I bought a 17 lb turkey marked down from $1.69 to $1.09 and then got a rebate from Ibota for $3. Brought the price down to 91 cents. A bit more than I normally spend but I am having trouble finding turkeys closer to 17-20 lbs. Buying 2 -10 pound turkeys just means I have double the bones.I bought 2 portabella mushrooms caps for an appetizer. They were on clearance for $1(last day for them) and I had a coupon for 50 cents. Normal price is $4.99 so I save $4.49 cents.After doing the survey for Kroger's we will have 10 cents a gal off fuel.IT will probably be used on the Jeep since I have 3 medical appts this month all of them over 1 hr away one way.We did all the regular things ... close curtains at dusk, open on east side at dawn. We keep the rest closed until the sun is up more. Washed foil, sandwich bags, freezer bags , and bread bags. Use LED lights for night lights. Use only task lighting and only the oil lamp at the table. The furnace is set at 72...which means my bedroom, laundry room and bathroom are 72, which sucks in the bedroom as I prefer to have a cooler room. HVAC guy told me to close the vents half but not completely as it would mess up how the furnace runs based on air flow. The kitchen and dining room are 70 and the mudroom, front room and wheelchair bathroom are 68 on a good day. Front room will drop to 66 at night. Just how this house rolls no matter what our HVAC guy tried. House should have really had 2 furnaces and ac's but the cost on propane would have killed us. We will just handle the cooler rooms and use electric heater if needed.We added more wind block to the front room windows and a heavy curtain to block the east/west lofts staircase opening. We could feel the cold coming straight down the stairs to the table.We needed a coat rack in the front room for guest and a different one that would hold Hubby heavy carhart bibs and coats in the mudroom. Hubby found a board that I had painted red from the old farm and cut it to fit those two places. We used the coat hooks that N had left here when they moved for the mudroom. As they are designed that you can put a narrow board on top of. Hubby will be looking for a narrow board in the barn to put on it for gloves and such. I will have to buy hooks for the front room as they need to be a lot smaller so they don't hit the door when it's opened all the way. The red paint blends well with the red paint in the front room.I kind of like the pop of color in the mudroom also.If I decide to paint it white it will be during the summer.I change the style of heater vent deflector under the table by the front door to bring the heat out farther from under the table.I used one that is suppose to be under a couch.Since I am baking a pork loin today I decided to dice up the last of the rutabaga, turnip , add a carrot and potatoes, toss with oil and herbs and roast on a cookie sheet while the pork is in. I might also do a strawberry quick bread that Daughter 2 posted on Facebook.How is your week going?"},

Prime rib for Christmas eve if we can find it at a decent price. This was the first thing we stocked when we moved last year. So it's been a year of knowing what it cost us to stock this pantry.Hubby was gifted with a Walmart gift card  so he wanted to finish stocking up the condiments that I was not going to stock up on. So we figured up what we could buy for the amount on the gift card using the prices on line for Walmart.Good news is we actually got MORE due to in store mark downs and was able to add a turkey that was 68 cents/ lb. I also got another gal. of milk, bananas and outlet safety covers. Gift card covered it. Doing a happy dance for sure. Hubby was happy also as it was the condiments he really likes so he won't have \"limit\" himself so much. Last year we got 10 turkeys (37-48 cents/lb during the week after Thanksgiving)and 6 hams( $1.49/lbs). This year is going to be 6 turkeys and 4 hams (the most, with the least being 3 turkeys and 2 hams)as I have 20 briskets in the freezer. A friend we had helped last winter found them on clearance and bought us 5 and I cut them into 4 \"roasts\" each and vacuumed sealed them.I have just enough space for the turkeys and hams in the small deep freezer and then we are FULL.I went through the paper goods and cleaning products. Neither of us can think of anything we NEED for personal items or over counter meds. We pick up stamps in Dec for the year.At the holidays I will pick up unsalted butter, white and choc chips, marshmallows (I got a recipe to make fondant using them) and probably sugar as it will most likely be a lower price than now.I am rewriting the basic grocery list.I searched the internet for DIY recipes to some mixes we usually buy so I can make them myself.Hubby figured out we spent less than $19.00 a day for both of us to restock the 4 deep freezers (all were empty when we moved) and 3/4ths of the pantry along with herbs and spices. I usually grow my own herbs but that didn't go well this year due to weather. I would like to see it closer to the $10 for both of us.According to the USDA food costs a couple our age are spending $367.50 for a thrifty menu  up to $714.70 for liberal menu. We fall in the area of moderate. The $10 I want might be unrealistic since the thrifty plan is set at more than $12.We will see how it goes.Sausage gravy, biscuits, applesauce for dinner."},
{"title": "Update on budget.", "date": "Monday, November 4, 2019", "text": "We came in UNDER budget even with being over budget with food buysOur electric company doesn't do budget payments. They do leveling payments and every 3 months your payment changes.  I figured out what we averaged and then pay that amount each month. So we have a \"credit\" on the months the electric runs high like Dec and Jan with Christmas lights (even though they are LED) and electric lights that we don't use at all during the sunnier months.I have been ordering 8 bags of salt instead of just a fill of 6 bags for delivery for our water softener. It's cheaper for us to rent and get it replaced every 2 yrs with the hard water we have, than buy a new one every 2 yrs. That cuts down on how many times I pay for a delivery charge by 2 times a year saving $5 a month. Hubby can handle pouring a bag of salt in the softener and when he can't E has offered to come over and do it for us as he does it for 2 other senior citizen neighbors.I had our home/auto insurance checked and they lowered the cost by $5 a month based on where we live.This month the new billing for internet/landline came in after Hubby called last month. Saving us $25 a month which is lower than what they quoted him.Since my health OOP (out of pocket) is paid in full I had a credit at the chiropractic office of $175... they have been using it to pay Hubby's when he goes. I save $70/ month since I have my OOP paid...a 3 day stay at the hospital from my Crohn's wiped it out.My primary doctor ordered my mammogram and dexa study(bone test) for this month since I do have the OOP paid I won't have to pay for these tests.I will have my back injections this month and those will be paid for saving me $220.We pay off credit cards in full each month to incur not interest charge.Hubby was able to skip a payment (every 12 months the bank allows it) on his truck and we chose to make the payment. The bank said if we didn't use any of the skip payments it we would end up paying truck off 7-10 months early. That is a lot of interest saved.We filled the jeep up once instead of twice as budgeted. We filled the old truck aka dog truck as it's the one we take the dogs in up twice instead of three times as budgeted. I do NOT budget the 350 truck. Hubby's hobby pays for EVERYTHING on that truck and the trailers. If he can't cover the cost he can sale the stuff right along with that truck according to him.I used the dog food bags twice instead of trash bags. As long as I tape them shut they will accept it. Saves me 20 cents a month for something I was throwing away anyways.We decided to not renew our Sam's club membership until we actually need it...if we need it. Walmart in our area has been beating the prices for the same amount. I am going to check out Gordan Food Service also as my brother said he buy a lot of bulk from them for his brother in law's youth church.We will be using Daddy's whole house humidifier. I cleaned it the other day when it was warm outside and then looked for filters. I don't think Daddy or brother thought to replace the filter EVER. I found several sites with them, priced it out and got the best buy at Amazon with buying 3 instead of 1. This humidifier allows you to use softened water instead of distilled. SAVINGS will be $32 a month by using Daddy's over what we had. So that's a savings to look forward to, even better we won't have to go to town to get distilled water.The baking soda that was in the refrigerators was used to clean with and to dump down drains with vinegar when I replaced it.I asked M if she had any tips as I was trying to cut the budget. She uses Mr Clean, bleach, vinegar and baking soda for cleaning. She makes her own laundry soap (same recipe as mine). Uses a clothes line and drying rack for all. Keeps curtains closed on dark and cold  days,opens them up on sunny days (reverse that during the summer) and closes them BEFORE dusk to keep the warmth in. She bakes her desserts and cookies before her breads....that I don't do. I asked why and she said that way the kitchen is warmer so her bread rises easier.Getting bread to raise in this kitchen even in the hottest day of summer has been an issue. Mending was also mentioned and on a daily bases. Something I am behind on HA HA. She makes her own yogurt, catsup, mayo, butter, buttermilk, pancakes mix, harvest and cook down their maple syrup from their own trees. Offered to tap our trees next year. Saving for things or going without was two more mentions. Doing a routine cleaning lets her keep track of things that need fixed or replaced. Also not having a lot \"pretties\" keeps her time down on cleaning. She does use doilies or cloth to cover furniture to keep the dust down also. Less to wipe. She cleans windows weekly, let the sun in better so she uses less kerosene to burn lamps along with cleaning her lamps daily. I also clean my lamps daily and used to do the windows weekly. I replaced my squeegee this week when it was on sale 50 % off. I got two so I wouldn't go without again.We are still talking over the grocery budget."},
{"title": "When a simple thing is a major milestone.", "date": "Friday, November 1, 2019", "text": "Hubby is definitely one for eating out or picking up take out.Yesterday we had our chiropractic appt and I knew he would complain he was hungry and needed to eat afterwards SO I made an early lunch of odds and ends and made sure I pointed out we had leftover roast and veggies or could eat bfast items for our dinner.He did ask when we left the appointment if we were still eating the roast or bfast for dinner and I said FIRMLY yes. MILESTONE he didn't bring it up again like he usually does.I told him I have a menu for Nov.  Every other Sunday is sausage gravy and biscuits. The other Sundays is bacon.  Mondays are oven baked meals. Tuesday is breakfast for dinner, Wednesday is pasta including his requested mac and cheese and smoke sausage a couple times. Thursday will float between chicken, turkey, beef,beans and pork. Friday is pizza, French pizza, calzones or appetizers. Saturday also floats between beef, chicken, turkey, beans and pork.  I don't bother to plan bfast or lunch as it's something we can always find to eat without much cooking. He did call me last night and said \"I know pizza is on the menu for tomorrow but we have a free pizza coming so can I pick it up tonight since I am already here getting fuel for the truck, gas and kerosene for E ? YES, that just moves the beef and noodles (M's homemade noodles) and mashed potatoes and cole slaw to Friday. As we bumped pasta night due to leftovers from roast.I told him I would like to make the 2000 gallons of propane I ordered for this coming heat season (plus we have propane water heater and cook stove) to last 24 months... I got 1600 to last 17 months and feel that if he gets done with the air barrier this month we should be able to get it stretched that much. I just ordered our first tank for the heating season. We averaged 10 % of the tank during the heating season last year so I do have a bench mark to go by during Nov through April. He asked how I thought we could do that as it's dropping fuel by 400 gallons a year. Getting the house insulated better. Multi dishes in the oven. Using the air fryer over deep frying or for small baking as our electric is cheaper than our gas. I also did not do any canning outside like I did the year before so I can go back to that using the grill tanks for canning (which runs cheaper in the summer) We didn't have a place set up for it this year at the barn so that needs to be set up by spring when the asparagus comes on.He put insulator board up at 2 areas that was allowing cold air to come in at where a heat vent was in the dining room and took a board to the pump house in case we need it at that door WITHOUT me nagging. Called Son 2 to find out if he could come up the 9th and help him put air barrier in.I rewrote the punch list with the thoughts of doing 3-4 things a week. Going through boxes in the barn is going to be a long time of dealing with. I have found a couple places to put Daddy's bedroom dressers. I just need to do some changing around to get them moved in. Not the priority right now.I spent  2 hrs putting insulators in the switches and outlets before I ran out. Ordered more to start again on Tuesday since Monday I have a doctor's appointment for my back pain. I have no other errands to run with this appointment.I started inputting the pantry inventory on a spreadsheet. I will finish doing it this weekend and start monitoring what we eat and what we need to eat. ANOTHER MILESTONE as I have inventoried before but never put it in a form I could monitor it other than look and go OH WE ARE LOW. It should help me look for sales better and not over spend other places. I have a clip board that I am going to rig to hang with a pencil in the basement stair case  to mark off what I bring up to use AND what I take down to stock.While he was checking to make sure we had what we needed for air barriers as he didn't want Son 2 to show up and then have to go get stuff... Hubby found 2 holes in between the kitchen porch roof and the roof to the house that was letting tons of air in. He shoved some loose insulation in it but is going out tomorrow to see what we have that he can use to close those holes up.Hubby stopped over to E and M's to drop off some fish we had in the freezer from his fishing trip. His buddy had packed too large of amount for us and Son 2 didn't come up with his bike buddies for a fish fry. I don't want it getting freezer burn and going to waste. M said it was perfect as they would be gone all day Friday but everyone was going to be home on Saturday. Hubby mentioned he thought they would be gone longer as she had 8 loaves of bread rising...until I told him they eat 5-6 loves a DAY. I will add when they eat sandwiches,there is only 1 slice of bread. They eat open face sandwiches most the time. She bakes 12- 15 loaves depending on what is left on Saturdays. He didn't remember we ate 3-4 loaves a day with the kids all home with a couple of us not being much of bread eaters.I am doing NANOWRIMO ... AKA Nano... National novel writing month during the month of Nov. It's 50,000 words in 30 days.  I try to do it every year, haven't always made the 50,000 words due to work load. This year I am keeping the work load down, working on a routine and writing."},
{"title": "No appetite fatigue.", "date": "Monday, October 28, 2019", "text": "TuesdayI did 2 loads of laundry and hung them on the kitchen clothes line.I turned off the furnace and opened the house to air out.Found the dust mop head that has been missing since the rooms were painted in my snow boot.Ran Afresh through the clothes washer.Unloaded the dishwasher and put the dishes away, reloaded the dishwasher and set it on delay cycle to wash during the night.Cleaned both toilets.Cleaned both bathroom sinks.Cleaned the kitchen sink.Took 2 naps.I was going to eat leftover mac and cheese but it didn't taste right to me so I didn't eat it. Ate cheese,pepperoni and crackers for lunch instead. Had nachos for dinner that helped me start breathing better but it was medium salsa instead of mild so it triggered my acid reflux and tummy got ticked at me over it even though I took my acid reflux med before eating. I'll check the label better on the salsa for sure next time.Watched master class on the British bake off.Took over 7000 steps during the day. (Fitbit tracker).Hubby got in around 8 and didn't stop talking until close to 10...he isn't much of a talker to begin with. He really enjoyed the day.WednesdayHubby off to deliver the food that was sent back with him yesterday and check on the newest arrival in the community. E's baby brother wife went in to labor so baby should be ready to start meeting everyone especially when he was dropping off food to them anyways.I have the only load of laundry for the day out on the kitchen porch clothes line.I turned off the furnace and opened the house to air out.I need to think about how to change how I store my baking pans etc as I have picked up more and want to start baking more.I need to get the summer stuff tubs finished packed so Hubby can take it to the barn to store when he gets backTummy seems to have forgiven me for yesterday's salsa but not sure what to eat today that won't trigger anything. I haven't ran a fever in 24 hrs... I might have jinxed myself on that.Did another load of laundry of summer curtains from the bathroom and laundry room. Those winter curtains are now up along with the ones in the lofts.Fixed quesadillas for dinner after eating toast for lunch. Tummy doing okay.I straightened part of the bedroom. I still have the dresser to unbury from stuff from when rooms were painted.Sent Hubby a picture of the east loft attic door that had blew open with the winds. He now has that moved up the to do list as he was looking at doing it late Nov.THAT was Wednesday and now is MONDAY...Tomorrow is my last day of antibiotics, I will be back on my biologic YEAH. Never thought I would look forward to getting a shot.We have been working at getting things done as the weather is turning quickly. Below average temps starting this Friday... after a day of soaking rain and 40 mph gusting winds with the temp dropping to low 30's or high 20s. I feel for the ones out Trick or Treating that night.We have been eating from the pantry. Not as balanced as I would like but at least we are eating. But neither of us feels up to cooking much.We got fuel at Krogers using points. I inventoried the pantry (not freezers). Variety is abundant. So we shouldn't get appetite fatigue. Ten varieties of dried beans, 2 more of canned.Eight different rices and 12 different grains not including corn meal or wheat flours. I have enough fruit and veggies for a couple meals each day  NOT counting what has been frozen as I have 3 large deep freezers, 1 small deep freezer (think 6 turkeys and 6 hams size) and 3 refrigerator freezers... all bottom drawer freezers... and yes Hubby decided to keep the old frig that is NOT reliable... it holds things that can handle getting warm and not going bad like mustard and ketchup, etcThe next time it goes down He can be the one to deal with it and that will change his mind LOL.Best thing is the small deep freezer is almost empty and ready for the turkeys and hams and the one frig freezer only has the peach juice I need to make into syrup and jelly and it will be empty.  Didn't think I would ever feel good seeing empty space in my freezers but at this time of year that means I have room for turkeys, hams and desserts.ANYWAYS.... I have 39 different pastas... and figures when he saw the list he asked why I didn't have the ditalini.... hum...because I haven't found it on sale for the price I am willing to pay for it. We can have a different pasta every week for 39 weeks and he points at 1 that isn't there. SIGH.We had to go to the store and restock perishables. Decided to stop over to E and M's and ask if they needed anything. E has been trying to get the last cut of hay in, his corn shocked (tee pee the corn stalks to store in the field and pick the corn later off the stalks)  with 2 soaking rains in the next couple days and freezing temps along also and M is pregnant with the 4 little ones at home as the older 4 are in school. I didn't see her loading the little ones up to drive the buggy into town and get groceries and back on her own. We got  3 gal of homemade noodles and a warm loaf of fresh bread for going for her.We get in the store and Hubby checks out the meat sales... I pass the grocery list to him and I go for the meat sales and dairy.I got the buy one get one sales of beef  and had coupons for smoked sausage and bulk sausage so got 10 of each ( total 30 as I got 10 mild bulk and 10 hot bulk and 10 smoked). I got 2 bacon that I had coupons for that was marked down also.I got 2 bags of frozen chicken that was on sale and I have coupons for both of them. Hubby loaded up his cart with produce that was on sale that we could put in the freezer such as berries and pineapple. He also got coffee,canned mackerel  and coke as it was on sale and what I drink.  I picked up the dairy after the meat. No sales or coupons there except for the cheese I got 2 packages of thin Swiss cheese as we eat it on casseroles during the fall and winter.I need to put the inventory on a spread sheet and mark off what I use.  I did find that I was low in a couple things that I thought was being kept some where else and it wasn't. I ordered it from Amazon along with another order that was sitting until things went on sale. I can't remember the last time I used my almond extract but I was completely out. I'd spend more in gas that I did by ordering it and I know of 4 recipes Hubby has asked me to make calls for it.We still have not ordered propane. It's paid for in full so that's not what is holding us up. When I called the other day about ordering it, we aren't down to the OH WE NEED PROPANE mark LOL...she asked if I could call back end of month to order it to be delivered the first week of Nov as they knew the price was going down a bit. Even though I have paid in full we get the lower price but never charged more if it goes above what I paid.Hubby took down the garden to start pulling up weed barrier so he could mow the whole area.... he found poblano peppers around the cabbage. He told me the cabbage was not good that the worms had gotten it but when he started pulling it up he realized that within a couple layers of leaves the head were good. I have 16 cups of freezer slaw and 11 cabbages tightly wrapped with press and seal wrap in the frig produce drawers of the old frig. I want to finish the last of the cabbage with cabbage lasagna and unrolled cabbage rolls. I want to make for supper Lidia's torte di polenta which is polenta \"cake\" sliced and filled with a filling of cabbage and potatoes cooked and mashed together with cheese. Old Italian recipe that my Nonna used to make but I forgot about until Hubby had was Lidia cook show on PBS.Errands are tomorrow as we have chiro. I want to stop at Aldi's that is close to the appt to see if I can fill in the holes..."},
{"title": " update on deck and Staying frugal when you are the one sick", "date": "Tuesday, October 22, 2019", "text": "Railing needs to be done, bottom enclosed and a small ramp to go over the door jam but it's usable for now. I love the red reflection of the barn on the French doors.The 4 feet wide ramp goes to the sidewalk that runs from the front of the house to the barn. The sidewalk 36 inches wide so a wheelchair will fit nicely after I finish moving some of the flowers that are in the flower garden beside that over whelm the sidewalk during the summer.I was going to work on the railing this month BUTI am sick. Even my antibiotic is making me nauseated. Exhaustion haunts me. Sleep cycle is out of whack. I love my Fitbit for tracking this for me. Part is I can't go get my back injection while sick and the other is just from being sick. I called the doctor yesterday to whine about the antibiotic making me nauseated.My doctor and his head nurse whom is his wife are friends so they know me very well. I was told to suck it up (in more polite terms) and eat before and after taking the meds and to quit trying to get things done and go lay down and rest so I don't relapse like I did last year. Suggested I start my anxiety med and my Vit D for my SAD. IF I still get nauseated to take the nausea meds I have.He will call in a refill if I need it. TO GO LAY DOWN. I took 2 naps and slept better during the nap then I did during the night.Sigh.I don't know if it's good that your medical doctor knows you that well...LOLStill if I lay that much my back hurts worse and I don't sleep if I don't get enough movement during the day...I have done 2 loads of laundry a day, both were able to be hung on the kitchen porch clothes line. It's been nice even when the rain came in so I opened up the house and let it air out.I stripped my bed, washed everything but only tossed a blanket over the top of it to sleep on as I am now washing it every day until I get well.   IF I wake up cold I know the dogs aren't sleeping with me. I usually have the snuggler.I don't know which one of them took the pillowcase off the other pillow but all the pillows got washed because of it. I really need to not use light colors on the bed.I said something to Hubby about meals and his answer was Arby's, Pfeiffer Station (Wed meatloaf, Thurs beef and noodles), Jump n Jim's (gas station with good pizza) Subway, Wendy's, Michael Angelo's pizza which we haven't tried yet. He did add he would heat veggies and chill canned fruit to go with it and pay for it out of his hobby money.I just looked at him.Right now he is running hard to help the neighbors with fall stuff to be ready for winter. He made a trip to Indiana today to take canning jars and an ice house for E's in laws. Since word went out he was going 3 other families added to that load that needed things dropped off in that area. E's in laws are making sure the rest gets  to where it's suppose to go. They covered his costs plus he gets 3 Amish cooked meals and got $ for as a tip for doing this at the last minute. The driver that was suppose to take it got sick and is in hospital.Meals we have ateSpicy chili I canned for Hubby, I ate tomato soup.mac and cheese and smoked sausage with Brussels sproutscheese and meat tray with pickles and pickled beetssausage gravy and biscuits with peas and carrotsScrambled eggs with applesauce with biscuitsPhilly steak subs with leftover beef from freezer and onions and mushrooms.Since Hubby is getting fed today by Amish I am eating on my own. I had meat and cheese and crackers with juice for lunch. I'll eat eggs for dinner as we are being over ran with eggs at the moment since I am sick and Hubby doesn't fix eggs for himself let alone the 3 dogs. Wilbur and Rascal no longer have skin issues since we been giving them cooked eggs once a week.Charlotte loves her eggs also.I think this week will bebean and meat burritos with taco meat from freezer. Salsa and tortilla chipsLoaded omelets (with grits for Hubby)123 pasta (1 onion, 2 cups protein and 3 cups veggies which is already cooked and in freezer) with garlic cheesy bread made from sub buns (in freezer)Reuben casserole with rye spiral bread(in freezer)French bread pizza using sub buns (in freezer)IF he is home for lunch then I will addquicheBig eggs( aka frittata using left overs for filling)For desserts this week WHEN I feel up to it....Sunshine salad (orange jello with shredded carrot, Hubby puts Miracle whip on top of it, Mother always put mayo)pumpkin pie and double layer pumpkin pieSpice cake with apple butter fillingsnicker doodle bread (new recipe)I need.... okay want ... to make some noodles while I am baking so I can us the warmth of the oven to dry my noodles.I'm tired so I guess it's time to lay down again."},

Allergies went into infection in my throat and ear.) Hubby mentioned there was things I was doing that annoyed him.My first thought was not using the dryer and his clothes being stiff followed by me dancing at 2 pm to my alarm and getting Wilbur to \"dance\" with me.Maybe keeping the curtains closed until the sun comes up, closing them when it goes down during the winter.Weird things I make and can starting with trying to decided which beet marmalade/chutney to make (we decided to just can plain beets and make different chutney's from them when we couldn't decide between 6 different chutney's and I am not canning that many without tasting them first.Eating part of something (apple, banana etc) and putting the rest of it in frig wrapped???NOPEIt's washing plastic bags of all sorts followed by washing foil and putting it on the kitchen porch clothes line in front of the kitchen window.He doesn't want to wash any of it but is okay if I do, just doesn't want to see it when looking out the kitchen window. I can tell you the only time he looks out that window is when he is pouring a cup of coffee.I don't make enough sausage gravy and biscuits and I don't cook bacon often enough and he wants mac and cheese with smoked sausage more often.He wants 3 to 4 desserts, ice cream in the house and cookies every week. He still needs to lose 40 pounds to be down to where the doctor wants him and I am right where I should be.Since he knows I am not going to change my lifetime habit of washing out plastic bags (I toss greasy or raw meat bags) and foil ... as my parents did this when I was a child... we agreed I would hang them on the other end of the kitchen porch when he wasn't seeing them when standing at the kitchen sink window when getting his coffee.The man eats 2 lbs of bacon in a meal. THICK sliced bacon. He agreed to 1 lb. a meal so the 1 1/2 lbs packages I buy would be 1 meal for both of us with some left over for crumbles.  THEN we could have bacon twice a month instead of once a month.  The other 2 weeks of the month could be sausage gravy and biscuits. We both miss taking Daddy out for sausage gravy and biscuits every other Sunday. Daddy don't miss it because the nursing home serves it every Sunday morning. I could put mac and cheese and smoked sausage on the menu every other week.Three to four desserts,ice cream and cookies when he needs to lose weight was the biggie for me.He didn't want to but agreed that I could cut the desserts and he only took ONE serving and I had to check his serving of ice cream as he will take a pint (used to be a quart) as a serving.I would bake cookies but only keep out 1 dozen for the week.A 6 inch fruit pie or a 8 inch cream/custard pieA 8 inch round or square cake or brownie single layer.A jello dessert or jello saladA pudding or custard if the pie was fruit.Ice cream but he could not have it daily.BUT he had to quit putting stuff in the one frig freezer where I will put this stuff as I will make 2 of the cakes and make cookie dough to freeze. He mentioned he thought that frig was full of other stuff... I definitely need to be checking that freezer.HE asked for more casseroles, roasts with veggies and meat pies. Two years ago it was \"I want my steak, pork chops and short ribs. \"My doctor did suggest I go back to drinking my \"medicine\" teas and eating from the rainbow. Asked if I needed it in writing to show Hubby. He texted him instead of writing it... good to have your doctor and Hubby be friends.Since I pretty much have enough stocked of the different colors it isn't going to cost us much. I do wish my eggplant would have grown, not something Amish grow around here.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Photos..", "date": "Monday, October 14, 2019", "text": "Starting with Charlotte.  The 3 dogs and I were in the barn getting winter items. On the last load I told the dogs to go to the house. Watched all 3 go out the door and turned to pick up the last load to take to the house... LESSON LEARNED... STUPID will go back in behind your back and HIDE.  AND then when you go looking for her 15-20 min later you will see thisWilbur and Rascal were sitting on the deck just looking at her. Guess they decided that since she didn't come out of the barn with them she could just stay in the barn. Usually they will bark if she is stuck some where like, the upstairs loft over the kitchen when the door gets shut. , the basement when the door is shut after she went down and Hubby thought she went outside something along that line. They went and did this when I let her out of the barn. Rascal being black makes him blend in some.I have put in the pantry...popcorncorn in the freezercandy onions in the cratesgreen tomatoes in the freezertomatoes and apple butter in the pantrymore apple butter from all these applesI cleaned out flower pots and found Daikon radishes and onionsWe went to Stites (damaged and past best buy date place) and spent $50 for thisI saw this there and think if I have time I might make some for usA young Amish lady I bought beets from while she was in the hospital having a C section came over to tell me that I left too much and she could either pay me the difference in beets or cash... KNOWING they don't have insurance and money is really tight for everyone as gardens didn't do well and those that earn their money through the produce auction was barely making enough to cover their costs. I chose the beets. THEN she told me that she had asked her mother in law for some beets because N's wife is her sister and her sister told her I couldn't find beets. SO I bought those beets also.  I am canning plain beets for my foster sister and mother as they don't can any more and are the only ones that like beets. Since I am canning them anyways. I will also make beet jam and beet and red onion marmalade. I have never done those before but it will be something different if I get it right.THEN a friend called me asking if I knew where he could get 10-15 lbs of beets by Friday so he could dehydrate them. YEP I sure do. I will stop over and let her know.I am still caulking and putting the house back together from being painted. There are a couple things I have misplaced...one being the hooks to the dining room curtains. Since mornings are in the 30s I definitely want curtains up and since I am not willing to go buy something I KNOW is here some where. I used clothes pins.I pinned them so we could open and shut them with only moving 1 clothes pin.Hubby walked over to the neighbors to help with a horse and he got a ride homeNot the usual to see an Englisher in the buggy.Hubby spent some time working on the deck ramp. Not as far along as he had hoped to be due to rain coming in but at least the digging part is doneI took him to Lock 16 in Lima for his birthday. He got his steak but also go these scallops that were wrapped in bacon. He loves seafood but doesn't eat much of it here in Ohio since he was spoiled by fresh seafood while living in Alabama for work.I think this will always be my favorite picture of him.  The Harvest moon was this weekend... I am thankful for what I did get raised and thankful for those that were willing to provide me with more to make sure my pantry was full.The sky was a violet color and it was wonderful to see.Blessing on all of you"},
{"title": "Spent the day working together", "date": "Sunday, October 13, 2019", "text": "On Friday and  Hubby figured out that he moves like a snail (his words) and I am a Belgian plow horse. Since he said it in front of E, he got ribbed over the comment. Yes, I take breaks but I don't side track or wonder off to check something that has nothing to do with what I am working on. I will send a memo to myself on my phone to check it later. NOR do I look at my phone every time a notification or text comes in.It took him 6 hrs to scrape and paint a trim on the house that should have only took him 2 hrs. Since E was going up and down the road he could see him and how he was doing where I was inside working , E came over to see why it was taking Hubby so long.The items still on the to do listMine:finish stocking the pantryfinish inventorying the pantrycut and sew the winter curtains for the bedroomhang the rest of the winter curtains up (have 50% up)finish 72 things off the energy audit list. I am fall cleaning while I do the audit stuff.build, paint laundry room closetinstall deck railing.Hubbythe trim has been painted that wasn't on his list but should have been.He has 1 board STILL to cut to finish the deck and then start on the rampHe looked at the list he made and realized he is going to working outside in the cooler weather when he really should have had that stuff done and be working in the attics before we start getting freezing temps. E talked to him about taking care of the home on the way over to get some lumber for E's calf barn.I wrote up a routine...AGAIN... BUT this one includes me spending time doing National Novel Writers Month that starts Nov 1st.It worked for over the weekend."},
{"title": "disagreement and frustration. ", "date": "Tuesday, October 8, 2019", "text": "Hubby and I have been doing a lot of talking about our lack of routines or what messes up the routines we have... lots of talking and lots of ideas. AND then I clued in after a frustrating difference of opinion.First we have things needing done from the energy audit. Do this will savings us $$$ in the long run while it is costing us $ in the now. There is 120 items. I could do all of it myself if I had to.Second we have the remaining 139 things on the punch list that we set a deadline of 2 yrs (now into year 2) to finish except for big projects aka basement ramp redone and the gravel in all places. Those items were set at 4 yrs. I average 8 items per month. Hubby averaged 1 item every 3 months. This is going to take both of us to work on to get it done in that time frame. And 1 every 3 months isn't going to get it done.Third there is the daily living items...Mine is meals,(planning, shopping, cooking and cleaning up, cleaning frigs) home blessing (decluttering, dust, shine, swish, swipe, sweep, mop and vacuum along with burn trash and half the time take the other trash to the can or/and to the road) Laundry (sort, wash, dry (clothes line or drying rack) iron if needed mend if needed) Putting the food up, maintaining the pantry. Being the one to manage the finances for the home.Hubby is in charge of keeping all vehicles maintained.We schedule health appts that we both need together to save fuel $. I try to schedule my others... so I can combine them with other errands.We both do yard and garden jobs. We both do repairs on the home.We both take care of the dogs. We both drive Amish or elderly that don't drive any more or take messages to those without a phone or to the English neighbor who forgets to charge her house and cell phone and her kids are worried since she isn't answering. Hubby is doing more hauling this year than expected due to 3 other haulers down on medical or retired out. The one that retired out is back as semi retired and the medical ones are starting back slowly.I clued in to that he was trying to pay back the money he spent on all 3 trailers in this year. Unrealistic goal. I did business management in college. He also wanted to have his truck paid off 2 yrs early... that might be possible if he wasn't trying to pay back the trailers even with just a paying hobby which is what he is doing.Which is why he started booking so much that he wasn't home for 12-14 hrs 5 to 6 days a week.I also clued in when he wanted me to do something that he offered to do for someone else even though doing so meant I lost 2 days of doing my own work right in the middle of me canning and trying to caulk 3000 plus square feet of this home and he had a poor attitude with my response.I refused and told him to call the person and tell them he couldn't do it or change what he was doing to get it done. I went to bed upset, angry and woke in the middle of the night with a mild Crohn's flare up.The next day we were on the road for several hours. Nothing like being in a car where you can't just walk away. I did tell him it was a conversation not a dialogso he needed to at least acknowledge he was listening. He was really upset that it flared my Crohn's but he understood it wasn't the disagreement it was the fact he disrespected me by not acknowledging the amount of work I already do. Funny thing is he has constantly told others I save him more money than I could earn (after taxes especially ) when he was working in the factory. Wonder how he thought I did that ?We realized that he doesn't really understand the time it takes to care for a home even though he was a single parent with custody of his 2 kids. He did a pick up and maybe a dust and run the vacuum a couple times a month. His daughter cleaned the bathroom and kitchen as she said she couldn't' stand it otherwise...she was 10. He never saw his mom clean the home , his mom said he was either in the fields or one of his grandmothers did it while he was in school since she worked outside the home. Never saw his ex clean their home. It threw him I knew that average amount of time it took me to keep this much space cleaned on a regular bases and how long it took to fall/spring clean. How much time it takes me to do the finances, do the meals etc. Processing food changes all the time. When it comes in, everything else is put on hold.But he realize I actually work over 40 hrs a week in maintaining the home. Add to that the energy audit, the punch list, and filling the pantry I am doing closer to 70 hrs plus and when I have to do the mowing because he hasn't done it add about 20 hrs to my work.I bit my tongue to keep from saying most single parents do that. It used to be most women and a lot of women still do when they work outside the home but I know a lot of men that are doing that now especially when they have kids.I did convince him that paying back one trailer a year with his paying hobby is really good and then after that is all back he can focus on paying off the truck. I told him to wait another year before he decided to make it a business , it will cost more to do but  he could do more hauling also... or stay with a hobby. He also knows he is going to have to focus on blocking time to do his work at home and if he does it as a business he will need to block time also.Amish have no issue when you say I can't do that due to work at home as they do it themselves.Since tomorrow is his birthday and I am taking him to Lock 16 over in Lima (where he orders steak always) he is going to pick up his hubcap he ordered for his truck last month since we will be right down the street so no extra $ spent on fuel to get it. He asked if I could write down what part of our routine is working and some thoughts on what to change to get things done and taken care of without the stress to talk about while driving over, during the meal and driving home.  I wanted to bang my head on the wall.. or better bang his head as I have done this several times and the monkey wrench has been him adding to MY work load.  AND I POINTED THAT OUT...I said I might as well be single and do everything myself.Can I do all the work on the lists and not put myself in the hospital doing so... YES if I plan it out and refuse to do anything he has promised to another without asking me if I can fill in if he can't do it.It will take longer to do.BUT that means I have to change MY routine to add that load to be done without his help.Is this a solution ... not to my way of thinking but I am so over stressing because it's not getting done, I see $$$ floating away that doesn't need to be and I am definitely tired of the constant \"I can't get to it because I told so and so I would do this\" even though it's on his work calendar he has other work to do and then I have to either ignore it needs done and is costing us money or go into crisis mode and deal with it.We are still trying to work on getting routines beyond getting up at 4-5 am and going to bed at 8 pm.MealsBreaded chicken tenders and steak fries. Pickles and pickled beets (Thursday)Spaghetti with meat balls and green beans (Friday)Leftover Spaghetti with meat balls with mushrooms, bell pepper and onion added and applesauce (Saturday)Spicy (not hot) cinnamon pork chops served in bed of apple butter with Brussels Sprouts roasted with apple and served with a basmatic vinegar, honey and dried cranberries dressing. (Sunday)Cube steak with gravy,mashed potatoes and breaded mushrooms (last in freezer, good thing as we really don't like the breading on them) (Monday_Pork cubes with pineapple and bell pepper served over rice and pot stickers (Tuesday)Six meals cooked and out of pantry. That's a big deal as we have \"snacked\" our way through most of the summer. ROUTINE NEEDED !!!!Hubby called our internet home phone provider and saved us $23.45 and kept the same services.Last night Hubby asked why the house was up to 75 and then dropped 20 min later to 72... my answer... you propped the door open for the dogs so you wouldn't have to get up and let them in . He got up and shut the door.Canning has been helping keep the house warm. I now have another 30 pints of applesauce and another batch of apple butter to make.Winter bedding being washed and dried on clothes line off and on this coming week.Hubby used leftover weed barrier from gardens to put under the stone under the steps to the deck. He has enough to put under the ramp when he starts working on it. We will have to widen the driveway as when he turns in with the trailer he ends up in the grass. That's next year's to do.The oil lamp is lit every morning and every evening.The furnace is turned on at 8 pm to 72 and then turned off at 6 am. The house drops to 62 but warms back up with the sun shining. Dark days it stays on the cool side.We still have not had to have the 1st propane fill of the heating season. Last year we were about half way through the tank.We figure I have 10 days to finish fall cleaning and caulking. Our frost is usually around the 15th, last year it was a freeze.I found another pair of tennis shoes in the winter shoe Rubbermaid. Since it still had tags on it I thought one of the granddaughters passed them to me. Not a style I have seen them wear but I don't care about the style of my tennis shoe that I wear around the house. But daughter 4 thinks it came from her younger son's grandma in his dad side as she wears the same size as me and she had gave Daughter 4 several pair of crocs and she thought a pair of tennis shoes. Daughter 4 kept the crocs as that size is too big for me in those shoes. I wear a 4 in children's crocs, and they were 6's in the crocs.Our HVAC guy came down to do a repair on insulation on a heater vent that his guys forgot to tape closed. While here he installed the whole house surge protector. BECAUSE he was coming down for a repair he did not charge us the $53 trip fee and took 10 % off of the installation fee since we gave him the information and where we bought it from as he has had 2 more customers ask for it.I canned 36 jelly jars of apple butter, froze 9 cups of corn and shelled 1 pint of popcorn.I told Hubby that the next 10 days is getting stuff done off the energy audit and fall cleaning. That he is on his own for bfast and lunch but I would try to have dinner on the table at 5. IF he isn't going to be home at that time he needs to let me know so I can eat and just make him a plate. Instead of me waiting until he gets home to fix something.I did more laundry and line dried. Told Hubby we are about to the time of using the drying rack over night.I hope to find another drying rack within my price point soon.I started the fall cleaning in the front room as I am also caulking baseboard and windows there also. I got half of the room done, was feeling a bit bad about not finishing until Hubby reminded me that most rooms at 12 ft by 12 ft and our front room is 24 ft by 24 ft. So it's the size of 2 rooms. I also replaced the window insulation seal that had went bad on 2 of the windows. Figure that the other 2 will need theirs replaced.There has been 2 fires, 1 a sawmill and another a calf barn in the past week. Last month a barn burnt down and a couple months before that a house did while the family was at Church. Amish community have already rebuilt the house and the barn. Yesterday Hubby said he stopped by the calf barn to see if they needed help and they were sending people down to the sawmill which was just 1/2 mile down the road because they had plenty of help. Today Hubby is hauling lumber in to the sawmill. No one has been hurt but the lectures of fire safety is going strong."},
{"title": " Monday Watching the fog roll in", "date": "Tuesday, October 1, 2019", "text": "after it's rained off and on during the night. Will be having a slow drying day for sure. Since the laundry room has been torn apart since last Saturday , I definitely need to do the laundry today and there is a lot of it.Since there is a small pond at the yard clothesline I will use the kitchen line and the drying rack for any thing that there is no room for. It took me 4 hrs to fall clean the laundry room and then do all the caulking in that room on Saturday. Only 12 more rooms to do.I ordered the King Arthur Flour items, used a discount, got free shipping and now have 4 more discounts. SO that is off the Oct goal listI ordered the Amazon order, using a couple credits I had and they had coupons. SO that is off the Oct goal list.I have one thing that was damaged that I will have to return.We have put the Christmas money aside and paid 4 bills. So far on budget...good thing to say on the 1st day of the new budget.Hubby put the steps on the south side of the deck so I can use the deck to go to the yard clothes line or the pump house. We decided to move it to the end of the deck towards the barn or it would have been right at the bathroom window. Hubby forgot to put the window in the drawing of of the house. 😏We shifted the deck 2 ft to the north as I didn't want to have to \"dodge\" the grill when I opened the one French door.Something else he didn't think of. It should work out nicer since that's the side of the ramp and now we can take it straight to the sidewalk that goes to the front of the house without putting any concrete at the sidewalk.We looked at ideas of the railing, decided on using the extra feed panels we have from the garden, 4x4 treated posts.... some 8 ft tall to come up from the ground so I can hang baskets and the hummingbird feeder from them.Maybe a shelf for eating at or sitting potted plants on. I told Hubby I would wait on the railing until he is done with the ramp and see what is left for me to use so we weren't buying something that we don't need.I canned 14 pints of applesauce on Saturday after doing the laundry room. M sent over 12 ears of corn late Saturday night. I think she was done canning for the weekend.That's added to the tomatoes I am working on this morning, the apple butter I have simmering right now and the rest of the apples.I have 1/3rd of the pantry inventoried. Would have been more but Hubby and I were talking about the condiments like mustard (not pickles or relish as I count them as veggies)and he felt I should inventory that also. I didn't because I will go without condiments.BUT since he asked if I would, I will.My youngest granddaughter gave me a pair of tennis shoes she wore for 1 month and then out grew them. She thinks she wore them twice. Daughter 4  told me to look in Nov as tennis shoes usually go on sale then.Since I have wore the same 2 pairs for over 8 yrs before wearing them out. I doubt if I will go buy another pair unless they are cheap but good quality ..SO off the Oct goal listI haven't been to the store. I think if I do go this week it will be for milk and depending on price, unsalted butter. I don't need anything else.Hubby mowed, he didn't get all the trimming done but hopes that is the last time he needs to mow. Said if he mows again it will be late Oct.The vehicle insurance dropped by 20 cents.TuesdayWe have been running the AC during the night (90 and muggy) so Hubby feels rested when he is driving. I never feel rested any more. I turned it off at 6:30 this morning and opened the widows and doors as it was a bit cooler than the house. No sense running it during the day even with 90 degrees as I put the canning outside to sit when it comes out of the canner. Counter space is lost to stuff I use daily since the furniture isn't back in the dining room to hold it... so far behind. HVAC guy is coming back next Monday to fix the stink pipe to the wheelchair bath shower as it showed on the energy audit it wasn't done correctly. We keep a cover over the drain so the dogs won't drop anything in it or catch a toenail like Wilbur did when he checked out the shower. He is also fixing the insulation on a pipe that was supposed to be taped and wasn't and installing the whole house  surge protector. Was glad we sent him what we bought and the installation manual as he had 2 other customers wanting one and he had them get what we got. My health ins is requesting proof I needed a test ran that was ordered by my GI. They did say since I went directly to the lab I cut 50 % off what the bill would have been. Still I would think when a stool test is ordered by a GI I shouldn't have to justify it. BUT it is a $700 bill after the 50% so I will spend today getting that dealt with.I shelled some popcorn. Now have almost 2 pints. Still have some ears in the garden to pick. Hubby looking at dealing with the garden this afternoon. He went to help an elderly Amish whose kids went to Michigan to live and he wanted to clean out his barn and storage shed. I will get canning supplies and Hubby will get some tools in exchange for the help. I canned 14 qrts of tomato juice yesterday and probably have about the same for today. Dishwasher is running from last night's dishes and a few of that I used canning. It ran last night but wasn't enough room to add more and I have the counter already full with the rest of the canning stuff. Was just too tired to dry the dishes LOL.We decided to wait on seeing the parents until mother in law's beets she wanted came in this week. One trip to do all of it.Back to work for me...Blessed Be"},
{"title": "October goals", "date": "Wednesday, September 25, 2019", "text": "MY LISTTake Hubby to Lock 16 steak house in Lima for his 61st birthday.Start the new budget and not have to rob Peter to pay Paul.Have the money saved for Christmas.Place order to King Arthur Flour for specialty items we are low on.Place order to Amazon for kitchen pans needing replaced.To have pantry fully stocked.To have pantry inventoried to base menu on how much is there ..First note I do not start eating mainly from the pantry until Nov 1st. Just a habit from childhood most likely. Hubby's mom said that is how she did also when raising the kids.Example I have 80 pints of pickled beets, that's at least 1 per week or 1 every 4 days (yes I can eat that much). I have 150 slices of green tomatoes for fried green tomatoes. We eat 8 slices per meal , that's 18 meals. So I can serve it every other week for 9 months or every week for 4 1/2 months. I have 10 cups of corn in freezer that is 10 meals, that's 5 months...(I have corn to process still to add to this). I want these amounts so I can use them up instead of buying something else at the store.I want to have the bedroom winter curtains done.I want to have to railing to the deck done. Which means I have to decide how I want it done. I know I want 4x4 posts... I just keep thinking about what I want between the posts as the deck is 3 ft off the ground and I don't want Wilbur and Rascal jumping off and getting hurt. Charlotte is still young enough to handle that jump... she jumps 5 ft high sideways as it is.I think she has springs instead of  legs, must be the terrier part in her.I want 80 % of the energy audit items completed... and that is on me as Hubby can't caulk worth crap and of course there is tons of caulking to do. LOL.I want to wash the winter clothes and get them in drawers etcI want to get the summer clothes in storage.I need new tennis shoes, not want but actually need.I want to build a closet in the laundry room.I want to have summer curtains down, washed, dried and storedI want to have winter curtains washed, dried and hungI want to decorate for the fall.I want to complete 15 things on the punch list.I would like to make some homemade preserved lemons, roasted red bell peppers and balsamic reduction to add to the pantry.HUBBY'S LIST Take scrap metal, old appliances and old trailer to junk yard which should pay for his tags for the bike and the one trailer.Last mowing/trimmingGarden downAll vehicles including tractor,mowers etc ready for winterAll air barriers listed in energy audit done or at least started (can't be in attics until it cools down) but the bottoms of porches can be done now.Sept goals done:4 rooms repainted but still need put back together LOLdeck (Hubby's part) will be done by this weekendtractor mower fixedtruck maintenance donegreen beans donecucumbers donebeets donebutternut, acorn sq,spag sq.,  pie pumpkins and jack be little pumpkins rinsed in bleach water to store until late winter when if not cooked by then I will cook and freeze. Butternut and acorn do not need to be cooked to be frozen.green tomatoes (wasn't on Sept goals) doneI have cabbage in the garden, apples, corn and tomatoes waiting for me to get home and do this weekend.Cabbage will be last since they are holding well in the garden.We still are sitting at 45% on propane so not needing winter fill YET. First. Charlotte has a clean bill of healthSecond Wilbur had a light stroke that only affected the left side on his mouth a little... which means I now sit with a towel on my lap as I know he is going to wipe his drool on me. I also wipe his mouth after he eats or drinks or that slime gets every where. IT seems to be getting a bit better.Third, Rascal... yes has a tumor, BUT with where it is Vet could not tell 100 % if it was a fatty tumor. Asked me to monitor it as he would like it to be removed like in Nov when Rascal isn't likely to be out running around as much. Said to really watch how he pees as that will show faster if it is growing that the lump it's self. He had a hard time finding it but I didn't have any problem finding it even with Rascal sucked his tummy in .MY OWN blood work came in good...don't need to take potassium pill or B vit  etc. I will have to take Crestor 3 times a week as my cholesterol is 250. Good cholesterol is maxed out (LOL) but both my parents have/had numbers over 200. Hubby's was good. I will have to take my vit D during the late fall to spring. After my bone test in Nov we will decide if I need to go back on meds for that.4 weeks ago I had no beets, not many was going to have beets. B is a dear sweet young lady planted beets last month so I could have some. They ran over both her and me in the last 3 days.  I now have canned 80 pints of pickled beets and she was still canning when Hubby stopped over to deliver a message to A. Told Hubby she has more coming in late Sept/early Oct and he told her good as his mom was looking for 25 lbs of beets and we have another friend that might also be looking for beets.I also canned 16 pints bread and butter pickles 32 pints dill pickles, 8-12 oz of bread and butter pickle relish, 8-12 oz dill pickle relish,9-8 oz jars of turmeric banana peppers and 8 jars of apples slices. I simmered the skins and cores to cook down later for apple butter since I have 3/4 bushel to cook yet. I have onions for onion marmalade and pickled onions yet to do.I have to wipe all the squash down with bleach.Pie pumpkins and butternut squash are in. I got acorn squash, jack be little pumpkins, spag squash and a couple green tomatoes at Hurley farm. I also got a dozen ears of corn to eat this week, Hubby got fresh cider.Hubby was making a delivery and was told tonight that we have 125 lbs of tomatoes coming tomorrow from N... M told me today that while she is gone this coming week to harvest what ever tomatoes ripen. Hubby's mom then called a few minutes ago looking to tomatoes. She needs enough to make 14 qrts of juice. I think we can cover it LOL.Hubby has gotten \"blown up\" with calls of everyone and their brother looking for a ride (like 1:30 in the morning when the Amish family south of us driver didn't show up to take them to the train station,Hubby almost took them but they found someone already heading that way and was within 5 min of being able to pick them up), 3-4 English wanting to know if he was going to be over to the eastern side of the state (Holmes Co  was one) as they wanted stuff to be picked up and the a couple \"can you haul\" calls. He finally just started saying I am booked you need to call someone else.... He now has 3 that changed when they needed him TO WHEN he can do it. Produce will be slowing down with mid-Oct being the end of the harvest so that is 2 jobs that won't be there. At this point I think Hubby doesn't mind as since the truck was in the shop 2 days he was able to get some work done on the deck and he is making a list of things to do this fall and winter. He even was called while we were at Menards and the Amish guy had been at the house and the truck wasn't there so he used the Amish neighbor cell phone that is kept in the barn to call and find out where Hubby was as he was looking for someone to remove wood to go to another Amish BEFORE he had church this coming Sunday.  The guy laughed when Hubby said I am with my WIFE running errands... told Hubby that was okay  still laughing. When Hubby hung up all I could say was GEEZE while we both laughed.On Sunday I cleared and prepped laundry room (after I did Monday laundry)for the painters and then cleared the other 3 rooms. Was told it would take them 4-7 days to paint all 4 rooms. Wished I had the two show up when we first painted the house as the ones that came Monday as they did all four rooms in FIVE hours.They said first we cleared, and prepped the one room but also Sherwin Williams provided the top paint they had so 1 coat  was all that was needed. They usually have to have things moved etc before they can even set up.I haven't used Sherwin Williams due to price but after seeing this paint and how it went on I will suck it up and pay for the top paint, even their flat in this top is washable. Not only did it cover nice, it dried to touch in 1 hr and the fumes was very little with the house closed up and the AC running. We figured I would have to leave due to fumes as it triggers my asthma NO PROBLEM !!!!.Now I can do the fall cleaning, caulking and outlet/switch insulators starting Friday since I am cat sitting and paper work at Son 2. ON TOP OF PRODUCE.An Amish family this morning met him at another's house and brought tomatoes and canning (yellow) corn for us as they couldn't use it and knew we would take anything. If we don't want it, we pass it to who does.  BUT I can use the corn. Right now we have 10 cups of corn in the freezer.I put 150 slices of green tomato in the freezer that I floured for fried green tomatoes. Not bad since I have no broccoli or cauliflower in the freezer.I also put in 2 loaves of bread sliced so we can get a few slices and not end up throwing away bread. I froze raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I did this yesterday before coming to cat sit.When running errands Hubby decided to get some staples he wanted stocked in the pantry that I normally don't get much of.We did very well staying on budget until we walked passed the bulk candy and it was about half price.... sigh. Still he was paying for it and even though I said \"we don't need that\" we got it. BUT we decided to put it in the frig in the basement and just take a few of each in the snack drawer in the kitchen frig. For what ever reason if it's in the basement, he thinks 2-3-maybe even 4 times before going down after it where I go to the basement for our meals usually daily. I am not taking his candy up for him.Hubby said he has been blown up this morning with work and turned it all down as he trying to get \"his\" section of the deck done so I can do \"my\" section which is railing. He has a 3 hr job tonight and a 3 hr job on Friday morning. He might have a job on Saturday... an auction of building supplies.. which he was being iffy about going to himself because of it being out of state, he wouldn't mind being paid to go to it LOL.  His next week is full already.  One job is about to go away beginning of Oct. Two of the drivers that had been off work (both medical) are back which will help Hubby as he won't have so many calling for help. He hates telling someone no when he knows it's causing them a problem.I am going to sit down and figure out where we are with the punch list, check to see where we are at with our goals , house and finance and figure out a better system of the pantry.Have a great dayBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Busy week...", "date": "Monday, September 16, 2019", "text": "Monday morningHubby has been working an hour or two on the deck off and on all week. Yesterday he started laying the actual decking.He laid some across at the French doors so if I had to go out that way, the dogs have something to walk on until they get to the edge. Which I would have to lift Wilbur and Rascal down as it's 3 ft off the ground and they can't jump that.Contractors start painting next Monday so this week is take things off walls, move furniture, wipe down walls so they are painting a clean wall. If I have time I will sand 220 grit as that was part of the problem is the paint used needs to be lightly sanded between coats and they didn't do that. I don't think the staff that sold them the paint really knew what they should have.Hubby lit the oil lamp this morning for the dining table for our morning coffee.Leftovers for dinner tonight.I down loaded statements from our ins. My primary keeps telling me that I have a deductible and my deductible and out of pocket is paid in full. Hubby's isn't.Hubby is on his way to an auction. There was some things he wanted to look at and a couple of the Amish wanted to go also they are splitting the cost between them  of him driving even though he was going anyways. Nice as that cost isn't coming out of our pocket.Rascal was acting sickly this morning so I checked him out... he has a lump...sigh ... probably cancer, we have lost a few to cancer, lump in same area. Will take him to vet later this week as they charge more for appts than walk ins.. He is only 7 but is acting like his is closer to 10.I might get a pup when we lose him.Charlotte is only 2 and Wilbur is 8 and he can't play so much with her as he has hip and leg injuries. She gets in trouble when she doesn't have anyone to play with. Son 2 got promoted to E6 military side and will be changing drill units (he is in reserves) but will stay in state and go over to Whitehall in Columbus instead of Chicago like they first told him. Means I won't have to go cat sit when he has drill weekend.Laundry is rolling and will be hung on the line.zucchini ready to be shredded for freezer.Cucumbers next to be turned into relish and canned today.Beets to be cooked, pickled and canned will be today. Might have to finish them tomorrow as there is 40 lbs.I will start clearing the dining room and part of the kitchen since it's an open area.I will check garden to see if there is anything besides the cabbage which for what ever reason is growing decent.TuesdayHubby will haul produce to auction for S .. S is paying us with pie pumpkins and butternut squash.I scheduled chiro appt before primary doc appt so we are only making 1 trip. Will also slide a stop at the store as I am almost out of milk.I will finish beets if I don't get them done today along with clearing the dining room and wipe down walls if not finished also.WednesdayHubby has to take his truck to get serviced.He will remove boards off basement ramp  so we can pull old frig outHe will make a block for staircase that goes from hall to basement so dogs and be in basement but not get upstairs while painters are here.I have apples to make applesauce and apple butterI have peach juice in freezer for syrup and jellyI have pie pumpkins  and butternut squash to deal with.I have onions for onion marmalade and pickled onions to can.I will clear the mudroom, wipe down walls for painting.ThursdayTake Rascal to vet.finish any canningclear area in basement for grow light cart and for frig that was in kitchen that has been sitting in front room (kind of nice to not go to basement for produce that needs canned) that will also go to basement.I will start clearing front room.I will start prepping meals for next week. I am thinking calzones, pot pies and lasagna, maybe a roast. The lasagna and roast would make 2 meals so that's 6 meals to get us through the week. I think I have everything in the freezers to make it except the cheese for the lasagna. That would save the $68 Hubby was going to spend on meals.Friday Hubby produce auctionfinish clearing front room and wiping down wallsfinish prepping next weeks' mealsSaturday do laundryClear laundry roomSundayMove washer and dryer and wipe down walls of laundry room.prep bfast and lunch for tomorrow, thaw tomorrow's dinnerMondaymove dog food and water to basement. They have water bucket out sideI will be cleaning the basement and working outside the whole week while the painters are here except for the overnight stay at Son 2's to cat sit while he is out of town. He has a class pop up since he was promoted. I will take my fabric for my winter curtains for my bedroom that I didn't do while at his house the last time. He said he now calls his dining room \"Mom's sewing room\"What are you doing this week?"},
{"title": "lowering the budget to match Social Security income", "date": "Friday, September 13, 2019", "text": "In a year Hubby will be 62... we have debated on whether to take social security or waitWhy are we looking at it now?First he decided to not go to ODOT for the winter. If they could have promised him 3rd shift I think he would have but they couldn't.Second , the RRA his company put aside for him that pays our health ins runs out next Oct. That's $1200 a month that will have to come out of our pocket. His social security would cover the mortgage (which is more than the health ins) freeing that money to pay the health ins. BUT not sure that is the answer at this point.Third,  a friend suggested we leave the annual payments in the IRA until they are due and then  month before pull that extra amt. Our finance guy suggested  put half in a savings acct we already have that pays more in interest than our regular bank and leave the big ones like propane in the IRA.SO We decided to live on the \"budget\" of social security and see if we could do it and how much we would still have to pull from IRA... looking at what he earned hauling in a year (that will be late April minus costs as it's a paying hobby not a business but still we do all of it) and what we can pull on top of SS and earnings and not take the hit on taxesSO digging through the budget1/1/2019 the budget was set at $8794 based on 2018 (2 homes for 6 months)8/1/2019 the budget came in at $6123 (even after 100 degree days)9/10/2019 the budget hit $7695. I paid off some extras that incurred while doing this home and moving just to get them out of my hair and not incur interest.Last night 9/12/2019 we set the budget at $5883... we would have to pay the mortgage and truck from IRA at the budget. Social security would cover the rest.That really limits us in some areas that I am not sure we can go as low as we set it.What it affects?I will not be putting in a garden next year as it would cost us $2500 to finish bringing up the soil at this point to have it ready for next year. Hubby talked to 3 of the ones that send produce to Produce auction and they are willing to sell us what I am looking for in the amounts I want based on what the going price at auction was. AND they are basing it on Tuesday auction where they actually get more money at Friday auction. They judged we would be spending close to $400 including canning lids according to the one that actually just set up her youngest and new hubby as they didn't have a garden this year.One heard I was looking for beets last month so she planted extra to come in later this month. I will buy soil for my grow bags to grow a few things I want. I can get the soil at the end of Sept/ Oct when the stores are clearing those items.I will buy frozen yellow corn, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, peas and peas with carrots during Kroger's 10 for 10 sales.I will get my acorn squash from the place I usually get my squash. The rest was grown by Amish so I don't need anything else. I only got pie pumpkins this year and no regular pumpkins.Son 2 is military. He is going to check out his commissary to see if they carry things that I normally buy at Sam's club and if which is the better price.Right now I save more that my prime membership at Amazon costs me.It's going to be an interesting year."},
{"title": "choosing to be frugal", "date": "Tuesday, September 10, 2019", "text": "Sometimes it's a habit... like washing out freezer bags that didn't have meat or grease in them and reusing them. Washing foil also. Mixing dish soap with water... any soap with water. Bar soap scraps go with water.Making my own laundry soap, using vinegar for the rinse.Using the clothes line or drying rack over the dryer. Washing in cold water short cycle if not real dirty.It's combining loads to make a full load..There are lots of things we all do automatically... but what about the other things?Hubby and I was talking about trash bags. We know our Amish neighbors have MAYBE 1 every couple months... ONE and that is usually broken glass or something they can't reuse or have used it to the point it can't be used AKA cool whip containers that have cracked.I asked M how they do that... first we are in a burn barrel community. M doesn't have one, they keep anything that can burn to use in their stoves or for E to burn to heat water to make milk for calves he raises for cash crop.They don't have magazines or newspapers. They get a couple \"news\" things that are for Amish etc that they use for lighting fires. Envelopes are turned inside out and reused for mailing letters to family and friends. Any paper that can be used for notes is done so. She cans 90 % of her food. Flours, etc either are in paper (burned) or cloth depending on where she gets it. Plastic like cool whip are used for storage, some will use them for carrying food. They use thermos for lunch boxes and cloth bags or butcher paper for sandwiches. They have dishes for \"left overs\".Milk is put in glass jars.She uses disposable pans for when she bakes for neighbors but that is the only time. She uses rags not paper towels, cloth napkins not paper napkins, and rags for cleaning  not paper towels or wipes.Then she added \"they respect their resources\". They don't change styles of clothes,nor do the change what they wear according to season except the men go from straw hat to leather hat. Men might wear a white shirt more often when in the fields but it's not something just for the warm season. When clothes are out grown they are reused either for someone smaller or taken apart and made into something else. OR even into rugs and rags. Even the grocery store plastic bags are made into rugs. They are not tossed in trash or burned.Then she mentioned men cleaning their tools and putting them away Her cleaning the home daily and then from top to bottom on Saturday, cleaning her tools she uses to clean and putting things away. If you take care of what you have it will last longer and that is respecting the resources. She talked about not running water down the drain when brushing teeth, showering, rinsing dishes,etc. Reusing gray water to water the gardens. Being very careful about what type of cleaners she uses (vinegar and soap is her main cleaners) They don't have a lamp (she uses kerosene her mother in law uses oil) on in every room when it's dark. The family gathers in ONE room and they use 1-2 lamps. She does her sewing and mending in front of a window that the sun is coming it.She really tries to not have leftovers (they have a spring house that holds at 36 Degrees year around) as she feels that's an easy way to start wasting. Something I need to focus on. When she is baking she starts with breads as they take the highest heat then pies cakes and cookies, some time custard. She bakes 4-6 loaves at a time DAILY except Sunday. Saturday baking is HUGE. 18 to 24 loaves of bread, 3 cakes , 6 pies  and a couple custards as she won't be baking until Monday.IT takes 4 chickens to feed her family ONE meal. She might have a little leftover to go into noodles or a dressing.I must have looked over whelmed as she patted my shoulder and told me \"yes we get tired but it has to be done. Winter is easier and more time for rest. ROUTINE is the only way to get it done but at first it has to be a constant reminder to do it. She follows the routine she was raised with and there are a few times her mother in law mentioned she did it differently to make things easier. Mother in law raised 6 , M is the 13th child on her parents.Her oldest girl in back in school and the 6 yr old (they start school at 7 yrs old) is now having to \"watch\" the littles, get the eggs, help mom with laundry and the daily cleaning. I can tell you the 6 yr old is happy to be helping, no whining about having chores and not having to be told to do her chores. She even went out to bring the milk cow up so her mom could milk... regretfully the cow didn't want to go and got away from her because she wasn't tall enough to get a hold of the halter when she turned away. BUT SHE TRIED because she knew her older sister used to do that before she went back to school so she thought she could. She is now watching baby A while Mom does that and she feels good because it helps Mom and she is now responsible for making sure the pup doesn't follow the rest to school as Hubby had to go get the pup down the road because the kids couldn't get it to go home and they didn't want to turn on out the other road, pup definitely would have gotten killed on that road.Looking at my home, there is WAY TOO MUCH. Hard to clean, hard to know where something is or if I need to buy it, or worse , know I have it and can't find it and have to buy it wasting money and time to go get it. Too much paper comes in so I am canceling magazines I don't read or can get on line. There is NO routine in our lives except Sunday being the day of rest.Something for me to focus on... routines and getting rid of the extra.WHICH now is a good time with the contractor coming in to paint the four rooms the 23rd and Son 2 is going to paint his hall after that so I chose to get the same paint he is getting for a room we will paint( not contractors) so if I have extra he can have it.Thoughts of changes ... respecting our resources"},
{"title": "TEST RESULTS IN", "date": "Monday, September 9, 2019", "text": "GI cracked joke that since everything was NEGATIVE... my crap must be worthless.... AND SHE IS SO THANKFUL...Definitely agreed that my thoughts it was the diverticulitis meds and too low of residue diet was the issue. For me to do what I feel is good for me with my diet and slowly increase the residue. It's now noted in my record that med can cause me sever diarrhea and mess up my Crohn's. The GI I am being transferred to, sent me the message that once again I was correct and he is willing to LISTEN to how I feel about things.Going to go take a nap since I had a \"big\" day yesterday of 10 hrs between drive time and family reunion... it was a bit much."},
{"title": "Okay, I am going to just bang my head", "date": "Saturday, September 7, 2019", "text": "WED.On the frugal side. I have green beans and cucumbers in the front room waiting to be canned as Hubby bartered hauling hay for the veggies with butternut and beets to come later. He also got a deal on tomatoes in about 2-4 wks when N closes up his hoop house, we will help clean it and get at least half off or more for helping on the 100 lbs I ordered from him. He might have some beets also. HIS wife said her sister might have more beets in a couple weeks and to check with her, sister's neighbor sent message to also check with her also. Friend is going to try to get some extra apples for us. I have a bushel of apples I got half price. The orchard we used to go to sold and the new owner asked if I would help pick some for the bushel to be half price. Their picker didn't show up. If I felt better I would have taken the job as it's not that hard, trees are not that tall and it's just when and what ever seasonal. I got beets, onions (for sauce, beets and pickled onions) and butternut , a few small zucchini and a couple green tomatoes from another market marked down as it was the last they had at the farmer's marketI am still looking for decent price on apricot jam for cake coating.We got a handicap helper for the toilet when Hubby's parents are here.It can be used as a walker if needed, just need to raise it up higher.I cleaned and filled the oil lamps. Hubby found out that some of the Amish use mineral oil/spirits to burn in oil lamps for the same reason I do ( I prefer unscented due to allergies) so he is going to ask E's Dad where to get some and how much since I already priced what it would take to get us through the season. Five gallons each yr not counting what ever candles I burn.We sat down and reworked out  the routines. I now put Hubby's work here at home on his work schedule so he doesn't over book. E came over with his horses and hay mower and cut around the pond so Hubby didn't have to do it by hand . Said it was because they hadn't sent eggs over for about a month, chickens are starting to lay again. He is also going to cut the ferns down on the asparagus when he cuts his down.  While here he asked Hubby if he could help him with a couple jobs next month so that's on our calendar. E is going to help a couple evenings on the deck after he gets home from helping his brother in law.Hubby has one area left on the house to use Great stuff on the foundation. Will still put insulation board there during the winter. He found 2 air vents ,to crawl space, that go right by the heat vent to the dining room and front room. The vents are not insulted them selves. SO those are on the list for next summer.GROSS ALERT... BANGING MY HEADSaw my GI, she thinks they misdiagnosed the diverticulitis( she thinks parasite or virus) so ordered stool testing since I still have diarrhea (I always do have it for a couple months after the med they gave me but she said STILL)... to keep me IN NETWORK I had to go to a lab instead of the hospital. I picked up the \"hat\" for the toilet and the test bottles. I can tell you after having a tube down my throat due to crap come up the wrong way that spooning diarrhea in a test bottle is GROSSER. Along with Zofran dissoluble  taste worse than that crap. SO after 145 mile round trip twice for this freaking test I am waiting for the results (looking for virus or parasite) which should be in a day or two but I expect a week as I know this lab.. 2 days LOST to being on the road etc and definitely no energy what so ever as I sat down on the kitchen  stool today after getting home and fell asleep and landed on Wilbur when I fell off the stool. Neither of us hurt but the 3 dogs and I just went to bed and slept 4 hrs. IF there is nothing in the results then she thinks, meds ( like I said )along with too low of a low residue diet. IF there is something then another 145 mile round trip and possible hospital for IV. She listened to my stomach and had tears on her checks and kept saying your poor lady, you poor lady and then really broke down balling when I said it wasn't as rough as the weekend before. I really hate it when a doctor cries on me especially when I was feeling decent. She was so upset that she forgot to tell me that she was leaving the practice (she just got divorced and the time she was working was part of the issue and now she's a single parent of 2 teens so the time element is now a real issue). I got transferred to the doctor that prescribed my biologic (GOOD FOR ME) and the PA I always asked for but seldom get is now listed as my PA. I listed a second PA as the young lady has stood up to 2 GI as the hospital on my behalf to get things settle for me and she is usually the PA that does the rounds in the hospital.Meantime... I can't eat more than 1/2 cup at a time or I get nauseated or sick, cramp up or what ever. I have blood work Saturday morning  ordered by my primary as his comment was I looked like a zombie walking around and decided to check Hubby's blood work also. The only day off this week for Hubby is Saturday.It's hard to sleep any when ever time you turn around you are running for the bathroom.THURS.I finally slept all night (except when daughter 4 text me at 4 that she had popped her knee out of place at work) even went back to sleep after reading it. Not that I can do anything when I am 2 hrs away  and she's already headed home from ER and going to bed so she can go to work tonight.I even ate 1 whole cup of mac and cheese and had no problems HAPPY DANCE.No results in , doctor called lab as it's usually within 24 hrs. The one test they have to send out and it wasn't back yet and warned it might be a week before it's in....WHICH IS NORMALI canned 16 pints regular green beans, 16 pints French style green beans, froze a quart of green beans and canned 8 pints of dill green beans. Might not like dill green beans , never tried them but I figured if nothing else they would be close enough I could use them for 3 bean salad that we have at least every other week during the year.We ate leftovers for dinner.Hubby called our internet and home phone provider because it went up in price. They offered to lower it less than what it started, we kept the home phone and they made the price permanent. We wonder how long is permanent but we took the deal.Had a little nagging session with Hubby as he OVER BOOKED this week and didn't get finish the foundation with Great stuff. We will have to go either very early Sat or mid morning Sat for blood work FASTING BLOOD work to top it off because he OFFERED to go get concrete for one of the guys whose driver had a  heart attack. I am fine with helping someone but we have FASTING BLOOD WORK that has to be done GEEZE.FRIDAYup at 6 am wide awake, feeling decent. By 7:30 I had 16 pints of regular green beans in the canner, another quart in the freezer and 8 pints (last of green beans) prepped to make dill green beans. This batch I am putting a grape leaf in.Cucumbers are after lunchRested after lunch...Moved what was in canner to mudroom counter to finish cooling 24 hrs.Did 8 pints of bread and butter pickles with grape leaf.Wiped down the jars I did yesterday and took to basement and put in correct areas.Brought up more jars.I might get another load of pickles done but I doubt it as I am dragging now and probably over did it.Picked 2 poblano peppers and 1 very small ear of Japanese hullless popcorn. The  bugs are eating what little squash grew...M's Guiana hens are eating the bugs...They still don't have my test results back so NO biologic this weekend.My doctor is flipping but the one that is going to take over as my doctor told me to eat as I felt up to, rest a lot and stay calm, if I feel like Crohn's is starting up, take the biologic and if I have other issues I will be in the hospital with iv... I can handle that.Hubby said he would update me about tomorrow's schedule when he gets home. I called doctor and asked for last day we could take blood work... it's Wed. AND that's the day we have to take dogs for check up and Rascal needs rabies shot so that might work even better.Freaking tired... just freaking tired.SATURDAYbefore bed last night M sent over 1 gal of green beans and several small heads of lettuce ...I dealt with green beans this morning with my 1st cup of coffee. at 6 am  They went in freezer. Dishwasher unloaded that I hadn't done yesterday. Reloaded and ran. Rest of dishes hand washed.Got family reunion stuff around to load tonight as we leave early in the morning since its' 2 hrs away.Drinking my 2nd cup of coffee 4 hrs after  I normally do waiting for this last load of laundry so I can get it on the line, then check the tablecloths for the reunion and pull the crock pot that the mashed potatoes will go in. Hubby got the water and pop and is going to wipe down coolers when he gets back. Didn't think I should mess too much with them as they were in barn near old insulation he had found.THEN I have to rest for 30 mins. so I don't over do it like I done a couple times.THEN wipe down yesterday's canning and put it in pantry.I am not sure if I am going to do any canning today. The kitchen and dining room is a wreck and I don't want to start Monday dealing with it or try to do it after 4-5 hrs on the road along with 5 hr family reunion tomorrow.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Sept goals ", "date": "Sunday, September 1, 2019", "text": "First house goals..One year today we woke up for the first time in our new home... Still a work in process but love it dearly.we want to have the 4 rooms repainted and out of our hair and I can tell you our contractor feels the same.Hubby wants to finish the deck , get the tractor mower fixed and his truck maintenance done. (Tractor mower fixed Saturday night, truck schedule for 18th at dealership (under warranty) )After talking to another contractor about the energy audit issues that  he specializes in insulating he gave us this advice. Great stuff outside foundations and  roll insulation work since not in attics and the insulation board of doors of pump house and attics during Sept. Outside caulking with silicone paintable caulking, Flex seal late Sept/Oct. Air barrier work Oct to mid Nov.INSIDE caulking AFTER CHRISTMAS as that's when the inside is the driest so the gaps will be their biggest and use silicone paintable caulking.. It actually made sense.Broke this down on to post it notes and taped each section to correct month on calendar. Listed what was needed from Hubby on his work calendar so he didn't over schedule work and not get this stuff done (silent nagging)I want to have the 4 deep freezers defrosted and organized by end of Oct. Put on my new wrote out routines to do one a week or every other week. E asked if we wanted to barter, he cash rents 3 acres from us...would we take meat instead of cash... YES. BUT that means I have to have room. He came over and looked at the freezers and told me more than the small deep freezer maybe 1/3 of the bigger ones.I would like to have green beans, beets, tomatoes,cucumbers and apples ...maybe some yellow corn in the pantry. Hubby is going over to produce auction today to see if there is anything he can pick up. I NEED apples as applesauce/apple butter are daily on the table during winter. I have 2 jars of apple butter. Our one apple tree was stripped by coons. The other will probably take a hit next. E lost 3 acres of corn to coons and deer.UPDATE. Amish guy took an order of cucumbers, green beans and beets for us. Will do what he can to find and get the amounts we are looking for.  Green beans and possible cucumbers on Tuesday. Got a few candy onions from A and B.  I will use stock up funds for these N has tomatoes and his wife E said to stop over and mid week and see when we can pick them up, she might have a few beets after she cans for the \"church\" day as her family doesn't eat beets. Payment out of stock up fund The old orchard we used to go to has apples coming on so I will stop there to see if what I need for chunky applesauce and apple butter is available. Payment out of stock up fundEven with my health issues right now this makes me very happy.Mother in law can come help can if Hubby can't help me.Might have her come over anyways to get her out of the house. Had to order handicap toilet stand for her to be able to get up off toilet. Father in law has the same issues.... at least this way it will be here when I get to that stage so not waste of money since they don't visit anyone much now days.UPDATE LOL... I have a few beets and a couple lines of where more will probably be in 2-4 wks.Hubby wants to have the deck on and the garden wrapped up and fertilized/composted by end of Sept ...we have a few tomato plants that are producing and I need to pull the cabbage and make freezer slaw.But he could actually do the north garden before the south garden as it's pretty much dead.FinancialCredit cards get paid in full every month. I have Amazon on a credit card so if it's hacked I have better chance of getting my money back where with a debit card connected to the checking isn't as good let alone they can wipe out the money for our bills.Hubby uses a credit card for fuel due to skimmers for the same reason.We have $260,177.05 mortgage and will be paying 1 extra payment a year as we will be 90 when it's paid off otherwise.We have $48,275.68 left on truck (7 yr loan)... Hubby's hobby of hauling (doesn't make enough to be a business as he is just even breaking even but gives him purpose and is needed in this community) is being paid by his hobby along with paying maintenance and tags etc on trailers and truck.So at least none of this is coming out of our budget. Might a bit during slow season of hauling.We have $10,454.50 loan (taken in 2008 crisis) on Hubby's life ins. We will pay the $91/ month interest so he won't lose anymore of his life ins.We have $6, 093.65 loan (taken in 2008 crisis) on my life ins. We will pay the $75/month interest.We  are short $13,600 in medical funds to get us to 65.We have $3,537.11 in credit for propane (doing things on energy audit should make this last longer than the 12 month I ordered  I set is $275 to savings to pay for next year's)We have 2/3 of one month out flow in our checking combined together... we would like this to be at least equal to 1 month AFTER all bills are paidWe have 1/4th of one month out flow in savings accts joined together we would like this to be at least equal to 1 month AFTER all bills are paid.We have equal to one month out flow with our credit cards since they are paid off before due ALWAYS.GOAL this coming year is to get the checking and saving up to equal a total of 2 months and get the medical savings up closer to where it needs to be... I figured we are $22000 short of where we wanted to be at this time... Hubby got a really strange look on his face when I told him that figure... then told me that was the last 2 trailers that he hasn't made enough to \"pay\" back to our savings... okay, so it's not been frivolously wasted, he is making some money as a hobby. And we just have to be focused on him making \"payments\" as possible (because there is no rhyme or reason for whether he is hauling or not) and truck payment, maintenance and tags etc come first.  We have been told that slow times are winter...late Oct to March. Might get a load here or there of lumber/pallets/ or taking someone to doc appts. March it starts cranking up with plants and produce to the produce auction. SO we know the \"extra\" won't be there during those times. Hubby thought about working ODOT again, I really wished he wouldn't. We have things that need done that takes 2 of us to do during the slow times but I left it to him to decide. Another summer of NOT having the deck on and he is kicking his own butt because he just\" sat\" on days he didn't have anything to haul. Told me I was lousy at nagging LOLDaughter 4 messed up her finances, didn't pay some bills in full that came due or shut off, paid them wiping out savings and forgot to make her car payment so lost her car. Can't find a car to borrow (no we can not go 2 months without our car and she lives almost 2 hrs away so I can't take her to work) and is short of making the car payment up as they want 3 months total to give the car back (she doesn't blame anyone but herself). Did find a place to get a car, know what her temp tags would be (her birthday is next month so going that route for cheaper to give her time to get tag $$ up) and the down payment and I asked if that included tax and title, she thought yes but is checking to make sure. She is having her daughter senior in high school, sit down weekly with her to read bills and stay on budget. Also helps daughter to learn how to run finances of her own place which most likely will happen next summer when she turns 18.UPDATE NO it did not include tax and title, she just got a promotion at work that will put her in middle management and was looking at losing that job with benefits because SHE DIDN'T READ HER WHOLE BILL as it's in her email on her phone and would have to down load pdf. She read current usage and paid that amount not total bill which included part of the bill where she was on some plan that let her make a minimum and then the rest at beginning of heating season.SO she is on the budget for heat and electric and her daughter to now monitoring the bills and budget. We lent her the difference between what she had and what she needed. Her daughter is redoing the budget to reflect a payment monthly to us and will send us what to expect and when next week as she knows her mom's (daughter 4) car ins will go up as this is a newer car....UPDATE... her ins WENT DOWN. with newer car, full coverage and her teen daughter on it. WOW.. she got ProgressiveWe went to store, formula for M as she forgot to put it on the list when E went as she was focused on stuff for church tomorrow.I got 1/2 gal milk saving 20 centsI got chip dip saving 30 cents (found new recipe to try for onion chip dip)I got 2 butters saving 60 centsI got cottage cheese saving 38 centsI got 2 lunch meats saving $3.50 (all most 1 free)I got 2 breaded shrimp saving $8.50 for buy one get oneI got chicken breast (frozen 3 lbs) saving $19.50 (one free and savings on 2nd)I got 2 bacon saving $3I got 1 pork butt on sale saving $5 off price and another $2 with buy $10 get $2 off in meat dept.I got 2 packages of  hamburger *73 fat* paying $1.59/lb instead of $2.99. lbs saving a total $8.40SO I spent the last $20 for this month and half of next month grocery budget.Told Hubby we might need produce or dairy at end of Sept but that would be it... That's about $60 if I buy it at Kroger's. Save a lot is cheaper and he can pick it up when he is getting fuel for the truck around the corner.Hubby also was told today that the one place he hauls from stays constant until Tday week and Christmas and then goes well until Englisher summer shut down at July 4th. So that's a good solid route for 1 day every 10 days.  Guy just signed the contract and thought he best let Hubby know so Hubby wouldn't be just going south for the winter."},
{"title": "ONE year coming up of moving in the house/curtains", "date": "Tuesday, August 27, 2019", "text": "and the freaking furnace was broke down again. We tried to turn it on last night, house was on the chilly side and I was sick (feel better today, think it was allergies and mix of meds) so Hubby wanted to take the chill off the house... pressure switch AGAIN. HVAC guy down here AGAIN. This time instead of blowing the hose out as the MFG suggested, he replaced the switch and said since it's only a year old it shouldn't be having hoses issues so he replaced the switch and the hose. AND thank me that we turned it on last night not the first frost which is what others do and he gets tons of calls...happens on the first hot day also for ACs. He had 4 calls in route to us (we are 45 min from his shop) and 5 calls while here for 20 min. I would hate to see what a bad day was.the photo of the house when we started looking at itStove pipes gone from roof, skylight in, fence in front of house was on the side of house that you can just see to the left of the first picWe love the house and are very happy with the first floor even with somethings left to do... basement has a few issues with the ramp that we are still trying to figure out.I would like better storage for dishes that I use but not often in the basement. I haven't really worked on the four rooms upstairs or the barn. A lot of thoughts and ideas but nothing really happening. We decided to maybe add ramp also to the front porch and not just the deck...not sure we can do one ADA code as of how tall the porch is and the driveway.HVAC guy is also coming back to install the whole house surge protector and do a couple checks on things that showed up in the energy audit that came from work his company did. Thought middle of Sept.Painting to fix the bad paint is going to be the week of the 16th or 23rd of Sept which means the 4 rooms of the house need to be cleared for painting SIGHWe want to have all the energy audit stuff done by the week before Thanksgiving.I want to have all the deep freezers defrosted and organized by the week before Tday. BUT I first have to take the stuff we brought from Daddy's out of my coolers to do that.Hubby wants to gather all the metal including broken appliances etc to haul to the junk yard in Sept.I got all the curtains done except the winter curtain for the bedroom. All summer curtains are hungbedroom ... Daddy loves roses and this reminded me of him. I have sunflowers in the laundry room that reminds me of Mother.Hubby picked this fabric out when we lived on Church st.. 2005. He actually preferred the wrong side of the fabric which is blue (other side is fuchsia). When he went in during the evening it had turned purplish due to the sun setting (faces west) and he LOVED IT, the room is a light periwinkle so it turns shades during the day also.I fixed the kitchen French door curtains... guess this also reminds me of Mother as she drank wine. We love the fabric, reminds us a bit of Biltmore estates and the kitchen on Church st.Winter curtains will go up Oct or early Nov. I'll take pictures of those then. I still have to put some grommets in some of the curtains and finish tie backs.We didn't have to have a summer fill on propane. in June saving $430 (same price as last year).. we also have by passed the winter fill in Aug... MIGHT not need it to Oct. unless we have to kick the furnace on more than just morning to take chill off as we are sitting at 48%. I prepaid for the YEAR getting us a 20 cent reduced fixed rate for 2000 gallons. That's $400 AND if the propane is CHEAPER per gallon they use the cheaper price. I ended up with a credit at the end of the heating season to pay for a full tank that only cost me $100 instead of the $400 that was the usual price.We don't have the deck on...nor is the smoker put together , sore point between Hubby and me.I showed Hubby my Aug to do list ...only thing not done was the winter curtains for the bedroom AND the energy audit things I am waiting on him to bring home the stuff I needed in the livestock trailer.He did look at his Aug to do list that HE CHOSE TO DO ...zip, nada nothing done on the list. Decided he was taking on too much work when he needed to focus on getting stuff for me and doing his own work around the house so this month that is his focus. SO today he worked this morning and was going to Menard's 11% rebate time to pick up the stuff I asked him to pick up LAST month. SO that means I am getting the stuff to do MORE on my list.We have bounced ideas for Sept .... haven't finished working that out.Figured it was something we could talk about on the 2 hr drive to my cousin's funeral and 2 hr drive back home."},
{"title": "Each day", "date": "Monday, August 26, 2019", "text": "WEDNESDAYWe got the scam call about SS number being suspended . SS does not suspend anyone's number. I did notify both our local law and SS .Primary doc said my diet was to eat real food (when I can actually stand eating again).... He felt with some talking other doctors and a surgeon that my diverticulitis was from slow digestive system (4 days documented by camera) and the Crohn's blockage. I can still have my pop corn AFTER this heals and not a lot at one time. He did ask if I could do the same routine, etc as I did in 2014 and 2015 which when I was in remission. Hubby and I talked about it last night... not real sure we can do that here as one ,Hubby retired and not working 3rd shift, two, was our grandson was living with us in 2014 and three, finding produce I can process that is organic is hard in this area due to flooding and drought. Everyone is in the same boat.I went to Aldi's canned fruit and veggies are running from 89 cents to $1.29  I picked up 4 cases mandarin oranges, 1 case French style green beans,xxx sugar, dried apricots,and raisins.I went to Walmart to get sugar, they were out of the 25 lbs bags, so I asked manager if I bought 100 lbs of the 10 lb bags would she sell it to me for the same price per pound of the 25 lbs since they had already given out rain checks for the next delivery. GOT IT. I got 5 lb of corn meal for less than $5, every where else is around $10 . The guy stocking told me that the next batch was up at least $1 if not 2 as he was told to not stock it until the other had cleared the shelves. The elderly lady behind me asked if I would put the last one in her cart as it was on the bottom shelf. She wasn't going to buy it until next month but since he said that she was getting it now.Went to our local Kroger's and bought what I have now named the basic grocery list. $180.18... leaves enough for milk during the month. Did my Kroger's survey. Hubby uses the points if it lowers the diesel more than the other place otherwise I use it for the car.I decided after looking at the pantry that if I am given green beans or beets I would can them as I would like to have more (want not need) but I NEED apples for applesauce (we eat chunky and can no longer find it around here) and apple butter and tomatoes for sauces.I also realized I am back up to carrying 30 lbs without straining or anything... GO ME. I was down to 10 lbs and it hurting the right shoulder that I had surgery on a couple years ago. I also have full range of motion which I was told I would never have again.E told Hubby the chickens have been corralled to an area that is easier to search for eggs and it seems they are not laying. Not molting so they don't understand what is going on, they had changed feed and they think that might be it. These laid through sub zero weather (not normal around here) and through the 100 plus heat (not normal around here) and now that the weather is decent they are not laying. They don't start laying soon M will be butchering and canning chicken.Frugal items... both of us combined errands with what we were doing. Hubby even asked one of his deliveries if he could flip the time as it would save him time and gas and they were fine. Timing actually worked better for them also as their English neighbor brought over a fork lift to help unload as they knew Hubby can use a fork lift.THURSDAYI am taking this day as the day of rest as I am worn out from yesterday. Good day to rest as the rain that was suppose to come in yesterday (glad I didn't get rained on) came in  this morning. I have the AC off and the windows and doors open that the rain isn't coming in but its a good walk (which is good for me) to check to make sure the wind hasn't shifted the rain.Told Hubby we was having soft tacos, green beans (M gave us a mess for dinner) and cantaloupe  for dinner tonight.Tomorrow is grilled pork, salad, leftover green beans, and cantaloupeSaturday is hamburger patties with the works, cantaloupe,and boiled purple gourmet potatoes we grew .Maybe if I fix it , I might feel up to actually eating it?Brother called and told me we lost a younger cousin that had heart failure and kidney failure.FRIDAYHubby off and running again 6:30 am , got the pick up , drop off in a route to save gas, 3 of the things out of 4 is for E and his family. He \"scheduled\" Saturday off to mow and work on deck if he has time after mowing.I am doing laundry. Washing the items I sewed at Son 2 as they probably have some cat smell. Wilbur doesn't care, he was raised with cats but Rascal won't go in the laundry room now and Charlotte always grows when she goes by it. SO everything will be washed.Washing the cloth bags I use at the stores.Then I will wash the laundry.I will test the soil I dug from gardens at 4 inches to see it there is better nitrogen that deep. If not we have to decide on hauling dirt in or going to square foot gardens.I will scrub crates for the regular potatoes and finish getting the dirt off the gourmet potatoes and box them.I need to order mesh bags for the garlic and silver grommets for Hubby's summer curtains as he doesn't like the rod pocket as he can't pull the curtain as open as he likes.SATURDAYordered everything we need that was also on sale.garden soil tested better, not good enough to support growing but better... potash and nitrogen on the low side of medium.We can do stuff without a lot of money to fix that.I did the laundry today using clothes line.Feeling decent so hopefully we will go see our parents tomorrow.Hubby mowed and trimmed. Finished straightening the fence line so it can now be painted (late Sept/ Oct) and he brought all the deck stuff for the base from other side of barn, sorted it out and put it on this side of barn so if he can only do one board a day , his time is spent working on the deck not running around the barn trying to sort through the boards to find the right ones.He did have time in the evening to take E to go get some stuff he needed for making pallets.SUNDAYDay of rest... we sat and talked about Sept schedule as  the 4 rooms with bad paint are to get painted in Sept which means I have to clear the things on the walls and move furniture and washer and dryer. I guess the blessing of a bad harvest is that I am not trying to can and deal with paint jobs.Hubby found out we lost a classmate which was also a good childhood friend of my last night in a car accident. OVI is suspected.We went to Marion and saw Daddy. He is doing as well as expected for a 92 yrs old and dementia. He knew who I was, asked where Hubby was as he was signing us in and Daddy didn't see him walk by as he was napping in his chair in the lobby.  We only stayed a few minutes as he wanted to go to the church service at 1:30 as it was the son of the preacher who used to preach at Daddy's church before my step mom died (1990s). Told my brother we were there when he went in later...Good day for Daddy. We saw pictures the nursing home had taken when they took the residents to a local park for fishing.Daddy did a bit of fishing, even took off his jacket and long sleeve shirt. I haven't seen him in his muscle shirt in about 5 yrs. The man still has muscles.I mentioned it to the staff and they said Daddy was one of the few that would lift himself (155 lbs)to and from the chair. They just make sure he doesn't fall during the move. Also lifts hand weights in therapy twice a week.We stopped to visit Hubby's parents as his dad has lung issues from chemicals he used while farming. Admitted it was on the side of the chemical to use mask and gloves and he felt it was a waste of his money to buy that and time to use that.  Made the comment his younger self didn't care much for his older self.. They are doing okay... definitely on a diet as both are over 50 lbs of weight if not more. They offered to feed us but we declined as what they were eating I couldn't eat.We stopped at our local Chinese buffet , used coupon and only got water to drink, even though I really like their unsweetened tea and it was still lunch prices. Cost less than going across the street to Arby's and I had fried rice (made sure I didn't get peas,carrots or onions in the rice) meatballs in sauce, green beans and mushrooms. Tapioca pudding for my sweet. Didn't go back for seconds or thirds which is normal. Owner told me she hoped I got to feeling better as she knew I had been down again.We came home, watched British bake off and I took my biologic.MONDAYFeels like a fall day without sunshine as the rain comes in bands with plenty of wind. I only washed the towels as that filled the drying rack plus had to put 3 things out on the kitchen porch line as I ran out of room. Doubt if they will dry at all.Meds for diverticulitis is messing with my Crohn's and didn't do as well with my biologic so my GI pulled me off the meds a couple days early. I am grateful I have another script in for nausea meds that Hubby is picking for me as I am still in PJs resting. I didn't sleep at all during the night. I would have rather floated in and out of a light sleep than none at all. Nausea hit hard this morning again. BUT I am eating lightly, crackers, banana etc.Hubby was suppose to be home for lunch, didn't happen as it rained and caused 2 of the hauls to be flipped. He carries homemade trail mix and granola bars all the time now along with a thermos of coffee as all he hauls for will offer him water when he stops at their places.  He also told me the one that is having him work during lunch gave me a gift certificate for a free pizza at the local place. So he was getting that on the way home to have for his supper for me to not worry about feeding him as there is salad already made in the frig and 2 slices of cantaloupe. I will probably do soup if still feeling like this.I had a talk to my bank about them changing the rules of how to keep fees off. They did look back and see they hadn't sent me notice of the change so refunded me the fees and then offered to change the checking acct to one I wouldn't pay fees...Then came back and acknowledged that when we opened the 3rd acct it was noted to change my checking also because I don't have automatic payments put in it and it didn't get done. So that got changed. HOPEFULLY correctly this time. Hubby keeps enough money in his checking he doesn't pay fees, we have auto deposit to the joint and my credit card was suppose to keep mine free.Our house ins wasn't going to give us the discount for paying in full since it is in escrow.... they changed their minds when our ins agent reminded them that an escrow acct is PAID BY US like if we were putting it in a checking out anyways with an auto with drawl. SO we got that $200 discount for the year payment. He then started checking ALL his customers and followed up on a few that had the same issue. Was glad I said something to him about it instead just silently fuming... I am not silent when I fume...that's Hubby until he goes into steam roller mode.Hope you have a great week. Going back to bed to rest"},
{"title": "Where does the time go?", "date": "Tuesday, August 20, 2019", "text": "Well for me the last week has been going from Crohn's attack that my biologic helped avoid hospital stay to going to the ER due to diverticulitis  attack, which I've never had before... exhaustion, dehydration and malnourished now. I definitely bit my tongue after GI pointed out that... DUH. I really hope my primary doc doesn't make the same comment as I know I won't bite my tongue with him tomorrow.Yesterday I was up to doing some things after the GI appt. We stopped at Menards to get food grade buckets and gamma lids, ant traps and fly traps and found jeans for Hubby to use for work. He wasn't happy about the price but Rural King has been out of his size in carpenter pants for over a month and he is down to 2 pairs of work pants. He has ruined 4 pairs of pants in last 2 months. I feel like I'm lecturing a child about paying attention to what he is doing to not ruin clothes. The rebates covered the buckets and traps. Hubby paid for his pants out of his hauling money.We went to Sam's club.I wanted to buy sugar but it was higher than at our local Walmart so that got by passed. M had told us what that price was when she went to buy sugar at the bulk store that her uncle owns and it was twice the price of Walmart as a friend from her church had just bought sugar. But I got several items especially oil and rice that was on the restock list. I bought 6 jars of pickled beets. If I don't find beets to can I have at least 1 jar per month to get through the winter.We came home and looked over what was needed done on the punch list and where we needed to be in 12 wks. That's stuff from the energy audit done and the repainting from the bad paint done.We talked about routines... if flying by the seat of your pants is a routine we have that down pat.We talked about meals... example, he has a haul job at 7 am and it should only be 4 hrs.... he walks back in the door 10 hrs later because the haul job ended up being 3-4 haul jobs. If it's for E or his family , they makes sure Hubby gets a lunch in there and I get told he is going to be late, other's don't. The one has arranged it that if Hubby is delivering to him, that he brings a load back this way(paid to come home according to Hubby as it's within a mile of us and right on his way) but that makes Hubby getting in after our supper waiting for his trailer to be unloaded. We both don't like eating supper after 6 when we both go to bed by 9.He finally this week started telling everyone he will not take loads anywhere after 3 pm because he is missing supper.He is now going to pack a lunch even when he thinks he is going to be home as he can always eat it if it is home. I will cook my meals as I did at Son 2's, fix the meal at lunch and warm it up for supper. I will fix enough for Hubby to warm up when he gets home. Not that we like not eating our meals together but we make sure we have morning coffee together even if it means I have to get up at 3:30 am because of when he is leaving.I have a doctor's appt tomorrow and we still have a things on the restock list so I will pick up some of that while out. I need to stop at N's and find out his price on seconds of his tomatoes for canning and see if he knows anyone with beets to sell. I need green beans, beets, tomatoes,corn and onions. Butternut squash if I can find it. I can suck it up and buy frozen at the store if needed. Prefer not .I ordered the fabric for my winter curtains for the bedroom, last set of curtains needing made, saved 50%.The dirt for the gardens have been pulled to be tested. They asked for 3 inches deep and 6 inches deep. Hoping that there is nitrogen at the 3 inch level so it's more of a \"apply this, do that\" solution and not the land is going to take years to repair before you can use as garden\" solution.  I would have to say even my square foot gardens didn't grow this year unless you want to count the weird weeds that popped up at out potting soil. E said it's an airborne weed but wasn't sure what it was just that he was fighting it in his hay and oats also.Lunch time. Leftovers.Yack at you laterBlessed be"},
{"title": "Frugal crohn's attack", "date": "Tuesday, August 13, 2019", "text": "yeah, I know not really but really...Had a great last week at Son 2's and finished curtains, table cloths , napkins and 1 apron.Got home Friday.Saturday I reorganized the pantry and cleaned it (except for the floor). Made a list of what needed filled in .  Hubby washed his clothes and hung them on clothes line.Saturday night we met with other classmates for a 60th bday party, we had a 59 yr old but we let the \"baby\" in anyways  😉. Mexican restaurant and it had food I could eat as it was not spicy.  Wonderful time,Coming home I made the comment I must have ate too much. An hour later I was into a Crohn's attack...SIGH... decided to wait and see sometimes they calm down when triggered by over eating. 6 AM it's nope, now it's sever, BUT I want to take my biologic before going to the hospital since I would be in the hospital when my injection was due.... 15 min after taking the biologic I was like, nope don't need to go to hospital. Biologic kicked butt. Still hasn't been an easy ride but not as bad as it has been.I did realize it wasn't from over eating , well it is but it's from over eating yeast dough and my system takes 4 days to process what I eat . Yeah really they were freaking out when I took the camera test and hadn't passed it in 8 hrs... took 4 days to pass it.  SO I looked back and realized I had pizza, 2 slices for lunch, 2 for dinner, 2 for bfast and last 2 for lunch BUT nothing with it. I thought by limiting the amount at a meal it would be okay ... 2 months ago I had a flare up from eating 4 slices and not the usual salad we eat with pizza. Last month I had 3 thick slices of M's homemade bread, had a flare up.Lesson's learned... eat salad or fruit salad with 2 slices of pizza and not back to back meals. ONE slice of M's bread is plenty. AND don't miss injections like I did 2 wks ago.Savings $7000 is what the hospital bill would have been not counting the stress on Hubby trying to be at the hospital and doing everything else. I have slept like a zombie for 2 days and could easily go back to sleep now. I didn't call my doctor to order any pain meds as I used what I already had on hand which is pretty mild compared to I usually take 2 shots of Morphine before it get kicked down. ALL AND ALL it was a good run as I now can say YES MY BIOLOGIC IS WORKING.Hubby pulled a couple zucchini, a patty pan and a spaghetti squash from the garden with some cherry tomatoes. He is eating what ever he finds as leftovers in the freezer or eggs.M told Hubby chickens weren't laying, they think because they changed the feed so we didn't get eggs this week not a problem for us as I still have some.Not much else has went on. Too tired to do anything"},
{"title": "Frugal moments", "date": "Tuesday, August 6, 2019", "text": "when you don't want to cook, maybe don't want to eat and have cheese, Italian bread and olives for supper.when E feels bad for your hubby because he has to cook for himself (Hubby does part of the cooking anyways LOL) while I am cat sitting and has his wife send over lunch every other day. M butchered chickens that weren't laying. They have had fried chicken almost daily. Hubby said there was enough each time he ate the\"leftovers\" for supper that night. M sent over a dozen eggs, some peaches and 2 cucumbers for Hubby. He sliced up the cucumbers with an onion and poured Italian salad dressing on it. Nice side dish or snack for him. As he is fighting a nasty bout that started with allergies.I shut off the AC(90 with humidity make it feel like mid 90s) every morning and open Son 2 windows and curtains letting the morning sun come in for the kitties to sun bath. Close curtains an hour later before it starts cranking the heat back up. Don't turn AC until it's 85 , with a fan on I would be okay but kitties are old and don't do so well in the heat even laying in front of a fan on a tile floor.I fixed my meals from what I brought here, decided to not buy produce this week since I am going home this weekend. I have enough milk to make it through.Hubby said the only thing we will need when I get home is milk... if I remind him he will pick it up when he is in town towards the end of the week.I'm not driving back and forth to home and back so have saved 1 tank of gas.I am not running our electric up with the iron and sewing machine... that's on Son 2's bill, he said it's cheaper than a kennel for the 2 cats. So I guess he is still saving money.Hubby said he has been mowing the 1 acre pasture (which is E's but we barter us mowing it for him up keeping the 3 acres and fence that is behind us that is ours) every other time when he mows the yard. He talked to the lady that lives next to that pasture and she was fine with that, said if it got to bothering her she would come over and say something. Not much is growing anyways... we have been without rain for over a week AGAIN.NOT FRUGAL NOTE.I finished tossing food from the pantry. I wrote down what we hadn't ate in YEARS.I know Hubby is like my Daddy and would eat anything no matter what year it was canned... I on the other hand can not figure out how I have food in my pantry from 2014.... that's the year we were raising our grandson. I think I canned too much as I thought we might end up finishing raising him. I also need to think about what we eat, what we should be eating and how much is needed. AGAIN... Mother in law suggested I go to the store and buy for each week and not go back until that is gone.... she lives in the city around the block from the store. I asked her if that was what she did when they lived in the country (same amt of miles from town like we do now) NO WAY she said... too much gas and if the weather took a nasty turn you could go hungry... then it was like, OH guess that would not work well for you to go weekly. She lived on a highway, we live on back country road that don't get plowed much during the winter.Back to sewing... 5 sets left to sew (still have to figure something out for bedroom) and 4 aprons... Long days of sewing."},
{"title": "Sunday The day of Rest", "date": "Sunday, August 4, 2019", "text": "and my day of planning.There is a pot of meat sauce on simmering to go with the pasta this week.Used up the last of the fresh hamburger, half zucchini and 3/4s of red bell pepper, most of the portabella mushrooms (leaving 4 to go with caramelized onions later this week) and some shredded carrot .There is a small pot of chicken cacciatore soup that used up the other half of zucchini, 1/4th of the bell pepper, the last of the white mushrooms, leftover grilled chicken breast, diced up carrot and an onion.I split a quart of homemade red sauce between the two adding a bit of water to the soup.Later today I will make mashed potato patties from what is left of the mashed potatoes and sausage gravy and biscuits to help use up the milk plus have brunch meals for me that is just reheat.I have 2 squares of cake, strawberries and some ice cream for snacks and dessert.Monday I have to clean the frig, take some things in the garage to toss and take trash can to the curb for Tuesday pick up.This is my pressing pile and re-pin so it can have the final sewing.This is the pile that is ready to sewI feel that is a good amount for Monday.Tuesday after trash runs I will bring trash can back around.AND work on what ever didn't get done Monday and this pileHopefully I will be able to work on the NOT TOUCHED pileI don't think I will be finished with what I brought as I planned and hoped. BUT I do have to find fabric for winter curtains for the bedroom as the fleece blanket I ordered Hubby decided he wanted for a blanket for himself. So I just put the second one aside for when I move the chair that I used to always sit in at Daddy's in to the bedroom. The one I sat in at Mother's that is in the bedroom is going to the front room. My parents always made sure they had a chair I could sit in and have my feet touch the floor so not to strain my back. I sit on a wooden kitchen chair at my in laws.Thursday I will mow the yard and go get the groceries off Son 2 list.Friday I will clean the house and pack up and go home. Considering Hubby woke up sick this morning I am not sure I want to go home before he is over it. He thinks allergies due to being in barns 2 days in a row and not taking his allergy meds. I hope he caught it soon enough as the last time he didn't take anything (Doc chewed him out as we have the meds) and ended up with bronchitis and gave it to me. If he isn't better by Wed he is calling the doctor.Here is to having a great week for ALL OF US.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "What a week.... . ", "date": "Saturday, August 3, 2019", "text": "First my eating (which is a focus for me to eat 3 times a day) is back down to 1 meal (at lunch instead of supper) and a snack at 2 pm usually fruit and a unhealthy snack at 7 pm... I now longer have any junk food in this house(Son 2's house) ...SIGH.Hubby had a really busy week helping neighbors which are becoming friends and hauling.He did get started on the frame on the deck on the only morning he was home.Every morning I send a couple pics of the kitties to Son 2... he has had them over 10 yrs and they are his \"children\". This is Bailey. She is 10. she weighs 16 lbs and is on a diet ... I chase her around the house (as she won't run from Son 2, just rolls over and wants her belly rubbed) several times a day. Keeps me up and moving so I don't get stiff from sewing.This is Cuddles because he likes to cuddle. He is a weird cat. He is around 12 yrs old and is 3 feet LONG. He weighs 18 lbs and is on a diet. He ought to have lost weight this past month because he follows me from sewing machine in dining room to ironing board in farrowing room ... AKA spare bedroom that hold overflow of military stuff.These two go up and down the hallway around 1-2 A.M. \"talking\" each night. I think they are talking about the bunny that sits in front of the house at that time of night.They are house cats as they don't have front claws when Son 2 rescued them.Every night Hubby sends me pics of my babies AKA dogs.Last night was a little differentCharlotte took Hubby's recliner, she usually does this when she wants him to hold her. He let her have it and took the couch as both ends of the couch recline.Rascal is laying in front of the front door but where he can see into the dining room. Pretty standard place for himWilbur is on the floor in front of Hubby. He is usually on the couch  but since Hubby is hurt he is staying close to HubbyHubby broke his little piggy ... nicely wrapped it after working all day mowing the yard...He sent this pic and I immediately told him it was broke, he knew it as he is a EMT and has broke toes more than once..which is why he wears steel toes shoes I asked how he broke it. The last time he broke a toe it was stepping over a dog...HUMMMM he isn't happy at the moment ,he broke it on thisYep , the step he put in front of the washer for me. He didn't turn on the light and went to toss his \"barn\" clothes (he helped clean out the auction livestock barn in the next county) and caught the step. I told him to put the clothes basket on top of the step and it would help remind him it's there. Or turn on the light . I told Hubby I was looking for a new phone. I have Straight talk, love it and haven't found a place I couldn't use it at including driving through the mountains in KY and TN. Haven't decided because I hate paying that kind of price but my phone is almost out of memory due to updates and etc.BUT this became an emergency...MY SEWING MACHINE DIED. The computer part of it was half functioning but I was making it work. Then the tension part went out. I picked out stitches and redid the sewing. THEN it just died in the middle of sewing.... Died on me. My daily amount that didn't get done yesterday.... SO now I am a day behind which means I will probably be taking stuff home to sew. I am spending 8-10 hrs daily working on all these curtains, table cloths, napkins and aprons. I don't have that time free at home. SO definitely have to make sure what I take home is cut, pinned and ready to sew. Hubby did set up a table for me to put the sewing machine.I really need to put my sewing room together in this house.So off I went to shop for a sewing machine at Joann Fabrics. I have friends that bought theirs at Walmart, they seem to be okay and as one put it a basic sewing machine. All have mentioned having problems with certain fabrics. I sew all sorts of fabrics and I am not buying separate machines for that (yes I know one that has a machine for fleece, quilting, silk/satin/ and regular. AND then has 3 sergers.    Some day I will buy a serger... not sure which one. BUT with the advice of Joann assistant who's first question was what fabrics do you sew and are you a beginner, intermediate or professional. I'm intermediate and I sew all the fabric.  She gave me two options and then a 3rd that I would have had to order through their online. I am used to a computerized sewing machine so that didn't throw me though I noticed a lot of their machines in store where closer to the old manual, dial a stitch. Nice to see those available.I got this oneI have to learn to push button 89 to lock stitches as my old one had a lock stitch button by the reverse button. This one is down with all the others. It has a nice button hole stitch which sucked on my old one. I hope this one is a lot better. I've already made a list of stitches I want to learn to use. But the one that is probably going to be learned first is the blind hem stitch to repair to screw up on the kitchen curtains. That might be one that goes back home not done.Last night I sat and read the manual. I was told to make sure I read ALL of it. The care taking part was in the very back. I did as I was told... foot stool for my feet as my son is a foot taller than me and it's in his legs and I can't touch the floor in any of his furniture. I hide this box in the closet of my room AKA guest room so he doesn't toss it or I have to find something else and this is the perfect size. I'll probably find a foot stool and put it in the guess room as there is a chair in there that needs a foot stool also.Negative on it is the lightI have had to use the flashlight on my cell phone to see things with this sewing machine. Son 2's lighting in his dining room is good for eating , but not sewing.I also couldn't get the threader to work . I think that is the operator's issue LOL. I can get it to go down but not back. I will deal with that issue later as right now I just need to finish 66 items. Back to work for me, I already grilled a chicken breast and hamburger last night to reheat for today's meals."},

You can't tell it but this room is the crimson red roomOld curtain bathroomnew curtain for 1  windowOld curtain for office with rolled up towel at bottomNew curtain officeOld curtain for French doorsNew curtains for French doorsWe love the pattern even though Daughter 4 said it was grandma-ish (which I pointed out to her that 2 of her older sisters are both grandmas)It looks close to the border I had in our kitchen when the kids were growing up...But here it the DUH moment which is going to take a few hours to fix . I did tell the kids that it was so the dogs could lay and look out, which they do but that isn't what happened. I wrote the wrong measurement down 3 times.Thankfully I do have more of the material and will have the lovely task of matching the print so the new seam won't show as much as it could. I plan to add to the top after I pick out all the seams bottom and top...SIGH.ANYWAYS today is not a sewing day unless I get around to it. I have 6 cases of canning jars that need cleaned and new lids and rings put on them along with Son 2 trash can to bring back in and hose down as he washes it every week so it don't stink from used cat litter and I promised to do so also. I have paper work to catch up on that shouldn't be put off any longer.  I will do ironing and pinning for tomorrow's sewing tonight.stop and see the beauty and count your blessings...Of course it was when it was FULL of water, just kept adding water and more water. I am so glad I do not run the clothes washer, dryer or dishwasher while gone. This was Saturday morning at 6 am as Hubby was getting ready to go away with a couple of friends for the morning. I waved him off, wrung out the curtains I was washing by hand and hung them out on the line to DRIP.I looked at a couple places we buy from , one was have a good sale. Saturday afternoon we were in the store and the young man that asked if we needed any help mouth dropped when I said yes, washer died that morning, what did he have in stock that I could haul home NOW in the larger machines. HE did say he was sorry my day started like that as it set the tone of the day.He had 2 I could chose from, same price, same space, etc.... I took the one with the better reviews.Thing of having a large washer (I was thick comforters and king size blankets monthly) is I am SHORT... Hubby made this step for me a long time ago. It's solid, big enough I can turn around and not fall off but small enough that it's not in HIS way . It holds a bigger load so less loads for me to wash. (SAVINGS THERE ) I didn't care about what features it had but can tell you the delay start is wonderful as I have the habit of putting the first load of the day in the washer the night. Now I can actually add the soap and set it to come on.The wash cycles are a bit longer than the old one but there is a timer so you can see how long it takes and how long is left to finish. Hubby likes it plays a little tune instead of buzzing when it's done.Since I wasn't washing curtains, bedding and clothes Saturday morning. I worked on decluttering and organizing areas that are way past due. The north loft has a new (Daddy's old ) metal stand for stock up of cleaning supplies. The grow cart is put back together and the extra stuff for it is in the garden shed. I straightened up some of my baking supplies and realized I have some of the \"lesser used\" items on the low side.While getting the washer I got some odds and ends that was on the buy list AND I insisted we get a new microwave. The old one floats how much it heats. I've boiled room temp coffee in 30 seconds and other times it takes it 2 min to heat up.Electrician is going to install whole house surge protector. Just told us to order it and when he is down to work on the drain to the wheel chair shower and a torn heat duct, he will install it also.We ate from the pantry. Daughter 2 was suppose to come up to visit with her son 4 , that got changed due to her job an hour before they left to come up so I was glad I didn't fix anything extra for them besides the lemonade.Since I have nothing that I have to be back for I will finish the next 2 weeks at Son 2 cat sitting until he is home. Nice to not have that 3 hr round trip or spend the money on gas. I did bring a few more things from the pantry to help with the costs of food . I did coupons with the local store sales and got a third off the grocery bill for the fresh produce and dairy.Hubby did his laundry while I was gone. E stopped over while I was harvesting the last of the gourmet potatoes (grown in grow bags , about 125 lbs total, one of the few things that grew)  and let me know the talk of the area was Hubby hanging clothes on the clothes line while I was gone. Amish men will do laundry and will hang clothes ENGLISHERS are not know for it. One English neighbor had his wife pointing out that Hubby not only washed his clothes but put them on the line and all she was asking was him to wash his clothes and use the dryer.  😊. Guess Hubby took a picture of our wringer washer and took it over the gentleman. NO Hubby has not used my wringer washer. LOLI pulled the shallots, didn't get very big but they did grow. I also got a couple onions, not very big also. They are curing where the garlic was which is now cured and ready to be prepared for storage.I got 3 zucchini not very big but made 6 cups of shredded zucchini for the freezer and a bit to toss in Hubby's hamburger helper he fixed for his meals of the day. Was a couple of small jalapenos that he chopped up and added to it also.The local farm that sells fresh veggies that they grow for their income are buying from the produce auction. Their farm didn't do well.Hubby was offered a permanent job at the produce auction. Two days a week, Tuesday afternoon and Friday afternoon of delivering stuff bought by a few stores that buy regularly from the auction during garden season. They don't do much during the winter but if one of the stores buys shipped in (what the auction has brought in during off garden season) then he would be hauling that also. The young man that's been doing it is having surgery and doesn't plan to come back to the position afterwards. Hubby asked for the locations so he would know mileage and the pay before he agrees to it. Would be nice if it pays enough. He asked why he was the one asked to replace the guy as we know there are others that haul in the area for years... he keeps the livestock trailer CLEAN ALWAYS. Doesn't matter what he hauls even when it was Daddy's furniture to our barn. He pressure washes the trailer ALWAYS.IF he hauls critters then he sprays it out and scrubs it down and then sprays it again. Just how he was raised.How was your week?"},
{"title": "sewing", "date": "Wednesday, July 24, 2019", "text": "I have been sewing off and on for 50 yrs...My sewing is simple. I've made my own clothes, curtains, bedding, tablecloths,napkins etc but when Daughter 2 needed her wedding dress let out I call for my foster sister to deal with it. She's far more professional than I am.So deciding to make our curtains when we bought the house last year wasn't anything new. I didn't have time (or energy since I was sick) to make the cold weather curtains before we moved in, nor did I make the warm weather curtains during the winter as planned. Bought some material but didn't do anything else.So when Son 2 told me he needed me to cat sit for a month while he was in school out of state... it was perfect for me to do the sewing.16 summer curtains 16 winter curtains with liner if not heavy material. We decided to go with a blind in the mudroom as neither of us can reach the window very well (that will be the first window to be changed).I gathered the fabric I ordered for  the front room and dining room warm weather curtains and then started going through my stash in the barn (yes still in the barn) for the rest of the house.I found fabric Hubby had picked out for our home over 15 yrs ago and will make the summer curtain for his bathroom out of it. I already did his winter curtain last fall.I found fabric that we used to drape front room window in the house we had in 2008. It's enough to make curtains for the front room, instead sewing a liner in them I ordered a sheer liner from Amazon that is also an insulator. The liner was half of the cost I was going to pay for fabric before I found what I did.I found in my stash blue jean fabric that I will line with the stash flannel fabric to make the winter curtains for the dining room.I found heavy fleece for the French doors and then fabric that I had bought 15 yrs ago to make curtains and didn't. So that fabric will be the summer curtains as the sheers we have now don't keep the west sun out and it heats up the kitchen.I found fabric that I had bought to make throw pillows for my granddaughter and there is just enough to make a curtain for my bathroom and the office.I found some fabric a quilter gave me that I am lining with more stash flannel to  be the winter curtain in my bath.I had bought a summer curtain for the laundry room that had sunflowers, my mother's favorite flower. I found the fleece I had tossed over the curtain rod and used binder clips to hold it there and made it into a curtain.I found fabric with roses (Daddy's favorite flower) that I will make into curtains for the bedroom. I did order fleece twin blankets  to make curtains (cheaper than buying fabric) for this coming winter.I am using the scraps from the dining room curtains to make 2 sets of curtains for 2 of the lofts. I am using the scraps of jean fabric lined with scrap flannel for the winter curtains....these are really small windows.I found another quilting fabric that I am lining with scrap flannel for the office winter window.I found fabric to make 7 new table cloths (we have an odd size table) and 32 napkins.I found fabric to make 4 new aprons ( I hope to do more later as I have more fabric).I am not color coordinating the thread to the fabric. White,blue or black is all that I am using.I had finished 4 sets. I cut the rest of the 28 sets, table cloths, napkins and aprons out yesterday. Today is sew and sew and sew.Which I best get at it as I have found it takes me 2 hrs to do one set, hopefully I can cut that time."},
{"title": "heat warning frugal", "date": "Sunday, July 21, 2019", "text": "We still opened the house up when the temperature was below 80 and closed it up and turned AC on when it hit 85 (or higher if there was a breeze) AC is set on 78. Fan are sitting at vents to help move the cold air around.We open curtains on side of house with NO sun , close the ones that the sun is coming in. between noon and 1 we close up the one side and open the other.We cooked our meals in the morning and ate them cold or microwaved them to reheat. I got a few zucchini from the garden and a couple green tomatoes off a dying tomato plant.We ate the lettuce that is now bolting. Hubby said he is feeding it to the horses next door as a bribe to let him pet them.We have also figured out the light weight sheers on the French doors was not a good thought for the summer. Most of this summer I have had another set over them to keep the sun out. SO curtains for those doors is added to my curtain making list.We decided on a blind for the mudroom window. Neither of us can reach this window very well as the counter (old sink and was the kitchen) that we do not want to tear out is wider than our standard Englisher counters.We have watered the plants that are in pots using the cistern (has a hand pump in the mudroom sink)We are drinking a lot of water, glad our well water tastes good even before we got the softener.We are getting up early to get work done even in the house (21 items off punch list, 2 items off energy audit list).The heat is suppose to break on Tuesday, I sure hope so because my AC needs a vacation."},
{"title": "frugal choices", "date": "Tuesday, July 16, 2019", "text": "It's Prime day at Amazon and pretty much everything on my watch list is now down to the price I would spend on it and had saved for... couple of them even less was the antenna Hubby wanted to install when we bought the house and and we didn't want to spend that much is less than half what it was .I also found a plain jane iron as mine died this past week in the middle of sewing 24 curtains. Lucky for me I was cat sitting at Son 2's and he has an iron. Hubby did mention he could go over and find out where M got her iron and go buy me one. I can heat it up on our cook stove... I told him to clean the barn upstairs storage out as I think N and E left one she didn't want when they moved LOL.I did check school supplies, not that we have any kids to buy for but I get my supplies, pens, paper etc during the days they have school supplies. I will get the notebook paper and spiral notebooks at the store.Hubby started working on the repairs needed per energy audit results starting with the foundation of both the house and the pump house. We got a bid from a neighbor to do the work....$3000 plus supplies. I think we can do it on our own for that price.I had to buy perishable for myself at Son 2's home. I was going to drive to the store that is 30 minutes away but he told me to go to the local store as their prices are pretty much the same after adding the cost of gas. I focused on their sales. I will have to buy more milk, fresh fruit etc but I bought enough meat for the whole time I am here and repacked it for the freezer. They had family packs of chicken breasts and pork chops  on sale.Hubby ate from the freezer and didn't eat out.Hot and humid and no rain here, went north and south of us."},
{"title": "Just going to bang my head on the wall", "date": "Sunday, July 14, 2019", "text": "I have 28 curtains to make for home. 14 for warm weather and 14 for cold. My expensive iron I bought 2 years ago DIED, just up and DIED in the middle of doing the cotton curtains.We found the trouble we have been having with our microwave and clothes washer is coming from power surges, we hadn't noticed any until the other night and we called the electric company. They are checking lines etc but did suggest power surge protectors for anything that has a computer chip in it. Now I need 8 of surge protectors. Regretfully that didn't cause my iron to die.The AC was running and we heard an unusual sound coming from the furnace. Hubby said it was not getting enough air so we went checking cold air vents to see if something was blocked. We find 2 small filters in the cold air vent and hot air vent in the north loft...didn't even know there was filters there and apparently the HVAC company didn't realize they were there either as the things are about 20 yrs old from the first English owner that built the house... YEWWW.Hubby called the HVAC company and they said those didn't need to be replaced LOL.Hubby went to hook up the small trailer to the old truck to help E move the fertilizer tank to his parents, he cut the bolt off the hitch and then beat the ball part to get it off hitch of the truck so he could change the ball. Guess that's what happens when you drive 2 trucks and one is a bumper pull and the other a goose neck AKA 5th wheel. Took him 4 hrs of working on it to get it changed, E felt bad over it.My car goes in for oil change and regular check up... I am almost afraid of what else will need done. Probably brakes and rotors, that I expect but just with the way things have been going .Hope your weekend and this coming week go better than you hope"},
{"title": "Energy audit results.", "date": "Thursday, July 11, 2019", "text": "We just keep reminding ourselves we knew there was going to be a lot of work, just didn't expect this part to be as much work.There was a blower door test to mimic a 20 mph wind and thermal imaging to see where the air leaks was.The audit through our electric company was $50. I have seen these audits run over $300... Even so I would have paid the price.SIGH.  We really wished we could have had this done BEFORE we had all the work done so it could have work would have been done and the cost covered under the loan.There is 120 things that need fixed. We have enough air leaking that should NOT be to match having a 16 inch by 16 inch hole in the wall 24/7 365 days a year. Costing around $700 in heating and AC.That is propane and electric bills AND that's just the house part. The pump house 6 ft wide by 8 ft long 12 ft tall is an additional $350 loss . So over $1000 in propane and electric is lost.The 4 rooms (aka lofts) upstairs, every single seem of the walls need caulked.Which told us that there was no under wall under the paneling , just attached to the wall frame.Four attics have the insulation installed BACKWARDS. Instead of taking it all out , we were advised to just add an air barrier.The entire foundation needs insulated. Great Stuff is the answer to that. We will need to either crawl under porches to apply it or just put up boards on bottom of porches with insulation board on the back of what ever we use to enclose the porches. Deck will also have to be done when we get it built.The 18 yr old that built this house on his own just didn't know that you are to insulate the foundation footing. Believe me for an 18 yr old he did very well building. There are a few things not done right and you definitely understand it was his age and just not having the wisdom at that time.This entire front room needs caulked along the baseboard and heater vents need caulked AND the crawl space under it needs the duct work repaired.The vent to the wheelchair bathroom shower needs fixedAll 17 windows need caulked inside and out. One window need replaced or a storm window made for it. All windows need new seals. We thought all the windows were bad and would need replaced and they don't at this time so this was good news?Two doors !!!NEW DOORS!!! need new seals.Funny thing was our French doors (French doors are well known for air leakage) wasn't leaking at all even with being out of alignment. The threshold that was installed under it was.Outlets in some areas are leaking air. I had not done all of those, not sure if the insulators I used were old or if I missed some. I know I hadn't done the upstairs.The old electric meter needs removed and sealed so it will no longer be leaking air along the electric wires.The attic work will have to be done this fall as it is way too hot in them to be working. We were advised to do the pump house and the house foundation FIRST. Hubby is going to be on that. I get filling in the missing insulation in the basement and caulking everything  ( I hate caulking but Hubby makes such a mess with his tremors) and our GOAL is Oct 9th (Hubby's 61 st birthday) but if needed finish the attics by Thanksgiving.THIS IN ON TOPof the 160 items on the final punch list for finishing this house.We would have to do 6 things off the audit list (priority) and 8 things off the punch list to be finished by Thanksgiving. We average 20/month on the punch list. Looks like another year of long days and very short nights like last year."},
{"title": "Frugal notes ,not in order", "date": "Wednesday, July 10, 2019", "text": "but as I can remember doing them.I am doing Frugalwoods Uber month of not spending anything but what is NEEDED.Homemade laundry soap and cold water and clothes line for the laundry.Stayed out of grocery store. Out of celery, regular carrots (shredding baby carrots that was a freebie for salads is a pain but hey LOL) fresh mushrooms and almost milk but going to Son 2 to cat sit so will not need as much milk here. Will be taking my food to Son 2. When he gets home next month (taking a class to certify him for some work, has been trying to get in this class for 5 yrs.) he will replace what ever food I use for myself for our home.Ac only on during night except the day it hit 101 and Wilbur puked on my bare foot. This comes from a dog that is usually laying outside on the metal roof on the basement ramp in 85 degrees and wants to drink from hot mud puddles instead of the cool water available and the house was only 90 with a great breeze. Still I shut it up and turned the fan on high in front of the vent and got him to lay down there. Put cool wet towel on his paws and tummy and he went to sleep. I called the vet to find out if I should bring him in . The other two were out playing with each other.Left AC on for the next day as it was worse humidity wise. This morning it was 58 ... Panting hard would have been a better sign he was hot as I do watch to see how hard they are panting especially Rascal as he is mostly black.We ate from the pantry, I got a 6 tomatoes (which have no flavor) from the garden, green onions which are on the hot side, one zucchini and one yellow squash  and some leaf lettuce from the gardens. We were able to harvest 36 large (about twice the size I normally get) heads of garlic to start curing. We got 6 blackberries off our bushes (first year).M sent over Raspberry strudel she had baked, raspberries from her bushes and we have ate peaches on a daily bases. The peaches should be eaten this week.I ordered the filters for the new refrigerator as they were on sale and there was a coupon from Amazon, I went through Brandy's web site THE PRUDENT HOMEMAKER( I read this blog daily as someone is always commenting how they saved sharing their wisdom). Saved over 50% and more than that over what we were having to buy for the other frig.I got the filters for the HVAC, there is one on the furnace it's self and one in the fresh air duct in the kitchen. Menard's had their 11 % rebate and that is also the lowest price I can find.I had turned in the receipt and energy star from the new refrigerator to our electric co and got $100 taken on this month's electric bill. We have a $5 credit still, I did still pay what we have budgeted for the monthly bill as I know there are going to be higher than what the budget is with the AC running. Hoping to balance that out so I don't have to rob Peter to pay Paul. I still haven't gotten the bill for the energy audit ($50) but we got the results (another post) and bought on sale some caulking and Great stuff (Menards cheapest and 11% rebate). I made sure it was on it's own receipt as I need to turn it in to the electric company also. They will \"refund\" the $50 audit cost if I spent $50 for items mentioned to fix what needs insulated . I spent $82 at Menards. Figured I would get 11% rebate equal to $9 and the $50 refunded back... I am only out $23( well kind of I would have paid that $50 anyways) well below the monthly budget for home maintenance.E paid Hubby to go back into town for gas, cream cheese and baby formula  , so Hubby finished running our errands at the same time.I mended 3 pairs of Hubby's jeans. One of them 3 times. If he rips it back out they will go into the scrap fabric pile. He said he would pay for his jeans out of his earning as it's the \"job\" that's causing the tears.We do normal routine... curtains closed to keep sun out, open when sun is other side. Windows open all night or at 6 am when AC ran at night. AC not on until 4 pm unless over 85 degrees.(which is where we decided so Wilbur doesn't get sick again) I don't use a lot of foil or plastic wrap or press and seal. I do use freezer and storage bags that get washed unless used for meat . We use empty coffee cans to scrap waste in that can't go to the compost pile, AKA grease and onions are common. I save my meat grease just like my grandparents did during their lives and especially the Great Depression. Air fryer over oven if possible, grill over stove, microwave over stove top, cold meals of fruit, cheese, crackers or bread, salad or veggie tray to keep the heat out of the house. We go to bed early (so less lights on and t.v. off) and get up early.  We don't use the heat or  dry cycle on the dishwasher and we run it at night.We have our outside water lines hooked up so the water does not run through our water softener , saving on the salt and filter and also not putting salt on the plants.We wait 2 days some times 3 before buying things.How did you save money."},
{"title": "Rambling ", "date": "Friday, July 5, 2019", "text": "Hubby's truck is fixed. One of the mechanics offered to come in early to diagnose it, and another stayed over late to get it fixed. Tow truck guy told them we hauled for the Amish and 5 families were scrambling to cover things since our truck was down. He's been working ever since even yesterday on the 4th. He even has a job tonight if he gets back from the other job in time, if not then he has it to do on Monday. He is hoping to make up the loss income and the cost of repairs as it wasn't covered under the warranty (busted hose and plugged filter) by the end of the month. The family that was out of state he was suppose to go get was given bus tickets for free to get home.I harvested a yellow crook neck squash, a green onion and some leaf lettuce. I also harvest 1/10th of the gourmet potatoes that I planted in grow bags. I got enough for 4-5 meals . Hubby did some weeding and realized I was serious when I said the veggies were not growing. Compost and fertilizer did not help enough. SO we need to decide if we are going to haul garden dirt in (a friend had to do this 3 yrs in a row) and fine compost (not course as we have in the gardens now) or go back to square foot gardens like we have been. I am voting on the square foots as they are easier to weed and don't kill my back as much.Even in the one square foot I just planted with store bought soil, germination of green beans is very slow and low. We got almost 3 inches of rain in 24 hrs this week. And the heat just pours in to steam what is planted.E and M asked about planting garden peas this fall, E's mom had asked me the same thing. Guess it's not common in this area and they weren't sure it could be done or what to plant or when. M planted 5 lbs of seeds of garden peas this spring. She harvested enough to make one meal  for her family of 10. Nothing to can. E was plowing another area up to plant for the gardens as it is an area that hasn't flooded. Their one garden has been under water 3 times so far. They are worried A LOT. Peas, corn, green beans, kraut and potatoes are their main veggies that they can to eat during the off season (late fall, winter, early spring). She is hoping the winter squash does well to help ease that lack.E asked me if they had to buy peas or green beans at the store how to buy them . I told him #10 cans as 1 can would provide 2 meals for them.Just let me know what and how much and we would go get it for him as it can't be bought here in town.  M sent over raspberry cream cheese strudel YUM. We thanked her but not thinking I asked why she was baking on a hot day... DUH, she was washing whites and needed hot water so while the stove (they burn wood) was heating water for the laundry she baked bread, strudel, coffee cake , 4 pies and made noodles(they dry them on top of the stove) and was done by 9:30 our time . She had gotten up at 2 am (our time as they don't do daylight saving time) with E when he went to the fields to get the corn in , easier on the horses to do it then. And started her daily work  so by time the kids got up at 6 our time, she was down to finishing the bread and strudels. She is now requiring ALL the kids that are home (1 or 2 of the boys goes daily to work with E, they changes which one goes at lunch time so they aren't out in this heat all day) to lay down and rest after lunch for a couple hours, says it's her way of keeping them from getting to hot during the day. E brought the kids over last night and had them sit on our old trailer behind the garden shed to watch the fireworks. Their woods behind their house blocks the view.We have been closing the curtains to keep the heat out...the curtains I was going to make for summer is going to be too thin to keep the heat out. SO I am thinking of making curtains that are double sided , one side lighter colored for warm weather, darker colors for winter... I will be working on these while house sitting for Son 2. Still waiting for the results of the energy audit. I called Monday and he said he had forgot to drop them off the Wednesday before as they have been sitting in his back seat of his car for a week.I paid the bills, checked to see what we are charging on our credit cards (I pay in full each month). Fuel is up on Hubby's but down on mine. Part of mine is the medical for neighbor's baby, clothes that needed replaced that was on sale for the two of us and some medical for us.The only \"extra\" was the cost of the book I ordered that wasn't paid in full with my swagbucks and Pinecone payments, I spent $6 which came out of my spending money. I ordered the propane, 2000 gals. at $1.649/gal. If the price is lower, they lower my cost. We ended up with 200 gals extra last year due to the price dropping. BUT it won't go up even if it costs them more. That was a big chunk of $ and I will start putting it back next month. I have a dentist appt on Monday that is cash out of hand as we don't have dental or eye coverage.I will need to stop and get furnace filter also as Hubby thought he had one back and didn't.  I need to rebuild my savings, took a hit when I bought the new frig. Hubby is holding on his.Garden not growing is a hit. I am looking hard at the pantry and deciding what is needed to get us through  instead of what we want.I fixed stuffed pasta shells for Wed night, AND a lasagna for today, yesterday was spare ribs and potato salad... I knew I was taking my biologic Wed night and usually I'm dragging butt for 3 days...just fall asleep off and on the day after. This time I wasn't as bad so at least with this heat 10 am and already 85 in the house *we only use AC at night if Hubby has to work the next day in the morning so he can rest well* supper is already done and can be reheated in the microwave.How is your week going?"},
{"title": "not a frugal week", "date": "Tuesday, July 2, 2019", "text": "I finished harvesting garlic scapes. With this heat in high 90's the garlic might be ready to harvest to cure within a week.I harvest basil and put it in dehydrator.We bought 1 1/2 bushels (75 lbs) of peaches for $96 ($32 each half bushel) we thought that was a little high but they were cling free (meaning the pit comes out easy). We saw the same peaches 50 miles from us for $42 for the same amount. Guess we didn't do as bad as we felt. I put them in the old kitchen frig which is sitting in the front room (HA HA guess GOD knew we would be using it there). I sorted the bruised ones to go in the kitchen frig so we would remember to eat them. What is left is going in to peach crisp for Sunday bfast. SO far I have 24 pints of peaches, 16 cups of frozen peaches and 4 1/2 qrts of peach juice made from the peels.I peeled them by hand so I could use this by product. Can't really do that with peaches you blanch to peel.I only have some in the bottom drawer and the drawer to the right. Rest are done.I made chicken fried rice, pot stickers and egg rolls... not from scratch. I sauteed zucchini, yellow squash, onion, carrot, celery, and mushrooms and put on top of the fried rice that I served on a meat platter. Then sliced the green onion very thin and sprinkled on top. I knew with doing the peaches by myself I wouldn't want to fix meals.We had that for 1 supper and 1 lunch. There is enough of the rice and veggies left that I am going to add a can of rinsed beans and cheese for tortillas for supper as Hubby is now working through his lunch. I had peach and cottage cheese.M brought over a head of lettuce and the normal 2 dozen eggs this morning. Mentioned E's parent cooked hamburger and crumbled it and then melted American cheese and mixed it with the crumbled hamburger and put it a salad with tomatoes and pickles like you would a cheeseburger but no bun. I think that is going to be on the menu this week. Followed by some stuffed pasta dish as I have ricotta cheese I need to use up.On advice of E's mother I planted Jade beans. She said they should produce as she has always planted them this time of year and had plenty for canning. I put them in the square foot we just put in.AND PRAYED.I joined Frugalwoods Uber frugal month that starts today July 1st. AND after this morning of this...with the turbo out of the ford 350 work truck and the dealership can't even LOOK at it until Friday or next Monday..Frugal in not the word... survival might be as Hubby had 4-5 jobs lined up. He might have to rent a car to go get a family out of state as they aren't finding anyone to replace him and my little jeep won't fit an adult with 2 car seats in the back seat. He is not going to leave them stranded for sure. We are hoping that something just came unhooked, or something simple like that. One can always hope.We knew gas was going to be up a bit as I will be going to Son 2's home to cat sit but this a solid hit on income. We do have an extended warranty so that helps.We just have to cut the budget somewhere else for what those jobs were going to cover.We have been turning the AC on at 8-9 pm and turning it off at 6 am. It's set at 78.Got to go weed the garden.Stay cool and safe through the holiday."},
{"title": "where June goals stand, garden,  deck and air fryer.", "date": "Saturday, June 29, 2019", "text": "JUNE DONEHubbyfishing tripproperty mowed completely (first time to get it done before the rain)gravel for deck downIt will be 16 ft wide by 20 ft long. I'm going to have to put a blind in the bathroom as if you are standing on that end of the deck you will be looking in.Dad's stuff is to Daughter 4 and Son 2 AND odd jobs at Son 2 is done.Hubby's not done listdog house removed, mudroom gate on fence, spouting at the cubby hole, tower/antenna put up, fence line straightened and the smoker has not been put together.We chose to not join Anytime fitness as they don't give discounts at the one that just opened. We will join the YMCA AFTER Hubby's parents join again as they do silver sneakers. At this time we are getting our work outs done in the yard and gardens and Hubby lifting concrete blocks with E and E's brother.Speaking of gardens .... we went from flood to so dry the ground is cracking within days. Roots are shallow on all the plants due to flood so they are just dying now. I watered one time, but won't be doing much of it as we have 10,890 square feet of garden (1/4 acre) and 1 inch of water for that is 6,853 gallons. We have a well  so we are only paying for the electric to run the pump but with dry weather I don't want to drop our water level that much. We put in 3 square foot gardens and I planted 1 with fall beans. Mid week I will plant the next one with fall peas and the 3rd will be greens etc the following week or even closer to Aug.I have gotten 1 zucchini (yes only 1) and 1 yellow squash and 1 green onion. I should have leaf lettuce (it's in the shade during the heat of the day) and green onions today or tomorrow. BUT we do have thisThere is over 50 squash vines, potatoes and onions growing out of the compost pile so Hubby said we weren't using it due to it might be the only food we grow for the pantry. I don't know how onions got in my compost as I don't toss them there. I had 4-5 squashes that went bad in the spring, Delicata , kaboocha, jack be little pumpkin, pie pumpkin and maybe something else. Last fall we had  pumpkins in the compost from the Amish family that lived here LOL. Since I grow mostly heirloom they should produce the same.With the heat on I've been cooking on the grill or air fryer. This was the last thing I cooked in the air fryer. Results, I need to pull food sooner. Wasn't over cooked and was very tender for flank steak. Used pesto, roasted red bell peppers slices and provolone cheese .When this airfryer dies... I will buy another one just like it. I love being able to put a variety in and not wait for each to be done before starting the next.Hubby loves having onion rings that are crisp and not heating up the kitchen.My June goals donegot well enough to start biologic.I changed the kitchen to suit the changes in our eating and I now how the new frig set upWe like this, it's suppose to be black, the sides are but the front with the fingerprint less looks more like gray. Magnets won't stick to it either so I had to move the grocery list to the side.Negative is the ice maker is too small and I ended up with a bin in the freezer anyways which I was trying to get away from.I need to buy small condiments bottles to fit in the door.I got the finances set for the new budget.We had the energy audit. Should have the report this week as it's already a week late.I did the test paint and it worked so our contractor now has a solution for the paint.I cleaned 1/2 shelf of the pantry.I DID NOT DOcomputer desk as the old kitchen frig is now sitting there until Hubby has time to remove the cover to the basement ramp and move the old.I didn't get the garden shed cleared as we still have some thing I need moved from the front of the barn.I still  have 1 shelf left to clean in the pantry and I didn't get to the deep freezers thanks to having to shove the frozen stuff from the frig into them.We got a total of 10 things done on the punch list of the house."},
{"title": "more rain, roller coaster ride of life.", "date": "Monday, June 24, 2019", "text": "Monday nightwe came home after our meeting with our financial guy. We had already decided on what could be cut if we don't have enough $$$ AND where the money that is saved goes . Half goes to the household savings, the other half goes in to Ally where I am saving when we need money for health ins.E and his boys, brother EL. and his Dad came over to fish our pond (have too many and we have enough fish in the freezer now) and invited us over for their fish fry. We didn't go, a bit tired of fish at the moment LOLHubby went over to where he was to pick up a load for hauling on Tuesday , that road was flooded Monday morning. It was down enough he went and got the load since we were expecting more rain.I put the budget on a spread sheet and found we had a $200 mistake in the budget ... it's okay...it was $200 MORE than we needed... SO that $200 will be split and go directly into medical savings and household savings accounts.I made laundry soap which I should have made Saturday so I could have done a load of laundry this morning and put it on the drying rack as it's RAINING and I haven't done laundry in 6 days.I went through Brandy's web site The Prudent Homemaker to Amazon (she gets a very small amount when someone that does that no money out) and ordered red clover tea good for congestion, red clover salve, Mother used to sell this, we used it for skin issues, echinacea tea good for immune system also honey lemon echinacea cough drops, geranium oil( I mix with safflower oil or coconut oil for muscle pains,really did well when I had shoulder surgery), garlic ear drop oil (suggested by Brandy), some eye droppers, lavender oil( for bath, etc but also for the garlic salve I am going to make that is for congestion also that E mother gave me the recipe), 1 round 6 inch cake pan, 1 square 6 inch cake pan (the size we bake now), 3 books on herbal/holistic due to 2 of my kids walking off with my books and then losing them,some camisoles and tank tops that I needed to replace this year and they were on sale for 50% off ,(Hubby will need socks this fall). AND a book for me that I have wanted for years and finally found at the price I can afford... exactly the credit I had sitting at Amazon... Diana  Phipp's Affordable Splendor...  Some of it was on sale, some even had coupons.TuesdayI straightened the dry goods cabinet in the basement and realized I have NO choc frosting.  Since I am almost out of powdered sugar also I will either buy one or the other, depending on what is cheapest and if I can find it at the discount store we are stopping by today. M needs mayo/salad dressing and asked if we were passing by it when we go to the chiro and doctor appt (praying I will be healthy enough to start my biologics)I canceled the auto refill of the water filter($50) for the frig that is going to the basement as there is no water line there. I priced the new frig water filter and the supplier wanted $50 for one, the very same filter is on Amazon for 3 for $32. Filter is changed every 6 months so I am getting over a year's supply for less than 1 of the old filter. Since the budget was set on the old filter that's money to be saved.I washed clothes, drying rack is full, 2 sock dryers are full and so are both shower rods. I have 3 loads left I will wash WHEN the others dry. It's RAINING.Tuesday nightWe stopped at discount store and got White Lily flour for us (99 cents for 5 lb bag, their only bag) and 12 jars of mayo,1 cake mix, 2 box of ho ho's  and 2 bottles of Ranch dressing for M. She also keeps a running list like I do.At Aldi's I got choc frosting and powdered sugar and a case of green beans. We got M 4 Ranch dressings, 4 loaves of bread (last her a day), and 2 more cakes mixes for the total she was wanting.At Walmart we got the baby formula M requested and some cupcakes that was discounted since discount store didn't have any. For us I got an Angel food cake baked in a loaf pan, 4 shortcakes for the strawberries we have and a discounted mixed slices of cream cake.We went to Chiro... nothing like laying down on the table and the doctor telling you it's bad before he really starts checking things. My chiro used an Activator so there is not twisting of the body. Hubby was in as bad as shape, probably from the fishing trip as he has been saying his hip was bothering him since he headed back home.We went to doctor appt. Hubby blood work good, sugar at 100 (that's his normal even though doc would like to see it in the 80s)lost 3 lbs.. My weight was up 3 lbs, I must have found Hubby's and forgot to give them to him 😁. Blood work was good except my cholesterol was up , doc figures steroids. Gave me the option of going back on my statin 3 days  a week or waiting to see what it is without the steroids. I chose to wait.We stopped and got a pre-bake pizza from our favorite pizza shop for dinner.The only place we get pizza from around here is the gas station. Doc cleared me to start biologics BUT strongly suggested I only start with the first dosage and wait an hour to make sure I don't have a reaction.He had talked to my GI and they agreed I should take 80 mg (2 shots) the first day, 80 mg the next day and then 1 wk later take 80 mg and then 1 wk later 40 and then go every 2 wks.   So I started. I don't do well with giving myself the shot, I tried twice and ended up with 4 sticks of the needle Hubby was cracking up laughing as he thought I hadn't realized I had already stuck myself as I did the \"jerk\" so quick... Hubby is doing Wednesday.Side effects... my hands quit hurting and got warm, I felt like I had a buzz like I had a couple glasses of wine without food and too close together and I was sleepy.No soreness in legs and there is no way I am doing that in my stomach, one I have tons of scars and stretch marks which they say don't hit but any shot that hurts like that will cause my Crohn's to crap up. Been there and done that and had to have morphine to stop the craps.WednesdayStill sleepy, got up at 6 with Hubby as he has a full day of being gone running around with an elder gentleman who wanted to go see some friends on the other side of the state and had no one to take him. I went back to bed when Hubby left at 7 and woke up at 10.... Still sleepy but up and moving. Took all the clothes that was still damp from yesterday out to the kitchen clothesline as the yard is still a pond . Started washing what I did not get to and will finish that hopefully before the rain comes in that is expected around 3 pm.Canceled a magazine renewal saving $49.99.M sent over leaf lettuce and a head of lettuce from their gardens (it was the one behind them and didn't get flooded , has spring \"crop\" in it and a loaf of bread as thank you for going after the groceries and formula for her. She sent a note that E her Hubby said of we wanted manure(with straw) to bring the trailer or truck over and he would help Hubby fill it so we could start putting it where nothing is planted to help the gardens improve for next year.I dehydrated garlic chives.GI called they changed the plan... I am to take 2nd round of biologic this weekend and the last 80 MG on Tuesday. The following Tuesday 40 mg to start the every other week schedule. Worried because I usually have an attack from beginning of Sept to late Oct.Raining again but all the laundry except 2 pairs of jeans was dry.Hubby got in late, he ripped his pants from his pocket to mid thigh loading equipment. He picked up a job for tomorrow morning. Guy was flooded and thought he best  get his load out while the river was down. We had left over pizza.ThursdayHubby did the delivery and got a flat tire on the trailer. He ended up buying a new tire at the local trailer place instead of the tire place. Still wasn't a bad price of $120 for a 10 ply tire. He has a spare for it but with hauling blocks for the neighbor tomorrow wanted to have that new tire.Paid last of the bills for June and July mortgage.Caught a over charge on one of the bills and got that corrected.Got a notice through email that the socks and underwear Hubby prefers was on sale, plus I found a coupon so since I had the extra $200 (no I didn't spend $200) I ordered him a year's supply.He also needs new pair of steel toe boots and asked if I would start checking prices as he can order them on line.Canceled a second magazine that originally started paid by our health ins. Saved $9.00 as now we would have to pay for it.Patched a pair of jeans for Hubby.Did a load of laundry of new shirts that came in and hung of drying rack.I dehydrated garlic scapes ... first time doing this  so not sure if this will actually work decent.I vacuumed bag the bfast pork chops, bfast steaks and dinner pork chops I had flash froze. I had wrapped them in plastic wrap and wanted better long term protection. I sliced the angel food cake I bought and put the last of the cream cake and the shortcakes in the freezer to be vacuumed bagged tomorrow.We had rolled up stuffed flank steak with roasted red bell peppers, pistachio pesto and provolone, and hash browns. Ice cream for dessert.FridayHubby and E going after building blocks today so he packed his lunch, a snack and a thermos of coffee. Texted me around 10 and said they were going to be more work than was thought and it would be late before he got home.To go ahead and eat without him.M asked me to go get her mother in law to help her with the kids while M worked in the gardens. So I let mother in law know the men were going to be later than they thought so she could tell M (E is her Hubby)I did a couple loads of laundry and hung them on the kitchen clothes line. A small pond is at the yard clothes line.Charlotte is having fun running through it splashing the muddy water as both Wilbur and Rascal can show as they are now covered with splatters from her doing it.Both Hubby's socks and underwear was on sale and I got a discount code so I ordered them now instead of waiting for until this fall. They were 50% off and I got free shipping. He is going to need a new pair of boots as I noticed the toe of his one boot is cut on top. Should last him until fall.Daughter 4 asked if we had any full size sheets, blankets, bath towels or kitchen towels. Her's is worn through that she bought from yard sales and thrift shops. So I am going through some stuff in the barn to see what I do have. I do have a couple sets of sheets from Dad's that she can have.M came over and asked if I could take her and baby to urgent care. She got a babysitter for the kids and had her mother in law go with us. Three month old has walking pneumonia. Regretfully the meds the doctor ordered was not available any where in town so I took mother and baby home. Grandma went and borrowed nebulizer and I took her home to get Grandpa and their buggy while I drove 1 hr to another store to get the meds. AND an hr back to give them to them. I also kept Hubby updated so Daddy E could stay in the loop of info.ON top of the neither woman had MONEY, Their hubbys had all the cash. M had the check book but the pharmacy wouldn't take her check because she does not have an ID. I paid for everything. They struggled more with that not only because they didn't have the money, never thought to have money on them but they felt they failed on taking care of the little one. I brought up the Bible verse of carrying each others burdens. Grandma started rattling off all the verses of helping one another and then M joined in. A very long day, both exhausted so I decide to take my biologic tomorrow.Saturday, we had to load the trailer with the furniture that we had planned to load the day before that was going to Daughter 4 and Son 2. Forgot the pans I was giving Daughter 3 so I will mail them.AND forgot the picnic table we was giving Son 2. Daughter 1 asked if I had her box of stuff around but I didn't because I am still finding stuff that is going to her.Got stuff to Daughter 4, her 2 boys helped unload their stuff.Got to stuff Son 2, he helped unload his stuff, Hubby did the repairs he had agreed to do and then reloaded the trailer with 2 furniture in serious need of repairs, 2 cement drain things for down spouts , 4 metal picnic table chairs , a trash can of limbs he forgot to give Daughter 2 but she's moved so we didn't have to drop them off to her because she doesn't have a fire pit now, and the basket ball hoop that was at his driveway when he bought the house 4 yrs ago that he finally decided to get rid of since no one wanted it.On way home we side tracked and picked up the new frig.AND stopped and ate dinner since it was already 7 pm.We did use the tractor to bring the new frig in , loaded on the forks and put it through the French doors. We uncrated it and I cleaned it. It's sitting in the corner of the front room.At  9 and we  showered and went to bed. NO injections. AT 10 pm E was knocking on the door with the news the person they borrowed nebulizer from needed it back Monday night because they were leaving town and wanted to take it with them. PANIC was all over his face as baby needs it another 10 days. I text foster sister as her son has been on one all his 33 yrs (lungs damaged due to pure oxygen at birth) and asked where to go and let me know Sunday.Sunday 8 AM... foster sister calls, she has an extra one (3rd hand) . It works (she tested it) and she was sanitizing it and her Hubby and son was gathering what ever equipment they could find to go with it. Son has a new one and supplies. Made him feel good to help another as he is disabled (all his life) and not been able to do much for others in his own eyes. SO I went over at 10 and let the family know one was on it's way and would be there in the afternoon after lunch... Hard to see E cry with relief. He is going tomorrow with M and baby (Hubby is taking them and sitting in on appt with doctor at their request) and he is getting a prescription for a new one... I made a dozen phone calls to find a place that has one in stock or could get in within 24 hrs. Walmart had a 4 day wait.Rite Aid has it in stock and could get one from a hospital supply store in 24 hrs of they are sold out.  Sis got down here at 1 , Hubby took it over just as the grandparents were arriving from church so it went well as he not only showed the parents how to use it but the grandparents. He also shared some things to help Baby A when she is coughing. Their daughter L mentioned I told them to hold the baby a different way and that opened the door to cupping Baby A back also to help break things up. Hubby also stressed that even though help was coming to stay with them (E stopped on way home Friday and made those arrangements) that E needed to not be gone 12 hrs a day until Baby A was better. From a few comments made it sound like grandparents felt the same. Without a cell phone and only a buggy or not even that if he rides with some other Amish to a job a few hours away, getting him home in an emergency isn't going to happen..8:30 pm INJECTIONS... wasn't the best I had hoped for but not the worse either.Bed, definitely bed.How did your week go?"},
{"title": "10 day busy ", "date": "Monday, June 17, 2019", "text": "OK, hubby got home from fishing, we went the next day and picked out the new frig. Saved 1/3 of costs... for the first time when something quit working the replacement was on sale.E came over with his older 6 children and fished for an hour and got over 30 fish. They had 2 meals from it.We have had rain 5 days out of the last 7 and expect to have 6 days of rain out of the next 7. Gardens are under water, not sure if anything will survive.Hubby picked up 4 last minute jobs last week ...good thing because 2 jobs got canceled this week as the Amish can't get out and we can't get in due to flooding of the Scioto River.We multi tasked our errands on Monday and Tuesday including going to the grocery store and replacing what we lost. I did \"OK\" I got the same things but also go meat for  buy one get one... I made sure the price point was still with in my range. Hubby got his truck maintenance done and thought to ask what brakes was going to cost him as he will most likely need that in 3-6 mos. Thursday we had the energy audit. Glad I had it done even though Hubby thought it was a waste. The windows we thought needed replaced don't need replaced.. it's not the windows but the actual frames around them that is leaking air. Our side attics is the worst of letting cold air in, as the person who put the insulation in didn't know it needed to have air barrier ( told us since that it's not an moisture issue we could just nail card board and it would be fine)also as when wind blows directly on insulation, it reduces the R value to next to nothing.Also suggested we do interior \"storm\" windows like they do with church's stain glass windows ... AND we can make our own... I need a LOT of caulking ... he said to ask if we could get a discount for buying a case of caulking at our local store. He made it clear we do great on keeping our electric down and thought the propane was reasonable until he went through the audit and then thought we did a GREAT job as he would have figured at least 2000 gals used NOT counting summer fill.... we did 1600 and 350 of that is what was the summer fill I just got it at the end of May instead of beginning of June.I was well enough to go visit my Daddy on Father's Dad... we sat on his bed and held each other. I can't remember the last time he held me like that. A memory that will last. He is getting weaker and starting to take more naps. AND EATS LIKE A HORSE  :)!!!! I took him strawberries from our neighbor for Father's day gift. No card, he no longer reads or like to look at things with writing on them.We stopped at Hubby's parents and gave his dad a outdoor.indoor thermometer that says this place is for the birds... they are bird watchers and have several feeders. They were feeling better also.We worked the budget, then reworked the budget and then did it again one more time. Went to our financial guy, he went over the budget, checked our IRAs and then went over the budget again. It's how it is going to be... not where any of us wanted as things are about twice as expensive as we had budgeted originally but it is what it is. I have supplements(holistic)  I have to take that I need to check out prices. I want quality items. M is checking with her mother in law that knows all about that kind of stuff.I have several things I need to change of how I am doing things first for my health to rebuild my immunity system and second to help get some things paid off, savings built back up and still eat healthy. With watching the garden drown... I know I have to work out a back up plan NOW."},
{"title": "In the kitchen. Mirepoix etc WARNING FRIG TOOK A CRAP", "date": "Friday, June 7, 2019", "text": "I enjoy the way my kitchen is laid out. It works well unless we both are at the coffee pots which both are at the corner where the silverware drawer is also. Since Hubby goes to that drawer automatically for silverware I put it there even though I wanted it at the end closer to the table. He usually sets the table so I let it be his choice.We are having more waste then either of us like. Not that any waste is okay but things are getting shoved to the back of the kitchen frig and not being used. I do pretty decent with the basement frig .Hubby admitted he asked me where something was the other night and I told him where I put it but since he couldn't find it he didn't use  it up and I found it yesterday and it's not good.SO today is change the kitchen (and my cooking practices) to not waste, be able to find what we are looking for without digging through the frig and have my different mirepoix where I can use it. To get back to cooking healthy flavorful foods.Okay... let's start with yes I am a chef, a personal/private chef. I do have some culinary education/training not cordon bleu.I am going through both frigs today. Combining condiments, tossing what isn't being used and organizing things. I will be grouping things together that are used together. AND finding room for my MirepoixI was raised by parents that grew up during the Great Depression with a great grandmother that was Cherokee, the other Amish and my Nonna (great uncle's mother in law that adopted me)was from Northern Italy. Between them and my culinary classes I use a lot of different mirepoix ...Mirepoix is what you start the dish you are making with and it doesn't matter what the dish is.French mirepoix is 2 parts onions, 1 part celery and 1 part carrot. Cajun Holy Trinity is 2 parts onions 1 part celery 1 part green bell pepperCuban/Latin (chef I worked for testing recipes and helping when she taught culinary classes) call it sofrito... Spanish onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, garlic, cumin, oregano, and Sazon without achiote seasoningSpanish call it sofrito also but use olive oil to cook the onion, garlic, bell peppers and tomatoesSuppengrun is Germany... my granddaughter speaks German fluently and her uncle on her Dad's side lives in Switzerland so she passed this to me as it's carrots,celeriac and leekNonna from Northern Italy (at base of Alps is all she would ever say) always started EVERYTHING with a battuto ... onions, carrots, celery,rosemary, garlic, thyme, parsley and a little of bacon or Canadian bacon to replace the pancetta, prosciutto or speck she used when in Italy. When this blend is COOKED it's called soffrito.  Really it didn't matter what she was cooking... eggs, it's in there, fried potatoes, it was in there. When she fried chicken she would brown it in the skillet then put it in the oven, add the battuto to the skillet and make sauce/gravy of what was there.SO I want in containers prepped onions, bell peppers, celery, and carrots  I will also prep mushrooms and black olives, I often toss in also,  so I can grab and toss in the pan. I figure prepping twice a week as I don't want anything to go bad.I organized the cheese drawer. Hubby is bad about using something up and not mentioning it's needed and also opening more than one of the same thing.SO I keep extra cheese in the freezer.The kitchen frig is good now so I can prep mirepoix.The basement frig is making noises again... so it needs dealt with..of course Hubby isn't home so appliances act up. Tuesday it was my coffee pot. Wednesday was my Toshiba laptop and the plug to my Kindle.OH CRAP..... basement frig took a crap... yes I know it's 10 yrs old, Yes I know we have had it worked on repeatedly to the point the repairman (a friend of my kids) actually showed me how to get it running again and again and again. It's the bigger of the two frigs and really nice for holding produce from the garden while I can or sale items. Condiments, extra dairy so I am not running to the store every week... We went without a second frig for about a year a couple years ago... that was a big pain as I ended up using a cooler and ice a lot during the garden season and then apples in the fall.Thankfully the freezer in the barn only had ice in it so all the frozen stuff that was still frozen solid is there. I have the dairy and the fruit I just bought in the kitchen frig now. I still have condiments, cabbage etc that is okay and in a cooler with ice.I lost the produce SIGH... I unplugged the frig, let it set over night and we'll see if it will start working again (have done this more than once) but now is the time to get a new frig to replace this. Hubby said when he got home we would check out what I was wanting and see about getting it.We both want French doors, freezer on bottom. At least 26 cu ft. Which is part of the problem with the one we have in the kitchen is it is too small.  You would think after all these years we would know better than to buy a smaller frig.Son 2 is still reminding me of what I told him when he bought his, better to have a little bigger than a too small frig.Son 2 did some research at his go to review sites while I checked mine.  I am leaning heavy towards LG LFXS38968D (black stainless steel) 27.9 cu ft... for the kitchen and moving the kitchen frig to the basement. I think Hubby will like it as he gets a bit tired bending over to get ice and this one has it on the doorFrig working... but I don't trust it, so what goes in it is condiments etc. NO produce or dairy. I am glad it's working. I hope it holds until we get a new one.Got to go clean the home, Hubby on his way.... 13 hrs before he will be here... the first 4 hrs he is the passenger so he is cat napping."},
{"title": "a quiet morning after storms", "date": "Thursday, June 6, 2019", "text": "after a night of storms and tornadoes going north of us ,it's a quiet morning. I have dragging butt syndrome with only 3 hrs of sleep while still coughing and hacking ...not as bad but still SIGH.The yard is a soggy mess that I would have to wear muck boots to get the yard clothesline so laundry is on the kitchen porch clothesline.For the first time ever, Charlotte hid from the storms. It was the one that produced tornadoes so that's something for us to keep in mind when she heads to the basement. I am glad I had no glass jars on that shelf as it was,she moved a 5 gal bucket of rice to get back in there. Usually it's Rascal trying to crawl under me and hide his face.But instead he decided to hid his face in the dried fruit shelf.Wilbur has no care in the world no matter how bad it storms or how many guns are being shot ... we have a hunting club within a couple miles of us and they have skeet shooting around once a month. He can snooze through the whole thing.He didn't even look up when I closed the door during the first storm or opened it back up.Just kept snoring away like he had no cares.I did go out and put the flowers back up first thing this morning that I had placed down so they could get a good drink of rain water last night.This is the rose bush my sister of my heart gave me. I didn't figure it would bloom any if at all when it being the first year it's planted.Laundry is drying on the line so I can mark that off.I won't be in the garden and I don't think it will dry out enough before Hubby gets home from fishing for me to get the rest of the garden in. I was hoping that I could get it done so it was just maintain after he got home.I won't spray for the bugs/ants outside the house either.I'll do the home blessing tomorrow so the house is nice and clean for him to come home to. Do the laundry of bedding and throw blankets also tomorrow, should be able to walk to the yard clothes line by then if we don't get any more rain.Guess I will go play in the kitchen"},
{"title": "Frugal moments and this week's plans as Hubby fishes", "date": "Tuesday, June 4, 2019", "text": "Hubby is deep sea fishing in Florida. We live in Ohio. His Alabama buddy and him went last year as I paid Hubby's share of the trip as a retirement gift for him. This year his(our) buddy retired so another deep sea fishing trip. I can see this becoming a once a year thing as they have been good friends as close as brothers for over a decade.  They are being frugal with how they are doing this.Hubby turned his Bunn coffee pot off since he won't be here making his coffee. That type of coffee pot is always left on to keep the water hot to make coffee in 3-4 min.Hubby drove my car (25 mpg and not his truck which is 10 mpg). They are driving Buddy's truck (S10 truck 20 mpg) from his home in AL to cut the costs for Hubby. Hubby is using Gas buddy app find best prices for gas. He took coffee, water, apples and hand pies I made for him to eat while traveling. He drove through the night, less traffic, no rush hours of stop and go and very little construction. His buddy and him are eating bfast at Buddy's local restuarant that gives seniors a break on bfast.Buddy has a \"membership\" to a hotel (a lot of his work he has to stay in hotels) and got a midweek discount. The $150 room  was gotten for $85 including taxes for them to split the costs. They are staying 3 nights. Included in the hotel price , is bfast including protein so they won't have to go somewhere else and pay $10 for bfast as Hubby would just skip the meal but buddy is a diabetic. There is a gym (buddy works out twice a day to keep control of his diabetes) and a hot tub (Hubby will definitely be in that).Also they got a discount on the fishing boat by RSVPing before the open booking date. Saving $15 each on each of the 2 trips they booked.Buddy took the fishing equipment so Hubby doesn't have to rent any.Hubby took a \"lunch\" cooler and a big cooler. Big cooler will be for any fish brought home. Lunch cooler is they go to the store and buy their lunch and snacks. They will eat their dinners at a couple places that does senior citizen discounts on some of the meals.They will be checking out the Market stands selling fresh produce on the way home.We took the 3 dogs to the vet's. Wilbur had been limping last week, we thought just a pull or maybe arthritis.He has lost 10 lbs over the spring GO WILBUR. He is almost down to where he should be for his size but the vet was very happy with where he is. He was 150 lbs when daughter 2 had him. It was just a pull but does have arthritis.Rascal had been limping, another pull plus he now has a fatty tumor (common and not cancer). He is holding steady on his weight but needs to be a little less as he is no spring chicken. He got his annual shots.The \"boys\" need to remember they are not spring chicks like Charlotte and can't be jumping off the kitchen porch or out the French doors(since the deck isn't there yet) and run like all get out to see what she is running after or barking at.Charlotte is good. A little underweight but that might always be due to Daughter 2 not getting her dewormed as a pup. GRR.BEST of it ... I asked for 6 months heart and flea/tick meds as Wilbur and Charlotte aren't due for shots for 6 months. I figure we can cut toe nails ourselves saving $10 each dog (that's $180 savings total not counting gas taking them). The young lady took the time to figure out how many free ones I could get as it was buy this amt and get this free. She saved us $90 PLUS filled out and sent in for a rebate for us for $12 for us. They also waved the $25 office fee for each of the dogs because we got their nails clipped($10 each) Saving us $75. THE local vet here charges $46 per dog for office visit and $32 for toe nail per dog on top of the office visit AND the same meds were over $5 more per package. Well worth our drive back over to the old vet. PLUS here they only give 1 year rabies and our vet does 3 yr rabies for the same price as 1 yr. In 6 months I will have the money saved up again to buy another 6 months of meds and visit. NEXT time all 3 will have heart worm tests, Wilbur and Charlotte get their annual shots. Young lady gave me the costs of that so I would know what I needed to save up.Hubby was given 2 gift cards for helping couple of neighbors that we used to eat out.We decided to not go to the store this past weekend. I am going to chiro this afternoon and will pass right by a discount store that I want to check out first. Last time I saved over half of what I would have spent at Aldi's or Save A Lot.I harvested garlic scapes. the only radishes that grew and basil from the gardens.Plans for the rest of this week by myselfgoing to chiro and stopping at discount store.planting more in the garden.clean and repaint old desk to put in front room for my computer so clear the bfast counter.change how the kitchen is set up to function better.do the test paint in the mudroomgo through at least 2 boxes of stuff from barn.AND do some cleaning and organizing.How are you all doing?"},

I am walking to 4-6 places to get stuff to put a meal together (which means it doesn't get put together if we are both tired or I am sick which I am still sick). I used to have a prep counter that held what I used daily and a \"basket\" in the frig from my containers of dice onion, celery, carrots, bell peppers.I need to change this kitchen to get that back together.Clean, repaint and set up old computer desk in front room for my computer. That clears 1 1/2 x 4 ft off the bfast counter that I can use for appliances. We sit at the table and use the bfast counter for my computer or any project we are working on. nag Hubby about smoker on rainy daysGO over finances as we meet with our financial guy in a couple weeks.clear garden shedget house ready for energy auditSUMMER CURTAINSSand and wash area of wall to do apply test paint for contractor that has to redo 4 rooms (half the house) due to bad paint... which actually the paint company said it's not \"bad\" paint but the contractor didn't specify that I wash walls (I repeatedly told them I did) so they use a middle of the road paint where if they had said something to the paint company they would have told them for the deep pigmentation I choose AND me washing the walls, they would need a higher level of paint.. Lessons learned. The section I am doing the test paint on is about 4 ft by 3 ft. so it's not a big area but still takes time to prep, paint, sand between coats etc.Finish cleaning pantry (1 1/2 shelves and 3 deep freezers)BOTHFinish getting garden in (please no rain for 3 days in a row would be GREAT)join a gym... looking at Anytime fitness or YMCA. IF we do YMCA we could also go with Hubby's parents at their YMCA.Join Son 2 on motorcycle rides."},
{"title": "One thing after another... Air fryer also", "date": "Wednesday, May 29, 2019", "text": "Rain every other day, ground is now like bricks from the beating. Couldn't even get the tiller to break it up... so Hubby spaded up holes for some of the plants and we put compost and potting soil in the holes with the plants. The beans are not going to make at all. Popcorn is still iffy...At least we didn't lose them in the 2 inches of rain we got in 90 mins or the constant daily down pours ... yet... Neighbor E lost the entire front garden they had just planted with seeds.... haven't been able to get back in it to replant. He lost the hay he just planted and might lose 2 fields of corn that aren't being able to dry out.We cut the last of the asparagus and left the tall ones to become ferns and gave it to H and his family as their asparagus didn't do well and they got 3 meals out of it.The day before the tornadoes came through we had wind damage...This is looking out my bedroom window. Winds took the roof off the basement ramp... thankful there was no damage to house and a few blocks knocked loose that can be dealt with a temporary fix and this area is on next years to completely redo.It landed at the end of kitchen porch,Got stopped by the crabapple tree.Hubby tied it to the tree and the porch brace to stop it from going anywhere else until the winds calmed down.Next day he cemented the blocks back that had shifted and fixed the roof and put it back on.He added braces to it that should stop it from being able to be lifted even though it weighed about 200 lbs. It's closer to 300 now with the bracesTree didn't get damaged, not even bark knocked off.Since Hubby had to go get cement for the basement ramp, he fixed the yard clothesline that the deadman came out of ground and let the pole lean in when he went to tighten the lines so the sheets wouldn't drag. Said it was dried before it rained (tornadoes went through but didn't damage anything here or around us) But he needs to drive the tractor over the dirt to pack it down when the yard isn't a mud puddle.this is in what we call the cubby... area between the two porches... babies are getting ready to learn to fly... I never can get a shot of them sticking their heads out. AND since this is an area that the dogs can get to  I put up fence so if the birds fall to the ground they have a chance to get back up before the dogs get to them.Since the water hose valve is there I put a big flower pot there with 3 stones to keep it weighed down, turned another flower pot upside down inside it and then put one of my hanging planters on top of it. We can move the pot when needed and yet the dogs won't mess with it. I am glad we keep this stuff around.ThenI started cooking in the air fryer... May 19th....Hand pies were good and will be on the menu more oftenSo I decided to try a pork loinand heard a pop and then watched the inside glass break... I emailed a complaint through Amazon to the seller. I did acknowledge that I knew this was a supplier issue and would like a replacement instead of a refund.  I was thinking I wouldn't get an answer back,until Monday. Sunday night they responded...Monday they let me know they contacted their supplier of that safety glass and Tuesday they shipped thisI did NOT have to nag, battle or anything else... 1 email and it was done and I had heard there was issues with their customer service. I didn't have any, if anything I would say it was the best customer service I've dealt with in the past months.SO after cleaning, heating, cleaning and reheating it (it's coated with protective oil on inside) I cooked this10 mins and it was on the platter and on the kitchen porch table for our snack.Memorial day we had thisSteaks on the grill withonion rings and broccoli fries.... CRISPY in 15 min. I did rotate the trays every 5 mins.IF you noticed in the picture I have a wood cutting board under it and on the end of the bfast bar. It does produce heat on the bottom and I don't want heat on my counter top. It's on the end which was due to space but I can tell you it helped with the heat coming off it. The air around it came up 10 degrees.... yes I measured it. I made sure there was NO paper or anything that could catch fire close to it (think stove). I like it that it's big... I could get 4 trays in it with 2 being onion rings that take more space so had to adjust to that.Not sure what I will pop in it next.THEN I went to the doctor for follow up due to getting bronchitis hoping I was good to start my biologic...NOPE... I am borderline bronchial pneumonia ... different meds along with inhaler 6 times a day do deep breathing exercises every 30 mins.. and go back the 18th of June.  AND then if I am HEALTHY I can start my biologic.Hubby has had to turn down a couple jobs, they don't want to pay him even his costs and he's not going to lose money to get work. E asked me what was going on and I told him , the other guy's truck is gas and Hubby's is diesel which costs more plus Hubby's livestock trailer is bigger so uses more fuel to pull and he's not going to lower to match someone else and lose money. E said it's like him using 6 horses (more oats and hay ) to pull his equipment where his brother N uses 3 horses (less oats and hay) . Yep you got it."},

She is trying to get me to move out of my chair on the kitchen porch which she now has decided is HER chair.Then it was fine, I will go over here and sit in Daddy's chair and pout.I shifted in the chair and she was looking to see if I was out of HER chair yet.The temp is 60 and that is the warmest it is getting today as we to drop in temp all day until it's 45 tonight. Furnace is back on. I have laundry rolling and I will clean out the frigs and some more of the pantry as trash goes to the road tonight.I pinned a sheer curtain that will go on the French doors. I will have to sew them by hand as my sewing machine hates sheer fabric and I don't care to fight with it. I can do the hand sewing while watching cook shows on tv in the evening.I don't usually watch more than the news but Hubby started watching them and asked me to watch some with him. We get a kick out of Nick Stellino as he reminds me of my brother. British bake off is interesting also. Others he watches are Simply Ming, Martha Bakes, Patti's Table, Lydia's kitchen,and Rory O'Connell if he is on.I really really just want to go  back to bed and lay there. Don't care if I sleep, just lay there. Depression and I are old friends, I think he is a cousin to Crohny (my Crohns).Even with everything we did in the garden to help bring the soil back up, I don't think it was enough. Rain coming in every 2-3 days isn't helping. Neither will this cold snap.  In GOD's Hands is what I keep repeating to myself, I do the work, keep the faith and leave it in his hands.I only have half in which is a concern,I don't have the flowers planted at the windmill either. I told Hubby it was going in this week even if I have to mud it in. E and M don't have anything in and E said over half of their church (180 families) don't have anything in or what was in has flooded and rotted.Deck isn't getting done due to the rain also. We did go out and mark the area. Which was good as after I mentioned we would be standing in front of the door trying to grill like we did on 245, Hubby moved the deck 2 feet so that wasn't going to be going on. It will allow us to change the down spout to drain farther away from the house also. E is going to put an awning on for me and he is doing it so when it rains I can still have the doors open if we ever get the deck on.Can't get to the dog house, it's a muddy swamp where it is, chicken coop hasn't been moved for the same reason. Can't clear the garden shed until AFTER we take furniture to Son 2, Daughter 4 and maybe Daughter 2 as she is thinking of taking the last of the furniture as that's where the garden stuff goes. I have 4 boxes of Daddy's stuff left to go through.Hubby's schedule and Son's 2 schedule has not worked out as Hubby wants to haul the furniture down and do the odd jobs at the same time. Daughters have kids in and out so someone is usually home so they don't care when we bring it down to themHubby trims the day after rain and tries to mow the entire area the following day.Last week he got slammed with work even with having one person cancel 2 jobs...actually turned out better as he picked up 4 jobs for the same time and now has plenty of money for his fishing trip. He said his goal is to have one of the 3 trailers \"paid off\" meaning the money is back in the investment accts. He also was able to give me money to give to our grandson that is graduating. BUT because he was \"working\", he wasn't able to do all he wanted after yard work and garden work..I look at all that is NOT done and don't see what is done....I don't see that I cleared the southeast corner of the front room and moved the radio Son 2 got us for Christmas into the dining room where we will actually listen to the local news in the mornings while having coffee like we did growing up. Which now allows me to bring in another small table to sit my computer at and take it off the bfast bar in the kitchen. I can then use that section for canning supplies when I am canning. Hubby said I need to paint the table before bringing it in.I don't see that I moved all the grow light cart plants out to harden off. Have 2 that is going to end up in pots as they aren't doing well out in the wind and sun. I want to declutter a basement area , (the last area in the basement to declutter) and move the  grow cart there for next winter.I don't see that the pile that is commonly at the basement door is not there.I don't see that I have my sewing area set up except for the sewing table that Hubby found me last night. Wednesday and Thursday are suppose to be rainy days so that's a good time to be sewing. SO he is planning to have the sewing table put together by tomorrow.Son 2 called last night to let me know he would be bringing friends up to see us probably this coming weekend... figured I would like a week's notice as he already knows the house isn't company ready. I do like to dust and clean the floors of fur before I have company. THEN he mentioned us feeding them and he would pay for the groceries...  deep breath... okay.I will watch the weather after Thursday and see if we will grill out or cook inside before making the decision of what to get.Washer buzzing, next load to the line."},

IF we do any of the work they suggest and provide receipts we can be credited up to $50 on our electric bill.  I asked if he could estimate how much propane I would save by doing $50 of what ever... close to $100 savings of propane as an estimate.I do need to do some preparing for the test.Hubby has been driving the Jeep for anything that does not require a trailer. He said he figured out he saved $80 in the past 2 weeks.I finished one summer curtain for the laundry room as it faces south and the heat is starting to warm up that room and my bedroom.I turned the furnace OFF... might have to kick it on during the night a couple times this coming week but it's off. By doing this I also might fingers crossed make this tank last until June so it's filled on the summer fill which is CHEAPER fillI refused to turn the central air on...told Hubby to open the windows (he had to remove winter storm windows anyways on front room to install the screens ) turn on ceiling fan when he is in the room and I turned on a small rotating fan on low for Wilbur and Rascal (who is black), both are old dogs and can't handle the heat during the middle of the day when it's over 80. After supper the fan is turned off until lunch the next day. Rascal will nudge it with his foot when he wants it on LOL.I had bought screen repair that was suppose to be self sticking but wasn't. Hubby told me to throw it away and he would go get new...nope I super glued the patches to the screen. Amish guy that was stopped looking for Hubby asked how I fixed them as he had some spare screen but not enough to replace his entire window screen.Our softener salt lasted 9 days longer than regularly. I've been using the cistern water to water my plants. Better for them also.I used my digital dollars at Amazon to order a book for my Kindle.I used my Rakuten rebates,Swagbucks points and Pine Cone pay to order 2 new roasting pans that have racks and handles on the pans. Hubby and I both are having trouble lifting roasting pans (especially turkey) without handles.I used American Test Kitchen to decide what I wanted.I didn't go to the store until today. I limped us through. BUT today I bought for a basic grocery list AND for the airfryer we bought for testing how it does this week. My brother, sister,Hubby's best friend, and 3 of the kids are interested in how it does.In the end with how I saved, we have over half of July's budget in savings. So Hubby can go on his fishing trip without worrying how to make up the loss of income when he gets home."},
{"title": "Being frugal while sick....winter sowing", "date": "Friday, May 17, 2019", "text": "The rose my oldest sister(of my heart) has bloomed.You would never guess it's been raining pretty much every other day here with the way this soil looks. My beans are planted here.With in  1/2 inch of the top soil it's mud. The quality of the soil is bad. E said the guy the owed it before his brother just kept planting the same crops in the same spot and never added compost or anything. N only lived here 1 yr so he wasn't able to get it turned around before we bought it.Tomatoes, peppers, marigolds and rosemary... lots of compost in the holes and fertilizer later.The gourmet potatoes in the grow bags are doing decentThe winter sowing I did the first round did very wellThe second round did hardly anything but the weather was colder than normal and we got twice as much rain as normal so I think that was the why they didn't do well.I am getting about 1 16 ft section done at a time before I have to go hack and cough while I work in the gardens looking like thisMy allergies went nuts and I went in to bronchitis the day before I picked this up at drug storeI now have bronchitis GRRR... now I can't take it due to being sick and on antibiotics... waiting until I am cleared by primary doc and then I can start. SIGHSince I was sick and I have no flowers (didn't buy any at auction either) I cut some crabapple blooms for myself.So while out for doctors' appts we stopped at a store the Amish had mentioned. It's called Stites. It's a discount variety store, had some coolers for marked down dairy etc. but mostly dry goods. I got bfast bars for 49 cents a box, face masks I wore in garden (50 in a box for  less than $2), I got a bottle of chipotle molasses marinade for us and Son 2 for 50 cents. I got 1 birthday gift, 3 Christmas gifts and a sign to hang over our archway between dining room and front room for 1/4th of what I had priced else where. Reminds me of the old Odd Lots aka Big Lots.We stopped at Menards and used rebate check to get fertilizer and weed killer during 11% sale.I have still not went to grocery store because of this...After reading bloggers, reviews, talking to others including daughter 1 who has an airfryer  and knowing it dehydrates also (I need another dehydrator as 1 died end of last year and this was the same price)... we broke down and ordered it.It came in yesterday while I was in the garden and Hubby was trimming and mowing around wet areas.I unpacked it today, cleaned it and read all the instructions (please do if you buy one READ ALL OF IT) and we decided we were going to pick out some of the recipes and do the \"test drive\" of it this week.Meantime I am going to take another round of meds for this bronchitis and go find a table in the barn for my sewing machine as I found the scissors finally."},

I chose to have my primary doctor monitor my heart failure (he already does now) instead of getting a Cardiologist and paying another doctor who will run tests my primary already ran. I have left sided heart failure, not a lot of anything they can do at this point, I am on meds for it. I am glad to see there is experimental surgeries that look to be helping left heart failure.I found the straight pens to start on the curtains... now I can't find the scissors. GEEZE.We spent hours in the asparagus patch (4 ft by 120 ft) pulling weeds especially thistles and crab grass the last couple days, almost done, probably if we worked together we could finish it in 1 more round.I transplanted some volunteer strawberries that had came up in what was the old strawberry patch we took out due to blight. These didn't show any signs of blight.We went to produce auction and bought 2 flats of candy onions, 1 flat of cabbage, 1 flat of cauliflower and 10 of 4 1/2 pots of tomatoes.We then went to the local green house and got 1 flat of broccoli, 1 flat of Amish paste tomatoes and 2 flats of marigold that had not bloomed yet.I have plants in the grow lights cart that needs harden off starting this week.Looks like we can be planting what we bought this afternoon after Hubby gets backs.I told Hubby I would pick up milk when I got get my Humira.

So we are working on July which is NICE since Hubby will be deep sea fishing during a week in June.Since May's bills are paid including what medical bills were in, I think there is 2 left going through ins still.... I had EXTRA grocery money. We together checked what we had and talked about what we wanted.We decided against freezing asparagus. Don't like mushy asparagus and we know we don't like canned unless it's pickled... So I am pickling asparagus we don't eat fresh or give to family.Since we were over to Sidney yesterday for doctor appt we felt we should go to Aldi's for groceries for May's groceries. Hubby stopped over and said something to E & M asking if they needed anything. The WHOLE family as in parents, 6 adult children and spouses and all their kids was coming over to have a work day, cutting wood, making repairs, sewing etc. We ended up with a list (Thanks to M it was on 1 list not 7). Hubby took care of their list. I did ours. Since we have been asked repeatedly what Amish buy at Aldi's... veg oil, saltine crackers, powdered sugar, celery .iceberg lettuce,cream cheese and butter if less than $2.60/lb. I have seen them get bananas and whipped topping.I got :Milk, sour cream, cottage cheese, and 3 \"bars\" of cheese. I got Greek vanilla yogurt that less than a gallon of milk which would make the same amount of yogurt.lemons, limes, oranges, kiwis , and a pineapple, strawberries(to make Daddy a strawberry rhubarb pie for his 92nd birthday on the 3rd) bananas, mangoes and fresh figs. Avocados.Cherry tomatoes (anti pasta salad) Roma tomatoes for salads(cucumber tomato salad etc) and tomatoes for BLT'sHamburger for taco meatThin chicken breast for satayChicken breast for the grill for meChicken thighs for the grill for HubbyProsciutto and speck for a couple recipes Hubby wants to take to a cookout at end of month.Waffles and pancakes and hash brown patties...not something I normally buy but Hubby asked for them since we just finished what I had fixed for the freezer and it's not something I normally fix at dinner time during the summer.Celery, carrots, potatoes, garlic (completely out of what I grew), radishes, broccoli, green onions, cauliflower, cabbage, lettuce and mushrooms. I really think I need a \"green house or hoop house\" for winter/early spring growing.I bought bread products that I will freeze and bag in servings for us instead of the whole package. Hubby feels at this time with dealing with all the boxes and stuff on top of gardens that my time is better put towards those items and not towards baking all our breads. I got 1 loaf of sliced bread (as Daddy calls it) 2 pkgs croissants, 2 pkgs of bagels, 2 pkgs of English muffins, 2 pkgs of sub buns, 2 pkgs of hamburger buns,and 2 pkgs of hot dog buns. Actually that should last most of the summer. Tortilla wraps... 8 inch for wraps/enchiladas/burritos   and 6 inch for tacos .total came to $292.24..."},
{"title": "Lessons learned with dealing with Daddy's house ", "date": "Monday, April 29, 2019", "text": "Daddy usually smiles, if he isn't smiling something is wrong. Even the nursing home staff  has mentioned that if someone is down, Daddy will go visit them and then that person with start smiling along with him. Well he wouldn't have been smiling this weekend... he would have been kicking certain family members butts for the disrespect they showed by trashing his home to grab what they wanted instead of what they actually deserved especially since Daddy gave them money through the years as their inheritance when he wouldn't do that for Brother or me even after Brother confronted him about it. JUST and FYI, I gave paid off some of Mother's and stepfather's bills with my inheritance from them. I don't want the money. If they have something I would like I say something then, if I get it fine, if I don't fine.Since my brother is a hoarder... that's a different on how he looks at things.Since Daddy has been in the nursing home over a year and we definitely know he isn't coming out  and I pushed for his house to be sold or at least rented out (Brother is paying the balance between what ins and Daddy's income covers) and put towards taking care of Daddy. Brother put word out he was going to sell the house, figured he would get a realtor and we had at least 30 days if not more because it's not in a great area, lots of poverty surrounds him since the factories closed down usually takes a year to get a house sold.House sold in 24 hrs, Brother is going through Daddy's lawyer to make sure everything is at is should be and then came the news that closing would be in 10-14 days... We got the message on Wed. Sister in law and our schedules didn't mesh until Saturday and only for 2 1/2 hrs.We walked into a nightmare... and she was overwhelmed as she had a wedding rehearsal as she is a preacher. AND there was mold and feather pillows that triggered her allergies in the house.. SO we agreed if she was willing to let us in, we could work without her BUT she had to walk through the house before and after before we left .  We were suppose to come back on MONDAY.My brother made a bad decision (his words) over trusting another family member to get certain things that had been made for Daddy by their dad WITHOUT him being there which they did BUT they gave the key to another family member who wanted something that they had made for Daddy (it's what they said) Definitely ransacked the house and it was apparent they thought they would find cash hidden, something Daddy used to do but I can tell you we had already cut his \"cash\" flow off LONG before he went in the nursing home.Family member who gave the key was upset along with Brother who stressed out and I was more than willing to punch the person and they know it.Brother got the call from the lawyer ON SATURDAY that the closing would be Tuesday.... SO Brother called us to come back on Sunday so if needed we could finish on Monday morning and he could get the trash out before Tuesday morning.I packed a cooler with boiled eggs, sliced cheese, crackers and apples. Filled several water bottles and Hubby took a thermos of coffee. Brother looked like death warmed over, he has been sick with his allergies, other health issues and is going to be 70 and caught himself and got checked...he is in the very early stages of dementia that stress of changing jobs, his own moving, dealing with Daddy, and then the house (before it was trashed) of course  makes everything even worse and now dealing with a family member over trashing the house.So Hubby and I  not only took what we wanted, we cleared it completely since we know he got everything he wanted out of the house. All the clothes was put in one area so Brother could haul it out easier. HEAVENS 52 underwear, 52 socks, 52 muscle tanks aka dress tee shirts,52 short sleeve button down shirts, 52 long sleeve flannel shirts, 52 long sleeve dress shirts, 52 sports jackets, 52 dress pants, 52 pairs of jeans, 52 ties, and 52 suits along with 24 pairs of shoes and 14 pairs of slippers.Brother is hauling all of it to a ministry that helps those that can't afford clothes or needs \"work\" clothes for an office job. We bagged 95% of the trash and put it in one area also. Garage wasn't done as well, there is nothing left but trash but it's hazard trash,such as fuel and oil and paint.SO on top of dealing with the mess. I had to accept that things Daddy had wanted to be passed down where beyond keeping. Hubby picked up a bed frame that was to go and it to fall apart where it had rotted in his hands. Dishes were chipped so bad I would have been afraid to use them. He was using 1 plate,1 bowl and 1 cup...those were in good condition. When family came in he used paper plates so it wasn't caught.Heart breaking that he didn't use things himself and wanted to pass it on, but didn't do so while they were still of use.So lesson's learned... check furniture including the areas you don't normally see until you take the bed apart, bottom of dressers, drapes, and mattresses . IF you are in charge of someone that goes in a nursing home,check for dirty dishes in the oven (hum... yes, I found them), have someone not only mow the yard but clean the house and don't throw newspaper in the door and toss junk mail around (Brother's butt now kicked by me) instead of throwing in trash.Better yet CANCEL newspaper and save the money. Everyone in the neighborhood knew he was in the nursing home. We tallied what we are now dealing with... 5 boxes I have held from my late husband that his only child did not have room for. She agreed to find room by this summer as I want them out of here.40 boxes from a daughter who said the boxes were ours from the old homestead and not hers only for me to find out when I started working on them they were ALL hers or her sons. I've talk directly to the sons since 2 are adults and the other 2 soon to be about if they want this stuff or not.One is planning on coming up this summer and going through it.12 boxes that were from Mother's estate and that Pop gave us at that time since he knew he was going into the nursing home. He passed a couple years after Mother.From Daddy's 12 boxes and couch (Daughter 4), 2 stands(Son 2) 2 dressers , 2 bureaus, 1 bed frame and mattress/box spring and 1 cabinet and 1 metalwork bench... the cabinet and workbench goes to Son 2. He tried to buy it from Daddy but he said he was still using it 3 yrs ago. The rest of the kids had gotten some things through the years and wasn't interested in anything that was left. Daughter 4 said anything we want to get rid of to bring to her. She now has a list of 10 families that are searching for stuff for their homes.I was down to 40 boxes of our stuff and half is either fabric or yard.AND REALLY all I want to do is have less rain so I can plant the gardensThanks for listening LOLBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Busy week", "date": "Tuesday, April 23, 2019", "text": "MondayThe manager from the paint store came and down checked ALL the paint in the house. Noticed I had a coat rack and broom rack sitting in the mudroom and told me to NOT put anything on the walls until after they figure out what to do about the paint after the testing comes back. SINCE I kept all the paint cans that still had paint they were able to test that paint instead of taking a sample off my walls.This is the paint off the mudroom wall, it's a dark teal metallic... they were thinking the metallic was the problem BUT the 24 x 24 ft crimson front room is doing it , the cobalt blue dining room is doing and the lime green laundry room is doing it. I was shocked the purple in the bedroom was NOT doing it.I finished the laundry after the guy left and worked on turkey.I did soil tests on north and south gardens. North garden needs nitrogen.. South garden needs nitrogen and potash.TuesdayErrands and chiro appt. We got the potting soil for the grow bags for the potatoes. We were getting 1 cu ft bags as that is easier for me to move, they had the 2 cu ft on sale ... so we went with the 2 cu ft bags. I just told Hubby I would use the 1 cu ft ones I have to do the flower pots with and he would have to help me with dealing with the 2 cu ft. Saving us $148.They didn't have enough of the bags for all that I needed but I told Hubby I can watch for the next sale and finish picking them up then.We went to chiro.... Hubby wasn't any worse than he normally is ...but it's the first time I ever heard my chiro cuss when he started examining me... I was told to knock the Sh.. off and told Hubby to keep me off the ground which Hubby being to smarty pants he is said he couldn't since I had to be on the ground to WALK.  He warned me I would be VERY SORE and have a headache for 2 days... I already was sore and had a migraine. DUH. What usually takes him 5 mins took him 20 min. He adjusted, waited about 5 min and the adjust again until it quit popping back out of place. The combination of my knees being out and my cerebral palsy acting up was causing me to fall. With drawl from from the medication they gave me after being in the hospital which I just finished triggered my CP. Migraine went away and eased down to a regular headache that went away at 2 am the next day. Little \"shakey\" with the knees , just going down sideways when on stairs when I am not sitting on my butt going up and down the stairs.We were going to go to the grocery store... I tossed that out after the adjustment to come home and crawl in bed.WednesdayJust a little bit of headache and not much soreness and a beautiful day...Hubby moved the burn barrel to where we can use it.and then dump the ashes into the gardens.I picked our first batch of asparagus for dinnerThursdayWe spent the afternoon putting down weed barrier in the south garden for walk paths.We only have 10 of the cross sections done but the rain was starting to coming in so we called it a day and put every thing away.FridayIt's a rainy day and we were planning on being outside...no go now. BUT this week we got 38 items off the punch list and about half off our monthly to do goals. Hubby is going to help move some calves and a bull for a friend tomorrow. SO we are taking today to relax and look over the goals and the punch list and the weather forecast which is NOT working with us.Today is the last day of school for the Amish. The boys will be going to the fields to help their dads and the girls will be in the gardens or watching smaller children for their mom's.L is leaning over to tie her shoe.It's amazing to watch these children all under the age of 12 with their work ethic ... Reminds Hubby of his childhood a lot. I didn't think anything of walking a mile to my friend's house to help her corral sheep and sheer them, we were 10 yrs old.I will miss watching for them in the mornings and afternoons. Always wave high or if at mailbox ask how their day went.SaturdayCalves and bull got canceled but Hubby was given $20 for his time and for stopping another person from going over to J's house as J was on his way to meet Hubby. Bull is a maybe for Wed night. Calves are now sold to someone that has their own trainer so no need to move them twice.We went through our goals list and took off things we know isn't going to happen due to paint issues. Checked punch list and then some May to do's that might get done when it's not raining.Checked our finances.Hubby went to get fuel for truck so I had him pick up the groceries I was going to get that was on sale at Kroger's.I canned turkey and beef broth from what I found in the freezers looking for the ham for Easter.Sunday HAPPY EASTER.A  quiet day.We spend part of the day visiting with Daddy and some of the evening communicating aka texting my brother who was very sick.He thinks allergies but since he works in the school system figured he best go to the doctor to make sure he didn't pick anything up and starting passing it around. We nearly lost him 3-4 times due to his allergies, I think he's allergic to everything..I fixed ham from the freezer, baked sweet potatoes and asparagus from the garden. We had ice cream for our sweet.MondayLaundry washed with homemade laundry soap and hung on kitchen porch clothes line. Area at yard clothes line still too wet to walk in unless you have boots up to above ankle. Hubby checked before I started hanging clothes. Said he could see that a fall waiting to happen.We had fruit muffins for bfast that I pulled from freezer. Sliced ham, cheese and crackers for lunch. Will have one pot green beans, potatoes and ham for dinner with biscuits.Hubby did some odd and ends jobs he had on his list this morning since he had to taxi an Amish horse to the vet this afternoon due to an infection after being \"fixed\".I checked soil temp in south gardens... 60 degrees, if it holds there after the next batch of rain comes through I will be planting peas and beans at the same time... just like spring 2011. SIGHHubby came out of barn and he had found bulbs growing in kitty litter buckets ...I didn't take pictures of the ones that were super small. I am hoping they are the grape hyacinth.I planted 150 flower bulbs that Hubby for some reason decide to NOT use the labels I made when we were digging them up last year when moving. Going to be interesting of what comes up and when next year as I know they are spring early summer bulbs.Unless the one is garlic... I really think it is garlic. If it is , I should be able to tell this summer because all my garlic is hard neck so produces scapes.Stay in the lightBlessed be"},
{"title": "Warm weather changes routines fast, livestock pic", "date": "Monday, April 15, 2019", "text": "Monday  I did part of my normal routine... laundry was done and hung on the line, house was picked up and floors swept.  Cleaned the dry goods shelves in the dining room and wiped down the china hutch. Flipped out the \"winter dishes\" which is red that goes well for Christmas etc.  for the spring dishes. Put out the \"Asian\"dishes and \"Italian\" dishes as Hubby calls them.Dinner was leftover pulled pork so I didn't focus on that.Hubby's parents came to visit for the afternoon so I didn't do anything else. They haven't felt up to getting out of the house especially Mom O who had sinus infection that went into bronchitis. SO it was great news that they felt up to coming over and even better that they ate lunch out as Dad O has some of the same issues I have and eating out is not something we do very often due to after effects of eating....new way of saying we run to the potty a lot afterwards? 😕Mom O brought over hamburger buns as they were too SOFT for their liking... worked fine for us as I served them with the pork instead of making wraps with the tortillas. I put the rest in the freezer along with what was left of the pork.So hamburger buns for freezer is off the list. Had a friend give me a bag of pot stickers she had bought but didn't like. SO that's off the freezer list also.TuesdayHubby put more concrete on the deadman of the clothesline  and fixed the downspout on the barn. Two things off his list.He took a picture of the livestock trailerWas advised to get some ply board and put around the bottom of the inside of trailer as horses with shoes have a habit of kicking and can damage the trailer if you don't have the ply board there. GLAD another person that does transporting livestock for a living warned him also told him to require straw be put down before loading as part of the \"payment\" then we can put it with the compost, makes it easier to clean out the trailer.He tilled the south garden and laid the 1st weed barrier down that is 120 ft long.This is the main path down the middle of the spring and summer sections. Hubby used landscape staples to hold it in place.While Hubby was tilling I potted the 2 rose bushes a friend gave Son 2 and me.Then potted 5 blueberry bushes (they do better in this area in pots as they prefer acid soil ) and made extra pots for the foxglove when it gets ready to transplant (also better in pots)  and THEN transplanted 18 from the grow light cart to the square pots until ready to go in ground. This way I can cover them or even bring them in if it gets that cold.We checked out the fence line making sure everything was secure and noticed this in our pond.I think they are blue gill...And this in the side yardE and M's guinea hens... they really need to go down to the gardens LOLand then we decided to get the mail as neither of us had checked and that means walking pass the asparagus patch... we found ! one!lonely 😁Guess we might have to share him LOLI fell in a hole in the yard ...yes I saw  the hole and still stepped in and fell. Now everything hurts...SIGH. Hubby immediately went out and filled it in. It's were a post was at that he pulled last summer and it settled in.Wednesday Hubby is car pooling with some Amish and  a Mennonite today. Last week heasked M if she needed anything as he was going over to Sidney for an errand and was going to stop at Aldi's on the way back. She asked if she could go also as she had appointment that would be 30 min in Sidney  and she would pay the gas. So he changed the day he was planning to go and said yes.Since he can run the errand while waiting on her (I'm still home bound mostly). It's not any different than him going by himself. SHE mentioned it to a cousin who is Mennonite and she asked if her Hubby could go as he had an errand over there also and would split the gas... YES...  AND then one of the Amish guys Hubby is friendly with asked if his wife could go also as she needs things from Aldi's and they would chip in on gas. Reminds of our childhood when the neighborhood would car pool, Daddy worked in town 10 miles away and it was common for him to run errands for neighbors after he got off work and they paid his gas that covered him going to work. Hubby got gas money and lunch out of the deal. He was happy.And speaking of Daddy...He is happy and even though most of the time he doesn't remember I am his daughter (usually thinks I am his sister and have been called Mommy a couple times. My aunt says I look like Grandma who died when she was late 30's). All I care about is he is well and happy... and watch out because he will run over you with that wheelchair that he moves with his feet. He roams the halls(he calls them streets) and stops at each room (apartments according to him) and says hi to every morning and good night every night. If he doesn't see you in the chow hall (they call it community room he calls it chow hall) he will go check on you. He likes  commissary...or the general store depending on if he is in veteran mode or civilian. He is on insulin for the first time after being a diabetic for over 30 yrs.  A very low dosage and his doctor said at 91 going on 92 she wasn't going to tell him he couldn't have his snacks but she did increase his physical therapy to help him burn some of it. He used to walk 5 miles a day, ride an exercise bike for 1 1/2 hrs while watching the news every morning and lift weights besides mowing 10 lawns for elderly( after he was 60 himself) with a push mower. My brother and I are not any where close to being fit as Mother who worked until she was 80, was or Daddy.I cleaned out the herb and spice cabinet and reorganized it. Made notes of what I need to grow and what I will need to buy when on sale.ThursdayWe were suppose to get gravel today, guy called from the quarry and they were out again of the size we ordered. Guy asked if we could take 2 other sizes and him bring us all for 4 loads tomorrow. SO we did.Hubby moved the compost to the north garden edge instead of it being behind the barn in the field we let E plant in exchange I get sweet corn for our freezer.He then cleaned out the mow of the barn of some wood shavings he found, put those in the compost also.I did finances .... paid all of April's bills including medical bills and 2 school taxes. Shifted some things around and now have all the May bills $$ in savings until May when I need to pay them. NOT including biologic which at this point it's a waiting game on insurance to approve it. Hubby has a check in the mail that will start building June's bill money and thought after paying the gravel bill he might have enough to cover 1/2 of June and his deep sea fishing trip.When we went to wash the walls while spring cleaning we found the paint was leaving residue on the cleaning rags so we stopped.I let the contractor that painted the house know there was issues with the paint. The company that sold him the paint is sending a man down to check it out. He will be here Monday. The front room, dining room and kitchen is also doing it.We went to Son 2's, we wanted to drop off his rose from our friend I potted for him and he needed some help with filing his taxes... the soldier in him does very well at inputting information... the civilian gets confused when asked about life changes like did you get a raise , did you put money in a retirement fund? HEAVENS!!!. I got him through it and then poor Hubby had to listen to me wonder where the boy's (HA HA actually a middle age man) brain went to on the 2 hr drive back home. Our dinner was from the gas station, yeah really, pizza (8 slices)and ice cream (2 -8 oz). Wasn't bad pizza and definitely was cheap as all of it was only $10 and fed us very well.FridayI was up at 3 am... ate too much and too late last night and paid the price. Made coffee and let the dogs out and in since I was up. Went back to bed at 4:30. Since dogs had been out they didn't wake Hubby. He woke up at 6 startled and wondering why the dogs hadn't gotten him up LOL. I got back up at 6:15, when I heard him rattling around in the kitchen.I started doing some odds and ends that needed caught up and he went out to move things around for the gravel. This is a big check mark off the to do list for the month and the \"punch\" list for the house.Ended up with 5 loads coming to  100 tons... will need 75 more tons when we finish the area at the basement ramp and around the pond. The pile by the barn is to go under the deck that is going to be on the side of the kitchen. The white stone piles is filling in the grass area on the north gardens so it's easier for delivery trucks to turn around and I can park my car there in the winter and let Hubby park the 350 which is diesel and needs plugged in at the porch where I park usually. Where the dump truck is dumping is the 32 ft trailer parking. The 18 flat bed and the 24 livestock are at the back side of the barn.  After we get the gravel spread the rest of the way out, we will need it graded (AKA smoothed out) E charges $25 to grade a regular lane. Hubby asked if he could barter... instead of E paying Hubby $30 to take some equipment to be fixed and bring it home, E just grade all of the gravel since we have more than a regular lane... E accepted.Hubby just talked to the lady that is trying to sell the other flat bed trailer. She had a person looking at it ...the trailer is worth $12500... we asked $9000 with accepting $8000... the person offered $1000....She said she asked if he understood what the trailer was worth, YEP... and he was still offering only $1000. YEP..Said she had to bite her tongue and walk away to keep from calling him a idiot.We went to town to get a battery for the old truck  and post office. I proceeded to fall in the parking lot SIGH... I caught the edge of a mud puddle and landed face first. SIGH...We had eggs and corned beef hash and pound cake for dinner.SaturdayHubby went to auction with 1 of the Amish, good thing they went even though neither bought anything as another Amish was there and not only needed a ride back home but had bought something that needed a trailer. Said God was taking care of him.I did my normal Saturday routine plus baked bread in my 13 inch Pullman pan using M's recipe. We like the bread better than the Pullman recipe and the size better than regular loaf pan. I used the meat slicer to slice the whole loaf.SundayPut all 3 turkeys that was in deep freezer out to thaw to cook Monday. Making room in freezer as there are at least 3 dozen asparagus up in the patch.Moved coat and sweater rack to loft andHEAVENS Fell down the stairs.... I felt the nerve in my back pinch but could get sat down on the stairs fast enough so down I went...Hubby said he saw me lean back like in a plank when he turned around.DONE for the day."},
{"title": "what a week GOT TRAILER...where we are at on goals NO SURGERY", "date": "Sunday, April 7, 2019", "text": "School taxes paid ... Still waiting for bill from CT scan.After 3rd opinion and a group meeting , it has been decided my intestine in NOT collapsed but actually swollen on the inside  . SO instead of surgery at this time (a maybe for future, talk of stint ) I will be placed on a biologic... Doctor is jumping hoops to get Humira authorized... more of a sit and wait while my gut hurts.Daughter 4 came up, we both spent 7 hrs doing spring cleaning. Did not get it all done but got the worse part done. She did not realize the house was this big though did like how I have the sewing/craft room, office, spare bedroom and storage loft in the upstairs and it was the easiest for her to clean.Said the mudroom (it's always a mess) and front room (24x24) was the worse to deal with. Made a few suggestions that has made it easier to maintain ( like in the mudroom)and suggested I deep clean one or two areas a MONTH instead of twice a year. She got gas money, food and  a bit extra cash as she also did some work with Hubby out side that was not part of the agreement but helped a lot. She just changed jobs and won't get a paycheck for 4 wks so she was grateful also.Hubby got the livestock trailer.!!!!!!!! Already had E's brother ask for him to haul something from the auction he  bought trailer at as he was there and wanted to buy gates but had no way to get them home. Paid 1/3rd more than we had hoped to, but the trailer is actually bigger,better condition and has MANY extras that makes it worth more than what he paid. He was bidding against 4 others. The guy that put it up for auction ask for Hubby's info, he does hauling also but said at times he has too many irons in the fire and was willing to send work Hubby's way. GOOD. Now it's just get the cash flowing back in to meet the bills coming in.Auction on the 13th got canceled as what the group including Hubby was going to buy was pulled due to not being up to working condition. BUT another neighbor had a piece of equipment break down and asked if Hubby could haul it to the repair shop for him that day.AT THE Trailer auction Hubby also got a grinder for $1 ...bought it for the angle iron for his welding until he started to pick it up and realized it was a grinder. E was excited as it's one he knew how to work and showed Hubby how it could be hooked up for Amish or English. Hubby also got 26 large pots...the size you would put a 2 yr old tree in.We had just priced pots that size for $15 to $35 ... Hubby paid $3 for each. Our ex son in law runs a landscaping business, he is interested in any we don't want and will pay $5 for each. It will actually put a little cash back in our pocket and the ones we use for free.Gravel was suppose to be delivered last Thursday, guy got his days mixed up and had to reschedule for Friday and then call back and reschedule for this coming Thursday as the company that supplies the gravel was not able to fill that order until then.Grill is together and on front porch. SO I can start using it.Hubby also put the pressure washer together, he just bought because he found it on sale for about 50 % of what we had priced them at,  so if I decided to clean the mud off my kitchen porch I could.He replaced the board over the cisternWe burnt the wood pile at the end of the north garden along with the weeds I pulled from the asparagus patch.We took the straw off the rhubarb, strawberries and garlic.Straw is in storage behind garden shed drying out to be used again later.We moved the flowers from the north flower garden down to the road on the knoll where the daylilies are also.I have enough bread dough, roll dough, tortillas, muffins in freezersEven though I am not having surgery we decided for me to still finish the freezer list so I am cutting back on kitchen time when I get in the gardens.Frugal notes...Because of how I paid the propane ahead last year, and having a credit,  we only ended up owing $128 for this 300 gal tank of propane instead of the $532 it would have cost us.Turning off furnace 12 hrs a day to make this tank last 10 wks to get to summer fill. Filling the tank after June 1st will save us $210 on 1 tank. That much difference between summer fuel and winter fuel.Electric bill is down another $10.Hubby said he cut his tv time down by 1 hr a day for the whole month (kept track on his phone) Was very proud of himself.Canceled the newspaper, I will miss it and the information I get from it but can always go to the library to find out when things are or check online local radio station calendar.Waiting for the rain as I finish this, I hope it does some as then I won't have to go water the flowers we transplanted.Blessed BeHave a wonderful week"},

I have no clue of why my system is working at all then.The left to do with spring cleaning : In kitchen.... spice cabinet and dry goods \"book\" shelf. Ceiling, walls, baseboard and floor.Neither bathroom has been touched but the bedroom is also down to ceiling, walls, baseboard and floor  AND changing bedding to warm weather.Daughter 4 has bartered for gas money, a ham and a turkey to come up to finish what ever spring cleaning I don't get done by the 12th. Including the entire house, not just the areas I want focused on. I might send home bread also with her. We live 90 mins away from her so she offered 7 hrs of work and 3 for drive time. That makes it the same as if she went to work and keeps her 5 dogs on their routine.Hubby's is no longer working with the state so he is able to start helping at home and working on the things he didn't get done on the house or his own items he wanted to do.Hubby's April's goalswin bid for livestock trailer April 6thhas an auction to take Amish to April 13th and then found out 2 things we are looking for are at that auction so it's no longer a \"job\" but car pooling. Amish are paying for the cost to go, everyone is responsible for their food and drink.gardens put in, tilled , weed barrier etc for me to plantgravel in for deck and drivewaydeck on at French doorsstraighten the fence (including E's that is attached to our fence) at the roadmove the compost pile to the gardensput the grill together and put on front porch until deck is builtput smoker together and put on front porch until deck is builtchange the down spout on barnreplace board over cisternput more concrete on deadman on clothesline in yard.Rehang the Jack Daniels coat rack he accidentally pulled down.

Was raining so didn't use kitchen porch clothes line.I did not turn on any lights or even the oil lamp even though it was gloomy inside the house until afternoon.I turned down the furnace since I was canning and the cook stove was warming the kitchen.I spring cleaned the inside of all the kitchen cabinets (only have base cabinets) and the microwave cart.Hubby drove the car to work since he was only working to noon due to our doctor appointments. We drove the car to the appointmentsWe ate lunch at home, egg salad, went to doctor appointments... everything was decent, scheduled for 3 month appt for both of us at same time to save gas then.Went to CVS down from doctor's office , using coupons, sales and extra rewards discounts to buy toilet paper and adult diapers. I still need two more bags of diapers... got another coupon for diapers and $ 3 off total coupon with my receipt so I will go to the CVS here where I live  to use it.Went to Walmart to pick up freezer tape, I found 2 pairs of shoes( I wear size 4) on clearance and Hubby got a pair of work boots and slippers on sale.We met Son 2 and our friends at Hong Kong. We made sure we got the senior discount.We drove the shortest way home instead of rambling along looking a scenery.TuesdayI woke up at 3 and decided at 4 I was done trying to sleep. Dogs decided since I was up to wake Hubby up. He was okay with it even though he still had an hour yet he could have slept.I put the laundry away from the drying rack.I started laundry with homemade laundry soap and white vinegar.Hubby checked the weather report for today and tomorrow.He drove the car to work without me saying anything about it.I hung laundry on the kitchen porch line when the sun came up.I made more soil blocks for starting 180 seeds.We had leftovers in tortillas for supperI spring cleaned the inside of Hoosier cabinet, bringing most of my baking supplies together except for the flour I store in buckets in the basement pantry.I started cleaning the Metal cabinet.WednesdayI did laundry using homemade laundry soap and white vinegar. Used kitchen clothes line and drying rack as I also washed warm weather clothes from storage.I had cheese and crackers for lunchI made homemade biscuits with buttermilk and sausage gravy supper.Dishwasher soap bottle is empty. We got 35 loads out of the bottle. SO we decided that since I mix 1/3rd water to 2/3rd Dawn that I put in smaller bottles  for hand washing that any thing NOT in dishwasher would be washed by hand after supper.That keeps the more expensive dish washing soap down.ThursdayCt scan with barium... UP at 5:15, had 3 cups of coffee by 7:30.We turned the furnace down to 65 as we left for the testing. Drove the shortest route in the car, paid off the last hospital bill getting a  5% discount.Was the quickest time ever getting the barium through, sort of worried me about having a 90 drive back home but made it home before the rest of it kicked on through my system.Hubby ordered take out of the local Chinese restaurant. I added a qrt of soup also. Neither of us was up to cooking and wasn't sure what or how much I would be able to eat.We didn't even turn on lights, watched the weather on the news and called it a day.FridayHubby's last day for seasonal at the state. Both of us are ready for this to end even though he might do winter seasonal.Texted Hubby to stop at Save a lot on way home and get 2 gals of milk. Potato soup and gravy on the menu.Saves one of us going back into town when we don't need anything else.I had Hubby order a qrt of wonton egg drop soup yesterday for today's supper.Propane was brought in this morning at 7 am. That is the last of our contract propane and I noticed it was 30 cents cheaper a gal than the contract so we won't have much $$ to pay out on the difference. Water softener co delivered also today. Right on budget there actually under budget according to them as we are using about half of what the EPA says someone should use daily.I did a load of laundry and dried in on the kitchen clothes line.Little E and Little B brought over 2 dozen eggs for us.These two little ones do not speak English except for Hi and Bye, good luck on getting that out of them when E and M are not around. BUT B always, just always has a large smile and a twinkle in her eye.Little E  is ornery.SaturdayI cooked canned potatoes and eggs to go with leftover biscuits and sausage gravy for bfast, well really brunch because we decided to NOT set alarms on the weekend and just get up when we wake up. We were up by 6, forgot the dogs wouldn't understand SLEEP IN. Still , we definitely didn't get around to eating until almost 9:30We snacked on odds and ends in the frig around 2I fixed some rice pudding and we had it along with the last of the wonton egg drop soup for supper.I prepped baked oatmeal for tomorrow's bfastI caught up the dishes, did some mending and notified family and friends of my CT scan results. Then spent the rest of the day figuring out priorities to be done before surgery.SundayThe day of rest is hard for us to do, as we have been so busy and worked some many times 7 days a week for years at a time.We had baked oatmeal for brunch ,this is now going to be a once a week, with changes of fruit in it. Today was blueberry pie filling as I have pie filling that needs to be used up so fresh can be put in the pantry.We had cheese and crackers for a snack at 11:30 while we played scrabble. Hubby won, he does cross word puzzles, he was definitely showing me that what he was spelling was a real word LOL.At 12:30 we went to see my Dad in the nursing  home. Sunday is a \"slow\" day for him as no one else goes and visits him on that day. We couldn't go see Hubby's parents as his mom is  contagious. His dad didn't catch what ever buy she has picked up. She's been sick for over a month now.Once home we did some planning of what needs done, what I need help getting done and how to handle me being down with surgery with spring planting getting ready.We had spag and meat sauce from the freezer (Hubby's lunches he didn't eat while working) and garlic cheddar biscuits (freebie mix) We had a choc bar for our snack while watching cooking shows.I ran the dishwasher and washed the hand dishes .I put the dough together for the American style white bread 5 min and the starter for the Italian sub buns to bake tomorrow.I down loaded some free books to my kindle.How did your week go?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Why do  I have so many clothes? Hum", "date": "Friday, March 29, 2019", "text": "This gave me pause to think about. Ended up talking family and friends about it.Here's what we figured out after Hubby had me write out what I was doing before I retired.I will admit, I buy a lot from thrift shops and yard sales, have clothes that was Mother's daughters and grandsons. I have never kept as many clothes as either of my parents. LOL. My brother admitted last night that after going through Dad's (I dealt with Mother's) he went home and got rid of 50 suits....HUM yes he wears a suit every day and takes them to dry cleaners once a week.He still has 21 suits. His daughter tattled that it was the suits that fit him NOW not the 4 sizes above the now size that she hauled to donate last month of over 200 suits.Son 1 buys new shirts every month, he buys 7. At the end of  month he donates them if still decent but usually tosses them as the work he does is messy. He buys cheap. He wears a sports shirt for other which is few and far between with him working 12 hr days 6 days a week.Son 2 buys new shirts twice a year, donates his decent ones to either me, Daughter 4 or our grandkids and their friends.He spends most his days is dress clothes.Daughter 1 passes hers to her Daughter 2 that works factory every 3 months.She usually has 7-10 tees and same with tanks. 7 work pants and 7 jeans and 7 shorts.Daughter 2 wears shirts from work and gets new every 3 months and personal is 2-4 shirts new each season. She gives her Decent ones to Daughter 3 girls. She has over 100 in her drawers and mentioned she needed to get rid of some herself.Daughter 3 gets new every 6 months, her kids get hers. She has 14 of each.Daughter 4 wears Son 2 or mine. Might buy a new one every 2-3 months. She wears mine to work(works factory) and Son 2 to hang around the house and her own to go out in. She has 21 in her drawers.I would start my day between 4-5:30 so dressed for home, did baking, home blessing, garden, and yard work. Casual cruds (LOL) ShowerTHEN I would get dressed for the office/meeting work...suit, business dress clothes including jacket and heels.THEN I would go to my cheffing work... light color dress pants, tee shirt or tank top, chef jacket, chef crocs and apron.THEN I would go home, shower and change to go to either a chef class (causal wear) or teach (clean chef jacket, tee shirt or tank and clean dark dress pants) OR work as an sous chef and that would depend on who I was working under in the class.. Anywhere from dress pants, jeans, shorts, dress shirt, tee shirt and apron (never chef jacket) but always of the color they chose for their \"staff\". Usually 3 -6 times a week.THEN I would go home  and relax... usually a causal dress, skirt or skort.WOW  I was changing clothes 5 times a day to match the work I was doing.Am I working that way now? NOI still do some cheffing on my own... I have a couple of my chef jackets to wear with my light color dress pants.Am I going to an office or meeting that require a suit like outfit...NO but I do have a formal dress (little black dress) and black skirt and a couple of jackets that I can pair together if that need ever comes up.Daughter 4 and Son 2 also said I don't wear the same clothes year around. I wear dark colored tanks, tee shirts and tops in cold weather and I should put them in storage either in loft or barn instead of having them in my drawers or clothes rack (have no closets). I wear light colored during warm weather. The only thing they see all year is white and black. They also see I always buy 2 of my shirts, so when one gets stained I have another and the stain one goes to crud clothes.Every once in awhile Son 2 or Daughter 4 goes through my crud clothes and they disappear. Guess they are the two that it bothers the most because the other 4 don't do that LOL. Then again they see me the most often working in crud clothes AT THEIR HOMES.By pulling my \"dark\" tees and tanks I go down to 8 tanks (none the same color) and 11 tees (I pulled the ones that there was 2 of the same) . All of it is in one drawer. I took the crud clothes and put them in a drawer of their own.I took all my hanging clothes and turned the hangers around backwards. As I wear them I will turn them around the other way. Next spring I should be able to see what I haven't worn and get rid of it, well, except the 40 yr old little black dress. It's not faded or worn and a classic."},

And then she would have never worn it because she would have kept it for GOOD and good never came around even when she should have been wearing something good.AND it was tempting to order for myself... but I know I won't wear it either because is has a crew neck line and I wear v neck lines because it would bother my goiter when it is flaring up.In this area, I am my Mother's child... stained clothes are for home, don't bother to change to run to town for parts or something. Nice clothes at home are saved for when go visiting or some where special ..AKA GOOD but that is so far between that you get to the point you wear stained clothes all the time.Dad wears his clothes until they are so thin you can't mend them any more but he never stains anything even when painting a ceiling. I am my Mother's child.SO it's spring here in Ohio, I pulled my warm weather clothes out and took a good look.I want clothes I can wear in the garden or yard work which also could be paint clothes as I have a lot of fence painting to do this summer. I am messy when painting.I want clothes that are comfortable and can float with my weight changes (I bounce 20 lbs with Crohn's attacks) and not feel like I need to \"cover\" up when Amish stop by.I want to look good, not just unstained , but actually good so if someone stops to visit or calls for us to go visit them I really don't have to change my clothes.I want nightwear that is comfortable and I not struggling with while I sleep.... I have been all over the place with this area, first nylon night gowns that don't work due to hot flashes, they are gone now. Cotton night gowns that dogs end up laying on so I either get pinned or twisted up in as I don't want anything snug. I tried flannel pj bottoms (also gone now) with tee shirts... kept struggling to turn over as the flannel pants didn't do well with flannel sheets and I don't see flannel pants in summer with cotton sheets. Daughter 4 suggested yoga crops ( she gave me 2 pairs)or a sweat pants crops with a tee shirt. I had sweat pants crops and that worked but won't work for warm weather as I am already starting to get too warm and yoga are a bit too snug for me to sleep in. Son 2 suggest mens boxer shorts and then gave me 2 pairs that he bought that were too small for him.I am still wondering why he doesn't understand he hasn't worn a 30 inch waist since he was 12 yrs old. I still on the fence of what to do so I guess I will try it all and go from there.Today I started pulling my clothes. If I haven't worn it in the past 2 yrs it goes. Going with 2 yrs because this past year we really haven't went to church like we did, not found a good fit yet. And we have been more focused on WORKING and not visiting. Life style has changed since I am no longer working as a chef.I do not need 72 tee shirts, 42 tank tops, 35 spag strap tops and 35 blouses. 53 pairs of shorts/skorts/skirts, 21 pairs of jeans (I don't wear jeans daily), 17 pairs of sweat pants(9 pairs of them hand me downs from grandsons), 12 pairs of \"paint\" pants, 16 dress pants and 39 dresses. This is ALL of my clothes. Not just warm or cold weather. That's 284 items not counting pull over sweaters and cardigan sweaters and 5 long sleeve tee shirts which I wore every single one this year LOL.What I have kept....4 dresses for formal weddings and events (1 is over 40 yrs and 2 is over 17 yrs)3 dresses for semi formal (all 3 from Goodwill 14 yrs ago).4 church dresses6 daily dresses (two might...WILL go bye bye if they are too big this summer again as I already took them in twice.)4 dress pants.. I moved 1 pair over to daily wear in garden since they are faded and show wear but are in good shape.7 jeans ranging in 3 different sizes.7 sweat pants put back for next fall.I have 4 pants and 4 tops for garden and painting. Two of those will be tossed in trash at the end of the season.I have 19 tank tops... about half for each season.15 shorts/skorts10 skirts11 spag strap tops(wear under shirts and sweaters)16 blouses (long sleeve to no sleeve)28 tee shirts... 6 for around the house(not stained but look worn and these might go after I get all the rest washed, dried and put in drawer.) 10 for fall/winter and 10 for spring summer.That is getting rid of 142 items. 50 %... gone.I started pulling winter boots/shoes , tossed 1 pair of slippers and put 3 shoes in with clothes. Put winter shoes/boots in storage and set up my everyday warm weather shoes on floor with dress shoes in shoe rack on back of bedroom door. I do have a couple pair of boots that I can wear when it's raining that I left beside the wall on the other side of the bed."},
{"title": "Where I am at on goals and staying frugal", "date": "Monday, March 25, 2019", "text": "Friday ....First the chuckle that started our day... Hubby left for work for the state, called me not 10 min later and I was like, You aren't even at work, what is wrong?Nothing... E had \"sos\" (flicked flash light on and off repeatedly very fast) to flag Hubby down as he headed to work down the road... E was RUNNING down his lane trying to catch Hubby .... They need diapers for the baby for Sunday visiting. LOL.... Hubby needed me to text him LUVS size 1 one package so he would remember to get them before coming home. Baby is allergic to Walmart brand which is what they used on the last babe.I have come to understand it's not just spending time tracking finances, appts etc.. I have to budget TIME, what is the most important to be done and saves me the most money using MY TIME instead of buying or paying for something. I'm not falling asleep at 6:30 in the evening so that's a help of getting things done in the evening. But trying to track everything is starting to be huge job and does get weary at times.I called to pay off the hospital bill and finance services is no longer allowed to do echecks...HUM, would have loved to hear the conversations that is going on about that. ANYWAYS the lady is meeting us at the cashiers office next Thursday when I am there anyways for my CT scan to make sure we get the 5% discount even though it's pass the 10 day time frame.Hubby turned off the heater in the pump house saving us propane.Three times this week we turned OFF the furnace for 3-4 hrs and opened doors to air out the house and saved propane. We are trying to stretch the propane to be filled in mid April instead of early April.I reworked the budget due to needing to replace the amount of deductible by Dec 31st , our ins has us pay all of it first(we used to pay last and had catastrophic after the maximum payout) and it restarts Jan 1st. So not to get nailed with it next year like we did this year. We decided to have the full deductible in a savings acct. before the end of the year.I will have to rework it again after I find out what my biologic will cost me. PLUS extra gas for appointments as my Primary warned me it might be weekly for the first 3 months. That alone will triple the budgeted amount for fuel and a change in the grocery budget as I have to eat certain foods... along with ginger, turmerics and cinnamon for health benefits.We have pulled some recipes that I should be able to eat and is simple enough if I am not up to cooking Hubby can put it together. We will drive the car not the truck... That's not standard for us when Hubby is driving. My car is small and he can't wear a coat while driving it but it's the cheaper to drive (I did mention motorcycle if he was taking me to check ups when it's warm and I have recovered).Example would be Hubby driving the truck yesterday that gets 10 mpg over to neighbor instead of WALKING across pasture.  No he wasn't transporting anything that needed a vehicle , just taking some mail that got put in our mail box instead. DUH moment. OR not driving over to N to deliver mail in the truck when I am driving right pass N's the next day in the car on the way to doc appt. I can see it's going to be a NO, don't take the truck for a couple months until he adjusts since he is used to crawling in it to go to work or haul.It's carrying 2 water bottles while gone so I am not spending money to buy another bottle of water while out. That happened twice this past week, the second time I was able to stop at Son 2 and fill my bottle back up.Son 2 is on active duty, so while at the doctor appt that is in his area I stopped and check on his cats and pick up the cardboard he has been saving us for the garden paths. Saves him $ of paying his neighbor to check on the cats .I fixed his litter box TWICE. Glad I decided to stop again on the way back home.Hubby's old company HR is handling finding out our costs for biologics since I wasn't being given any information at all from the ins.  Ins wants 3 different biologics and their dosages so they can give us a price and we can figure out which one WORKS for me along with what can we afford. They already figured out we will have to pay 20% of surgery OF the contract price they have set with the hospital (which is lower than the original bill).Hospital has already agreed to payments and will work with us. SIGH of relief we won't be put in a crisis but have to focus on picking up odd jobs and saving were we can to pay the meds and the hospital bill off.I asked grandson's mother in law about the surgery I might have (she has had several bowel surgeries and knows several others as she works at the hospital) She told me 6 bags of diapers and TP and butt cream. So I need to pick up  3 bags of diapers and TP, I have coupons and CVS extra bucks to use this week. We will be right around the corner from CVS Monday when at doctors appointments. I have  butt cream (HAHA) and Vaseline, which works just as good as butt cream.We have 3 months of household bills in the savings WITHOUT touching any IRAs.  We have total amount of $$ for winter propane and total amount of $$ for Hubby's fishing trip with his BFF that retired this year(deep sea fishing once a year so they can see each other as the other one lives in AL). We have total amount $$ that we are willing to spend on livestock trailer (Auction April 6th).We both took a breath, and relaxed as we aren't in a crisis but the budget is going to be STRICT and we know it.  We have money in IRA and we can pull SS at 62 (18 mos from now)... WE DON'T WANT TO but can. SO it's not worse case at this point , just not a comfortable fit of where we want to be with what we want to do. The price of the biologics is going to be what points us to what we do.E and his brother N talked to the person that does the stone for the lanes of Amish and that person is willing to do our lane. Hubby just needs to get a hold of him to come price it. The price is HALF of what was going to costs us plus actually a bigger load than the price of  us spreading it out (dump and go price). This guy will spread it out and E said he would do the grading as he has the equipment to do that so we won't even have to rent or pay for that part either. E wants fish if Hubby brings home fish from the trip ;) He also wants to fish our pond which his brother stocked with the fish LOL.I called our vet, Rascal is due for shots in April, we also need heart worm and flea meds for the 3 of them plus Wilbur needs a check up for his weight(was severely over weight we got him_ and so does Charlotte (who was dying of worms when we got her). They cut us a deal if we brought all 3, let them cut nails, they wouldn't charge for the office visit for ANY OF THEM. Just shots and nails (office visit is $25 nails is $10) AND if we buy our normal amt of 6 months of meds they will give us a 20% discount. They are already about $5 cheaper on the meds than anywhere I have priced on line and local.The savings alone on getting nails done over office visit cost will cover Rascal's shots.Baby freezer in barn is defrosted. Hubby is going to give it another go over with cleaning tonight after work . I have 3 turkeys and 3 hams yet so I put on the kitchen calendar to cook ham in April, June and Aug. and to cook turkey in May, July and Sept. I have brisket... 24 of 4 lb brisket so I can cook one  a month of it.I moved them into the other 3 deep freezers in the basement. I still have white space, about 4 cubic feet of white space (that's about 2 refrigerator freezers amt of space). I transferred 9 gallon bags of ice to Baby. I will continue to pull ice from the refrigerator ice maker and put it in Baby so save on the cost of ice this summer. I average $150 for ice when blanching during the season. I would LOVE for this to be $000000.I moved a good part of odds and ends to the kitchen frig to where I was storing stuff for Hubby's lunches. Since Hubby is eating in the truck he prefers to eat a wrap not something from the thermos. We can start eating this for our lunches or suppers. His last day is 3/29. I decided that Baby freezer in barn will hold ice until I start doing rhubarb, asparagus and broccoli etc.It has a small area that is separate that I can put those in to and still keep ice.I now have 2 loaves of bread dough, 8 rolls (dough), 8 slices of pain de mie bread and 12 tortilla wraps in the freezers. I also have pound cake slices and 6 small loaves of pound cake in freezers.Hubby has asked if I can make egg rolls and pot stickers (or buy them made)for the freezer.He would like a supple of my \"not feeling well\" foods in the house, tomato soup, beef and turkey broth, fine noodles or star or alphabet pasta, pot stickers, egg rolls and sausage patties from Walter's meats in Wapa with thin bagel, thin Swiss cheese,and horseradish cream sauce.  I'm canning beef and turkey broth this weekend. I have star, alphabet and acini di pepe pasta. I will make noodle most likely this weekend also since I am doing broth.I have ground pork and bean sprouts , I have the stuff for the pot stickers, I can make the dough... time doing it vs cost buying it when it comes to making the dough including the bagels and English muffins I want in the freezer...... on the side note I have a child that wants to barter, $10 for gas, one turkey and one ham in exchange of a full day of spring cleaning and cooking... HUM... so for $34 (as I know what I paid for the meat) I can have 8 hours of work from the child that is a \"lets get this cleaning done so I can play in Mom's kitchen or better yet, Mom play in the kitchen while I clean so I can just pack up food and go home\"... might just take that offer up especially if I do have surgery.I know we have ate 18 cubic feet of food from freezers in 6 months. Why do I need that info? Because we have 60 cubic feet of freezer space and if I am not going to need that to feed us one to two years I can SELL one of the freezers (putting money in savings and lower electric bill) BUT I can also tell you that I have next to NO veggies in the freezer  which is something that usually fills up 7 cubic ft and maybe, just maybe 3 cubic ft of fruit that is about 1/3rd of what I usually put up. I also know this year I will be putting up freezer jam that I don't normally do.Just one more thing to track to make good judgement calls.I paid the State taxes.My computer refuses to work with the state school tax forms but the lady that has done our taxes (hired by Hubby's old company) offered to do them for us for free .Said more than one person has had issues. She will have them done by the end of the week and those will be out of here.Hubby picked up another hauling job that might turn in to a weekly haul.Hubby ordered \"business\" cards, even though he is NOT running a business just doing odd jobs (falls under Hobby) he is still keeping track of things as if it was a business. Better to do it at the beginning and go nope, that's hobby at the end of the year than oh well crap it's a business now and I have to go back and figure out everything. PLUS the Amish can't google him to find out his cell phone number. Next spring he has a job lined up working at collection maple sap aka maple water for 2 different Amish.We went to store to get dairy and produce. I transferred my \"coupon/digital savings\" to the savings acct.I talked Hubby out of picking up cookies when both us can bake cookies... I don't care they were marked down and the flavors we like. Baking cookies this week is on the to do list.Apples trees have been sprayed with dorminate oilGrape harbor has been sprayed with neem oil and slightly pruned.Limbs have been burnt in garden so ashes can be tilled under.Looking to move compost to east end of north garden.I have not done much spring cleaning between doctors appointments and potty visits 😞 , I am lucky to get meals on the table and finances kept current.I need to change OUR routine to get our meals times the same as the Amish we are hauling for. I also need to  change errand/appts from 1 day to 2 days a week. I just can't handle doing all of it on 1 day and I definitely did not acknowledge that when I have appointments I am gone most of the day, not home working to do list and not fit to do much of anything when I do get back home.I canned 9 pints of beef broth. Have turkey broth in frig (thawed) to can today and 4 packages of turkey vacuumed bag in the deep freezer.Hubby drove the car to work this morning. He put all his work stuff in it yesterday. He is only working 1/2 day since we both have doctor appointments today. We will be meeting our friends and Son 2 at Hong Kong for dinner... we usually do this every 6 weeks...it's been before Christmas since the 5 of us has gotten together. Since we are already in that area, it worked for all of us. No special trips for us.We decided on a menu plan... menus don't work well for us, depending on how my Crohn's is acting, last minute jobs and preferring a variety of foods and how they are prepared.We thought about month plan...didn't work at all...can't make it through a week....We thought about plan by protein....didn't work at all either.We hit on it this week as I've been tracking what is actually being fixed...We will base our menu of Countries.Mediterranean :Italy, Greece, Spain, Algeria,Libya, Morocco, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Sicily, Iran, Iraq, and Egypt.Cuban,Haiti and JamiaciaIndiaIrelandMexicoAsianGermanFrenchAmericanAnd Home Chef that Son 2 gave us recipes of while he was using that service.We decided Monday to be leftover day as that is the day before trash pick up.We decided Sunday has to be meals that can be prepped Saturday night to and just simple meals that is mostly hands off.This week we are having Asian, Italy, American, Greek, German and Home Chef... we will see if this works .Blessed beHow are you doing?"},
{"title": "Goals for next two weeks", "date": "Tuesday, March 19, 2019", "text": "FinancialAll bills paid ahead and taxes finished.Hoops jumped for insurance to pay for my biologic meds to keep my costs DOWN.GOD willing, that we win the bid on the livestock trailer that is at auction on April 6th. We have set the highest amount we are willing go even though actually the trailer is worth about 1/4 more than we are willing to bid. IF we get the trailer it will almost double our income from hauling as E has told his he would drop the hauler he is using now because he over charges, like 4 times the amount others do and charges different prices for the same work depending on who you are. He doesn't have a good rep even with the Englishers that use him.Savings of 2-3 months income and rebuild to a year.GardenAll seeds started including seed block, potting soil etc. MAYBE depending on weather, grow bags for potatoes.Hubby needs to spray dorminate oil on apple trees (if the freaking rain would quit for a couple days )I need to prune and spray Neem oil on the grape harbor once again rain interferes.Remove all limbs that we trimmed off trees and bushes that we left sit due to high winds.I need to figure out where I am starting the compost pile. I am thinking of just trenching in the garden like my Daddy did.HomeI am starting the spring cleaning. I will start in the kitchen/dining room as they are open floor plan. That way if it takes me the whole time I have before possible surgery that area where I spend most my time done plus it's the area that will drive me bonkers if not clean. I will then do bathrooms, mine before Hubby's and then move on to another room depending on what is going on and how I feel. I figure the kitchen dining room will take at least 10 days. Bathrooms should both be able to be done in a day each.I am getting better at keeping to a daily routine of cleaning that means less decluttering. Unless it's paper and it breeds in drawers or boxes in the barn they breed also.I would like to have at least the baby freezer in the barn, defrosted, cleaned and restocked, organized and inventoried. Then when the asparagus comes on I have a place to put it and not bury it in the other freezers.FOODHubby is concerned with the weight he has picked up  so after lots of thoughts and such tossed around we decided on the \"plan\"Breakfast is going to be our main meal... which means that we have to be up at least 2 hrs before we eat (remember, his bfast for over 30 yrs was my supper since he worked nights so that big meal is what he is used to). I will start doing prep work for bfasts the night before.He wants and I agree to protein, grain, fruit, dairy and possible veggies thinking of omelets, frittias, zucchini bread pancakes,bfast burritos etc. He isn't one for dairy unless it's cheese or ice cream, I am trying to add yogurt to that rotation for him. He does okay with it with granola or as a topping on fruit/dessert. I plan to make pancakes and waffles for the freezer. Maybe some muffins or fruit bread or both for the freezer. Put in one servings sizes so we can have choices.Lunch will need to be able to be eaten in 30 mins. that's about what the Amish do so I am looking at casseroles or 1 dish meals that I can prep that morning or night before and finish at lunch. E's wife, M told me she does a boiled pasta(with butter.) a vegetable and a meat, usually bologna or summer sausage and some dessert for lunch.Supper will either be something on the grill, soup, salad and sandwiches. I am thinking of having him put the grill on the front porch until we get the deck put on this summer. I REALLY have missed the grill.I also noticed he will eat bread daily if it's a different type of bread, this past week we had pretzel buns(Sister of my heart gave me frozen ones) store bought frozen rolls, homemade rolls and artisan bread loaf. He mentioned he would like toast and French toast this coming week so I will make a style of bread for that. PLUS tortilla wraps. I would like English muffins and want to try to make bagels for Hubby.I want to put a variety of dough for 4-6 loaves of bread dough, 2-3 dozen rolls in the freezer  and a 3-4 dozen tortilla wraps. Some pie also... maybe hand pies or what some call lunch box pie. As Hubby does cook, will bake cake or cookies ,would put bread/rolls to rise and bake and bake pies but don't ask him to make the dough LOL.Instead of prepping meals for the freezer to be reheated, I decided to \"gather\" the rest of the odd's and ends, list them and we eat them while I am in recovery. IF I get the baby freezer defrosted, I can put all of it there along with the extra ice we are getting from the frig( I use 50-80 lbs a week while blanching in the summer)."},
{"title": "FRUGAL FRUGAL FRUGAL", "date": "Tuesday, March 19, 2019", "text": "I think I am going to get a tattoo (not frugal LOL) that says that.What has been frugal ?We have ate from home, been some really weird meals but we aren't going hungry because neither of us has an appetite or energy. So it's what every odds and ends are in the freezer...frugal in 2 ways, we are not eating out....and it's using up what is in the freezer instead of it getting freezer burnt and tossed.I now have all the appts I am to do for the rest of this month. Next month will fill up when I get the CT scan results back. I have rearranged errands and what other appts I could to lower the cost of gas for said trips as none are closer than 1 hour and 15 min away.We had pancakes due to coworker of Hubby's giving us maple syrup he just made. Extra pancakes in freezer.I talked again to the Hospital financial services lady who did some digging to find out for sure what the policy was about if we had a balance and was current on payments could we get a discount on the next hospital bill since I am looking at surgery... the answer was no if we rolled it over to the payment plan even if we paid 50% of the bill. We would have to pay the bill off completely with the one we have now would be okay to pay have and still get the discount on that half. SO since I make less in interest with my savings acct I will pay this bill off and get the 5% discount. We will then make \"payments\" *as she told me what they would be* into my savings acct. By time I get through the next testing my deductible will be paid in full (Hubby's won't, in 25 yrs it has been 1 time). Not touching the cost of surgery.We will finish paying the taxes owed this week so there will be no late fine etc on that. We actually got back enough in federal to pay the other and I did file a complaint that Fidelity didn't take the state taxes out at the rate we requested (our tax person told us what to have taken out) and we ended with a hefty bill plus a penalty for owing over a certain amt. I was not a happy camper.Hubby has 2 wks left on his seasonal state job. He was thinking of doing summer seasonal, I have left the choice up to him but did sayI think it will cause more stress(which spirals me downward) and could have him sick again like he was last Sept after working 2 jobs when we bought this house. Especially since we have to have the gardens as large as we can this year to bring more income in. He decided to not do summer seasonal and then today (which is Saturday) after we had our 3 month blood work done we have 4-5 people looking for him needing him to haul Saturday afternoon and again this week. He was laughing about it because he chose to NOT do the summer's seasonal because of me might needing help in the gardens in the spring and it looks like he might be shuffling the hauling times around me instead. He had 3 different Amish men tell him that if he needed to do something at home or help me all he had to do was say something.Two of them already said something about couldn't leave until a certain time because they had to help their wives when they were arranging hauling times.I baked rolls and a loaf of bread from the dough I had in the frig. Frozen one loaf of dough and 4 rolls of dough for while I am in recovery(Yes I am saying I will have the surgery even though right now it's waiting on the Ct scan to say yes I will, best to plan for being down instead of hauling butt because I didn't plan it)I hung laundry on the drying rack.We have found the grow light cart puts enough light out we can read on the couch so we aren't turning on a light there any more.We changed our filters to furnace and whole house water. Hubby said he will check the water in 3 months when he does the furnace but it looks like it could go longer , at least another month. IF we can go to 4 months on that alone it would save $12 a  year.We checked our smoke alarms, they don't take batteries but we still tested them. That batteries in them are suppose to be good for 10 yrs. Since Hubby has now been through 2 house fires, he still like to check them.We had a prime rib steak( bought on sale at Christmas time) (I only 3 ounces of it) that we split along with sauteed bell peppers,onions and mushrooms. I should have cooked about twice as much of the veggies as I thought I could use the left overs for other meals. I have enough left that Hubby can put it in a couple tortilla wraps(which I will be making today) to go with the turkey I am roasting for today's supper.(Update stopped and took Amish family to their dad who was in hospital and not being released. Spent entire day GONE from home ...MONDAY)He is only working today, Tuesday and Thursday and Friday of this week.Next week he is working half day on Monday( 3 month check up at doc for both of us), Tuesday and Friday... Looks like Wednesday is going to be a hauling day for him and Thursday is my scan.I will be glad to see him not working with the state. Working 1st shift causes issues with appts.... plus hauling... They did tell him to this coming fall to come in and talk to them , they might be able to just put him on night shift (after 30 plus years of night shift, we do night shift better than 1st) and only for snow plowing. He did mention yesterday he feels like he gained weight, he does have an issue with keeping it off because of the amount of sitting he does. His old job in the factory had him walking OVER 10 miles a day. He doesn't want to have the issues that his parents and his maternal grandparents have/had with their health due to weight.Even though he got home late and I got home a couple hours after him we ate at home. Today and tomorrow is going to be late meals also that I need to deal with to keep the costs down.We have decided to bid on a livestock trailer, wasn't going to buy one this year but the one at auction is only been used 3 times, it's an older trailer and it does need new tires from sitting so much. Amish neighbor, E has done the cleaning all 3 times because it was his draft horses being hauled. He knows the trailer well. He also knew what the guy tried to sell it for in the past. So hopefully we will get the bid as if we do get it, we will have jobs lined up immediately with E. We also know what we would have to make each month to cover this year's bills.  Not counting hospital bills.How was your frugal week?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Frugal in the hospital", "date": "Wednesday, March 13, 2019", "text": "sounds impossible but really it's not.The first time I was in for my Crohn's I didn't bring anything but my self... when I went over the bill with a fine tooth comb I immediately packed a hospital bag for the next time...with Crohn's there is always a next time.This time I brought , tooth brush, tooth paste, floss. Diapers (diarrhea is a guarantee with Crohn's) kleenex, soap that can be also used as shampoo and a comb.... this alone saved me $200.  I also ordered a bit more for my meals as I found ordering a snack ( as I am not use to the times they serve) cost more money than ordering extra with my meal and saving it. I drink water (that's the only freebie LOL) outside of meals.This hospital allows me to bring my own BP meds as it has to be specially ordered to be without blue dye. A lot of hospitals won't, so if you take a special ordered med you should call your local hospital office and ask for their rules on that.. or just take it with you and they will tell you when you get there.I needed extra blood work for further testing about the surgery so I asked the doctor to order it now so I didn't have a 4 hr round trip for just blood work. He was/is very supportive of my trying to take care of myself and yet not end up with no money to live on. Said it was one of the biggest things he was dealing with was those that can't afford the testing, blood work , meds or just don't come to the doctor until it's too late and they are in the ER because of finances.I have contacted my insurance to see if biologics are covered with my prescription plan and what ones are covered for Crohn's. I was already warned by my doctor that they are picky about which ones would be covered and to ask what my copay would be since if can vary.As for the hospital bill, my share is 20%. Payment plans are available if I can't pay in full especially since we know there is more to come. It takes about a month for the bill to run through my insurance but I can see what the total is in claims in a week so I will know what our share will be so we can put the money aside for when the bill comes.Hubby has ate from home using the single packages I had put in the freezer for his lunches for his dinner also. He packed an extra sandwich to eat on the way down to pick me up as I will have already ate my supper. Since he goes to nights next week until he finishes out his seasonal (we think the 29th) he can just take what ever we had at supper before he goes to work or a sandwich.Blessed be"},
{"title": "Frugal moments", "date": "Tuesday, March 12, 2019", "text": "We got the electric bill... Down $35.We have a digital thermometer in the pump house and a propane heater. As long as the temp stays above 38 we won't have the heat lamp on which Hubby really wanted to just leave on. Wind chills that put the outside temp below that we will plug in heat lamp.Hubby is not having to plug his diesel truck in every night, maybe once a week now if that.The sump pump is no longer plugged in and running.Humidifier is off in front room. Bedroom humidifier is only on when I am sleeping.I only have the answering machine/charger plugged in so I rotate which phone is being charged.I turn off the power cord to my phone charger etc when not in use.We unplug or turn off power strips to computers.JUST and FYI  Son 2 in his own home put his desk top on a power strip and turns it off now, dropped his electric by $25 and that is the only change he has made, now he is replacing lights with LED in is office.We turn off the printer when not in use.We use task lights 95 % of the time. If we need the kitchen and dining area both lit up, I use the chandelier as it's over the bfast bar and lights up both areas. LED light bulbs in it.We turn the furnace down when we leave so it's not running the fan as much.We do not use the heat dry on the dishwasher.I very seldom use the dryer (and I don't use it instead of the iron like a couple of my girls do) I use the drying rack and clothes line. I would love to have another drying rack that is LARGER.AND have already mentioned to Hubby I need concrete poured for the clothes line in the yard as the one pole is coming out of the ground.I will mix loads in the washer. WHY? because one, you will use more power doing 2-3 loads than 1 and two, I never wash reds or new clothes with other clothes that can be stained by release of dye. Rule Mother (Grandmother, great grandma who all used wringer washers and wash boards LOL) had was whites and lights together, medium and darks together, with oranges and reds together.IF Hubby is not reading he turns the task light off while watching TV, the security light outside actually lights up the wheelchair bathroom, front room and mudroom enough. I have actually read sitting in the love seat in the front room using the security light.We limit TV time. Hubby used to sleep with the TV on, something his doctor told him to stop doing for his health as constant noise is not good for you. First he set the timer for 90 min, then 60 and now it's 30 min if he sets it at all and doesn't' just turn it off. He isn't not much for watching sports so that's never been an issue. I watch the news ... really I just watch the weather. And Maybe a cook show a couple times a week. Hubby it depends, news yes, cook show or history show for an hour. Then it's off. Weekends maybe 1 game but not usual.We use an oil lamp in the mornings for about an hour and during supper if there is not enough light. Hubby said the LED Christmas lights I hung for a night light is enough light for him to make coffee and put his lunch together. So he is no longer turning the lamp on in the corner of the kitchen.I mended a shirt, a pair of my pants, a pillowcase and comforter by hand so didn't run sewing machine.We bought no groceries this week. Both times we ate out was free as we used coupons and someone else paid for as thank yous.I washed plastic bags and foil to reuse.We ate an odd mix of leftovers for Friday supper instead of my cooking something else.Hubby took and thermos of coffee and boiled eggs, crackers and apples to eat while driving to KY to pick up the new trailer (that will have a title so can get tags) and drop off the one that can't be titled. They are going to go over it with a fine tooth comb to see if they can find any numbers to trace it back, if it's a salvage trailer they will try to sell it for him as their local farmers are willing to buy salvage trailers for the fields.Hubby watches Create TV, Cooks Country, American Test Kitchen and Milk Street.  Repeatedly want something made that the recipe is you have to be a member to get.Last night he said in celebration of our 1 yr anniversary of closing on the house. He wanted us to pay for the membership. I found a 12 wk membership for $1 for Milk Street on Facebook. I will cancel the membership before the 12th week. I bookmarked Cooks country website (free). I figure by mid summer his interest will go somewhere else.Right now he is watching TV for about an hour after the news, that won't happen when it's warm enough to be outside.E *Amish neighbor, needed a ride to Walmart to get a couple things for the baby. Worked well since I needed to pick up a couple things also. Got to know they named the baby Anna after her aunt.Hubby got home with new trailer and the company that sold it had already changed some seals and barrings as they found a small leak on one and decided to change ALL of them. BEFORE he got there. Which was nice. They also started checking the other trailer out and they said someone had painted the trailer and that is probably why Hubby couldn't find any numbers. They said to call them back around Wed/Thurs and they should be done searching for answers for him.UPDATE on trailer...company had to strip most the paint away but they found enough number that they could trace that it was salvaged and not stolen. It also is a 2006 not a 2013 as listed on the bill of sale. The company put it up for sale and already had a couple people look at it. I really hope it sells so we don't have to go get it. We could put it in an auction if we do have to bring it back. Amish neighbor E brought a handbill over to another auction that does sell trailers, with noted that there is a live stock trailer being auctioned off.... which is something we have been looking for.Blessed Be"},

He is HOPING that an anastomsis is possible and takes thatcycle down to YEARS not months. Worse is ileostony...well in my eyes being toldmy entire small intestine was dying would be the worse because I am not a goodcandidate for transplants.  I will have blood work donebefore I leave here in 2-3 days.

Been there and done that one, trying to not repeat mistakes.It would help if I would remember there is a corner on the bfast bar and quit backing up in to it when I am sweeping or mopping the floor.Nice bruise on my back now.Son 2 suggested starting and ending my day with Yoga. He does it at night so he can sleep. I also have exercise that I do for my cerebral palsy that I will be doing again. Hubby pointed out I need to do my touch my toes reach for the sky and squat and walk like a duck exercises.. that's the 2 moves for clothes line and garden. Hubby set the potting soil I use for winter sowing up so I can do that today and get it marked off my to do list. Said he will set up my soil block soil so I can do that either tomorrow or Sunday night for starting on Monday. Starting seeds is the priority.Since Hubby starts doing a regular haul job next week for E our Amish neighbor he talked to his boss at State.They decided to put him on nights (they have 3 leaving and that leaves them short manpower on nights) and that way he can work Amish during the day and if he needs a day off for Amish work they just need to know a couple days ahead. He only has 2-6 wks left with the State anyways depending on weather. So we are thankful they are willing to work with him especially that he is seasonal. They asked if he was coming back this coming winter, he isn't sure at this point depends on what else he is doing and he would prefer nights and they know it. We will go through the punch list and start picking the priorities, his , mine and ours that we have to do together. I already separated the ones we might have to hire.Speaking of hire, we were worried that we would have to hire someone to dig up the drain line to the sump pump. Hubby talked to N (Amish guy who owned the house) and found out the line they hooked the sump pump to is the over flow line from the cistern and it drains to the county field tile on the other side of the pond.SO we don't really need a sump pump because if it gets to the point there is water flooding the basement means that everywhere is flooded and there is no where for the water to go. Told Hubby to pump water daily from the cistern if it's to the over flow or unhook rain spouts that go to the cistern. Can put in rain barrels which could be transported to E 's house if they run low on water . E and N are brothers. The house sits on a knoll so I wondered why we got a sump pump, even asked and got told the basement would flood if we didn't..hum... Hubby agreed so I shut up.  Now it's don't plug that in we don't need it.Laundry just finish washing. Back to work"},
{"title": "Bread dough ", "date": "Thursday, March 7, 2019", "text": "I bought this book fall of 2008.We used it for awhile and then I stopped baking bread as Hubby isn't a sandwich eater nor does he want bread at every meal. At that time I had a very small deep freezer and didn't have room to freeze bread dough. I have room now 😏.SO after I made the tortillas, I flipped through the book and decided to do the master bread recipe. Next one will be the one with buttermilk.It's not hard to toss together, no kneading at all.It's about ready to put in the frig until tomorrow. This should make 4-1 lb breads. It will hold in the frig about 2 wks.I used a traditional recipe from a friend with lard and no baking powder but I did add Easy Roll Dough Improver from King Arthur Flour.Making the dough was easy, flour, lard, salt and water along with the Easy Roll Dough Improver. You can let it rest 30 min before cutting and rolling into balls but I didn't. Rolled it in balls, covered it with plastic (bread bag) and let it rest 30 min.I used my pie crust mat. I do need to pick up a new pastry brush to brush flour off as my silicon brush didn't do as good as job as I wanted to get the extra flour off. I rolled it thin enough I could see the lines under it. Pioneer Woman does the same.I ended up moving my griddle over to a hotter burner than the griddle burner as it wasn't getting the griddle hot enough. This is the first side down.Maybe not even a minute later, I rolled the next one out while these cooked and it's was maybe 2 rolls on the one I was rolling out before I had to flip the one cooking or take it off. You want dark brown not light brown or burnt (yep got a few with burnt).I had towel laying on a pan to lay them on as they came off the griddle (cast iron pan would work or a heavy dark pan, not nonstick) and then covered with  another towel. When they cooled they went on a plate and back inside the bread bag and put in frig. These can NOT be kept on the counter as there are NO preservatives like store bought. They can be reheated in microwave or oven (wrap in foil), they can be stored in frig or frozen.Considering I ate 2 with nothing in them and I sure wouldn't do that with store bought...

{"title": "When your Hubby feels like he failed", "date": "Monday, March 4, 2019", "text": "due to a major mistake on his part and it costs you 6 months of income and he has to tell you just hours before your back procedure that will have you down for 5 days (My sister in law is down for 12 wks, no BLT for ether of us... that's no bending, lifting or twisting. but our Hubbys which are brothers are having fun with no BLT's).As hard as it is for him to face this, it was harder for me to see him with his head in his hands not knowing what to do and feeling like a failure.He has been looking for a 30 ft-32 ft flat bed trailer for hauling things  OUT OF STATE... which requires a commercial tag on the trailer... He knew that. He asked at the BMV how much it would cost... no problem , he has that set back. What he should have asked was for the regulations of commercial tags for trailers.   I still sigh....I actually sighed just writing it.He got a really good deal and a bill of sale (common in our area) and went to get the tags... He knew he had to go get a weight slip so got that done.Still no big deal.OOPS... it weighed over a certain amount and so can't be used for commercial unless he has the actual title. SO he makes calls, goes and spends 3 days on the ground with snow and bitter cold trying to find VIN numbers literally scrubbed the entire frame with a steel brush trying to find the numbers  to realize he bought a salvaged trailer so no title.Whomever did the repair work did a great job. I wish we could afford to keep it and not resell it as it was new.He called about getting a salvage title and was told he could do that for personal use ONLY, not commercial.  The company that sold the trailer back in 2007 is searching their records hoping against impossible odds as he could only find 3 of the 17 VIN numbers, that they can locate it for him... otherwise... Thursday he will have to buy ANOTHER trailer that has a title as he had work already lined up starting next week that will be WEEKLY.This is NOT something he can put off. Putting things off is something he is really really good at.The good news the company we bought our smaller trailer( about half the size he needs for the work) has a few in stock so he won't have to order it, but he will have to buy and install a wench.  IF the other company comes up with nothing, which the lady that is even working weekends on her own time to help him told him the chances are in the miracle area...HE is holding on to the IF....Meanwhile since I can't do BLT I worked out the worse. Called our finance guy, updated him and if it gets bad we can pull from IRAs, he just needs 7 days notice. AND I spent the weekend rereading The Prudent Homemaker.Reworked the budget(seems like a daily thing right now) and handed him the budget written out on paper as he asked.OPTIONS FOR EARNING/BRINGING IN MONEYtaxi for Amishhauling with trailer.Selling extra produce if haveSelling extra plants if have\"barn\" sale this coming fall.I need to get back on Swagbucks as this is my primary \"income\" for Amazon.Make sure I do my Pine cone surveys.I need to make sure I do the reimbursement for the health ins with in 2 wks so we have that money back to pay the next month's bill. We have 18 months left in Hubby's RRA from his ex employer.Priorities for the house nowGarden needs (already in my savings etc).gravel for deck (already in my savings for April, decking in is barn)energy audit (already in my savings for May)insulation ( have some in my savings but not sure what we will do as the windows seem to be the worse, if so I will plastic on the OUTSIDE as all the dogs get in the windows to look out and dog nails go right through plastic). Hubby said he had some insulation still out in the barn he was going to use there so if needed it will come to the house instead.Replacing trailers money.This will be coming from Hubby's jobs he does.What has changed?Instead of ordering 2000 gal of propane which would give us a cushion for bad weather.... we will get 1600 gal. Means I have to be watchful of how I use the cook stove and keeping the furnace down(like I do now) and insulate. Means I HAVE to make the time to sew insulated curtains for the house for next winter.I just tossed what ever we had up this winter even though they weren't insulated.Hubby will be changing the oil in my car but paying the mechanic for his due to his warranty, lowering the amount needed in that budget. I will be needing brakes this year, that remains in the budget.Our sump pump has been acting up, the contractor was willing to tell Hubby 3 different ways to fix it depending on what is really wrong with it and Hubby can do the work himself. We might have to buy some drain pipe,Hubby has that in his savings as he knew if the drain pipe was the issue he would need money for it.We will take the dogs to our old vet as even with the mileage he is almost half the price of the local clinic for their shots. Toe nails are on us that saves us $30 a month but takes both to cut them.We found another place in town that sells the dog food we use at a great price.Our vet is also the cheapest for their heart worm and flea meds.Eating out was flipped from grocery budget to spending money ($50 each for the month), I very seldom spend mine , unless I need clothes so it goes to savings. Hubby uses his for coffee and food if he can't pack his lunch. FYI, when he is on the road with Amish they most times BUY his lunch for him and if they are packing their lunches themselves they say something before hand so he knows to pack his lunch. WHICH means we won't be eating out very often as I am not known to pay with MY spending money when I already have food in house.Grocery budget is $26... yes per month... that is 4 gals.of milk (1 for yogurt) 1 gal of buttermilk, 2 bunches of celery, 2 lbs of carrots, 10 lbs of potatoes, and 3 lbs of onions. Produce will go away during the summer growing so the budget will drop to $12.40 so I can flip the $13.60 to non food when I don't buy that.SO I took the non food out of the budget. I will have to \"earn\" for stocking up and meat (turkey and ham mostly) this fall.I averaged out what we have used in electric and it's about $50 a month less than I had budgeted. We will just have to open windows and close curtains to keep the heat out during the summer instead of using the central air which we planned on doing anyways since we have French doors to where the deck will be.My meds and our over counter meds has dropped by 50%Each vehicle gets 1 tank of gas a month, anything more than that comes out of what we earn.I based this on what we spent on all 3 vehicles since last Sept.. Hubby pays his truck gas out of his earnings of his job (jobs) but I am not willing to count on odd jobs to pay for all his gas.We will still be putting a the same amount in savings. This is not an option as far as I am concerned.It's not much at all but it does keep the checking accounts free.Hubby does put 10% of his paycheck in a retirement fund through the state while he is plowing during the winter.Non food has been removed from budget. I should be able to pick up it when I am not buying produce. I have stocked up on hand washing dish soap and personal items. I will need dishwasher soap, dishwasher rinse and the never ending need of toilet paper.After I finish with this year's $$ for garden ( remember I already have it put aside from last year) I will put what ever is left in next year's budget. Next year's budget is set at $15/month. This is the soil I need to start my seeds and the manure I buy from my neighbor. I am focusing on heirloom/open pollinated this year and saving my own seeds. I will still have seeds from this year for next year and I should be able by the end of next year know which varieties work best here.House maintenance. $40 down from $100.Our water softener company flipped some plumbing (for free) so the well water goes through the softener 1st and the filter after that so we don't change the filter every 2 wks but now every 3 months.They have a \"flush out\" they do when they bring the salt . We actually pay less NOW with renting the softener than when we were only paying for salt and filters at the other house... about 3/4 savings. AND they deliver the salt and put it in.By cutting the budget this hard we have enough in SAVINGS to go until Dec before having to look at pulling more than we do from the IRA's which we only pull a small amount.Here's to a FRUGAL year."},
{"title": "On automatic frugal", "date": "Tuesday, February 26, 2019", "text": "Hubby came home from work, walked in and immediately asked if I knew I did automatic frugal?I wondered where this was coming from but answered YES I know I do things automatically that is frugal. Why?I guess the guys were talking at work about how high their electric bills and food bills are so he started with what we do instead of  doing 20 questions of what they are doing or not doing.Except for the grow cart lights everything is LED.In time they will be also.We turn off lights if we aren't in the room. If I am reading or mending on the couch and he is at the desk we have 2 task lights lit but as soon as one of us moves (like he shut off computer ) that light gets turned off.I have LED night lights at the corner where the front room and dining room join and another at the end of the bfast bar that shows down the hall towards the bedroom. Those pretty much with the Christmas strand light up the walk ways so he doesn't fall over Rascal... Rascal is BLACK and does NOT move when you step near him. We don't have dusk to dawn lights outside. We pay $10/ month for a LED security light that pretty much covers where we park or someone else parks. Our Amish neighbor said he likes where it's at as it doesn't bother them while sleeping.We have a Christmas strand of LED lights as our night light in the kitchen to see the door we let the dogs out during the night. It's over the Hoosier which makes it nice as we can see the top of the stove also if we want to get tea out of the kettle. Hubby said it's enough for him to make a pot of coffee even though I have a small lamp in the corner between the coffee pots as he doesn't want to light up the whole kitchen.We unplug or turn off power strips to computers and phone chargers. Printer is off unless we are using it. Coffee pot warmers are off. Our alarm clocks are our phones so we no longer have a clock plugged in to wake us up.We have 2 generators so when we lost power this week we didn't lose anything in either refrigerator or the 4 deep freezers. I turn burners and oven off about 5 min before food is done, the heat is still there especially in the oven to finish the food.I don't use the dry cycle on the dishwasher.We use an oil lamp at the table. Our dining room does have a ceiling light fan but for just eating or sitting at the table talking we have the oil lamp or candle lit if there isn't enough outside light coming in. Found we slow down eating and it seems to help us relax even talking about stuff that upsets us aka taxes or kids that can't seem to get their lives together and keep making the same mistakes over and over and over. I can buy a bottle of fuel for my oil lamp for around $3 and it will last me 3-4 months.I use an oil lamp here at the computer in the morning until there is enough light from the window beside me.I open curtains for light, put sheers up in the summer so I get the light but not the heat. I close curtains at dusk to keep heat in during the winter. In the summer I have 2 south windows I close the curtains during the heat of the day.I use the 50 lb dog food bag as a trash bag.I use plastic grocery bags for trash bags for the smaller trash cans.I will also use them for bones etc that would stink in the kitchen trash can  so I can take it out to the trash can outside to put in a sack later. When I run out of plastic bags, I get more from the kids as I have pretty much went to cloth bags for my groceries.I can probably go a year before I run out as I got bags from 3 kids and a granddaughter.I wash plastic bags and foil and what few plastic food containers we get.I wash the inserts to boxes (which is getting fewer each month) and use them as wax paper.I turned the second bulb in my grow light cart to not have it come on as I only needed the first one on that shelf(I have 4 shelves and 8 bulbs that are not LED)I use up the leftovers or put them in the freezer. I don't have a compost pile yet but will by time summer is over. I keep a \"scrap, peelings\"bag for broth in the freezer...goes with the cubes of fat I keep from meat.If I am using the oven I do more than one dish.Which is why I haven't baked the pound cake since I haven't had to bake bread or anything else.When the sun is shining, I am baking or using the dryer I turn down the furnace. When we leave I turn the furnace down farther.If we feel chilly we get another shirt (shawl or sweater for me) or a throw blanket. We do NOT turn the furnace up. We have a humidifier and it's need replaced but it lasted through this winter. I will wait until I find one on sale before replacing it .In the summer we use fans and open windows. IF I turn on the AC it's set at 78. I have dehumidifier on the buy list.We have 3 house phones. I do not leave the chargers plugged in except the one that has the answering machine. I just rotate which one in on that charger.If I can use the microwave over the propane stove I use the microwave.Like yesterday when I made spag sq for my lunch. 12 min and I had lunch instead of the 30 min in the oven.We don't hold refrigerator doors open ( that was Hubby's habit that took me awhile to get him broke of). I keep my freezers full even if I have to use bags of ice so they don't run as much.I don't run water while brushing my teeth. I love my soak tub but I usually take a shower.Hubby showers only. I have to focus to turn water on with my right hand or I will turn the hot water on which is a waste because it kicks the instant hot water heater on.I sweep the floors with a broom or dust mop and only use the vacuum every other week.I have throw rugs at doors that are industrial so I can easily sweep them with a broom and they look fine.I used the drying rack and clothes line instead of the dryer. I use short cycle and full loads even if I have to combine loads to wash clothes. I use the dry sensor cycle when using the clothes dryer.We tie in errands to other appointments. We check Gas Buddy for the cheapest gas around us. We use the car over the truck if we aren't needing to haul something in the bed of the truck.I still send birthday cards. I buy them at Dollar General for 2 for $1. I pick up enough to do all the kids and grandkids for the year.We have a to buy list that I keep on the frig , I check the sales weekly to see if what we need is on sale. Until it does we just make do or do without.I have been looking for a better blender for over a year. My blender will not hold up to smoothies  or anything that is frozen.I was debating between 2 when Hubby ran across American Test Kitchen testing blenders. The best was one I had by passed due to price,Hubby said something to a friend about it and the guy had a coupon for anything Black and Decker that he was getting ready to toss. That put the blender down to our price range. The guy said for now on he is going to ask around if anyone wants the coupon before he tosses it.We eat from the pantry. Last night I was so worn out if I hadn't had supper prepped and ready to bake I would have asked, begged for Hubby to bring something home or ate eggs instead of fixing a meal. I have also found that pepperoni (always have some sliced in freezer) cheese, crackers or bread and a sliced apple is enough for a meal as Hubby doesn't care so much for soup and is definitely gotten tired of it and casseroles in his thermos at work.I bought shorts at Sam's club and then ordered a few more pairs on line as that was the cheapest I could find. Since I have worn the same shorts for over 20 yrs I hope these last as long. Better yet was I found they were on clearance from being $70.  I paid $5. I've been looking for the last 2 yrs and haven't found anything that will \"flex\" with my weight changes. I bounce 20 lbs depending on my Crohn's.I bought a pair of garden clogs, I will have to change the insert as it hits the top of my foot with what is came with. I have high arches and high instep and wear a size 3 in children, 5 in women's. I've ruined 2 pairs of muck boots with squatting in the gardens. Have tried everything except flex seal (which is next) to patch the break at my toes. My \"pain\" doctor suggested them as his mother wears them all the time even after she quit gardening.I did some more winter sowing. Goal is to not buy any plants for the gardens.I trimmed the halo dogwood bush but made sure I didn't pull the sucklings so we can transplant them down by the pond. Hubby hates mowing that area and I suggested we \"make\" it like a bird haven. I have some wild flower seeds we can plant that is for bees and butterflies (since the pond is close to the garden I thought the garden would benefit also). As long as Hubby can get in to fish it and the neighbors to get ice and fish (they stock it), it shouldn't be an issue.Hubby pruned the second apple tree the morning before all the wind hit. Guy at work told him he paid $100 for each apple tree he had pruned. Hubby offered to do it the next time for him for $50 after he looked at the trees.. I will go through the limbs and pick the ones that are the right size to cut for the smoker. It will also be a Christmas present for a friend down south.A friend gave us thermos cups for Christmas. Hubby won't use his as he needs a handle on a cup to hang on to it so I am using it to put a cup of water by the bed so I don't have to get up for a drink during the night, nor drink a Sprite as I've been known to do.My sister posted a meme on Facebook of getting rid of 1 thing daily during Lent for a total of 40 things. I decided to start early and chose to do 40 items a day. I have did 411 in 6 days. The paper clutter is just mind boggling. BUT I feel I will be through the entire house by Easter...that leaves the barn LOL.I watch for sales for things I need for my gardens. I might have to suck it up a bit as we are down to soil for 30 grow bags and the trellis (which is going to be feed(cattle) panel and metal stakes that can be used for YEARS. I got bird netting on sale for the grapes and berries. I doubt if Hubby will cover the apple trees. I got row cover on sale to cover the brassicas and the cucurbits plants to keep bugs off.I cut back on how much meat I fix each meal, Hubby hasn't noticed as there is more veggies and fruit on the table.I did suggest to Hubby he drive my car to work instead of his truck but the very next day he was offered $ to stop and pick up something for a coworker that didn't have a truck. SO far he has made enough of \"side\" jobs that he hasn't paid for his gas to go back and forth to work.GOOD... repairman for Sump pump is here."},
{"title": "wind wind and more wind PS Lana", "date": "Monday, February 25, 2019", "text": "We have survived the weekend of 50 mph winds. Had some things blow around, cover off generator after Hubby started it as we were out of power, tree limbs Hubby had cut out of the apple trees, some pots that were in the perennial garden etc. Cover off the garage in the box, boards and metal roofing over basement ramp took a nasty hit and will have to be totally redone. Hubby went out and made sure it was safe because the dogs do go down that way. Maybe tomorrow we will deal with it better.I listened to it BANG ALL NIGHT long for 2 nights now. Dogs paced, barked and paced more last night. Hubby and I have our butts over our shoulders to keep them from dragging on the ground after 2 nights with little sleep.Amish neighbor stopped over this morning and advised me to not hang clothes out. He had to go get a couple diapers out of the tree after his wife hung them out on the line.They weren't damaged but she had to rewash them.Figured I would be fishing mine out of the pond. His ice slide got wrapped around one of the pine trees. Another something to fix on his to do list for this summer. Hubby said he would take a look at it when the winds calm down and see if he can fix it for neighbor as he is expecting more milk calves... baby calves that are still on milk and not grain feed.I got up at 5:45, easing into my new routine. Not bad so far even with the lack of sleep. I'm pretty much on task. We did chose a couple things that are my priority for the day which are to finish Feb winter sowing (waiting for potting soil to absorb water in containers) bake pound cake (waiting for butter to come to room temp), so some cleaning in the pantry and start the spring cleaning.... Going to start in the south and north lofts. I will be timing each area so I know to plan for the fall cleaningPS LANAI used your recipe for biscuits except I had only dry buttermilk, I made the buttermilk and put it in the frig for the day until I made the biscuits in the evening. Hubby said it was a SCORE but I needed to put buttermilk on the grocery list as he wants to test it also LOL. I'm waiting for him to ask for cat head biscuits, he lived 2 yrs in Alabama. THANKS for the advice"},
{"title": "Routines change...", "date": "Friday, February 22, 2019", "text": "It used to be that if my routine got messed up even a little I would end up sick the next day.Then we bought this house and routines went out the door and it was more like survivor mode.It's no wonder Hubby and I both have been sick pretty much from Sept when we moved in until now.Hubby asked for me to work out a routine that WE can handle as he is looking at coming out end of March from his seasonal work so he can get started on working on the punch list left for here. Plus he has a deep sea fishing trip in May with his BFF that is retiring out March 1stI want to have the gardens set up the latest by mid April (prefer end of March but hey we live in OHIO so winter still hits in March and some in April) and the gravel in by end of April with the deck on before he goes fishing mid May.We have a dogwood halo bush, grape harbor and apple tree that need trimmed. Hostas, daylilies, lilac, halo bushes and maple tree that need transplanted from now to March.I was okay... when do you want this routine to start? I'm thinking since he is looking at stopping the season job end of March that would be when...NO , he decides March 1st....as in NEXT WEEK.!!!I'm like \"but you are still working for another month, how is that going to happen?It's MY routine he wants changed starting March and then he can slide into MY routine... okay, since I am slow at changing routines and have next to nothing that I thought was working until he pointed out I do have things that are working but I need to \"fine tune\" that routine.Hubby gets up around 4 and he puts dog food down and gets the dogs fresh water and lets them out and back in. He wakes me up if I am not already awake at 6. We have a cup of coffee together and at 6:15 WE open the curtains and he starts getting around for work and I start laundry. Neither of us eats bfast of a regular bases. He goes to work, I get dressed and continue with laundry. If I need to bake bread I will start bread at this time. I continue with laundry until it's all washed and on the line or drying rack. Baking bread when it's ready.While laundry is rolling I do emails, blog, Facebook (aka, check on the grandkids as they no longer even text it's all social media), pay bills. I have found if I do 2-3 loads a day, it is easier to dry if I have to use the drying rack,even if it means I do a load before I go to bed to put on the rack to dry over night.Around 8-9ish I eat a light snack.Then it's what ever....11:30 I stop what ever and have lunch along with 90% of my meds. He would stop also.12:30 I will do what ever...2 pm I stop for tea and snack, maybe prep supper if needed.3:30 I stop and shower, put laundry away if dry,(sometimes this is after supper) prep supper, talk to Hubby about his day from 4-4:30. Finish supper, put dishes in dishwasher, wash anything that doesn't go in dishwasher, put what ever we are eating the next day to thaw in frig. Watch the 6 news for weather report. Answer text from Daughter 4 or phone call from Son 2. One or both connect at this time of day as they are both single living alone and decided this is two fold, we know they are ok and they know we are ok.6:30... decide what needs done for tomorrow.7:30, run dogs out for potty party ,yeah if I yell that they all go outside without battle. I think Rascal was a house cat in another life.  Pick up dog food, give fresh water. Check emails, blog,and FB.8 pm... Hubby zones out in front of tv for 1 hr (he puts it on timer) I go to the bedroom and do devotional, mediation, journal writing, kindle and then read whatever bedside book (something I have already read, new books make me think too much at bedtime or worse I read the whole book and not sleep).10 pm SHOULD be lights out... it's been MIDNIGHT the last month.Even with turning the lights out I lay there, so get up , go sit and rock and watch the dogs sleep instead. Midnight... I go back to bed and go right to sleep.I think the change in my meds is affecting my sleep.SO what am I going to change on the routine.Morning routine and after supper routines work ...floating around the day doing what ever isn't... most likely because I am not sure what is most important(all of it is important LOL).I'm going back closer to the routine I ran when I was raising my kids...just sleeping in a bit as I am NOT getting up at 4 am unless I must.5:00 A.M. rise and shine... potty, start laundry, dogs, start bread if needed5:15 COFFEE...5:30 get dressed, open curtains,2nd coffee5:45 start 2nd load of laundry hang laundry on line or rack, start baking if doing something besides bread, Bread on 2nd rise.6:15 3rd coffee, bfast, prep lunch and supper6:30 continue with laundry/ baking/housekeeping/ computer8 am garden:plant,weed, harvest/pantry and freezers/punch list9:30 water break, snack9:45 garden:plant, weed, harvest/pantry and freezers/punch list11:15 wash up for lunch11:30 LUNCHNOON process harvest/pantry and freezers/ housekeeping/ punch list2 pm Tea time with snack,computer2:15 process harvest, punch list4 pm SHOWER, put laundry away, start supper,prep tomorrow's bfast, plan tomorrow's lunch.supper and snacks.Supper, Son 2/Daughter 4, dishwasher loaded and set, hand dishes washed6 pm News WATCH WEATHER. mending, decide tomorrow' priority, finish processing harvest of the day/ cut dog nails if needed/finances/ work on sewing8 pm dog food up/potty party/ dog biscuit/ put tomorrow's 1st load in washer to be kicked on in morning/ check calendar and make sure everything is ready for the next day.Lay out tomorrow's clothes.8:30 devotional, journal writing, read10 pm lights outHubby came home from work and looked this over and thought it looked good but I was going to want to change some stuff as he won't be coming out until END of April unless they let him go before that.... He wants to increase how much propane we buy by 2 tanks instead of the 1 tank I budgeted for. He also wants to buy some \"spare tires for the commercial trailer he just bought. Asked me to REWORK the budget to add commercial tags for trailer and truck that is in June and I told him to take it out of HIS account not the joint and it would be fine. I don't count on anything in his account as it's the odd jobs he is picking up just like my account is. Joint acct is retirement money that pays the bills.BUT with him working until end of April means there is things that he was going to do through the week that NEEDS done , that he isn't going to get to. I need to go back through the punch list and pull what I can handle doing by myself. I also need to learn how to run the mower on the tractor. I can drive the tractor but haven't done much with the mower on is or the fork lift and bucket. Need some practice on that because it looks like I just got the mowing part until May and that's 12 hrs each time WITHOUT trimming. Trimming is another 6 hrs.The good thing is it's Friday. I need to make noodles this morning , do the floors and trim the halo bush this afternoon. Everything else is done for the day. I woke up at 3 when the weather alert went off and got up and worked through my list."},

This one also has a button that I can press and it does a continuous spray of a fine mist.Next I got took an empty distilled water jug and put drain holes in the bottom and some on each side and a few on top.Kevin used a heated screw driver, I used a drillThen I cut the jug open leaving about 2 inches at handle to keep the two pieces connected.I'm lousy at cutting LOLThen I added 2-3 inches of potting soil and misted it so it was damp all the way through. Then I went and did something else to give the soil a chance to absorb the water before I planted the seeds. That's just the old me that doesn't want to plant is wet soil.Then I planted it.

{"title": "Freezer burn and  pantry for 2 yrs Lana asked about", "date": "Wednesday, February 20, 2019", "text": "Lana This is how I protect my food in the pantry to last 2 yrsCanning ... I use NEW canning lids and check the jar rims for cracks.. Ball right now has a suretight canning lid that the seal is suppose to be good for 18 months after used and 5 yrs before used. I check ALL my seals once a month.In the freezer I follow the advice of a family member that lived 30 yrs in Alaska and put their own food in the freezer as the stores were 3 hrs away one way and not accessible during the long winter (about 6 months at least according to him)DOUBLE WRAP meat... first a plastic (I use press and seal) and then vacuum bagged. I've had meat NOT freezer burnt that was 2 yrs old. Freezer burn does NOT turn food bad, it just dries it out and has a \"burnt\" taste that can be covered with a tangy marinade or sauce (yep I actually tried it with a freezer burnt roast and it was good)Veggies and fruit I flash freezehttps://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/cooking-basics/how-to-flash-freeze-foods/I then put them in sandwich bags in the serving size I need and then vacuum bag them. Example is corn, I put 1 cup in a sandwich bag and 4 bags in a vacuum bag (1 month of corn for us). When I open the vacuum bag I only take out what I want and then I leave the rest in the vacuum bag and put the open vacuum bag in a freeze bag in the kitchen frig freezer. That corn is used in 1 month while the other 11 months stay in the deep freezer.Is it a part time job? can be but my pantry filled by my gardens or produce I buy at the Amish auction is a full time job year around, just more of the planning stage and making sure things work and are ordered if needed during the winter.At one time this was all I had for a pantry. I started stocking can goods under the beds, couch, love seat, in corners behind doors, beside the love seat covered with a tablecloth as a stand,in the garage in rubber maid containers. Hubby was down to 3 days, we lost both houses, had no savings and the family and friends were putting food on the table because we had no garden.BUT because Hubby's company had them working 3 days instead of just laying them off, we had HEALTH INS which good because I was laying on the couch dying...actually dying and my doctor was running hundreds of tests trying to find WHY. FYI... I'm allergic to blue dye and half my meds that were red had blue dye also in them along with the preservatives in the food I was eating took me down.Two years later...This was where I was at with my pantry. I was still working 11 days out of every month out of state as a private chef.  A combination of shopping Aldi's, growing a garden (in ground, square foot gardens, and over 2 dozen pots) and buying vegetables and fruit at the Amish produce auction was a full time job when I was home.I went from spending $150 a wk for organic fruits and veggies to spending $10 a wk now days.I plan ahead, we knew we wouldn't have a garden with buying the house in March (we actually offered at Christmas and it was accepted but the underwriter kept messing up the loan and our mortgage guy kept catching it). SO I put extra in the pantry 2017. NOW after moving, which was rougher on the pantry then I had planned as I have had several jars come open during the move.We are thinking the heat in the trailer caused the problems. ANYWAYSAs Hubby put it to a co worker that stated that when they checked into childcare so his wife could go back to work... she wasn't even going to earn enough at minimum wage to pay for the childcare and costs of going to work. BUT they need food on the table.SO Hubby told him how we did it.If I was working outside the home at minimum wage which in Ohio is $8.55/hrLet's say 7 to 3:30 (which is what Hubby is working right now) He gets paid for 8 hrs (no pay for lunch)... pay for 8 hrs / day 5 days a week is 40 hrs. That is $342 BEFORE social security, federal, State and school taxes are taken out.Social security, and all taxes run us about 32% which is $102.60    $342.00  - $102.60---------------   $ 239.40 bring home for 40 hrs that equals $5.985/ hr bring home.WAIT... I would have to leave at 6:30 and get home at 4 pm... which is actually 9 1/2 hrs so for 1 1/2 hrs a day I am not paid for times by 5 days a week is 7  1/2 hrs a week I would be gone but not paid for.SO what would I be earning for the actual hours I would be gone (aka what I would have to pay a babysitter for if I had a child)$239.40/47 1/2 hrs is $5.04 AFTER the taxes.... That's $47.88 a day...WAIT !!!... cost of driving back and forth to work. If you are self employed you keep track of mileage and the gov't tells you what you claim for that which at this point is 58 cents/mile.  Hubby works 6 miles away so I will use that figure..6 miles twice a day is 12 miles times 5 days a week is 60 miles times 58 cents/ mile ...that is $34.80 each week...so that's $6.96 a day that needs to come off the $47.88..SO without childcare I would be bringing home a total of $40.92 a day of a 9 1/2 hr day which is $4.31/ hrCan I save that or earn that staying at home.I can 56 pints(16 oz) jars of green beans yearly. To buy it I would be spending 65 cents per 16 oz. (FYI most cans in store are 14.5 oz now days). That is $36.40 for green beans. I plant 20 green plants and get my 56 pints AND fresh eating for $1.30. I know that my cost for lids is 20 cents each (I buy in bulk) so that costs is $11.20At this point I have $12.50 in the green beans..Average age of my jars is 10 yrs.The last time I bought canning jars I got them with lids for $5/ case which is 12. I can usually find them for around $8.  I don't count my jars in the cost as I use my jars FOR DECADES. but just to add it in there, doing the $8 for a case that would be $37.33 divided by the 10 yrs I use the jar would be... that's $3.73 FOR all 56 jarsBringing green beans to $16.23The cost of the propane (I use turkey fryers for canning so I don't heat up the house) is $8 for the tank as I get mine refilled from my supplier which is a LOT cheaper than a trade in for around $20. I use 3 tanks for canning season (yes that is what we call it here). I use 3/4 of a tank for green beans. I can get 8 pints in my canner and it takes 7 loads. SO that's additional $6Bringing green beans to $22.23That is $14.17 CHEAPER than the store bought...and it's organicI spend 30 min /day hands on to weed, harvest and process those 56 pints. That is 3 hrs a week I don't count the time they are in the canner as I am doing other things then.SO if I were to count my 3 hrs a week $14.17/3 hrs is $4.72 /hr. ...would be my earningsNow...if I worked outside the home I would be bring home $4.31...LESS than green beans.Granted I would earn a lot less with tomatoes or peas.... but winter squash, onions, garlic, potatoes, and sweet potatoes which is even less hands on time and NO canning brings that \"wage\" up.SO on average, yes I SAVE more by working full time in the pantry( garden turned to pantry) then I would by working a full time job outside the home.You have to figure out if you need cash in hand (I can sell my extra produce at the auction or at the end of the road) or can the you just do the physical and keep from spending the cash."},
{"title": "Frugal each day", "date": "Sunday, February 17, 2019", "text": "MONDAYWe ate from the pantry for all mealsI baked cinnamon raisin bread.I did the laundry on cold wash, quick cycle, homemade laundry soap and hung everything either on the drying rack or shower rods.We still are running across things that should have been pitched when we had the dumpster. We are breaking it down and keeping it under the weight limit and amount of bags we can have with the new service. Since we don't have a burn barrel, our Amish neighbor offered to let us burn the cardboard at his place.Hubby worked last night so was home today when the Amish neighbor asked if he could get a ride to check on his brother (5 miles away , brother broke leg) Hubby made $10 for a 20 min trip.TUESDAYWe ate from the pantry for all meals.I baked  Pullman bread ( https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/drink/ct-food-0227-pullman-bread-recipe-20150227-story.html )Hubby worked all night plowing (again) so he ate his \"lunch\" for his breakfast as he only ate his snacks during the night. He doesn't like to eat a meal during the night since it can make his sleepy.We reworked the budget that Hubby calls it the 2008 budget...that's when he went to 3 days a week and we had family putting the food on the table since we hadn't put a garden in . Not that bad, actually not bad at all when comparing to 2008 to 2010 just wanting a few things that are going to cost some money and not willing to pull a lot off the IRA with how the market is at the moment. Our original plan was not pull the IRA until 62, but we invested more cash in this house since we didn't get moved in 90 days as the contractor started but 180 days later of paying rent and mortgage and double utilities and had things that were missed during inspection. The only two things under budget was the gas we used driving back and forth and the food budget as I knew we would be eating out more than normal.His first question was what else do you need for the gardens this year and how much $$ and do we have enough in the pantry (or will if the garden does decent) to go 2 yrs instead of 1.SO we are \"test driving\" the new budget for 2 months as we already are set to not pull the IRA until mid summer. I have already gotten or ordered stuff I will need in harvest season and have the list of what is left and price.Hubby called around and got quotes for the gravel for the deck,driveway etc. Depending on the trailer he buys we might have enough saved between the two of us to get most of it done this summer.We already have a contract for job that we will need the trailer for in April. The Amish guy hiring Hubby said he had already talked to another guy that would rent his trailer if Hubby didn't have one by then. The guy just doesn't want the job as it's out of town and at least 12 hrs between driving and wait time.Hubby turned off the heat lamp on water pump in pump house. It's not suppose to get that cold but if it does I can go back out to pump house and turn it back on. He is also not plugging in his truck.Amish neighbor bakes sugar cookies and sent a dozen over, so I won't be baking cookies tomorrow like I had planned.WEDNESDAYI think I am trying to come down with a \"bug\" sneezing, sniffling and having clammy sweats. Hubby is crossing his fingers when he passes me.I did the laundry(table linen and kitchen towels/cloths) on cold wash, quick cycle with homemade laundry and hung everything on the drying rack and \"sock\" drying racks.I sent our granddaughter a birthday card. I was told that I was the ONLY grandparent that actually sent a card in the mail and the grandkids think it's great. They know they are only getting $10 but they love getting something in the mail.I filled out and sent the rebate form for Menard's 11% back.I filled out the form for reimbursement for our health ins from our RRA.I paid the bills. Still waiting on the ER bill. The bill should be around $300.I sorted out the seeds I will be winter sowing tomorrow.I cut all 3 dogs toe nails , not an easy job on my own but saved us $30 by doing so.I make two pots of hot tea every afternoon, I reuse the same bag from the 1st pot and just let it steep a bit longer. Hubby has even started drinking it instead of coffee (Thankful for that as the tea is a lot cheaper than the coffee).All meals from the pantry, except for the cookies the Amish neighbor sent over, which Hubby has them almost gone already.THURSDAYHubby worked over this morning so he doesn't go to work tomorrow. That saves 2 gal of gas LOL.We did errands using the old truck (Hubby had to charge battery as it hadn't been started in 3 wks) bank, truck payment, TSC for dog food, Walmart for distilled water, Gas station for gas and kerosene and Save a lot which saved me $19.07 over what it would have cost me at Krogers.I did 2 loads of laundry, drying rack and clothes line usedWe ate left overs for a late lunch and decided we would eat eggs if we got hungry later. Probably won't since it was almost dinner time when we ate lunch.We sat for a couple hours and talked about what we wanted to get done around the house this summer, whether he should do summer seasonal work where he is now or not. We decided not after I brought up what we NEEDED to get done and we WANTED to do. He did say he had 1 more job of hauling something for a co-worker and possible a occasional call to drive a cement mixer that is a manual as the guy does concrete and struggles to find a CDL driver that can do manual transmission. He has one job set for April as it is.We also decided to get into a better routine during the summer so meals can be at a set time, which means LESS SNACKING.FRIDAYHubby finished his 40 hr week yesterday so he was off today. Supposed to be off until Tuesday morning but if we get any of the nasty snow or freezing rain Sun as they are saying he will be working before Tues.We ate from the pantry, nice roasted chicken for dinner that will be leftover chicken wraps tomorrow and then into the broth pot.I labeled the empty distilled gal. water jugs for winter sowing.We have 55 things still on the punch out list we wrote when we walked through this house the first time ...and then added to after the contractors left and we realized we should have added a few more things.Hubby trimmed back the one apple tree. Has another one to do.I cut back the lilac tree. Definitely a work out that I am not used to.I mended a pair of jeans for Hubby and 2 pairs of pants for myself along with buttons on 2 of my shirts and my winter cap repaired.SATURDAYLaundry washed, homemade laundry soap, freezed dried on kitchen porch clothesline, drying rack held \"unmentionables\" LOL and \"sock dryer\" got socks.Have too many eggs and know I'm getting another 2 dozen today. Just didn't get the baking done I planned.I baked a loaf of bread.I boiled 1 dozen eggs for Hubby's lunches ...then gave 3 of those to the dogs as Charlotte was sitting so nicely at the cabinet \"begging\" and could have snatched one while I was hanging clothes out as they all are tall enough to reach to the back of the counter.I baked apple bread pudding.I baked custard.I did part of my Feb winter sowing.I cleaned the frigs out.Hubby came home from KY with a 32 ft flatbed trailer with wench.SUNDAYThe day of REST... sometimes hard to do with all that is on the to do lists but we know we need to REST so we don't get sick and don't burn out.We enjoyed the few moments of sunshine there was.We are thankful for the ice pellets we got instead of freezing rain.We had Apple bread pudding for bfast, lunch meat wraps for lunch, custard for our snack and eggs and homemade bread for our dinner.We did ball park figures of how long it takes me to do the following  in a week:Cooking meals and snacks for the 2 of us(prep, eat, clean up and food from scratch) 24 1/2 hrs/wkGarden (weeding, planting, harvesting) 14 hrs/ wkBaking (hands on only) 4 hrs/wkLaundry (hands on only) 15 hrs/ wkHousekeeping  15 hrs/wkJust those items are 72 1/2 hrs a week. That's 10 hrs and about 21 minutes each day.That's not adding in processing harvest,sewing, working on the punch out list, dog care, personal care, pantry cleaning , deep freezer defrosted and it's food organized.Going through the boxes still left, clearing the barn and what I was going to use for a garden shed until we realized it had a NASTY odor when the doors had been kept closed.SO I need to move what little garden equipment out of it to the barn, which means I need to fix an area in the barn to MOVE the stuff to.He asked me how I did it when I was a widow with kids, I got up at 4 am and went to bed at midnight. I worked 2-3 part time jobs and I multi-tasked like crazy AND I have paid the price of doing it with my health.SO what is the advice I would give... actually keep track of the time it takes you to do what you do at home, time you spend running errands or other people. MAKE SURE you take DOWN TIME for yourself.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Frugal moments", "date": "Monday, February 11, 2019", "text": "I made biscuits and they were actually decent, not up to Southern standards but decent.I made rivel soup from potatoes, onions, flour from the pantry and the free eggs we get each week.I had a couple onions going bad so I cut them up and fried them with bulk sausage that we can either add eggs to for a meal or make gravy with it.I tossed what leftovers was in the frig with pasta and called it dinner.I baked bread.I did laundry on quick wash, cold water, homemade laundry soap. Hung everything either on kitchen porch clothes line, drying rack or shower bars. I used my \"sock drying rack\" to also dry dish cloths.We turned the furnace down to 55 when we leave. Good thing yesterday because Hubby forgot to lock the basement door and the dogs let themselves in  through the basement but that meant the basement door was open along with the door to the 1st floor from the basement for 6 hrs. (Neighbor saw them go down right after we left and didn't come back out until right before we got home.  No heat vents there and it was 22 degrees out. Thankful the collapsed garage in the box cover was still across the basement ramp so it helped keep the cold out. Hubby left if so if the dogs didn't want to go to the kennel in the barn when we are gone but the porch (which is where they prefer to hang out) was getting rain or snow they could go down under the cover and be out of the weather also. I locked the basement door.We saw Dad, first time since I got down sick, he is doing really good. My brother texted me while we was there that he was down with his IBS so I let the staff know Brother wouldn't be stopping by. He usually spends Saturday evening with Dad. He is better today so it going to stop this afternoon. Then we went to Walgreen so I could use the points off my card and get Vit D which they had on sale and I am almost out of. Since Hubby's parents live within 2 miles of Walgreen I suggested we do a pit stop and check on them. They are doing okay. We went on to Menards since they are having the 11% rebate going on, got garden stuff using the last rebates we got. We should get the new rebate back in time to buy filters for the house.Then Hubby suggested since I felt decent and Valentines and our anniversary was coming up that we stop at the local restuarant and have a meal. He paid out of his money. I brought home my leftovers.We know we will need ice for when the asparagus starts coming in so instead of turning off the ice maker or just dumping ice I am bagging it and putting it in the white space of the freezers, helps keep the freezers from running so much also.Hubby worked over the weekend and threw our routine off a bit. He is trying to decide whether he wants to do seasonal work for the state this summer or not.How was your week?"},
{"title": "Spending the day with 4 Amish ladies", "date": "Thursday, February 7, 2019", "text": "I played taxi driver for my neighbor and 3 of her cousins. Their driver had cancelled on them due to flu and they had appts...chiro and massage appts with a stop at Aldi's on the way back. They are going 50 miles to have these appts as that is the only lady chiro in the area. I enjoyed the time even though I really need to learn German as they would forget and get to talking in German, they try to be respectfully of speaking English around Englishers.  We were gone from 10:30 to almost 5 pm.We talked about being frugal...which they don't call it that, to them it's respecting their resources. We talked about getting meals on the table quickly and when it's already been a long day of child care, laundry in wringer washers and clothes lines and gardens with preserving the harvest. We talked about routines. We talked about getting it done and still having time to rest.I'll start with meals as I know my neighbor's husband is a meat eater... he has made that comment several times that he wants meat at all 3 meals and he makes sure he provides meat so his wife can put it on the table. All the husbands AND boys take care of chores..aka feeding and watering animals BEFORE breakfast which is usually served around 7 am. Wives and daughters gather eggs. (Because I asked what happens if you have no sons or no daughters...then it's the oldest child does chores and the second oldest does eggs.)Breakfast might be oatmeal or homemade granola with canned fruit and an egg or like \"meat eater\" have sausage with it. Very little bacon is used as it's not something pigs produce a lot of.Lunch is at noon pretty much across the board, or 1 pm during day light saving time as they don't do that time change. It's canned meat, canned potatoes, canned veggies or fresh from the gardens and some kind of dessert. Dinner or I should say supper as it's at 6 or 7 pm AFTER chores is the same as lunch...NOTICE CANNED MEAT and CANNED POTATOES. Casseroles are very common, Soups are common year around especially on laundry day but steak, pork chops, meatloaf isn't. With canned meat and canned potatoes they can have a meal on the table in 15 minutes. Since I am not in to canning meat so much I figure cooking a good supply of meat and putting it in the freezer in \"meal\" size will help.I do that will my turkey and hams , used to do with the hamburger as just hamburger for pasta,sloppy joes,  mushroom joes and taco meat. We don't eat that mix much anymore but I think I will go back to precooking my hamburger. When the gardens are producing what ever is ripe is what is ate. They ALWAYS have cake,pie, cookies and canned or fresh fruit in season for snacks. They burn those calories with the manual labor they do.The ladies decide what they are fixing the night before right after dinner. They know what they will be baking the night before. Not waiting until that morning or right before a meal is the biggest thing that helps keep the meals on the table without frustration.Baking... Monday and Saturday at least, but most bake also midweek. Baking is done when the stoves (wood burning in this area) are already heating the water for the laundry to be washed not \"wasting\" the heat. They will bake the bread,cakes, pies and cookies at this time along with making noodles and using the top of the stove to help dry the noodles so they can cut them rather than leaving them hang or lay all over the house to dry. Especially nice in rainy weather. The young lady that used to live here showed me last summer how to do it on the stove and what to check for to see when it was dry enough to cut, maybe 2-3 minutes. She said since I don't have a wood burning stove to use a skillet to lay the dough on. They do one piece of dough as a time. Their cook stove is also the one that heats the house. Some have more than one stove. Our neighbor has 3, a kerosene cook stove for summer, a HUGE cook stove for winter and a smaller cook stove in the laundry room which I would have called a summer kitchen as it's a 20 by 20 ft room that she also uses for canning so it doesn't heat up the house in the summer.If they are baking a casserole , the whole meal goes in the oven.Winter squash and sweet potatoes , casseroles are used a lot during the winter for the veggie since the stove is heating the house.Stove top meals during warm weather.Routines help save you from frustration and gets most of it done and that's how they put it. Monday, Wednesday or Thursday and Saturday are laundry days. Baking is done on the same days. Bedding is washed middle of the week. Housecleaning is done on Saturday though if they have some thing that needs cleaned during the week they will do it. Houses are \"spring/fall\" cleaned from top to bottom usually right before when they have church service at their house BUT other family or friends will come in and help clean the house and prep food that is served that day. Some mend/sew on Tuesday or Thursday. All iron the afternoon or the day after laundry day.Floors are swept every night after supper.Dishes washed after the meal.Everything is put in place when no longer being used. They don't get something and then decide where to put it, BEFORE they get it , they figure where they will be keeping it. Sunday is NO work beside chores for taking care of animals. Church is every other Sunday and visitation with family and friends is encourage for the other Sunday. Meals are prepared the night before, dishes are to be done as normally done. Soup and sandwiches are common. They don't use condiments like we do. Might be the lack of refrigeration?Kerosene lamps are used for task lighting only. Curtains are pulled open for light, and closed as soon as it gets dark during the winter or half closed during the summer to keep the heat out.They sew, iron, and read at windows. In winter they might do those things at the kitchen table where there is a lamp lit until they go to bed. They get up anywhere from 4 am to 5:30. Bed is usually around 8-9 (exception is teenagers and young adults).They don't have summer clothes and winter clothes. They on average have 5-9 outfits.I asked about trash... oh yeah because no one has trash service. They ONLY thing they could think of that they had to deal with was the lids off their canning jars. Some use reusable one, others put holes in the lids and hang in the gardens to scare off birds, some recycle. Others find an English neighbor that will allow them to \"share\" their trash service. They all compost and  all have burn barrels(allowed in this township.)so paper stuff is burned if they don't use it to start the fire in the stove and dump the ashes in the gardens. and since they can all their own meat, veggies and fruit and get their staples mostly from the bulk store....they just don't have the \"trash\". They don't use paper towels (cloth rags) they don't use paper napkins (cloth napkins) they don't use paper tissue (cloth handkerchiefs), they don't use paper plates,plastic silverware or paper cups. Everyone has a water bottle.(Most drink water, juice or herb tea, very few drink coffee or \"black\" tea).After supper, dishes are done (wash water heated while they cooked the meal), they or the one of the kids will sweep the floors and then they sit and read from Bible, talk of the day, wife might do mending while this is going on but pretty much the day is done, the hour or so before bed is one of slowing down and stopping.They do get a kick out of me hanging laundry on the kitchen porch clothesline in freezing or rainy weather, seeing the oil lamp lit early mornings and during supper. How dark our house looks compared to other Englishers in the area.I swear the one looks like they turn every light on and never close their curtains. How big my pantry is for Englishers as the neighbor has helped us moving things around down there. They all are looking forward to seeing how I garden.They either grow their own seeds/plants or buy from one of the other Amish that do.Most buy it from the ones that grow is as they don't have grow lights ;)They miss fresh salad during the winters. I figured that with what I saw what they all bought at Aldi's... lettuce, lots of iceberg lettuce, lots of bananas, cool whip, canned fish,cream of mushroom soup(that was the one having church service next), and the 2 younger ladies bought pizza for their supper that night.TO follow this up, Hubby and I talked about respecting our resources, routines in the house especially with the garden work going to be starting and him looking at working seasonal work for ODOT this summer AND working for the Amish. We talked about getting meals on the table to cut the \"what are we going to eat when we should be sitting down to eat\".Blessed be"},
{"title": "Battling Crohn's", "date": "Tuesday, February 5, 2019", "text": "I am thankful for my GI and her office that have went the extra step of not only monitoring the meds they prescribe,  probiotics, and prebiotics. They also researched what foods I can eat to help replace my med. In 2012 when I found out I had Crohn's there was no diet that they could really offer. It is definitely a disease that is very personal. BUT through the years I have tracked what triggers me and what doesn't. Certain bottle waters will trigger me. SO it's easier to look at what I need to eat and if I can eat it.By time I got off the phone with the office I and the PA that was working with me was laughing. It's real close to the Mediterranean diet. Which is a frugal diet for the most part.They gave me a list of prebiotic  foods which isn't a big effort on my partonions, leeks, garlic radishes,carrots, tomatoes, asparagus, sweet potatoes and dandelion greens are already in the plans for the gardens. Apples, we have 2 trees. Didn't do well last year but I can always pick up some from one of the Amish neighbors. I already have flax and chia seeds,oats, barley,cocoa powder and as of last night I have bananas.The list of probiotics was a different story.Greek yogurt. I used to make in the oven but this gas stove doesn't have a switch to turn on the light. I priced yogurt makers but really I hate to spend money on something that only does 1 thing. I settled on a 2 qrt crock pot using my swag bucks to pay for it. Seems to be the right size for simmering soups for the 2 of us when not in use for yogurt. I paid $16 ON SALE last night for 3 lg containers of Greek yogurt. I don't prefer Kefir but might be sucking that one up.Cured meat...hum... MY NONNA would be happy, pancetta, pepperoni, proscuitto, corned beef, kielbasa, summer sausage (we are usually given deer summer sausage) etc. I grew up eating cured meat, cheese and bread for lunch when I was with her. It can be expensive but as long as I use it as a condiment like Nonna did, it can be in the budget.Oats and Barley...haveFermented foods...that sounds easy but it's SALT BRINE or RAW VINEGAR brine, not cooked with weak aka store bought vinegar food. Still my girlfriend mentioned refrigerator pickles/veggies and using raw vinegar with the mother to make it( also ordered from Amazon using swagbucks) My Nonna used to make kraut by the bowl full with salt and then refrigerated it to eat after it sat around for a month or so at room temp.Sourdough bread... SIGH, neither of us really like sourdough bread. I know I could also make muffins, pancakes, waffles, noodles, tortillas, crackers, pie crusts etc besides bread.They asked if I could include spinach, kale (greens) and collagen...no problem as I am growing the greens and have the collagen already bought .Wine. I've been told to drink it for my heart failure... first time I have been told to drink it for my gut.Berries and cucurbits (cucumber, summers squash, winter squash family will be in gardens also) I don't have the berry bushes at the stage of getting a harvest so I will have to find people growing extra but I do that yearly anyways as we both love berries, just need to have more than I usually freeze.. There is a farmer's market in the local town that someone might be selling some when they start harvesting this summer.I don't want to kill my budget and stress out (which triggers Crohn's) over what I have to pay to get in my diet. On the other hand, if I don't get it in my diet I'll be paying the hospital bills instead.I decide to make what used to be my standard bfast... a porridge type of oats, fruit, chia seeds and yogurt that sits over night in the frig and then a smoothie after dinner when I usually crave chocolate, I can use cocoa powder which helps also.My lunch can be cured meat okay...Italian pepperoni (yes it's what I've ate most of my life)with mild cheddar cheese (instead of my standard colby) and I can sourdough crackers or sourdough pita bread (instead of my townhouse crackers).I could be like my Nonna... coffee and toast with orange marmalade jam for bfast. Cured meat and or cheese and bread , 4 oz of wine and glass of water for lunch. Biscotti and tea at 2. Salad, 1 cup of soup or 1 cup of pasta, 1/2 plate of veggies and a little serving of meat with bread followed by fresh fruit and maybe some cheese and 4 oz of wine and glass of water. Woman lived to her  late 90s and had no health problems. Died in her sleep.I remember the first week I spent with her. Early mornings spent in the gardens, fresh veggies daily, evening walks around her 10 acres of property as she walked the fence line every evening no matter what the weather was. She taught me to make bread and the difference between being frugal and miserly . Bean soup on Monday with fresh bread, tossed veggies and more water day 2 of that bean soup. Pasta or rice and more water day 3 and day 4 it was served over very stale bread. Friday what ever she decided, usually a pizza of fresh tomatoes, basil and fresh mozzarella cheese or parmesan  cheese. Saturday she baked and we would have eggs for our meals. Sunday after church...  Salad of what was ready in the garden , 3 beans salad or carrots and raisins during the year when there was no garden, spaghetti with meatballs, fried chicken with 3 or 4 veggies, wine and pitchers of water, bread, fresh fruit and cheese for dessert. There was NEVER leftovers and we ate for HOURS. Blessed be"},
{"title": "Where do I start?", "date": "Monday, February 4, 2019", "text": "It's Monday and automatically I started the laundry before my first cup of coffee with Hubby before he left for work.Our Trash company called Saturday to let me know they could offer me $3 off a month if I went to quarterly automatic payments that's the same as 2 months free DONE.The furnace is off and the kitchen door propped open for the dogs to run in and out because that is all they want to do with this warmer weather and to air the house out without me freezing. The laundry is on the kitchen porch clothes line. I even got a couple throw blankets washed and out on the line ad things are drying so well today.Hubby probably only has another 4 wks left to work depending on the weather so we talked finances especially when he knows his 401k*which is what we live on* is losing money AND I can no longer get the medication for my Crohn's. Company moved it out of U.S to Italy and changed ingredients which took out what I needed and put the cost way above what I can afford to pay even if they had left the ingredients in. They also just lost a lawsuit to the person who actually developed the ingredients in the original formula so it's looks like they won't be selling it anyways. I have 2 months left of the old formula, my GI has worked out a diet that should help keep things steady once I adjust to eating it. Not a bad diet to deal with, I just need to add smoothies into my diet, not something I do but I can get a lot of the live bacteria I need in a smoothie which will help with not having to eat 8 meals a day. I will have to start making yogurt...I used to use the light in my oven to make yogurt but my gas oven doesn't have a light switch nor do I have a 2 qrt crock pot. I have looked at a few at Amazon but haven't decided yet. One to two cups of Greek yogurt each day is going to be expensive to buy. Certain vegetables I will need year around. We looked and decided to buy a 4 shelf grow light with humidity tent to not make do with trying to rotate what plants I was growing under 1 grow light I do have. I got 20% discount, free shipping and cash back through ebates on the order. Hubby figured it it allows me to grow \"greens\" during the off season we will save $40 at least weekly. I will have to plant more vegetables than I planned to have what I need during off season.We sat with the 5 different retirement funds in front of us. Talked to 2 different finance people that have NOTHING to do with our investments so they aren't getting anything out of it and figured out that we are still OKAY. We don't have to go to work to pay our health ins which we have seen MANY have to do within a year of retiring. We don't have to go back to work to make the mortgage or the truck loan. We do have to EARN the extra's so not to deplete the retirement. One retirement will be closed out this month, we had called it the house fund and that's exactly what it did even though there wasn't enough to buy the house out right and the improvements like installing running water and electric and appliances etc. It's losing money anyways so it's going over into the emergency fund/ medical funds.Right now our goals are:To have 6 months of emergency funds. 50% 2/4/2019To have 5 yrs of medical funds. Since that seems to be a big one of those our age having to go back to work for or going without meds etc we decided that to be the second goal to emergency funds. We are at 22% 2/4/2019To get gravel...which allows the deck to be built and the driveway redone as it's not in good shape. I have the $$ 100% for the deck but if we do it all at once I have 10% of the total.To improve house, awning over French doors on deck, 15 new windows that don't let drafts in, more insulation, siding put on, etc. Windows replacement are estimated at $4800, insulation is estimated at $3000. And siding is estimated at $6000 (siding is WOOD).  I rounded it up to $15000.We are at 0%.To have the truck paid off 2 years early 0%To NOT claim Social Security until 67 being the earliest with work to make it to 70. Two years ago it was claim at 62 due to paying health insurance and that was the only reason we would have to claim it that early.I got that backed up to 65.Every penny counts.We are going to town today after Hubby gets off work (I am not driving due to blurred vision thanks to meds) to FIRST see my Dad, then Menards, 11% rebate plus we have rebates to use to buy distilled water and furnace filter. Then to grocery store to get what is on my new diet that I don't have and can't make do without ...AKA Greek yogurt."},
{"title": "ON budget...well actually under", "date": "Friday, February 1, 2019", "text": "with even forgetting a category... didn't have anything for house maintenance. Yeah really, I guess we were like, hey, it's like new house LOL. The day I realized it wasn't in the budget was when I picked up furnace filters and had no where to input the amount and we both wondered why we didn't have that in the budget and walked around looking to see what else we forgot.We did nothing but the normal things of being frugal this month, I have used the dryer when I was down on Crohns or the temp was horribly cold or the rain/snow wouldn't let me use the clothes line on the kitchen porch. Hubby asked if I wanted a clothes line in the UNHEATED basement... Nope, already asked the Amish lady that lived here how that would go and she strongly suggested another drying rack.We came in under budget due to some being cheaper (aka electric was down) and some not happening at all. My $550/month budget for groceries was $187.24.The taxes I thought we would owe... I was a little high so we have that amount completely.I used last year's gardens budget to buy fresh seeds and the items to make soil blocks, weed barrier etc. I still have enough left to pay for the cattle feed panels (16 ft by 50 inches tall) to use for \"trellis\" and metal stakes to hold it up.More soil for the grow bags, worth saving both our backs.AND with coming under budget,  I am now going to talk to Hubby about cutting it again ON purpose and ways to bring in a bit more cash flow that isn't pulling from the retirement which lost over 2% last month. My savings earns more than that."},
{"title": "Garden Calendar and Amish cutting ice", "date": "Thursday, January 31, 2019", "text": "It is hard work doing it and there was 3 more than came to help. I kept watch in case some went in the pond. I know they have a 20 ft extension ladder and rope to pull anyone back out. I have a couple blankets at the door I can toss to them if needed. It looks like it will be an all day job. Our neighbor told us that the ice he cut from the pond last February was still solid in his spring house. BUT we didn't really have that hot of a summer.Hubby asked me last night to put my start seed dates, transplant and plant dates for this gardening season on a calendar. I had bought this calendar for that reason. It also helped me to decide what I was going to plant in spring and then in fall. I was able to work out succession planning at the same time. I ordered the items I need to make soil blocks a first for this attempt (Eliot Coleman), that will be in Feb the 7th for pick up. I do have some empty water containers to do some winter sowing in (Kevin...a Garden for the house) I haven't decide what to plant in them.Plus I need a place they can't get blown away.I am making sure I don't start my transplants too soon, which I have done and then had to transplant them into bigger pots and then transplant in to the garden... wasn't the best for the plants or me as it added stress along with starting other transplants.February seeds to start transplants : Tall Utah celery (first time) Celeriac (first time)Tokyo onions, long purple eggplant and diamond eggplant.March is going to be busy over 40 different seeds to get started or planted if the weather works with me which it usually doesn't. If it's too cold to plant my peas ( March 18th)in ground I will start them in seed blocks. I do have them broke down to so much a week instead of doing all of it at once.There will be around 38 to start in April. Plus April 19th is potato planting. Sweet potatoes will be May 23rd.What I did realize was I have no banana pepper seeds which I need and all of my tomatoes are determinate which is good for canning as they come mostly in within 2 wks but not good for having tomatoes to eat during the season.I probably have too many varieties of carrots,lettuce and Swiss chard. But I don't know what will grow well here.  I am planting more heirloom but  still deciding on what to harvest seeds from. My field paste tomatoes is a given.  I hope my fall garlic produces good so I can use my own garlic to replant this coming fall. I have Egyptian walking onions already planted. Scarlet runner, painted lady runner and sunset runner I will use to replant next year.I just have to make sure I don't plant in a way something cross pollinates.I need to start labeling my markers so I don't have to do that while trying to start seeds or plant.Stay warm , blessed be"},

{"title": "Polar Vortex and a smile from the neighborhood kids", "date": "Monday, January 28, 2019", "text": "Our Amish neighbor asked us last year before Christmas if they could use our pond to skate on, he specified there would be an adult or an older teenage with the kids at all times. They didn't want to buy their kids skates for Christmas if they couldn't use our pond, the other nearest pond is over 3 miles away.We were glad we agreed because we got such a kick out of watching them and us staying warm. Amish dad checked condition of ice. He actually does this weekly anyways to help us monitor the pond.Then Amish dad cleared the snow off the ice using pathways. That way he said the kids have to learn to turn not just go straight.They brought a sled also to sit on to change into skates but also to pull the youngest 2 that was there as they didn't have skates.Amish Dad showing the younger one just starting to skate how to do it. I really missed it as he also showed them how to fall...which he didn't do on purpose.Then the word went out and we had more Amish neighbor kids show up to skate also. The oldest teen took over when Amish Dad went to start chores.It was good to see a teenage pick up a 6 yr old and skate with him in his arms especially when they aren't siblings. The oldest teen made sure everyone got home on time and made a point of thanking us for the use of the pond.There are 8 in this picture, they blend into the tree line with their dark clothes. At one time we had over a dozen plus a dog that did his little walk across the ice and then got scoped up by several to be skated around the pond in arms.The polar vortex is suppose to hit us Wed morning. We are planning on it coming in Tuesday night. Since the dryer and the stove help warm the house I plan on doing laundry Wed and Thurs. along with baking the last of the winter squash to freeze in serving meal sizes. I can shut the bedroom off and hang blankets in 5 doorway if needed. Going to depend on the wind coming through. I know at 22 below the house is warm as it normally is. We will check gas levels in car, trucks and generator tonight as Hubby got gas for our cans when he got gas for the neighbors. On the menu, chili and taco soup for Hubby's lunches and turkey and noodles and mashed potatoes for one meal, turkey noodle soup from the leftovers of noodles. Custard as I have 1/2 gal of half and half. Might be a good time to make fresh mushroom soup LOL."},
{"title": "lousy week and weekend.", "date": "Sunday, January 27, 2019", "text": "The best part of this week is the Amish neighbor checked the ice in our pond. It's 4 inches of ice, 4 inches of water and then another 4 inches of ice. When the top layer is 6 inches he will allow his kids to ice skate on it. We already gave him the okay before they bought the kids new ice skates for Christmas. Plus he will cut ice blocks for his spring house when the ice gets closer to 7-8 inches. He puts a 20 ft extension ladder across the pond a rope tied to it in case anyone falls in , the way to get them out is already there. He has fell in himself and so have I so between an adult and the ladder and rope, and 6 inches of ice , it's as safe as we can make it. He walks the ice all over before his kids get on the ice also.Hubby has been working split shifts which definitely throws a wrench in his sleep pattern and our home routines. Doesn't help he broke a wind shield wiper on his truck and now has to go back to town this afternoon to get new ones. I told him to pick up a second set.I went to the hospital on Thursday evening thinking I had Crohn's since I had dry heaves and couldn't even keep my nausea meds down... they said it was a bug but didn't run the CT scan to rule out Crohns....well it was a bug that started it but I am definitely in the middle of a Crohn's attack. GI called to check on me and decided that since the hospital where GI is at was pretty much full with accident victims and elderly with broken bones and the roads were bad he would order meds for me to stay home and if it got bad for me to go to the local hospital fondly called band-aid station and have them page him. Hubby got meds... that tastes like CRAP. It is better than it was but no where as good as it would have been if they had kept me when I went in. Pain is at level 8 , which is down from 12 but the pain meds make me throw up that even the nausea meds won't kick down  so I can throw up and have dry heaves that triggers the hiatal hernia ... 6 one and half dozen the other... I'm sucking up the pain and keep reminding myself I have went through this all my life without pain meds and survived it. But right now the quality of my life is in the toilet.Still I managed to clean 30 of the 56 pantry shelves, figured since walking during attack (besides running to the bathroom) is encouraged that I would be productive without straining anything.I also when not feeling up to even walking down to the pantry worked on the layout of the gardens... good thing I did it on paper because it would have been a major screw up in the gardens. Not only did I not focus on tomatoes being determinate or indeterminate, I didn't note harvest times... having 4 different types of tomatoes coming on at once is NOT good. The beans weren't as bad, but added to the tomatoes would have overwhelmed me and triggered a Crohn's attack.Hubby went to the store, neighbor needed rock salt to make ice cream, kerosene  for lights and gas for the motor(lawnmower motor) to shell corn for the 100 calves they just got in. We needed gas for the generator, fuel for the truck, milk, 1 qrt of half and half, 1 lg container of large curd cottage cheese and 4 cans of Campbell's chicken and noodles or chicken and stars soups... please note the sizes and the brand name I used because as much as I  rely on Hubby I am not sure I will let him to go the store with even a WRITTEN NOTE. He got the milk and the cottage cheese right... but brought home 1/2 gallon of half and half (custard is on the menu a lot this week which I am not up to eating yet) AND Great Value chicken noodle soup which is one of the brands I can not eat.SO I am now down to bouillon and ramen noodles broken up... stars and alphabet pasta are now on the list, as I have already wiped out my broth supply and am not up to dealing roasting anything to make broth. I have tomato soup, can make homemade tomato soup but having it 4 times a day gets too weary of a meal.  Thankful as I am to have food in the pantry, I need to add SICK food to the pantry.

{"title": "Two neighbors came to tell us it was 22 below at 7 am.", "date": "Monday, January 21, 2019", "text": "Hubby plowing again as he plowed yesterday for 5 hrs after working all night plow state routes. Neighbor and his brother in law saw Sherm out and thought they should come tell him how cold it was. It was just around 10 below when they were talking. Hubby grew up farming with livestock so he knows how to bundle up.I put laundry on the drying rack and got a new sock dryer on clearance with 15 % off to dry the socks.Suppose to hang it from a clothes line or shower rod but this spot has a heat vent in the kitchen. Wished I would have had one of these when the kids were little with all the wet mittens , hats and socks there was in the winter.I have bread rising and a pie crust in the frig chilling to bake custard pie.The kettle on the stove has hot tea.We had fresh eggs (another free 2 dozen from the Amish neighbor) and bacon and toast for brunch as we both slept in from working out side yesterday. I stayed up and watched the moon ellipse ... had to go outside as it passed directly over the house and dumb me didn't go look out the skylight in the upstairs north loft. I went out side in the freaking snow and cold. I roasted brisket yesterday while roasting our chuck steak. It's now just a reheat for today as we didn't know if Hubby would be called into work or not.I've adjust my baking schedule and what to fix according to the coldest days this week. Tomorrow is decent starts at 5 above and goes to mid 30s. and Wed is the same and then it's a down hill slide again through the weekend. Winter squash and definitely a turkey in the oven this week.Might do another pie and cookies, maybe bread pudding.I tossed the grocery store ads directly in the trash when Hubby brought them in with the newspaper.Hubby now has 19 % saved for one trailer, if he buys both trailers he is wanting together he has 15%. The one place sells both and he is hoping when he goes to buy there he can get a deal with buying 2 for CASH. BUT if he went and bought the smaller one first he would 76 %.I have 85 % of the garden stuff with 10 %  saved for what is left I need.I am still at 35% for the deck gravel as the garden is coming first.We are still at 50% for the health ins which is okay as we won't NEED it for 18 months but still don't want to need it and not have it.I spent $55 on groceries this month. 2 gals milk, 2 lbs carrots, 6 lbs of onions, 2 lbs of limes, 3 avocados, 2 bags of tortilla chips, 1 container of cottage cheese, 1 of ricotta cheese and 1 of Greek yogurt, pkg of 16 of 8 inch tortilla wraps,6 lbs of apples and 4 lbs of mushrooms (marked down). I needed celery but I wasn't willing to pay that price for something that looked that bad.The neighbor had some and gave it to me in exchange for going after gas for them , wasn't out of the road as Hubby had to go to work.It's easy to be frugal when you can't go anywhere due to the weather. I did research online the items I need to make soil blocks for my seeds and another grow light. Along with that I priced out gravel for the entire driveway, the deck and around the pond...if I pay for it ALL then I'm 10%. Hubby is trying to find someone to loan him a dump truck, he has a couple ex co workers that own them. IF we can borrow the dump truck for the price of fuel it's cuts the cost by 45 %.Blessed Be"},

I thought it was good as I was born between a snow storm and a flood. I spent Friday baking and figuring out what I wanted to fix that could be cooked and reheated.Saturday morning we did a test run for a hour of the generator running the house. Hubby made sure it was full when we turned it off.Four deep freezers, 2 refrigerators, sump pump, water pump and furnace... the small generator did fine, you almost couldn't tell when the furnace fan or the deep freezer kicked on, the pull wasn't enough to make that much of a difference. I am glad Hubby got one that he knew would handle the whole house. Can't run the dryer on it as it's 220 and that would pull hard. But I am not running the dryer much any ways. I did pull drinking water so if we ran out of fuel while Hubby was working and couldn't get home that I would have water. I can drain the water lines and have small \"buddy\" propane heaters (with a window open some for ventilation). My gas stove burner work without electric but the oven won't if we don't have electric. As long as the generator works everything is about normal as we don't run a lot of things at one time anyways. Hubby had to go to work at midnight so supper of leftover lasagna was early. I pretty much worked in the pantry in the basement so not to disturb him while he was sleeping.Sunday. this morning I woke and was surprised the dogs hadn't woke me up during the night or early this morning like was normal for them. Guess they didn't want to deal with the nasty weather either.Temp was 5 with wind chill of 8 below. I let them out through the basement to go up the ramp and through the garage that is just a tarp covered garage in a box, so Wilbur could actually go potty away from the house, he slid off the kitchen porch last night trying to jump through the drift and only caught part of the porch , not hurt but worried us enough to change how he goes out until we clear a  path for him and the porch isn't slick. Charlotte and Rascal seemed to wait for him and he followed their footsteps this morning. We call Charlotte snow bunny as she loves running around in the snow.Hubby cleared the back door when he got home this morning. Could not get the F350 (large dual wheel truck) up the driveway so he has spent all morning plowing his own driveway.I'm not sure he will get to snow blowing the sidewalk to the barn , drift is up to my waist or the couple pathways he was talking about making for Wilbur and Rascal (as Rascal has had a leg injury and that flares up when it's this cold) to go potty away from the house. They still haven't let him know if he is working tonight or not. They might have him come in on Monday instead since it's a holiday and they weren't suppose to work the holiday.I have a chuck steak in the oven on low as if it was a roast for supper.  I will start a brisket for tomorrow in a bit. I did put a load of laundry in to wash this morning, with the wind chill I won't be using the line but want to keep the electric down. I can get one good load on my drying rack. So it's a load or two every day this week.I need to get started on the brisket, it can share the oven with tonight's supper."},

{"title": "I know I am going to forget...so", "date": "Tuesday, January 15, 2019", "text": "I thought I would jot these frugal moments down.I put foam insulators in the outlets and switches. Since I didn't have many (I know we have a ton some where in the barn) I started in the wheelchair bathroom as it's outside wall socket is on the northwest corner... WIND  came through the actual socket. YIPS. I put the insulator on and then did the north wall in the front room...same WIND. The front room east wall had some but not as bad.Hubby went out in the barn and found some pieces of insulation board and a couple wood boards and put them on the northwest and north walls foundation of the house. He also insulated the old breaker box that is NOT connected to anything but we didn't get off the side of the house last summer and thought that was also part of the draft probably. There is still a 3 degree temp between the front room and Wheelchair bathroom and the rest of the outside walls. We will be doing insulation this summer. I don't think they put insulation where the garage walls met the foundation when they converted the garage to the front room and bathroom.I found a hole in the foundation of the pump house that Hubby now has plugged. We have a gas heater in there also so that also saves on the propane being used to keep the pump from freezing.I already noticed a drop in the amount of propane we use each week even though our propane company let us know we are 5 % below average usage for this house and what appliances use gas including me canning and baking.I found more outlet and switch insulators so I continue around the outside walls.Child safety plugs are on the to buy list to stop the cold air coming through the actually outlet holes ( update, got some and have about half the house outlets now plugged)With the change to LED Christmas lights even with more expensive electric here than the old place where the bill would have been around $225... it was $128 . We averaged 45 cents/day compared to the month before for the use of the LED lights. I see more LED Christmas lights in the future as the fake tree had regular lights on it this year so that is on the to buy list.I continue to turn the furnace down to 60 when we are out of the house more than 4 hrs, I turn it down to 64 when we are gone less than 4 hrs.I now unplug my laptops not just turn them off along with unplugging phone chargers and the 2 extra landline phones base. I found the landlines don't go dead for a week even off the chargers. I want to see if this brings down the electric this month. Hubby put his on a power strip as it doesn't plug in to an easy place to get to.I had to bake 4 different things at 4 different temps so I started with the lowest setting and time it so there was only about 10 min between what I was baking. The last was dinner at 400 for 15 min.I wrote up the menu and the baking menu..figured out the temps so I can do more combined baking to save propane.I have to replace some baking pans. Since I bake  and I will be doing more of baking I am not buying cheap, but well made sturdy that will hold up years. I checked out Wilton first , it's been my go to for decades but the last 4 pans I bought did not hold up past 3 yrs. My son 2 had a pan from King Arthur that he has used for everything, deep dish pizza, lasagna ( I use glass for this but son uses parchment paper to line when using acid stuff in his metal pans), cakes, etc. YES HE BAKES. He has had this pan for 10 yrs. So I am going to try King Arthur (had a gift card from Son 2 which made the cost more in line with what I was willing to spend and stay in budget. This is out of my spending money for myself budget.I ordered my canning supplies through Fillmore. Mason jar rings and lids. I pick up jars when they go on sale at the end of the canning season and stores are clearing them out.That was in the garden budget.The house humidity is 36 and needs to be at least 42 so Hubby is picking up distilled water for the humidifier  after work today after he goes to the bank... won't have to back track for anything that way. I don't NEED anything from the store.Usually we have to start the humidifier in Nov so we have save $$ not having to buy distilled water for 2 1/2 months.My Auto ins agent was checking our policy (he does every 2 months) and was able to reduce our payments by $80/ month since I turn 60 this month.I am hanging laundry on the kitchen porch line to freeze dry LOL or become damp and finish drying on drying rack. When I don't want to do this I remind myself that I want the deck this early summer not next year and the money I save pays for the gravel we need to put the deck up.We did splurge and bought dinner at a different Chinese restaurant. Hubby paid using the money he got helping the neighbor. We had enough left over of 2 dinners(Hubby eats SPICY) that we had 2 more meals each. So that actually made it as cheap as the Chinese buffet with a coupon. Hubby was happier as he got SPICY. Next he will get something with seafood...I know him. LOLI was making the grocery list last night as my basement frig froze my carrots and celery (grr.. This happens a couple times a year and I can fix it myself since my Appliance guy showed me how). I asked Hubby if he still wanted apples for his lunches. He thought about it and said NO, he wouldn't need them to next week... I came back with I am not going to the store next week so you will need to figure out what you want to use instead....He changed it to YES, he wanted apples. He takes apples, crackers and peanut butter for snacks for work. They work nice if he's not able to get back into the main post to eat something. He takes a thermos of hot food, trail mix and a thermos of coffee as he drinks water when he is at the main post or out post.  I am going to the store about every 2 wks I would love to stretch it to 3 if I can get milk that is dated a bit farther out than 1 week.I had some errands to run to pay some bills and appointments this week. I am glad I made phone calls. One bill was not only paid over the phone they set me up for auto pay, they don't have a website. Two others told me of better times to come in on different days. Sounds like Monday and Fridays are horrible. I was suppose to go to 4 stores(rebates combined with sales) BUT two of those might not happen as the one appt was cancelled so I won't be in that area. I am not sure the savings is worth the trip and the rebates don't have expire until next month. So instead of running around using $20 of gas and waiting in long lines today I am home making soup (was suppose to be creamy enchiladas from The Prudent Homemaker) but decided to do a soup(carries better for hubby in his thermos) of dried diced potatoes, dried carrots, dried red onions, dried celery, dried parsley, dried oregano,powered marjoram , 2 cups of diced turkey, 6 large bouillon cubes and 8 cups of water. Was good...think I will do beef bouillon cubes, diced beef and add dried mushrooms next time and see how that goes. Might toss barley in there also.Hubby has 10 % of what he needs to save for the trailers he is wanting. He should get his first paycheck this week so he can fill his truck up as he as made his fuel last 4 wks ...he has a 40 gal tank. His pay goes into his savings for the 2 trailers he wants to buy.We have 50 % of what we will owe on taxes, might be more with the changes of deductibles.We have 50 % of what we want saved to pay for health ins in 2 yr when Hubby's old employer no longer pays our share.As I remind myself daily when looking for ways to save Money that I am saving for the gravel and gardens and maybe some Christmas lights that are LED at this time.I have saved 35 % of the amount needed for the gravel for the deck.I have 75 % of the amount to cover what I feel I need in the gardens.I probably forgot something LOL"},

That way if I am in hospital with my Crohn's Hubby can handle it on his own.#5 To acknowledge that some of my tried and true varieties will not work in this area.

I was give 2 varieties of pickling cucumbers and I chose 11 winter squashes as I usually don't grow these as I could pick them up at the one farm market that was close from where we lived last year. I also wanted more variety that 4-5 since we will be eating them during the winter.I also added watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe. We'll see if the longer growing time helps.Grasses  this is my Japanese Hulless popcorn. I won't grow sweet corn this year since I have several neighbors in the area that grow sweet corn. I only need to grow popcorn every 2-3 yrs depending on the incoming crop and how much I share. Lamiacea mostly herbs 27 varieties... instead of buying plants I am starting from seedsLegumes (beans beans peas LOL)  32 varieties. I added mung beans this year along with 8 dried beans varieties.Morning Glory , not growing the flower  but am growing sweet potatoes, using one of the sweet potatoes that the Amish neighbor gave me to grow slips. It was from her brother who lived here 17 yrs ago.Solanaceous (tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, okra) 20 varieties . I added 2 varieties of each of eggplant and okra and 4 of peppers I plan to dry. PLUS I added 3 varieties of small potatoes.Umbelliferae (carrots, celery ) 14 varieties there are a couple herbs in this also ..cilantro being one.PLUS  we will be growing what is called green manure... like buckwheat, clovers, corn salad , Claytonia , and annual rye.We measured the south garden .We have a 8 ft gate to the pond that I was leaving a path from the driveway to it open but Hubby and Amish neighbor, Eli agreed they would both be okay using the other gate that comes from Eli's pasture on the south side of our pond.  SO the south garden is 40 ft wide and 112 ft long.North garden is perennials. I have rhubarb, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, asparagus, chives, garlic chives and 1 sage plant. I put my fall garlic there also. The area left to plant (as I already marked space to plant more berry bushes, is 24 ft wide by 74 ft long.We have  3 areas in back yard by house that can be planted or have containers. One is 9x5, the other two are both 5 x 11.We have a fence line at the kennel east side is 16 ft , south side is 48 ft that we can use for planting vines.We are still debating on whether to do low tunnels or green house depending on $$ for late fall,winter, early spring growing.I started Egyptian walking onions on the west side of the sidewalk at the flower garden on the north side of the house. I have 3 hostas that need moved from that area, they have out grown their spot. SO I will put smaller plants there that can handle the shade. I might save some of it for lettuce during the hotter parts of the summer.Following Elliot Coleman New Organic Grower book I listed all the plant families on index cards. I wrote what varieties was in each family. I then highlight variety by what season it could be planted in. Green highlighter is spring, summer is NO highlighter, orange highlighter is fall and blue highlighter is for winter. I have a few that has all four.The ones that can be planted for a winter crop will be pulled as I don't want to plant them during another season.Then I will focus on summer only... I will list what needs to be started as a transplant and by what date so I can mark that on my garden calendar and make sure I have enough supplies.A lot of spring crops can be grown in the fall also, certain varieties do better in fall than spring and vice versa so I will do them last. Listing transplants also and their start dates on my garden calendar.Hubby found a couple metal filing cabinets in the barn so I can use them to organize files with plants and such. Since I am not taking my laptop out in the gardens I want sheet paper and a clip board to write notes on while I am in the garden and then will put over on to computer (called Scan and save)Back to reading and organizing"},
{"title": "After Reading The Prudent Homemaker", "date": "Monday, January 7, 2019", "text": "Where Brandy listed what she wanted to improve in her home, gardens and personal, made me think about looking at more than just the finances, gardens, pantry etc...We are close to living our dream life... we are in the country in our own home doing our own maintenance when it needs done (instead of waiting months before the landlord decides it's worth doing or not doing which drove us nuts). We have the land we wanted to grow the gardens we want. We have an income but still need to work for the items we want that are WANTS not needs.AND we like that as it give purpose to be out and about.We still have things we need (like ramps for wheelchair access and railing on the porches for ins reasons) that cost $$ that we are saving up. Hubby took part time work to save up for the 2 trailers he wants to buy that will bring more money in to the home in the long run.SO what is left?Home...the mudroom is a dumping ground for anything that is to go to the barn or Hubby dumps things on the counter top for stuff he means to put away that he forget to put away because he goes into the I'll do it later mode.My rocker in the bedroom is breeding magazines. I have canceled all except the 4 I read but Hubby finds one some where and puts it there so I can read it at night. I don't read magazines at night LOLArea beside the kitchen frig which is at the door to the basement gets loaded with stuff that should be put away in the basement. Funny how we walk to the upstairs to put something away but not the basement.Kitchen, Hoosier counter on over load, counters constantly is loaded especially the bfast bar area and my roll cart at the stove gets dumped on all the time.In the laundry room, Hubby shoves boxes off odds and ends under my clothes that are on racks (Don't have closets yet). I think I might have got this stopped this weekend when I put the two boxes he did it with ON HIS DESK.My office... MY Desk is the worse, but it's now over flowed to my table. I have 4 boxes in the corner plus of course the 3 drawers in the desk ... I need a bigger circular file and a filing cabinet and about 8 hrs to work on it.Sewing room, box after box after box. I need to build shelves to sort the fabric and yarn on and set up my sewing machine. SO I can sew aprons, curtains for entire house (warm weather and cold), pillows and the Christmas gifts I didn't get done this year.We would love to have the barn decluttered before the end of summer... I doubt if we will get that far as the house is the priority on that.IN the gardenI would love to have flowers that I can at least have 1 bouquet a week if not two. I have plans for planting flowers.Herbs, as I am starting a new garden from bare nothing I really have to focus on getting the herbs rolling. I did transplant my chives, garlic chives and sage that seems to have survived. My thyme and oregano didn't. I have garden mints that I will have to remove part of, not something I use a lot of.I would like berry bushes, a new grape harbor with seedless grapes that is NOT on the driveway. Hubby has to almost put the F350 in the yard to not clip the concord grape harbor.More perennial onions. I started a few last fall and they seem like they are okay so far.Personal...No Crohn's attacks that put me in the hospital... think of walking a tight rope on that one.Eating healthier... I don't eat enough protein and with the work I am doing here I definitely can't put off not changing my diet.Learn German.Have at least 1 get together with friends and neighbors this year."},
{"title": "2019 A New Year.", "date": "Thursday, January 3, 2019", "text": "Budget is in place...I joined Goodcheapeats.com for the Jan. pantry challenge.I joined  Frugalwoods.com for the Uber Frugal Money challenge.Then we went out to eat last night at the local Chinese buffet... granted I sat down and went to sleep at 2:30, thinking I would just take a break until 3 and Hubby woke me up at 4 when he came in and wondered why I didn't wake up when the dogs carried on. I'm still recovering from the crud most likely or worse I am getting it again thanks to Son 2 that ended up in Urgent care the day after we met for dinner.So while at the Chinese buffet, which I had a coupon for, and have 3 more so we can eat out ONCE a month and I am taking it out of the grocery budget. We have 12 days to the next pay and we are doing fine. We talked about our goals for this year, two years, 5 years, 7 years *we will be full retirement age for SS* and 10 yrs.We talked about the south garden, that I measured wrong big time. I thought it 40 ft x 40 ft west of the pond gate, the gate was 8 ft and then 37 ft x 40 ft east of the gate...NOPE It's 80 ft x 40 ft west of the pond gate. the gate is 8 ft (Hubby thought 10 ft which is why he was out measuring) and the east section is 24 ft x 40 ft. Which made us both realize that neither of us knew what the north garden was. We will be measuring it this weekend.We talked about over lapping big projects... aka gardens along with putting in the deck and redoing one of the porches or back stoop steps. Continuing to go through boxes. Down to 4 in the office and 12 in the basement as I finally got through all of them in my bedroom.  We talked about lack of storage and closet and how we are glad I didn't put the closets in where I thought to as it would have not worked well at all.We talked about changing how we eat. I brought up that March I usually start buying what we term as spring crops, asparagus, beets, radishes, fresh greens, peas, snow peas ...when reality those crops don't come in until late April, some times May. I buy summer crops in late May/June but those crops don't really come in until mid June. We start eating winter squash in Oct when really we should not be eating it until late Nov or Dec since it's what we should be eating come Feb/March. If we are going to eat from what is in the garden in season...we have to think about when the harvest is coming in , not the planting time.We talked about sweets... I will eat one piece, maybe 2 of pie, cake or brownies.I maybe eat 2 servings of ice cream or sherbet. Which sticks Hubby with eat the rest. He still needs to lose weight. Cookies I will scarf down, M&M's also especially after Hubby makes his trail mix of M&M's, dried fruit, peanuts and cashews. That's he snack at break at work.It's my breakfast most mornings.We talked about me making room in the kitchen refrigerator freezer for bfast items, like homemade McD's egg mc muffin, sausage egg burritos, pancakes, waffles and French toast.We talked about healthy sweets that put dairy in our diet, Both of us have low calcium levels.I brought up that with the work load for me going up with starting into the gardens and yard work, that I needed a day of baking that I can do the baking for the week. We needed a menu that focused of using up what was needed to have a place to put the harvest in when it comes in. We decided that baking day should be Saturday, maybe Friday and Saturday depending on the type of bread thinking of brioche and sour dough. IF I am putting bfast items in the freezer then how much. Hubby thought a month supply of 5 days with weekends being a brunch instead of bfast and lunch. With changing the menu plan from beef on Saturday to soup so I am just putting it together and letting it simmer. Having beef on Sunday instead.I will testing this \"new\" menu and routine starting tomorrow.Blessed Be"},
{"title": " examining the  budget and the pantry", "date": "Monday, December 31, 2018", "text": "I'm sitting here drinking my last cup of coffee for the day, smelling the beef broth I am making from odds and ends of beef roasts we had during Dec that I had tossed in the freezer until a \"broth\" day. Makes me hungry so I will probably have a cup of beef broth for lunch.End of the year I tally what I have spent in the kitchen and gardens... What I saved us that we probably would have spent if I had been working outside the home.I have already ordered all my seeds for the coming season. I will need to order garlic IF my garlic does not do well. I will know that come Sept. We are adding berry bushes also this spring. I have $1200 left in the garden budget from this year since we didn't really plant anything. SO that will be added to this coming year's budget. I know I will need trellis and black plastic and other odds and ends that comes with starting a new garden so it will be higher in cost this year.Years ago I used to do the twice a year Pantry Challenge that Jessica has over at goodcheapeats.com... It really helped when I had to clear the pantry after Daughter 2 and her 4 sons moved out... then again when Daughter 4 and her two kids and Son 2 moved out at the same time.It also showed me how our eating habits had changed.Now my pantry challenge is different... I will need room for the new produce coming in. I need room in the freezers and room on the pantry shelves.2018 I spent $6,603.42 on food, that included any produce I bought to stock and to restock 3 empty deep freezers. Of that $6,603.42 I spent $1, 211.99 on meat, that is including 9 turkeys, 6 hams and 6 briskets (that I cut to make 24 briskets) along with other meat.SO I spent $5,391.43 at the grocery store for other stuff than meat. This is the only year I did not put eating out as part of the grocery budget as I knew it would be on the high side with working here daily.As I kept track I know that $3594.29 was for fresh produce, which 80% I could grow on my own and the majority of that is NOT stored in my pantry. That's $2,875.43 I could have saved.Hubby was talking to a friend about how I save us enough money that it would match me working full time at $10/ hr.$10/ hr for a 40 hr week is $400$400/ wk for 52 wks (1 yr) is $20,800$20,800 minus the 25% tax we pay is $15,600.$15,600 divided by 52 wks is $300 a week...He could have took the taxes off the week and multiplied in by 52 also but the friend needs things broke down this way.With the way I price things out, push him to price things out, do the pantry, the gardens, drive our autos etc. On average I have saved that during a year. This year I save over that with researching mortgages,loan to fix the house and Hubby's truck... not counting anything else.It's what I used to pay off the hospital bill.My goal is to match the $15,600 this year even with the extra expenses of medical ins/copay/deductibles and have it in the savings.We will see how this goesI would rather look at this picture of the south garden from Autumn than look at the muddy mess it is right now. We are having a warm rain, a blessing as it's December in Ohio that it's not a freezing rain with it being New Year's Eve. This has been one of our wettest years.I spent 3 days , 8 hrs each day going through seeds, writing out a sheet of information for each one that will be on a clip board and taken to the gardens during the season to monitor how each does. I don't know what varieties work best here.I listed each on spreadsheets by their family I have 14 families (did you know that beets, spinach and Swiss chard are the same family?) and then listed them by what season they could be planted in.That is simple except I have 245 varieties between herbs, flowers (most edible) and 4 seasons of veggies. Not counting we will be adding to the berry bushes and might have to replace strawberries if they didn't take in the transplant.I have chose some more heirloom so I can provide my own seeds. And will have to make sure they don't cross breed with another. One person said they put their seed plant(s) in pots and keep them separate from the rest of the gardens so they are easier to not let cross breed.In the past year I spent just under $5000 for veggies and fruit to put on the table...not can or freeze for later use.Amish neighbor gave me a sweet potato to start my slips with. I got that in a jar of water as of yesterday.It's the variety her brother and brother in law grew when they lived here.Now, I have to figure out a rotation plan so I am not planting something after something else that shouldn't be plus Hubby would like to see a spot that rests each year plus plant green manure each fall, annual rye does good around here.I also need to figure out what needs started in house to be transplanted.We took a walk around the property and I was pointing out where I could plant things that wasn't in the gardens... I could see the look of \" more work for me\" on Hubby's face until I pointed out I could put weed barrier along the fences and use the fences to plant vine plants and he wouldn't have to run the trimmer along the fences... that's at least an hour if not more of work he did this last summer. I could plant 3 areas that have been trouble areas for him to get mowed as he has to use the push mower to mow them. My thoughts are to change it so it works for us and be easy to maintain.I talked to my Amish lady neighbor as she is the one that does the gardens, she has 3. When an Amish person looks at your gardens and then back to you and says \"weed barrier and black plastic, cattle panels with stakes\"you listen. I've paid attention of how their gardens are set up and watched how them maintain them. My neighbor does most her gardens by herself. Her oldest 3 are old enough to watch the youngest 4 while she is in the gardens especially since they are outside playing where she is at. Towards the end of the season the oldest 2 were starting to help pick and the other 2 olders ones watched the youngest 3 but were right where she was at.She told me to be in the garden by (meaning her laundry is washed and on the line and she's fixed breakfast for 9 and did the dishes by hand by this time also)8 am the latest and start at the row that is away from the house. Stop at 10:30 and fix lunch which is at noon for them. Process what ever you picked after lunch. Do the house work, fix dinner and go back out to the gardens after dinner for at least 1 or 2 hrs, process that before bed. She \"puts up\" over 3000 quarts of veggies, over 2000 of fruit, over 3000 of meat (they don't have freezers or refrigerators) not counting the jam, jelly, juice she cans also.That is also not counting the root cellar of sweet potatoes, potatoes, and winter squash  or the onions she stores. She said \"it's not energy, it's routine\". Putting food up is the priority over housework, not being in the gardens in the heat of the day is also a priority. She also told me that if I wasn't planning on selling at the auction to pull the plant once I have enough for the pantry and replace it with something else. EAT FRESH FROM THE GARDEN. She does not pull any veggies or fruit from her pantry when the garden is in full swing.So I asked for her routine...Monday is laundry and cleaning the homeTuesday is baking, ironing and mending and more laundry (9 of them, laundry is pretty much daily and takes 4-5 hrs to do not counting drying time on the clothesline).Wednesday is for more detailed jobs or something that pops up, sometimes she will go help clean whomever is having Church that coming Sunday or go help a family member. And laundryThursday she helps her mother in law(her parents live out of state) and laundryFriday laundry and maybe errands if her Hubby is able to go also. She very seldom goes in the buggy without him.Saturday, laundry, clean home which is over 5000 SQ FT, do laundry, baking, preparing Sunday's mealsSunday, church or family on off church week (church is every 2 wks), it's the day of rest. She tries to not cook much, cold bfast, lunch at church and maybe soup or sandwiches for dinner. In the summer, it might just be salad, popcorn or something else that is light.She offered the wisdom that to get my home routine in place that reflects the time I will be in the gardens, then in the \"off\" months I will have time for sewing and such.Blessed be"},
{"title": "in the kitchen", "date": "Sunday, December 30, 2018", "text": "As the year ends one of my habits is to go through my kitchen to get clear away what isn't working for me and to set how I want it to function for the new year.Hubby bought me a new cast iron griddle and a separate cast iron grill that fits over the middle burner of my gas stove... which we can celebrate that the stove is now fixed, under warranty and I no longer have to use a lighter to ignite the largest burner I have.I have to have something for Hubby to pack in his lunches that could be eaten cold if he doesn't make it back to the post so he can reheat it. I bought a thermos from Amazon that I had saw on The Prudent Homemaker blog that she had looked at.Mondays I will clean both refrigerators as Tuesday is our trash day. I will be noting what I have to throw out in the trash or compost..I will also be keeping an eye on leftovers. I've been packaging them and put them back in the freezer for nights we get in late or I am sick and Hubby doesn't feel up to cooking for himself.The food budget is $250...non food is $40 with the note the dogs are a separate budget.I have a calendar on my kitchen wall with the \"menu\" . It's more of what protein I will be cooking that night.Monday is Mexican, that can be beef,pork, poultry or beans , something we did when we first got together was go to a local Mexican restaurant and have a drink (soda or coffee as Hubby worked nights and I was driving) and got the \"snack\" bar for free. It had refried beans, salsa, sour cream, black olives, scallions,  and fresh cooked tortilla chips. I now have a tortilla press and many of the spices etc I need to make our own Mexican. (Dec 31st we will have BBQ pork ribs).Tuesday is pork( pork loin, tenderloin, chops, roasts, ground pork, sausage patty and bulk, smoked sausage, and ribs)which works this week as I have leftover pork roast in the freezer that will go with the leftover kraut and some mashed potatoes for Jan 1st.Wednesday will be Asian... when Hubby was working in Alabama for 2 yrs and I stayed in Ohio raising the last 4 kids as they were in the last 2 years of high school. I would go to the local Asian restaurant after going spending time with church friends.. Since I don't want my meal swimming in sauce that is high is sodium and years of working in classes with a Thai chef. I will be starting back to cooking my own. Hubby prefers beef and I prefer chicken... I am still floating thoughts of doing both but using the same veggies or doing one this week and the other the next week. I will be going back to making my own egg rolls, either with cabbage or bean sprouts and will try my hand at pot stickers aka fried dumplings ,once we eat through the 3 bags we have in the freezerThursday is poultry. I still have 5 frozen turkeys and 18 meals of shredded turkey in my freezers. I also have 26 meals of chicken so I think we are really set in that area.Friday is a floating day... either vegetarian or seafood. ... pizza or calzones could fit in there alsoSaturday is beef , 24 beef briskets, 6 prime rib roasts along with chuck roasts, chuck steaks and hamburger.Sunday is left overs that I don't shove in freezer, soup.or breakfastSince I have home made soup canned, it can be real simply to use for Hubby's lunches when supper isn't something he wants to carry.The idea is to write down what I buy, what I cook and what is tossed with note of why."},

So it's just going to be the cost of the gravel with no delivery charge.Awning to go over French doors that lead to deck...Rework driveway and gravel...28 ft livestock trailer ...28 ft flat bed trailer...Building a \"box\" on top of the trailer we have to have an enclosed trailer.Clear last of plants around pond and gravel edge...Front porch redone...Kitchen porch redone...Back door stoop redone...Gate to back door at house on sidewalk...Widen sidewalks to fit wheelchair...Trim apple trees...Trim dogwood...Trim lilac bush...Plant 2nd lilac bush...Plant maple tree...Design and plant 4 season gardens with 4-5 yr rotation availability...Rebuild garden shed at gardens...Build small green house...Get home energy audit...Replace all windows (all doors have been replaced) on house ...Put siding on the entire house...Paint porch area on barn that is not metal siding...Install lights in dog kennel area of barn ...Install lights in \"garage\" area of barn...There are things like installing closets (in barn that can be repainted and used) and shelves (in barn that can be repainted and used) and the endless changes we will do as we live through the seasons and years.Tuesday MERRY CHRISTMAS.Wednesday < Hubby is at work while I go over 2019 budget againAs our IRAs are making money invested in the stock market and the stock market is losing like is did in 2008 and this  Dec being as bad as the Dec in 1931. We had a meeting with our finance guy over the phone (saving us gas money)... we talked about losing half of what we have as the worse that could happen (it gets that low we will cash out and put it in a savings acct) and making it last until Hubby reaches full retirement of Social Security. What would our income be? About 1/4th of what it is now.So Hubby and I talked about things and then decided continue with the withdraws as is (which freaks our finance guy out some) BUT cutting the budget as much as possible and putting the \"rest\" of the money in a savings acct. Won't earn as much but won't be losing either.Hubby is working part time for state hwy dept. All money he earns after paying for his fuel and any meals he has to eat out though he plans to pack daily , will go towards by the trailers.We will know where we stand with federal and state taxes in April, we do know we have to pay to the school that we moved from and hoping that we get refunds enough to cover most of that. We requested twice as much to be withheld for Federal and State since we knew he would be earning money on odd jobs and hope there won't be a really with paying the taxes.My Job, as Hubby puts it is to cut the budget, save money aka follow behind and and remind him to turn off lights, unplug stuff that is electric vampire and grow enough garden to provide for us for the year including during the winter.I went back over the budget as we had forgot somethings when listing it... like maintenance on the tractor that he can't do himself while under warranty, tow truck when the F350 wouldn't start this very morning  as we having nothing big enough to tow that. He is hoping it's because he forgot to \"plug\" it in as it's diesel.Goal is to keep the electric down below what is budgeted. I called our \"trash\" company and they have another service that will lower our bill by 50 % BUT I am limited on how much I can put out. Our Amish neighbor said we should get a burn barrel from a neighbor of his brother's and only burn paper products (not plastic or metal which some people we know have done) and he could use the ashes in our field that he rents along with our own gardens and is going to help us set up a compost... we don't have much to compost to begin with.Last year I had to restock the freezers as we had ate pretty much what was in them also the pantry was only half full and we didn't put out much garden.I was able to put up enough to get us to mid summer thanks to the kindness of the neighbors and the family we bought the house from. The total budget for food and non food was $600 a month. I cut it to half of that amount.This week I will be planning out the gardens. I'm glad I picked up 3 more turkeys and 2 hams than what I planned.We found a place to get bigger bags of dog food for the same price as the smaller bags.We will take down the Christmas lights and put what little Christmas we put up away by this weekend.Not that the LED lights on timers raised the bill much.I will continue to use the drying rack and clothesline on the kitchen porch as much as possible.When I use the oven I try to put more than one dish in it at a time. One pot meals will be common.We budgeted 2 tanks / month of gas for my car, two for the old truck and 1 for the F350... as Hubby will be paying for fuel out of his paycheck or what he earns hauling for the Amish. I planned the 1 tank in case we have to use that truck for so reason that we can't drive the jeep. What ever isn't used for fuel or maintenance goes back into savings for that month.We won't be doing a lot of driving to go visit. In fact we just had two different couples of friends that kept asking us to come down and go out to eat and I was honest and told them that at this point and time we couldn't afford to always come to them as they are an hour away and we definitely couldn't afford to eat out where they wanted to go. They were more than welcome to come here  and I would fix dinner for all of us or we could bring something to share for a meal at their home every other time. We haven't heard from the one couple , the other is coming tonight for potluck dinner after Hubby gets off work.Have a safe and Happy New Year'sBlessed Be"},

Found out that he was given the incorrect information so they refunded the fee and he corrected his account to not get a charge again.He made a couple calls pricing the cost of getting his welding torch tanks filled.Found one that was 1/5th of the one he was going to use.I hung laundry on clothesline on the kitchen porch. Yes it's freezing outside here in Ohio but the clothes froze and then when I brought them in hard as a rock, jeans were standing on their own 😀, 10 min fluff in the dryer with no heat had them soft enough to fold. Was definitely dry. All in all I only used the dryer 1 hr for 8 loads of laundry and NO HEAT on. The underclothes was hung on the drying rack.I roasted a turkey that we bought before Thanksgiving for 37 cents/lbs.I will freeze the leftovers in meal size bags and make broth from the carcass.I ordered our prescriptions for pick up tomorrow so we can pick them up when we are out running errands and going to 3 different doctor appts.I made the grocery list and checked coupons for tomorrow.I ordered the last of the garden seeds.Tuesday Dec. 11th3 doctors appts and errands on top of it.Our primary has agreed to see us at the same time so we are only making one trip. He no longer does evening hours but did say if Hubby couldn't get off work and needed the last appt of the day and called that he was on his way , he would stay until we got there. He suggested we get our blood work done no earlier than a month ahead of the appt. when we were already there, just reminded us in was a fasting blood work.Our dentist was willing to do the same as that was the other appt for hubby.We did a run through Menards, using the last of the rebates we had to pick up some \"odds and ends\" like timer, pet safe salt for the porches etc. Also we bought a thermometer for the pump house so we can monitor the heat there from inside the house. We have a heater on a thermostat in there to keep the pump and water lines from freezing . This way we should pick up that it is not working faster than when we find things broke.I went twice through Kroger's. Once for paper products for a family in need while Hubby was with dentist and then again for us, including an additional turkey for the dinner we are deep frying for this Sat. When we got the head count hit 40, we knew we needed another turkey. I picked up another one for us since they were still 37 cents/lb even though it's smaller than what we use ourselves but that was all they had. I had them check.We decided to use the last gift card for Apple bees we had as there isn't one close to us now and we knew if we didn't eat, we wouldn't when we got home... just to tired. Out of pocket was the tip we left.Wed. Dec 12thI hung the bedding on the kitchen porch clothesline to dry. Left it all day until right before dinner before bringing it in. 10 min fluff took the stiffness out of it so I could put it on the bed without it \"crackling\" when the dogs got on the bed. 😂.I put the turkey carcass in the pot to simmer to make broth. Put it in the frig so the fat would raise (fat went to freezer) , will can part of the broth tomorrow and the other amt is in freezer until Friday morning for injecting the turkeys we deep fry. We don't like using oil or butter as it has made the turkey taste \"grease\" to us when it is cold. We had soup for dinner using part of the broth.I printed off 3 coupons I know I will be buying the items in the next 30 days.I put all the house plants in the mudroom sink and watered them at one time.I updated the old computer to manage the budget and track the garden/ grocery stuff.I made two loaves of bread. I am changing what recipe I make each time until I find at least 2 or hopefully 4 different ones we LOVE.Hubby did the following.Went to Marysville and ordered a snow blower and a bunch of gizmos for it using a loyalty card he got when he retired. He still has some left,the guy at the store said he could use it for oil and filers etc for the motorcycle and snowblower.He went to town and had a trailer guy look at the hitch in the bed of the truck for him to order one. The guy gave him a quote and Hubby told him of another website that he could order exactly the same thing for half the price. Guy's wife checks it out, Guy is ordering it for him and he is paying the shipping for Hubby since he will now be using that site for his own supplier.Hubby dropped off the prescriptions we got the day before and had them to be ready before he came back home along with the 3 that was sitting there ready for us to pick up. Saw no reason to write 2 checks to the same place.He found a place closer to do the 50 mile first check up on the tractor.Thursday Dec 13thHubby called the tractor place and they told him to bring tractor any time and they would work it in. So he loaded it up and took it to them. They should be done with  it before he starts work the 24th.We went to chiro (we took the dogs with us so they would get a ride in). Hubby won't be going for awhile since he will be working days and wouldn't make it while they were open. I scheduled for the first Thurs. in Jan but for the afternoon since I will be driving myself. We had them transfer the credit from my acct to Hubby's so we had no out of pocket AND their books are now balanced with our accts.I cleaned the basement frig out and made a list of what I pitched... things we had not bought but was given and I definitely remember telling the person we didn't want it as it wouldn't be eaten...Hubby took it from them when I wasn't around not knowing I already said no. He put it in the basement frig when he put the meat in the freezer. He forgot to put it on the perishable list I keep on the kitchen frig for items in the basement frig so I don't lose track. For now on he will tell them to ask me. He did call them and told them he didn't appreciate how they did that when I told them no.We did a pit stop at the grocery store for \"salad\" items as we were completely out, I have 10 days worth. I saved 10 % but definitely know I need to put a cold weather frame up this summer to grow salad items during the winter.We had sandwiches for lunch and cheese, summer sausage for Hubby and pepperoni for me along with crackers for dinner.Friday Dec 14thHubby went to pick up the ball and hitch he ordered and stopped by the Amish produce auction to see if they had next year's schedule for auctions.Then he cleaned and set up the turkey deep fryers (and covered them to keep them clean) out in the barn.He loaded the presents we were giving friends and the bags and boxes we were giving the family in need at the SCARES dinner. That's now off the list for tomorrow.I thawed the broth I made to inject the turkeys and got that done first thing.I set up the kitchen after dinner for the morning of making 25 lbs of mashed potatoes and craving the turkeys to go in the electric roaster.It's going to be a busy weekend... so I won't be back on until Monday or Tuesday.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Frugal week", "date": "Friday, December 7, 2018", "text": "We only used LED lights to decorate even though it meant no candles in the windows, no signs of JOY etc hanging around... The green blob on the left is a green LED rope light wrapped around an upside down tomato cage to look something like a tree. Post on porch blocks part of the wreath and the lamp post almost blends into the house. Neighbor said his kids got a kick out of the snowman at the hitching post with a sign that said Santa stop here.The tree was from when we lived in a very very very small house. We couldn't find any place close to us that had live trees. Frugal to use what we had....a little sad as most of my traditional decorations aren't in use but frugal. We have the lights on timers and make sure we turn lights off in the house.The containers of sausage and hamburger was gifts from the Amish neighbors. Very good flavor...but no grease, NONE not even with the sausage. Wasn't dry though.When we asked if they had the sirloin ground instead of the scraps,they thought it might be because their animals are grass fed and ran in a pasture.Along with those items...I baked the pumpkin that had been on the porch and pureed it and put in 1 cup servings in the freezer. This is one of the pumpkins that was growing in the compost pile left from the previous owners. Hubby buried one of the other ones that had went bad between the grape harbor and the electric pole. We will see if it grows anything.I bought the flour, sugar etc that I had on my Dec buy list. Still need cashews and ground pork but will get that when we go to doctor appts on Tuesday.I got a couple pork roasts, one we ate, the other is now in the freezer.We were working on what to plant in the gardens and I listed what we ate then we decided to plant more in the garden so I am back square 1 on planning the gardens. BUT the focus is to grow as much as we can of what we eat and eat in season.SO if we want broccoli in Dec we have to have it in the freezer. IT's also to grow more of my own plants from seeds rather than buy the plants. We started listing what fruit we can glean, we have 2 different apple trees that we hope will do better with us trimming them and using dorminate oil. Neighbor lady has pears that she's already said that we can have some after Amish neighbor gets what he wants (he does handy man work for her as she is a widow).Hubby starts working for ODOT (temporary job) Dec 24th but he is off Christmas. We decided that this coming Monday we would start the routine as if he was working.Fixing breakfast for him and packing a lunch that doesn't have to be heated (I ordered through The Prudent Homemaker web site for a thermos from Amazon.) He has for the majority of his working life worked 3rd ,even when he farmed with his Dad so this is a big change for us as I am used to him being home during the day.Brother was clearing out the cabinets at Dad's house and found coffee that had not been opened so he split it between us. We don't usually drink decaf so I mixed it with our regular coffee grounds 1/3rd  decaf and 2/3 rd regular. It will stretch our coffee by 2 months.While sitting on the love seat with Charlotte I realized we had a draft coming from the window that was behind the window, even with a storm window on it. Got to checking all the windows and found what Hubby called cigarette paper cracks at base of windows. He had enough corner round to deal with the front room windows and I used oil lamp wicks that didn't fit my lamps to fill the rest of the as the window sill  is actually above the bottom of the window. Made a lot of difference. In checking this we realized that the thermostat was put on a wall that has a heat duct right behind it causing the thermostat to read 4 degrees warmer that is should. We now have thermometers in 3 areas of the house to maintain the house at 68 degrees except when we are gone when I lower it.Our mechanic is working on our son 2's car since it broke down (radiator has a hole) and son 2 is now driving mine.Since I need an oil change our mechanic offered to do it when son 2 goes to get his car and then we only have to make 1 trip to pick it up instead of 2.I will be researching seeds for the gardens this coming week to meet what we have decided to try to grow.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Planning the gardens, planning in December", "date": "Friday, November 30, 2018", "text": "First I am looking at what we actually eat... what is going to be low or completely out of (grape jam, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage for freezer slaw (slaw already gone).Then I am looking at using the space to produce the most I can and have things staggered so I don't get all of it at the same time. Variety is a big key for us as I can some of the more exotic things like roasted red bell pepper or pickled asparagus or something we run across and decide to try. Victorian conserves (rhubarb and raisins).I am looking at heirloom and open pollinated to save on buying seeds. Which also means I have to watch were I plant things so they don't cross breed along with increasing my perennial garden.I would like to grow cannelini beans. They only come in a can around here and that's only at one store for over a $1 a can. I need to figure out how much to plant and if it is feasible for me to do or is my time (as it take time to shell dried beans) worth more than ordering the beans from Amazon or some other supplier.I want a spring garden followed by a summer garden followed by a fall garden and then have a small hot house for winter garden... especially lettuces as Hubby would eat salad every other day if not daily.  I am keeping track of how much onions, sweet potatoes and white potatoes we eat a month along with the rest... as the Amish neighbor told me focus on what you need to go to the next season then deal with the extra. You don't want to run out of canning jars, space etc because you put up 100 jars of pickles and jam and not have room or jars for tomatoes, corn and green beans.I won't run out of room because I will shove it under furniture, behind doors, use it at stands (covered with cloth). If we don't need it, I can promise you one of the kids or grandkids will.Son 2 went to the store and priced what I gave Daughter 4... it came out to about $500. Since I keep track of what I spent this past year I knew what it cost us....$150  because of the  canning, freezing, gleaning, accepting garden stuff, and only buying meats on sale.Cheapest turkey he could find in their area was 98 cents/lb. The 2 turkeys I gave her were 37 cents/ lb.So the month of December I will be working out plans for what to plant, where to plant and how much to plant.Blessed BeI will start with Son 2 that gave me some of his recipes he got from Home Chef, he thought I could make some of the seasoning blends etc instead of buying it because he has found that the \"spice of life\" is actually the \"spice in food\" for him. So I made a list of what I didn't have and then went online to find out if I could make it myself... 98% I could make myself. The other 2 % I needed anyways as I didn't get enough herbs from the gardens this year.The root veggies: 20 lbs of potatoes, 20 lbs of sweet potatoes, 3 acorn squash, 3 butternut squash, 3 spag. squash and 3 kabocha squash are in the north loft as it has the correct temp and humidity for that type of storage. I am not storing onions this year. I haven't found a place in the house yet that would be good and not be with the potatoes.I am looking at making a place in the barn for them if I have enough insulation next year. I didn't take a picture of this. I have them in milk crates with other crates under them so they have air flow and over a rubber backed rug so it something gets nasty and I miss that it's spoiling it doesn't mess up my new flooring. I check at least once a week but usually daily when I go up to get something.I have on the grocery list 50 lbs of all purpose flour (yes I am down that much) 50 lbs of sugar again down this much. ( I gave 5 lbs of sugar and flour to Daughter 4), dried Italian salad dressing (used more for rolling cream cheese in), ground pork (found recipe for Spanish chorizo on Pioneer woman), cashews (From Aldi's)milk, half and half, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, onions, celery, carrots, bell peppers and mushrooms, a small jar of basil pesto. I already ordered my seasonings, spices and dried peppers that I can't buy in this area. Cheaper for me to order it than buy fuel to drive 2 hrs to buy it.Daughter 4 was here the other day and wanted a tour of the pantry. Since she was one of kids (Son 2 was the other one and an out of state friend) that put food on our table for 2 yrs when Hubby's plant went to a 3 day work week, I have no problem with her checking ...she also got a few things that I canned that she just won't buy at the store like roasted red bell peppers. This is what she saw when I opened the basement door.Hubby put the buckets of flour, sugar, and rices that I use most often on the landing at the bottom of the stairs.more of the flours, sugars, regular oats, quick oats, grits, under the stairs.the oils, 3 empty buckets for sugar and flour,dry goods cabinet, over flow cake mixes in washer..hey at least the bugs don't get to it ;)aisle 1 as it was named. Couple shelves on the low side but that's the broths that I make during the winter from turkeys, hams and beef roasts.Center or end aisleaisle 2..dried beans are on low side but I won't refill them until next summer. Low on grape jam as I made juice since we didn't get many grapes.Will have netting to deal with birds getting to the grapes before us next year.Buckets have different rices, pasta and specialty flours.the 3 deep freezers, sorting the meat and veggies into cloth grocery bags has been a great. First, it's easy to pull up a bag or two to get to what I am hunting for. Second, like foods are kept together. Hubby has even mentioned he like it when he was wanting bacon and I said, first freezer, left back corner, gray bag.Refrigerator freezers hold open bags or leftovers...chocolate LOL Bread items.Dried fruit teas, drink mixes pantry staples I use daily and the over flow of spices and herbs.Maple syrup,molasses, sorghum, honey,agave, boiled cider etc.100 plus herbs and spices. I grew most of my herbs, didn't this last year which is why basil pesto is on the grocery list. Herbs are in on my garden plans which I am still working on.We have started eating our supper by oil lamp, something I grew up with  until Daddy wired the house for electric. We have found we slow down with our eating, fill up faster OR just acknowledge we are full and I am cooking less as a result.Better for our health and will make the pantry last a bit longer.I found some winter curtains in the barn that daughter 4 had passed back (we don't get rid of curtains, someone will always need them). They are way too long and I had to put one panel at a window to have enough but they are helping keep the home warm. I did get scissors. I like the new ones better than the old ones, don't strain my wrist as much when I am cutting. Hubby did tell me he wanted me to use shower curtain hooks for all the windows. He LOVES how they slide when he opens the curtains as he is usually up before me.I did not go shopping on Black Friday. I hate crowds. I did check prices on some things we needed on Cyber Monday but they were not low enough. Today the prices were where I was willing to pay so that's been ordered. Spices and dried peppers is not something that is stocked as well as over where we used to live and something I use daily.We had a doctor appt (Thursday) so took the dogs along and stopped at the vet's office as both Charlotte and Wilbur were due for their annual shots and 3 yr rabies shot, Rascal is March for heart worm testing. All 3 got their nails trimmed. Because we were okay with the vet assistant doing the shots and nails they gave us a discount. They are not sure if they are going to continue the discount or the practice . We have talked about Hubby giving the annual shots, getting the rabies shot at the local TSC during their clinics.I bought nail clippers like our vet has .We have been eating from the pantry except for Wed night. Hubby went to the funeral home (his aunt died) while I stayed home (coughing again don't want to pass it) and he went to the grocery store and got a couple items that he could heat in the microwave. All of it was marked down and was around $10, it feed us 3 meals so I guess that wasn't bad.I found out Tuesday that the meds I was on for 3 wks for my Crohn's has caused me OTHER problems that I am now dealing with. My GI wanted to have me take another med... no thanks. My primary backed me.We started to put Christmas decorations up...very slowly as we don't have very many lights since we agreed and really want to focus on only having LED lights.The windows here are about half the size or smaller than the windows we had so a lot of the window decorations do not work. I still haven't figured out where to set my candles or stockings since we gave the mantle to daughter 1(it was the one her late father grew up with).Hubby called the appliance repairman. The front big burner on the stove will only light with a lighter and has more yellow in the flame than it should. It hasn't worked right since right after we moved in. Repairman said he would run the bill through the warranty before billing us. He is local and was happy to find out we moved back into this area as we all went to school together.Hubby called about getting a bill from blood work that we had paid two months ago. He gave them the confirmation number and they immediately corrected the billing.I called and ordered propane (we prepay for the whole year) but since I agreed for it to be delivered when he was already going to be in the area I don't have to pay an extra delivery charge.I called our ins guy and told him I was looking for new auto ins as their cost for the new truck was horrible... he went back through  it and found they had the price as the month price when it was the price of 3 months NOT ONE. Made a lot of difference. He also caught that even though he changed the address (four times now to be exact) billing still had the auto policy listed at the other place. When that was corrected we are back down to where we was before I got rid of my car plus they gave us a credit since it was THEIR mistake.We decided to give a couple years of trying to sell produce from the garden at the produce auction..but only what I don't need to have in our pantry. Most use boxes, but the one Amish lady told me to just use either plastic grocery bags or bread bags the first year to see if I really want to go that way. It is a lot of work to grow it, harvest it the night before or the morning of the auction along with cleaning it and making sure it is dry.Hubby applied for a part time /seasonal job at Ohio Dept of Transportation AKA ODOT. He was hired, filling out paper work today (Friday) and will start towards the end of Dec Unless they call him in sooner. I did not want him going back to the plant and working 40 hrs a month. Common for the workers to go back and do that as it's enough money to pay their health ins.It's Mon through Fri. unless there is a snow event and first shift. He hasn't worked first shift in over 20 yrs except when he was in Alabama building the plant down there and the kids and I stayed here in OH.He did get the stuff from his brother in law to set up his portable welding. Just needs to set that up.He also went to a couple people that were looking for someone to haul pallets. His trailer isn't the size they want and he isn't going to go buy a trailer for a couple trips... not enough work/money to justify it. BUT another one told him that if he ran across a 20-24 ft live stock trailer that he could afford, he would have work as the Amish are always looking for someone to haul animals to the butcher. THEN another Amish guy put him in touch with a guy that was going to get a new live stock trailer that was still deciding if he would trade the old one in or sell it. He agreed when he got to the place (went to work at local fab shop to earn enough to buy a new one) where he was getting the new one, he would call and see if Hubby could match the price offered for trade in...but that won't be until spring. HE also told Hubby if he heard of anyone looking for someone to haul on a 16 ft flat bed, he would send them Hubby's way.We have an appt on Monday to talk to our finance guy, he asked for the budget for 2019 so he can help figure out how to make the retirement to last as long as possible and us figure if we should take Social Security at 62 or wait. Stock market went down right after we retired (figures) and the medical bills were higher than we budgeted but the house only was over budget by $50. We are saving for gravel to put the deck on this spring as we don't want just weed barrier. Gravel for the driveway and pond. Need to replace posts on the kitchen porch and both front and kitchen porches need railing and painted (railing will help bring down house ins). We need new windows and the house needs siding but we can handle waiting for those for a couple years. We have the deck stuff and ramp in the barn but will need to save up for the awning that will go over the French doors. We want to redo the steps and awning at the back door. We think we have enough left over wood to do the steps.The worse case is we pull the cash from the retirement, pay everything off  and put back enough to pay health ins until we are 65 and live on the balance and not pull the SS ... would take a hit on taxes (like we are this year) but stress would be lower as we would only be paying utilities and what ever we need for medical copay,deductibles...it's a thought.Blessed Be"},

{"title": "When it rains it pours... still some more BUT", "date": "Friday, November 16, 2018", "text": "Good news is we have a good solid truck...bad news is we got a truck payment.Good news is the payment is under what we had worked out because the finance guy took it for LONGER time (and then worked out what we needed to pay extra to hack off that last year he added to get the interest rate that was 3 % lower than what we had found and it still was under the $900 payment even with the extra payment saving us even more on the interest. Our insurance agent looked at a couple different underwriters to get us the best deal on insurance and still was an ouch due to the size of the truck.Bad news is my favorite car is now at the junk yardGood news is they came and got it for free, plus paid me for it and it's off the insurance. I will miss it as it was FAITHFUL to a fault of even driving when the axle broke...yeah really went 5 miles while Daughter 4 drove it slowly home in a rain storm. She knew the tire was coming off but it stayed on until she put it in park.Next day we realized the axle had broke.Good news is we took food to Daughter 4, whose own daughter had invited a friend to spend the night (kids take turns on that) and at the last moment found out the friend can't eat gluten. If we hadn't take food to her she wouldn't have had something for the young lady to eat. Bad news is Daughter 4 dislocated her shoulder at work and is off work. Medical payment is 60% of her normal paycheck. Good news is , that's what she bases her budget on and with us giving her food she is going to be fine going through the next two months especially since she was back to work today with restrictions.Bad news we are not having Thanksgiving dinner for the family any more, not just this year. After not having it this year we had several comments of kids and grandkids wanting it to stop but did not want to offend anyone with their reasons why. One grandson was very open about being torn between families and having pressure put on him by his parent to attend ours instead of the other side and he has a girlfriend that is likely to get a promise ring at Christmas so there will be her side also.Good news is no one is under pressure  to attend, no one is AKA us and Son 2 is spending money, time and effort to be at a dinner that there is a lot of complaining going on. Do not need the DRAMA which is on the good news side.Bad news I won't be getting deep fried turkey for dinner or sweet potatoes with marshmallows(son 2) or baked beans (by girlfriend who makes extra so I can freeze them), good news is I am roasting those 3 turkeys and putting them in OUR freezer and making broth.Deep Fried turkey doesn't make good broth.Good news is since we didn't have Tday dinner we just sent all the kids money ( a lot more than normal)for them to buy Christmas as we had trouble connecting to them all at the same time last couple years and can't afford 6 different trips (bad news). SO we all told them it was time for them to come our way and it did not have to be on holidays. The kids are fine if we don't do cookies and candy BUT if we do and want to limit it..Buckeyes, sugar cookies for Granddaughter who eats NO chocolate , snickerdoodles for most of the rest and oatmeal cookie and peanut butter for Son 2 and no candy for him. We will see how that goes.We thought about a Christmas open house and decided to pass on that as we are still changing things around.Bad news is my sewing scissors , all 4 pairs is missing, Daughter 4 said something to Daughter 2 and she said she had borrowed them while she lived with us for work to cut cardboard and forgot to bring them back....then Daughter 4 who does sew reminded Daughter 4 who does not sew  that sewing scissors are for fabric only not paper, cardboard etc. Daughter 2 did say she did not know where they went after she left them at work. SO I now have to replace my scissors and since they were missing I couldn't sew the winter curtains...BUT I did use pinking shears and cut this no pill fleece for the wheelchair bathroom that at this point I call Hubby's bathroom .I used a hole punch to put the holes in for the shower curtain hooks. Hubby decided he liked it better than me sewing a rod pocket. Said it's easier to open and close. SO that is good news... I just don't have the rest of the house done which is bad news but good news is the house really isn't getting cold because of the lack of winter curtains.Bad news is the lights in the north loft don't work, good news we put the winter squash, potatoes and sweet potatoes in that loft since it's on the cold side and we would have to use electric heater to have it warm enough for any one. Hubby already called the electrician that installed it and they are on stand by until Hubby checks a couple things with his tester as they think it's the actual light not the wiring since the outlets and other light works.Bad news is we need to get our propane tank filled... Good news is I prepaid it when they delivered the tank.Doubled what we used at the other place.GOOD news, even though Hubby doesn't care if we decorate for Christmas, I would like to some...the weather is suppose to be decent Wednesday,Thursday and Friday so I can get what I want done and Hubby won't have to deal with icy cold crap doing the outside lights.Bad news ,between the house, car, truck and medical our one retirement acct will not last to Hubby can collect SS...GOOD NEWS is , we have not touched the other retirement acct and could actually pay everything off and still have money to live on allowing him to not pull SS when he planned to. Our finance guy is bouncing some figures around and looking at the big picture to show us our options in Dec.It all balances out in the long run is what Mother used to say. GOD will provide the work to earn what we need.Not sure where I got this from, I used to have it hanging from my frig in the fall. This year nothing got hung but I have been stocking the pantry.I made pear butter out of the pear's the neighbor's 4 yr old helped Hubby pick up off the ground while 4 yrs old dad put roof on the neighbor's garage. She had told the child he could have all the pears on the ground or that his dad or Hubby could help him reach on the tree. We got 2-5 gal buckets. Hubby helped him take 4-5 gal buckets home while his dad finished the roof. Good thing as the freeze came in a couple days later.I am pretty much stocked with meat for a year. I would like to have a couple pork butt roasts or loins maybe one of each instead of two of each but if I don't get them on sale for the right price I will pass. We now have 18 months of main dishes in the pantry... 2 main dished per day. Though I image with a little bit of this and that I could turn it into a 3rd dish if needed to stretch the main meal part of the pantry for 2 yrs.Which would be great as the next 2 years are going to be very thin on the income with the outflow of the house and truck etc.Last Wednesday Hubby picked up 2 turkeys for 48 cents/ lb if you spent $25 for Daughter 4. He got her  beef roast (buy one get one) and potatoes. I picked up 2 turkeys for us (same price) and beef roast (same deal) for us and onions for Daughter 4. Thursday, I run to store for dairy items, and grab 2 more turkeys and found hamburger marked down, hot dogs and smoked sausage also marked down.Got home and found out that Hubby had went to the store when he went to town to run an errand for the neighbor and got 2 more turkeys and 2 more roasts(buy one get one) and coffee as he had checked his coffee before he went to town.He had 2 coupons for the coffee and it was on sale.Spent the weekend dealing with the food etc.Sunday we meet son 2 and our friends over at Hong Kong to celebrate Vet's day Son and friend are vets) and since friend wants us to deep fry turkey for Ham radio Christmas dinner we went to Kroger's there so he could pay for them and we just bring them home. They had turkeys for 38 cents/lb limit 2 so we picked up 2 more (total is 8 just FYI)for us AND they had brisket for $1.99/ lb while it's running $5.99 at our Kroger's. I picked up 2 briskets.The next day we had eye appointment back over to the other Kroger's (my steroids has cause my astigmatism to change) so we stopped at Kroger's.  I got 4 more briskets, brats that was marked down, hamburger that was marked down, 2 large containers of oats and a bag of potatoes.I cut the 6 briskets in four pieces  to make 24 roasts (that's one every other week) or one once a month for 2 yrs.Vacuumed they will hold good.Turkey 1 was roasted, deboned, ate and the remaining part vacuum packed (6 meals)and in freezer and carcass is been turned into broth which is now in frig to let the fat come to top and be able to remove fat and can tomorrow.Turkey 2  was roasted today, is now deboned , I ate it tonight for dinner (Hubby working parade)and carcass is in pot simmering as I type this for broth to be defatted and then canned.Turkey 3 is thawing. Actually I had no choice as I now need that space for the briskets LOL. But that's okay. We figured we would cook 3 turkeys this month to get the broth back up as I was low and I vacuum the meat in 3 cups packages as that's what I use in most of my casseroles, noodles etc.We decided on our basic once a month perishable list. I will go to Save A Lot here (don't have an Aldi's) to get what I can BEFORE going to Kroger's. Walmart here does not have the choices or smaller sizes that I use. It's $125 IF I go to Kroger's a month .... but with the understanding I might have to buy something that isn't on the list but needed for a meal if it's something we agree on. I set that amount as $25. When we don't use that money or there is some left, it goes back into the stock the pantry envelope. Any of the $125 not used also goes into stock the pantry envelope.There are a couple stores in the next town where our parents live that I would like to do a price check when we are over there. They have an Aldi's.I pulled some different breads out of the freezer trying to use that up before I baked another loaf when the neighbors down the road brought a loaf of bread they bought from the Amish bakery around the corner so we are eating that as well.We talked about things we were no longer eating...cold cereal for Hubby as he used to eat it in the mornings when he got home from work before going to bed.Apples, he used to eat one either at work or before work with peanut butter...not happening. I used to eat cottage cheese, pickled beets and applesauce for lunch  and a yogurt for 2 pm snack with fig newtons or cookie, not doing that either.I already need 25 lbs all purpose flour, 25 lbs sugar, and peanut butter and choc chips... not out but lower than I usually am at this time even without baking cookies or making candy for the kids for Christmas. IF they come on sale cheap enough I will pick them up."},
{"title": "What can I cut ", "date": "Monday, November 5, 2018", "text": "End of October I was thinking, pantry is almost fully stocked, just need turkeys, some fresh cranberries ...then my mother in law reminded me of mincemeat. Saving account looked decent, bills were paid.Nov. 1st, daughter 4 bought a car and now has payments (she's trying to rebuild her credit after her divorce) and she had budgeted for an oil change this paycheck and 2 tires the following paycheck and another 2 tires the following week and right after she left the dealership her doctor called her to tell her she did not have a sinus infection but is going into stage 2 mold poisoning. She called the health dept and they told her to find another place to live because as soon as they contact her landlord (AKA slum lord) he will evict her. WHICH she already knew because she knew a couple of people that went through this with him. She is now saving to move along with needing the tires, did her budget and called us to see if we could provide basic groceries for 3 months (without causing ourselves problems) so she could only spend $20 a week for dog food, toilet paper, milk and margarine.Hubby told her we could do that as this is the kid that LOVES beans and rice.Nov 2rd our old landlord got a hold of us and told us when they pulled the carpets up they found mold UNDER the padding (figured it was from where the basement constantly had water) and thought they should let us know to go get checked for it.. so since we was in the doctor's office when they called our doctor ran blood work...yep, it showed we had had mold poisoning but we were healing (probably due to bronchitis meds) so we have to take meds a week longer to just be on the careful side Nov 3rd Hubby's truck starts making a grinding noise  so on the 4th he hands me a sheet of paper that had all the information of the truck he would like to buy... he has been pricing trucks for the last year... I am glad I was sitting down. He priced it out, down payment, sales tax and title, cash payment or loan with down payment and without down payment and 5 different years. Best deal is a 2015, he PLANS for it to last 15 to 20 yrs like what we have so that puts him 75 -80 yrs old and most likely won't be driving a big truck...I really didn't want a payment of $900 along with the price of the insurance which he priced also but is the worse case. There has been a couple jobs he couldn't take because it would have been too much for his truck which is a 1998.SO back to the budget, yes we can do it but it makes it tight because we don't want to increase what we withdraw from the IRA especially when the market is DOWN since he retired. We will be going this Thursday to look... sigh.As I went through the pantry today, making sure we had everything, refilling the containers in the dining room from the pantry etc. Hubby came in and told me to buy more turkeys than what I had planned and handed me 2-5 gal buckets of pears he had picked up out of the neighbor's yard while helping the other neighbor with his 4 yr old put a roof on the her garage. She has all she wanted so Hubby and Neighbor's 4 yr old picked the rest up from the yard to \"clean\" the yard up for her. Hubby said the 4 yr old ended up with 4 -5 gal buckets in the wagon and he helped him pull them home while his dad finished the garage roof.Hubby really does NOT like pears, they taste sandy to him...but his grandma used to mix apples with pears for sauce and in pies so I will be doing that because I definitely did not need any more pears canned.We will be going to Kroger's to get turkeys on Wed as they have them on sale for 48 cents/pound.Paper ad says you have to spend $25 and limit 2, website had limit 1 with nothing to spend... either way we will be going on Wed.We have ate from the pantry, finished canning the last of the tomatoes, hubby gave away 40 lbs while I was in the hospital , still I ended up with 6 meals of fried green tomatoes in the freezer and 30 qrts of juice beside what we ate daily.I sewed buttons on 2 of my shirts, Hubby darned his socks three times. Amish neighbor baked a loaf of bread again for us as we stopped at the store (not out of our way) for her and saved her 4 hrs of being away from home as she is also canning the last of her tomatoes and tomorrow will be doing pears like me.Charlotte has been finding a way to get out of the yard when we leave, I caught Wilbur and Rascal jumping on the fence when barking at the neighbor and Charlotte started to go over it since the 3 of them can tug it down.far enough she can jump it. Hubby took old fencing wood and put it on the top of the fence so they can't pull the fence down and she can't jump over it. He also put lattice we used to use several years ago over the top of the gates because he saw she could get half way through it today. Both neighbors are watching to see if they can see her get out when we leave to go vote tomorrow and again on Thursday for our doctor appt and going to look at the truck.We had some birds getting in the loft of the barn making a mess and since that is where we store stuff we weren't happy about it. Hubby thinks he found all the holes , said they could get in but not out that way so he plugged them up today using wood I had savaged from here when the contractors where working.We are still slowly going through the boxes in the barn and getting things put away.I did get my gate leg table (Grandpa built it out of ply board)in the house and upstairs as I use it to cut fabric on . I also got the table I use for sewing in the house and up stairs so MAYBE I will get to start sewing the winter curtains next week.I am spending this week gathering my recipes of things I will now make from scratch instead of buying.Blessed Be"},

Grew my hair back out to my waist as I got tired of fighting it to stay up inside my hat.It sometimes surprises people when they mention I must love to cook everyday being a chef... as a self employed chef that answer depends... for work , love a good solid 5 days a week which usually ended up at least 10 plus hrs a day..at home, I am always looking for plan overs vs left overs and how to slap a good balanced meal on the table in 30 minutes or even better in the oven where I can do something else, like read a book and drink tea.I never have been much at crock pots  At work I love working with different ingredients (great in Atlanta GA) at home here in Ohio, not going to get that variety unless I travel 3 hrs one way to Jungle Jim's. though there are a few things I could order from Amazon if I really wanted to...I loath to order produce or fresh herbs online.Right now, I am sitting here fighting bronchitis, as Hubby shared his (GRR) and for the first time in 25 yrs we are both sick at the same time and both are not really wanting to cook, let alone clean up.Keeping with that theme HA HA...I fall back on old stand by's of when I was a widow with kids...

{"title": "Still sick... 209 update", "date": "Monday, October 29, 2018", "text": "The only place we have went is the doctor's office. We have ate from the pantry that is full which is a really really good thing since neither of us wanted let alone needed to be out and about in the store.We have finally got to the point of actually eating something like beef stew,spaghetti with meat veggie sauce and chili instead of just drinking broth and pureed veggie soup. I fixed baked pumpkin oatmeal (Pioneer woman) that was good also.I have gotten the kitchen together completely (if you don't count curtains not being sewn and hung).  I brought my wind chimes in from the porches and hung most of them at the kitchen sink window.I won't put a curtain up at this window as I watch the sunrise a lot through it .It also lets me see who is pulling in the drive before they get to the house.It's nice to have everything in it's place and able to actually find what I need.I think the next place is the bedroom and my desk area as I am starting National Novel Writing month Nov 1st.Neighbor came over to borrow some yeast as it was Saturday morning as she didn't think she had enough bread to make it to Monday afternoon (Amish keep Sunday as the day of rest, her Hubby was away at an auction so no one to take the buggy to store for her) I asked for a loaf back in return of the yeast since we were down to 2 slices... BOY was it better than mine. Since she doesn't use a recipe she said she would have to think about it but she thinks the big difference is she uses sorghum and I use sugar. The bread was a lot moister and it is definitely GONE. So tomorrow (Tuesday) I will be baking bread."},
{"title": "Frugal mid month", "date": "Sunday, October 21, 2018", "text": "Tuesday, I put the last of the green tomatoes in the freezer. Cleaned the pantry and moved some things around so it makes better sense... also will allow me to focus on what needs used up first and what we are low on. I had 10 jars of green beans. Forgot we lost 16 jars to bad lids, daughter 4 still has some of her's here and offered for us to keep them and use them as she has enough to go a few months. Her pantry is only 6 months. I caught the laundry up as I usually do that on Mondays and we went to visit parents instead. All loads were on the clothes line to dry even though they forecasted a freeze this morning we got nothings. I took leftover beef roast and broth and mixed it with leftover chicken and noodles my cousin made that I had shoved in the freezer and had plenty for dinner and enough for my lunch tomorrow.WednesdayHubby is working today for a neighbor. He packed his lunch and we both mentioned at the same time it was weird for him to pack a cold lunch instead of leftovers that could be reheated. He was working outside with no place to to warm anything. He did take a thermos of hot coffee as he does drink it black. Said it wasn't bad even with the winds though the temp never got above 55. I ate the leftover noodles for my lunch and spent the day washing the fall bedding and blankets . All loads were dried on the line except the last , it's a heavy blanket but is still damp. I'm okay with the dryer running for one load as I turned off the furnace when I started the laundry since I have realized every time I open the kitchen door the furnace was kicking on. House never dropped below 64 but it will warm up quick enough between the dryer, furnace back and the oven when I bake biscuits after Hubby comes in from mowing the pasture and around the pond that he plans to finish tomorrow. I pulled pork chops (cut from the pork loin I bought at the beginning of the month) to go with pears (on sale with coupon). I will also make a salad with a pear and walnuts (from freezer that was a gift from a friend) and sweet potato (gift from neighbor for going after kerosene for them) to go with the biscuits. I have homemade strawberry pie filling (neighbor again) to go with vanilla ice cream if we decided we want a sweet.AND THEN IT WAS A SLIDE DOWN HILLwe got the frost THURSDAY  morning so Hubby didn't want to cut anymore around pond , wasn't sure what was weeds and what was flowers since the frost killed the blooms.I went to make waffles with the new waffle maker and it just kept ripping it apart(on line reviews say use thick batter with 2 eggs so I'll try that the next time.) I didn't want to waste the batter so I made funnel cakesFriday we decided to hit the produce auction as I was still looking for onions,potatoes and sweet potatoes...Wasn't advertised as butternut squash auction but that was pretty much all there was. I got some onions, a pie, candy for Hubby, maple syrup and a angel food cake in the area off the auction. SO since we didn't stay for the actual auction we went to Wapakonta to Walters Meats and SCORED. They had my sausages I had on my list, plus we got, hamburger patties, pizza burger patties, cube steak (for less than $3/lb) minute steak, round steak (that isn't paper thin), 10 lbs of hamburger, potato hash brown patties ,shoe string French fries and candy for Hubby. Adding 49 meals to the freezers. Cost is about $2 each meal.We get the turkeys and hams in Nov and will have a total of 369 meals plus in the pantry. Then it's just milk etc to be bought during the year.Feeling GREAT with that and then....Hubby GOT SICK. He very seldom gets sick but when he does it's BAD... dealt with that and then Saturday morning at 7 am I woke up in a Crohn's attack...At least I can see the hospital pond out my window and Hubby is home (not visiting me ) with his crud. We now have some more answers of why I keep getting blockage. I have scar tissue from my appendix exploding and it stops my intestines from working correctly.We will see when I get to go home... but at least Hubby is home with the babiesRascal is pretty much laying at Hubby's feet most of the time and Wilbur and Charlotte are sharing the love seat behind Hubby. Usually Charlotte is laying on WilburBlessed Be"},
{"title": "a BUSY week", "date": "Monday, October 15, 2018", "text": "It's only Monday, I keep repeating that to myself,it's only Monday.I did laundry today using the clothes line Hubby put up out in the yard and like he feared the deadman in concrete came up and started letting the support  post lean in causing the lines to sag in the middle. I stepped on the concrete and it sank back in some. Hubby was going to go look for something to weigh it down and I told him to get the Ford...the car that is suppose to have went to the junk yard weeks ago... Well, today it was parked with the front tire on the concrete holding the clothes line up so my bedding didn't drag on the ground.Regretfully even after drying everything on the line I had to run the last 3 loads through  the dryer to kill the gnats that decided my bedding looked comfy. At least it wasn't a long time , just a hot dryer.We don't have a power washer for the parts that are vinyl siding on the house so I hand washed the part that is on the front porch with blue Dawn and rinsed with vinegar. Looks better than what it did. Hubby didn't realize how dirty it was until I was about half way through.Took me a couple hours but well worth the time.I froze enough green tomatoes for  6 meals of fried green tomatoes, I might get more before the rest of them turn red.I cooked about 10 lbs of red tomatoes to make juice with tomorrow ( I have juice ready to can tomorrow in the frig)as I needed to make bread after dinner since Hubby ate the last of the bread this morning and wants an egg sandwich with his oatmeal in the morning. I made 2 loaves of oatmeal bread (Owlhaven.net) and made extra oatmeal for breakfast.I weeded the flower garden,definitely will have to move the hosta next spring as they have outgrown the area and you can't even see the sidewalk.I fixed leftovers for lunch and then we had a cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato on the side. We had potato chips as our even snack.Hubby mowed all the property but decided to not trim as we know we will be mowing at least one more time and want to do the trimming then.He also went to a local place we were told carried weed barrier that we are looking for,they were out but offered to order it for us and then told Hubby where they order from. The place is 15 min from a place we have been wanting to go (Lehman's in Eastern OH that provides items for Amish and like).So we decided we would go there this Thursday as part of Hubby's birthday as he turns 60 tomorrow.I did 2 orders to Joann fabrics using coupons both times. We decided to make curtains for the French doors for night time or during the hotter months.  I need to stop at thrift shops to see if I can find something to back the flannel for the curtains in the front room as Hubby said the front room got pretty chilly when the temperature dropped last week.Tuesday,It's Hubby's 60th birthday and we have in recent year's went to Lock 16 in Lima OH for him to have steak. I always make sure to tell them it's his birthday and they bring him a cake.The server remembered us from last year as we paid for an elderly couple that was having their anniversary and we left the server a big tip as she went out of her way to make sure the couple had a wonderful meal which was apparent they were sharing a meal and picked the lowest costing meal. We did some errands first and got some needed items on sale.Then did a pit stop at the produce farm to pick up the winter squash for the pantry. I worked more tomatoes when we got home,should have enough juice to have a full canner in the morning.WednesdaySlept with the windows open as it didn't drop below 68 last night. Won't be do that again for a long while as the high for the next 9 days isn't even that high.Hubby finished painting the house and I canned 12 qrts of tomato juice and cooked 2 more pans of tomatoes. It's drizzling now but the wind is high so I won't be going out to the barn to can tonight.Storms are suppose to be running through in a few hours, they said that this afternoon and it came in 3 hrs early.I went through 15 boxes and put them away.I find some old curtains of Son2 that he gave to me to keep for anyone that needed them. I had lined them with blankets several years back and decided to take the backing off and use it to line the curtains I am making for the front room. I remember I didn't spend over $3 for the blankets at the thrift shop so this is just the icing on the cake to reuse it.I washed laundry and hung our clothes on the kitchen clothesline and the winter bedding and curtains on the yard clothesline.We had leftovers from Lock 16 for lunch and dinner.Thursday,We went to Holmes county for the day. We needed weed barrier for the gardens and the local green house told us where they order it from and offered to order it but since we have been wanting to go to Lehman's in Holmes co. and the place was only 7 miles away it made sense to just pick it up ourselves. We drove the car instead of the truck and hoped it would be a negative of bringing everything home. Turned out to be a good choice as the gentleman gave us a price comparison of getting 4 of the 300 ft lengths instead of 5 of the 100 ft length actually saved us the price of the 4 th roll. PLUS we got more weed barrier.He also got us a deal on barrier staples that got us twice as much for the same price and the popcorn plate that fits my seed planter was half the price we found it at Johnny's seeds.We then went to Lehman's and got wicks, lamp oil and 6 lamp chimneys so when I do the fall cleaning I can put out the oil lamps also. Those items were on sale. I picked up some hand soaps for the mudroom and kitchen sinks. I forgot I now have 4 sinks. I will just refill the bottles with the hand soap I have in the pantry.We got a cast iron waffle iron you put directly on your stove. It was marked down to $17 from the $45. Waffles will be on the menu.We went to a grocery store that had an restaurant attached to it and had a late lunch. We chose to just have sandwiches instead of the special because it was cheaper and after seeing the specials served we could have bought 1 and split it and still had leftovers. Even with what we bought it was less and healthier than the local Mc D's .We talked about where to cut the budget on the ride over and back. Batted thoughts of how to bring in money or save money. I will be back to growing my own plants or getting them at the produce auction of course. Hubby is going to get a hold of his brother in law about buying some stuff from him for welding. FridayLast night Amish neighbor asked if we would stop by his house this morning and get his kerosene container and pick some up for him as they were almost out and it's what they use for their lamps. We were running errands today so it wasn't out of the way.We paid some bills, Hubby got tags for the trailer and motorcycle that are in his name. Hubby filled the truck up using the Kroger points.He got a flu shot,made a deposit at the bank, dropped off a tax paper that will give us 2.5% deduction on our taxes next year.I went in to the  newspaper and found that they had gave my delivery person the wrong address so that is straightened out. Stopped at the library and then we went to the store.Kroger's.... wasn't busy for a Friday morning and it was stocked well. I am still adjusting to the how much smaller it is and the layout seems to be random , might be so you walk through the entire store to pick up a can of veggies and a can of fruit. Couple things I had coupons for they don't carry so if I am closer to a different Kroger's before they expire I will check else where. I saved over $200 and the manager had to over ride the system to get me checked out. Hubby did ask why I got more pasta with what we have.... it was on sale and the coupon I had made it 40 cents for a pound of pasta... So we will get 6 meals for $1.20....SMILETotal meals added to pantry is 74. I was going to drop a ham and a turkey off the buy list but Hubby wants me to keep it on. We have the room in the freezers and he is just feeling it would be better if we didn't change plans at this point.He took the kerosene to the neighbor and I sent a list with him that I keep extra flour, oil, yeast etc so if they ran out or low to come borrow instead of trying to get to the store especially as early as it's getting dark and being in a buggy. Hubby said she was excited as they haven't had time to go to town (it's an hour buggy ride one way) and she was out of oil and had been for awhile. So Hubby took her a gallon of oil and made her day. She asked what we wanted for it and he told her he would have to think about it... DUH... I said when he told me...BAKED GOODS.. He laughed because it hadn't crossed his mind even though he just bought a pie at the local store made by her cousin LOL.I still need to find some containers to put stuff in that is now in the basement since we don't have a butler's pantry. I'm waiting as I definitely don't have everything put away let alone a place to put everything.Saturday I did all the dishes up including some that had been packed, canned tomato juice, washed the outside of the front room windows and the storm windows before Hubby put them on. Did 2 loads of laundry using the yard clothes line.Hubby put together 2 more shelving units for the pantry in the basement.I searched the barn for milk crates to wash on Monday for the root veggies for the basement. I closed the ceiling vent that allows warm air to rise from the front room to the guest room. I fixed pizza from the pantry.SundayI slept 12 hrs straight, definitely don't feel good so hope it's a passing thing as several of friends and family have commented that they have the stomach bug. I already got my flu shot so maybe I won't get what ever is going around. Hubby also just got his flu shot.Hubby put up the \"closet rod\" I asked for in the staircase at the front room and I put a heavy curtain on it to help stop so much of the warm air going up the staircase.  I really need to finish the fall cleaning up there and get the sewing room put together so I can sew the winter curtains.I went down to change things around in the pantry since Hubby added a couple more units. He put 2 of the shelf braces on upside down and the shelves collapsed when I had them LOADED... lost 3 pints of pickled beets and have a messed up thumb and pulled bicep as I tried to stop the shelves. Got that mess cleaned up and Hubby kept telling me he was sorry... decided to just call it a day ...both of us and start again tomorrow. Good thing as I am having troubles hold things in my hand due to the swelling and bruise of the thumb and definitely don't want to lift anything heavy with the arm.I pulled ground beef to make tacos for dinner. We had odds and ends from the frig for lunch.I put the budget on an excel sheet and paid the bills that are not automatic. We have decided we want to put down at least 20 % on the new truck for Hubby.I transferred what we set that amount to be to Ally bank. We don't touch the savings there unless it's an emergency plus it makes more in interest than our local bank."},
{"title": "Filling the pantry for a year FRUGAL", "date": "Saturday, October 6, 2018", "text": "Living around farmers you get to hear how the price of corn is down, how it's too wet for the beans to be harvests and the price of meat is going to go up.We already have a good pantry but when the man who used to own this house offered us free tomatoes because they had fell off the vines (he called them seconds) and he doesn't sell them at the auction , we went to glean them...110 lbs of tomatoes with a possibility of more when he cleans his hot house if his helper doesn't take all of what is left.Hubby on his tractor with the new tiller preparing the south garden (the one that will have seasonal plants) He already did the north garden which is perennials and the garlic.After we was done gleaning the tomatoes Hubby mentioned the freezers are pretty low on meat. I told him Kroger's had a sale of roasting chickens (7-8 lbs) for 69 cents a pound. Don't see it lower than that anywhere around here. So we decided to go to Kroger's before home.We had decided the other week over our morning coffee to have 730 meals in the pantry. That is lunch and dinner for a year.We save 1/3rd of what we bought... they had other meat on sale but it wasn't listed in the weekly ad. I now have an additional 75 meals of meat (not meat, I list things by how many meals it will make us to make sure we have enough food to go a solid year)We got 10 dozen eggs (for less than $1/dozen) which is not counted in the meals as I will use part of them to make noodles,2 pork butts, 1 boneless rib roast (for Christmas as the price was cheaper than I have ever paid at Christmas) 2 racks of ribs (one for New Year's),3 roasting chickens, 2 pkgs of rib eye steaks (for when Hubby craves a steak after so many casseroles and soups)2 bags of frozen thin chicken breast, 2 pkgs of fresh chicken breast,3 pkgs of ground pork,12 lbs of ground beef, 2 pkgs of chicken thighs, and 2 pkgs of chicken wings (for when we miss our favorite wing place)  I cut the wings in 3 pieces and bagged the tips for broth. I broke the pkgs down to meal size and vacuumed them. What is already in the freezers is 4 prime rib roasts(from Christmas) a pork tenderloin, a pork loin, 10 meals of pork chops, 2 roasting chickens, 2 hams, 40 meals of pepperoni, 1 rack of ribs, 1 qrt of beef cubes for stew or noodles, a bottom round roast, 1 pkg of thin chicken breast, bacon, bulk sausage, and smoked sausage.

So we listed 54 meals we enjoy that have no meat/beans(though might have scraps of what ever meat was leftover aka ham bone, or eggs) so we can rotate through those meals. Hubby doesn't care much for soup but I added 7 soups (ThePrudenthomemaker.com has several) so we can rotate through the soups 4 times in a year. He will do better not eating the same one a lot.I baked 2 loaves of bread and froze one for when I don't have time to bake. Hubby didn't realize that baking bread takes about 4 hrs. Told me I needed to buy another bread pan so I could do 3 loaves at a time. Considering he already ate half the loaf I might agree with him though I know he won't eat the same bread all the time, something both of us don't care for. I baked Amish white bread this time. I plan to make oatmeal bread (Owlhaven.net) then a potato bread (simplyrecipes.com), and my favorite English muffin toasting bread (Kingarthurflour.com).Back to canning tomatoesBlessed Be"},
{"title": "The start of a frugal month", "date": "Monday, October 1, 2018", "text": "Yep...saving big time...how... we didn't have to pay Oct rent for the old place along with the mortgage here, a savings of $700 PLUS the landlord said since we weren't actually living there through Sept we wouldn't be paying the electric bill for that month, especially since we had turned off the AC before we moved here at beginning of Sept.That's another $125.  We won't be driving every day the truck with trailer and the car 120 miles round trip spending $160 a week in gas....for a savings of $640.We won't be eating out 3 times a week at $15 a meal to split between us saving us $60 a month. That's $1525 a month savings.  JUST FYI, we came in at $10 over what we budgeted for 209 including gas and eating out.That will be split between, savings, mortgage principal (goal it so have 20 % paid off in 3 yrs) and a new truck payment for Hubby(which we have already figured out how much he can pay down and what he can carry as a loan and the interest rate he can afford.I harvested the last of the ripe tomatoes and the last of the green ones. I will be saving the seeds for next year.I harvested the last of the hot peppers. I won't save these seeds as we didn't like the peppers all that well.I harvested the last 3 heads of cabbage.I harvested the last 2 green onions that got missed when I thought we had them pulled a couple months ago.I harvested rhubarb by cutting it back to get ready to transplant it to the north garden.I harvested grapes, there are some not ripe so we will eat those fresh if the birds don't get them . Buying a net for the grape vines is on the buy for gardens list.I found a source for eggs  and a couple suggestions for bulk goods . I will be checking out the bulk goods to see if it has what I need and if it does I won't be renewing our membership to Sam's club that is almost an hour from us now.I cut the pork loin in half and vacuum bagged it for 2 roasts for this winter. I cut the second one I bought into 20 pork chops and froze them on cookie sheets so I can vacuum them 2 to a bag for our meals.I sliced the 2 sticks of pepperoni I got (that I was given a discount on due to moving away and being a regular buyer) and now have 20 months of pepperoni unless we eat more of it than we regularly do.We found a tiller for the tractor for about half the price of what we were seeing. We were able to till our north garden today without paying for it to be done.I will be transplanting the strawberries and rhubarb to this garden and planting the garlic, hopefully if the rain holds off...I'll do that tomorrow.The Amish neighbor stopped by and asked what we were planning on doing with the 3 acres we let him plant corn in (for free), He had a look of surprise when we told him we were planning on him planting it with what ever he decided on with no rent . He said he felt better if he paid us rent and told us what he rents other properties for. I did qualify before he offered money that he had to find me an bulk store for flour and sugar and where I could buy 2 to 4 dozen eggs a month.Hubby added someone to buy straw from... he laughed and said he could do the eggs and straw and when his hens weren't laying there was a couple others that sold eggs. He told us where the bulk stores were at and then offered to pay rent for the property. It would cost us more to maintain it so letting him do it for free actually saved us money. Hubby said the rent would go in the savings for what we needed for the gardens. I think I will put it in savings for when we are short on $$$.I sewed my skort twice before I realized it kept ripping because it's too big on me and rides lower that normal so when I walk it pulls the old tear back apart.We went to our grandson's wedding... tempted to buy a new outfit but chose to wear my little black dress that I've only had 40 years. Yes 40 years, I paid $100 for it and it's averaged out to $2.50 a year and it looks good enough to go another 5 yrs at least. I got several complements on it and my grandson remembered the dress from his childhood and mentioned it to his mom, my daughter2 and she remembered me  having it during her childhood so they decided to ask how long I had it. They were surprised it looked so good being that old... I was surprised I could still fit in it. LOLBlessed Be"},

NO more spending $$$ for gas for driving back and forth any more.I had a bit of a worry as Daughter 2 had shut 2 of the dogs in her bedroom while she was staying with us and they did this to an 100 yr old doorWe weren't very happy with her but like always in her mind she can do what ever she wants and it's always right.I got Restor finisher for dark oak and now it looks like this. Landlord's oldest son asked for what it was because he now wants to redo all the doors and woodwork with it.He hadn't realized that the door was 2 different woods.We came home the other night and was a bit worried as Charlotte wasn't in the yard with the boys... we found her in the house which bothered us until I found muddy prints on the back storm door and the mudroom inside door had muddy prints also. Hubby didn't make sure the storm door was shut and Charlotte definitely knows how to get in and out. Wilbur tried to get in to her as every single window had his muddy prints on the newly painted siding.SO now it's 118 things for this HOME and over 100 boxes to sort and put away."},

They charged 1/3 of what we were quoted by \"Englishers\" as the term is used around here. There are 3 places they could not reach as our ladders weren't quite tall enough on the ends. I told Hubby we could park the truck next to the house and put the ladder in the truck bed giving us the 3 ft needed in height to finish the house. The house looks great and a big check mark off the to do listThe back splash at the stove was installed by Hubby instead of having the contractor do it at $150 , he put Plexiglas over it to protect that almost $250 back splash from grease from the stove.We cleared the inside of the old house YEA!!!! We still have 2 loads in the garage...just because of the size of things not the amount. I still have to clean the house and do some minor repairs. We have chiropractic appt Tuesday morning so will be in that area and Hubby has 3 month check up on Wed with his doctor also in the area... I figured we can pretty much finish it on those 2 days ( saving gas for not making extra trips)and do the removing of the mantle that will go to our oldest on Sunday (when she is off work and Son 2 can help us) and give the keys to the landlord along with the garage openers and get our mail one last time.  Last 4 wks we spend around $600 in gas moving. SO done with doing that.We went to Sam's club today. I had a very detailed list of what needed restocked along with price point.I got gal./qrt/ and sandwich bags. Foil and press and seal wrap. Potato chips, Frito's and Cheddar cheese chips. Plain choc candy bars, almond candy bars and Heath candy bars. Dried cherries and dried cranberries. Cashews. Club crackers.Choc. chips.Limes,lemons,cucumbers and apples.Spaghetti and Velveeta cheese.Peanut butter.Olive Garden salad dressing. Goat cheese and fresh moz. Minute rice and 20 lbs Jasmine rice. Canned pumpkin and coffee for me. Chinet plates to replace what we used at the family reunion. The big buy was 7 lbs of light brown sugar, 25 lbs of all purpose flour, 25 lbs bread/pizza flour (definite need after we at frozen pizza because we don't care for the pizza place that is close) and 50 lbs of sugar.About half of the buckets I have , this is the flour and sugar section.They are sitting on pieces of wood as you should never store food directly on concrete.From Amazon I ordered White Lily bread flour and all purpose flour, popcorn,panko crumbs, case nacho soup,case of bean sprouts,case ramen noodles,Arborio rice,2 cases of whole potatoes, coffee for Hubby for 1/5th less than I could find it else where.I still have manicotti, lg pasta shells,red cabbage with apples and saran wrap on the buy list.I have my \"fall/winter\" list of winter squash,pork loin, pork butt, pork ribs, dinner sausage(Walters)pepperoni (IGA) G&R bologna (G&R) Prime rib(Walter's at Christmas) Turkey (Thanksgiving) Ham(Thanksgiving/Christmas and Easter). I am looking for Roasting chickens and hamburger.I need to find a local source for eggs.... I forgot to ask when the ladies were here painting the house.We are going to the Pumpkin Auction at the Amish produce auction on Friday with our friends so I might find a local seller there.We have the furnace on but turn it off when it's warm enough to prop doors open for the dogs and turn it down to 60 when we are gone. I said something about it being cool in the house and Hubby suggested I turn the furnace up, I came back with I could put socks and slippers on and a shawl or sweater instead of cranking the furnace up. He laughed.Dogs are no longer staying in the kennel and their run at the barn while we are gone as Rascal has learned to climb over the 5 ft gate. Since we don't want him without water and food for hours we decided to leave the run gate open and found that they do stay in the yard (meaning he doesn't climb the 5 ft fence) and will take shelter in the kennel or on the kitchen porch when it rains. Both neighbors have checked on them and said they do very well like that.We saved $250 on getting a dumpster instead of paying extra for the boxes etc we have from moving. I still have about the same amount of boxes to go through. I plan to have that done before the dumpster is removed.I put darts in a couple pairs of pants. I don't want to buy new clothes going into winter when I usually put on weight. But my belts are no longer holding the pants up either.I'm still a bit under weight from last Crohn's attack.Blessed Be"},

I changed a couple things in the kitchen drawers since I kept walking to one drawer for the can opener and it was in another. Easier to move the can opener than retrain me LOL.Mornings are started with us sitting either on the kitchen porch or at the dining table drinking our first 2 cups of coffee, talking about what needs done, who is doing what etc. I start a load of laundry between cup 1 and 2 and then I hang that out on the kitchen porch clothesline. It's 8:45 ...the Amish kids walk by to catch the buggy ride at the end of this road at that time.I then unload the dishwasher and put that away.IF I am going to the old place I leave for there. Usually around 2 I will head back here with my car looking like this.Yesterday it was both my Jeep and my Ford. Ford blew the muffler on the way here and since it's heading to the junk yard as the axle is going bad I won't be fixing it. Hubby was kind of shocked that I was driving it even with him following. Not the first time the axle broke with me driving that car.When I get home it's fix dinner, load dishwasher and set to run after bedtime. Put out what ever needs thawed for the next day's dinner. We spend some time either on the Kitchen porch or sitting at dining table. If we can we will watch the news for the weather in the front room. I will do some computer work,balance the budget, update punch out list for both places and then read until bedtime which is around 8:30.If I don't go over to the old place I do something in the gardens or on the yard work in the morning and again in the evening. I unload the car and put it away. Continue to work my way through the boxes that are here and moving furniture around to work better during the day until dinner time. Our morning and evening routines are pretty much the same.Breakfast is usually toast,cupcakes, cake, cookies (as we had some left from the reunion last Sunday), Hubby does cold cereal few and far between. I know when it gets cold it will be oatmeal or cream of wheat...maybe grits for him. Milk gravy and bread or biscuits. We prefer warm breakfasts when it is cold. Pancakes,French toast and waffles are more of a weekend or breakfast for dinner item.Lunch is leftovers or lunch meat wraps except on Wed or Thursday then it might be Pfieffer Station lunch of meatloaf(Wed) or beef and noodles(Thurs).The last couple nights for dinner we had leftover fried chicken my brother brought to the reunion along with the leftover mashed potatoes son2 brought for the noodles my cousin brought ...which I didn't get any of  noodles🙁🙁.  Tonight is 123 pasta using smoked sausage (freezer), onion( I grew) and bell pepper( neighbor gave us) with diced tomatoes the I have canned. We are eating mostly from the pantry or what we are given.I've pretty broke the routine of going to the grocery store(Kroger's) every week. Last week Hubby spent $4 getting milk at the gas station when he got fuel because he figured it was cheaper than him going into the local Walmart and spending money on what we didn't need. I then reminded him that Save A Lot was a block from that gas station and the milk would have been less than $2.I would like to get a cleaning routine set but right now it's clean as needed and focus on the moving etc still. Every Saturday morning I do dust mop the dog hair (HA HA) off the floors.Blessed Be"},

We need to finish getting the stuff from the old place and then find a place to put it away or get rid of it here.I need to restock pantry, winterize this house, get winter clothes and blankets ready, prepare gardens,prune bushes, trim and mow the entire property.  NOT touching there is still painting etc to do. NOT have a Crohn's attack.SO I will start with this picture that I found a long time ago on the internet somewhere.The woman reminds me of my Nonna who was from Northern Italy. It's my favorite style of apron. The kitchen is real close to what I grew up with except Daddy enclosed under the sink so Mother could have more storage. It keeps me focused on what I need to do because as a child I learned the necessities of making it through the winter since we didn't go to the store for food at all and there was no such thing as assistance if we couldn't pay the fuel oil bill or electric. Nonna, my grandparents and my parents all went through the Great Depression. I've been taught well on what I am using to get us through this next year, that we planned on being on the rough side. Don't know how much fuel it will take to heat this house, run the water heater and the cook stove. Don't know how well the insulation is or how well the windows will keep the wind out. Lots of unknowns to deal with.It will be officially Autumn this week, we watched geese flying north west this morning.I bounce from windows open, AC on to furnace running in 24 hrs.It's fall in OH.The pantry is lower on the veggies than I like going in to winter but doable but I do have more jam than usual and more dehydrated potatoes than usual. We just won't have the variety that we are used to having. I don't have extra money to pay for it out of season as we still need to finish getting the stuff for Hubby to start welding and his truck is limping big time.I have the material for the winter curtains but until we are out of the old house (NO later than the 28th because I refuse to pay another month of rent and electric and we stopped due to me getting an eye infection and not being able to open my eyes at all..and not being able to see..(better, not completely over it but better) I am not focused on the sewing.As our Amish neighbors told an Englisher at the Auction the other day when they were asked, they eat from the gardens during the season and from their pantry when out of season. If they don't can or dry it (as they don't have electric so no freezers) they don't have it when it's not in season. We intend to be the same.I hope everyone is doing well, adjusting to new schedules with school/work or just every day life changes.Blessed BeOur Sam's club membership ends the first part of Oct so I will make a run before than as we don't know if we will need to have that membership since a few of the bulk stores carry flour and sugar in 25 lb bags.We decide to try to find a local butcher shop and see what specials they have and if that doesn't do well for us we know the local Save A  Lot store (like Aldi's) does a weekly 4 packages of different meat for $19.99. Packages are for a family of 4 so that would make us 2 meals at least.On the list (which was easy to start since I just moved the pantry and freezers.50 lbs sugar25 lbs All purpose flour25 lbs bread flour25 lbs White Lily bread flour25 lbs White Lily All purpose flour (White Lily flours is what Southern's use and I use it in recipes that I got while taking classes down south)4 lbs light brown sugarcase of ramen noodlesPanko crumbsMinute riceArborio riceJasmine ricecase of bean sproutscase of whole canned potatoes (unless neighbor teaches me to can potatoes)case of Nacho soup1 box of manicotti1 box of jumbo shells3 jars of red cabbage and applesMeat...3 pork loin (I use for roasts and cutting my own pork chops)4 pork ribs (for BBQ or smoke ribs or flavoring in sauces)2 pork butt roasts3 roasting chickens4 hams1-5 bone prime rib (At Christmas) (Walter's Wapa OH2 logs AKA sticks Italian pepperoni (IGA Anna or New Bremen OH)2 logs of G & R bologna (G & R Waldo OH)2 cases dinner sausage (Walter's in Wapa OH)6 whole turkeys.

Mine is on the left with medium brew, Hubby's in on the right with bold brew. My tea box is to the left of my coffee pot. If the weather isn't bad we sit even in drizzle out on the kitchen porch and watch the dogs run around and the Amish kids walk to the corner to catch a buggy ride to school.This is okay...not thrilled to have it sitting at the cold air return but for right now it works as there is NO drawer space for my kitchen towels.This is set up real close to how it was so it's good. I used to have my metal bowls sitting on top which I do prefer but that causes issues with open bags of potato chips and boxes of cereal on top of frig. I think Hubby will get away from the cold cereal.I still open the right side for the milk which is now on the left side due to water filter on the top of the right side. This is SMALLER than our other one which is now in the basement. I think we both regret not spending the money and ordering the same size in black.In all the years we have had this cabinet I've never been able to use the side table because it sat at a door way. It's nice to be able to put what ever we are putting in or pulling out on that now. We do need a better radio, as the local radio station plays decent oldies and has weather every 30 min and local news at the top of the hour. The tv is on an antenna that gets a station over 90 miles from us. Okay for the weather but nothing about local news here.  I was able to put my bento boxes and steamer baskets in with Mother's pots and pans that I keep in the cabinet.For the past week, at least once a day if not twice a day, this is what the back of my Jeep looks like. Boy do I miss the Ford being able to be driven because I could get twice as much in the Ford as I do the Jeep.IF I do twice in one day I stay home the next day and put the second load away while Hubby goes and gets a load of stuff from garage or farrowing house that he will put away.We have started to have a routine. Coffee and kitchen porch in the morning to discuss what needs done, sometimes at the breakfast bar or dining table.Our Amish neighbor told us this morning they didn't know if we were out of bed yet since there was no lights on... a friend of his needed a ride due to a horse not doing well on the way to work and stopped at the neighbor's house. We open curtains and as long as we can see what we are doing we don't turn on lights.This house has a lot of windows and it not as dark as the old place. Since he now knows that he can't go by lights on and to just look to see if the back door blind is up any. We raise it when we let the dogs out the first thing as they go out the back door instead of the kitchen. Their preference for what ever reason.I will do a load of laundry and hang on the kitchen porch clothes line unless it's really raining hard enough to get the porch wet. Then I wait until the next day.I put 3-5 boxes away or sort through them to list what I need to find a place for.It's now , where can I put this so I remember to look for it here mode.Hubby now has 3 wardrobes and I have two clothing racks.Lack of closets is a pain. A place for shoes for both of us is worse. I can see some items going away.If we are both home we eat lunch at 11:30. If not then we try to have dinner together between 4-6. Otherwise we are known for grazing for what ever that is quick.Back to work for me...Blessed Be"},

SIGH I really really thought I had it better organized. I guess that is being frugal...frustrating but frugal.Items I don't know where are going are put in boxes and put in a certain place and a note of what it is so when I figure it out I can put it away.We decided to change the furniture around and if we don't have a place for it right now it will go to the barn until next spring. That way when I finish doing the lofts it won't be a \"blast, should have kept that\".I started washing the blankets etc Hubby used to protect things while moving them. Since he hasn't had time to put in my new clothes line I am hanging them on the clothes line on the kitchen porch that the Amish lady had. They hung clothes on the porches and basement when the weather was bad or cold. That means I can only hang a few blankets at a time but cheaper than running the dryer.We have been sticking to the menu for a change and I've not felt too tired to eat let alone cook and clean up. Decided leftovers once a week.We now have hot water so I was able to use my dish washer last night and let it run after we went to bed.We did have to have the plumber come back in due to an error code on the water heater and what we thought was a leak. Wasn't a leak just no one had used the hot water and the plug in the tub adjusted. While he fixing that he realize the sump pump had been shifted and the float was sticking on the wall so he adjust that and check a couple other things to make sure everything was how it should be.I put a couple bath towels up at windows that still don't have enough curtains to keep the sunlight out from heating up the house... we are in 100's with heat index. I  folded a panel of curtains in half to use in the dining room. The curtains are too long but work fine folded. When I get time (ha ha)I might just sew them so that is how they are.I opened the house this morning as the rain came in to cool things off for awhile. It wasn't raining in on the east side due to porches and overhangs. Nice to turn the AC off at least for a bit.We changed how the railing /banister to the staircase to the lofts are going to be so we can do them ourselves instead of paying the contractor that is coming in on Saturday.Saturday.... contractor and his crew got the flooring down in the north and south lofts. He will come back next week to put the pine panels on the bottom of the walls. He is hoping to have the rolling pantry cart for my regular bathroom done when he comes back as he decided to make it at his own home. I put together meat and cheese platter with assorted breads, a veggie tray and fruit tray for the 5 of us.Hubby and I finished the veggie and fruit trays today, Sunday. I will most likely put part of the meat and cheese in the freezer with some of the bread. The rustic white bread is almost gone. I already made notes for the menus in the next weeks to use up the rest of the bread, meat and cheese.I went over to the old place and packed up another car load of things that can't be transported in the trailer.Punch out list was 304 a couple months ago, was down to 119 on Friday. We have it down to 109 today.Calling it a day, I was up through the night with a migraine due to my arm hurting (weather is now 60) with the colder weather.Blessed Be"},

Talk about going back to my childhood.We shifted our work day to mornings here and afternoons back at the old place to finish it up and take hot showers before coming back. The old landlord was fine with it for another week but since I am feeling a bit rough I was concern with another flare up of Crohn's so I paid Sept rent. He said he would prorate it for when we actually are completely out.We are focusing on becoming zero or very little waste. I know it won't happen over night. First we decided why the change... truthfully it was because we very seldom have 1 full white trash bag of trash a week but have to pay the same as someone that has 10 bags of trash. I talked to the lowest priced company and they suggested I pay for 1 month to start. From what they have seen the most trash is produced when you first move in and when you move out.  They figured we would start living closer to how our neighbors do and end up with zero waste because our township does recycling once a month.Second, I hate paying that much for something I can get by without using.We still might end up spending the money but at least I will have tried.We will not be getting cable but using the tower Hubby bought from a fellow HAM radio operator. That's on his to do list.We spent time with our ins guy and he priced out 2 different ways to insure us and we chose to do the suburban farm as it was only $200 more but allows us to earn money doing hobbies. The other required no income from the farm and we know that will change in the future. Ended up with it not being as expensive as we thought AND it covered more of our stuff that wasn't covered before...like hand tools...AKA 35 screwdrivers we have between us and yes we have used them ALL.I figured out the menu based on what we have right here at this time.canned corn beef hash, biscuits(canned) salad and canned mandarin orangespasta with meatballs (freezer)  homemade sauce ,garlic bread (freezer),peas (freezer)and canned tropical fruit saladmeatloaf , mashed potatoes ,rolls($5.99 split a meal from local store) corn(freezer),and canned peachesBeef and noodles, mashed potatoes,rolls ($6.99 split a meal from local store) , cole slaw (from local store as we don't eat enough of it to make it) and home canned applesauceOne pot green beans(home canned), potatoes and ham(leftover in freezer), cornbread (from scratch), and home canned pearsSaturday we have 3 contractors coming in to finish the south and north lofts. I already told them I would provide lunch. I know two of them are sandwich eaters. I will make a meat and cheese platter, veggie tray and fruit tray along with assort breads. I plan to bake brownies or a cake also. What ever is not ate will be our dinner and then frozen for meals later.Sunday will be leftovers or home canned beef veggie soup and leftover bread.We slept in to 7 am... even the dogs. AND they didn't get us up during the night. Charlotte went out at 10:30 pm but Hubby was still up.We had our first cup of coffee watching the sun come up over the trees and listening to the horses' hoof hit the road as they went down the other road about 1/3 mile from us. Even the dogs would cock their heads to listen. Not a sound we are used to.Wilbur decided to check out the perimeter which is now all fenced so we don't have to worry about any of them getting in to the fields or the road. It's about 2 acres for them to roam around. He decided to come check us out to see if we had anything for him.Rascal has now marked every single tree, bush, plant , building, fence posts LOLCharlotte swiped Rascal's ball while he was busy.Hubby was just enjoying sitting and relaxing before we started back to working.And since I snapped Hubby's picture he insisted I have mine take also...Nope I didn't brush my hair yet LOL...We still have tons of work to do , still have things to box up and bring this way also.The dogs have adjusted so well that when we went over the other day , they wanted back in the truck within 30 min , didn't even go check out the barn or cows."},

Enterprise (once again) was the best deal especially adding AARP and ENTERPRISE as we have a membership (have since 1998). 26 ft box truck, 400 miles free, Tuesday to Saturday was $100 LESS than what is was going to cost us for our own trailer.AND it should be only 1 trip except for dishes, glass canning jars and frozen/refrigerated food. Those I am transporting in my car.I am hoping tomorrow or Wed to go see my Dad as he fell going to the bathroom and busted his face and glasses. The Nursing home called my brother immediately after taking care of Dad and they aren't sure if he had his slippers on his feet or was in socks because his slippers were under his wheelchair where he fell. Heart breaking to hear about and my brother did take a picture and send it to me... Brother told Dad he was sending me the picture and Dad told him I better bring him pictures of the house being done... so part of his memory is still working. Not much but some.We decide to not try to fix meals at night. I cooked a ham in the crock pot and sliced it up and put in the frig so we can have sandwiches at night time or for breakfast. We buy our lunch at the local store that has a special lunch daily for $4.99 to $7.99. Wednesday is meatloaf and Thursday is beef and noodles. Those are big enough to split between us so it won't be as much. Today was suppose to be country fried steak and mashed potatoes for $4.99. She was sold out at 12:30 so gave us Swiss steak with mashed potatoes for the same price. Hubby bought 2 since there wasn't enough to split... AKA he was hungry as he didn't eat breakfast before leaving this morning.Got to go pack the car and wrap up the evening.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "SHE (209) IS DONE", "date": "Saturday, August 25, 2018", "text": "or at least the main floor is done.A good cleaning left to do in the mudroom , east loft and west loft.Contractor already hired to redo south and north loft (our schedule conflicted with his or it would have already been done).New furniture is in.I've ordered slider shelves for a couple of the cabinets that will hold pots and pans.Loads left to move...1 of furniture. (plus one to take mantle to daughter 1)2 of pantry(including freezer and frig)2 of household (pots, pans, dishes, holiday stuff etc)1 in farrowing houseHubby said 3 in garage with all his tools and tables etc but I think only 2.and then cleaning here.Plan is to be OUT of here completely by the 30th/31st except for cleaning part.I doubt if we pack, load and unload and Reload 2 times a day... but we will see.View from front room door way through dining area unto kitchen, you can even see the lime green laundry roomwhat is now sitting between the stove and the cabinets so MAYBE we won't be stupid and sit a hot pan down on my onyx counter tops.I'm not going to put up my knife magnetic strips or the paper towel holder etc until I see how I actually use the set up of this kitchen. We have decided to try to be zero waste so I need to now work on how to set that up when our recycling is only once a month at the township hall. The Amish family next door offered to help do that as they are zero waste.This is my new china hutch. I'm still thinking of how to put what dishes in it. The every day dishes will probably go in caddy that is sitting on the end of the counter right now.I've ordered sliders for a couple of cabinets for the pots and pans since I put the Hoosier where  I was going to hang my pegboard. The corner cabinet I already decided for small appliances. The rest is kind of wait and see.Oh yeah... 20 yrs later, we got new furniture ...The was my Mother's rocker she had when she died. It won't be sitting here for long as I want a \"game/puzzle table to sit here so it will most likely move to dining area or even the bedroom. Either place where I can sit and read."},
{"title": "moving this week", "date": "Friday, August 24, 2018", "text": "It might be a hard shove as Hubby is not home from fishing trip until Saturday night but he asked for the plan of attack to be written up so we can post it on the wall to stay focus to be moved by the 30th with cleaning on the 31st.He is changing the barn around to reflect, woodworking/weld shop area, furniture restore area. 2 car garage area, tractor area, and dog kennel area.THEN he is finishing the fence and gates .I have to finish cleaning...I haven't touched the east and west lofts yet so that's on the list for today. AFTER they deliver the furniture.Ins agent is coming in Monday (which is why the barn needs changed around 1st) and needs a some what set up to make sure we are covered correctly.I already got an estimate of what it would cost us to replace the barn as we are using it that he definitely under estimated.SO here's what I haveI went out to the barn and got Mother's rocker that I was using to sit in out there.Cleaned her up , needs a repair but usable as is and put her in the corner when I will probably sit a table for us to do puzzles and games during the winter. Painters teased me about sitting watching them work since I was actually eating my lunch.I did not plan to match the paint(which is the color of Hubby's truck) to this chair. This chair has floated through the family after I went and got it out of state. A friend was closing plants down (the heart breaking part of his job) and the company he works for told him to give the stuff away or to toss in dumpster. He gave everything away even when it meant he took it to the thrift shops to keep things out of the dumpster. This is a chair that came out of the 1st plant he closed where I took 2 loads and brought it back to OH for several families.Needs a couple little repairs but usable. My furniture repair area is going to over flow LOL.Our head painter was waiting for drywall to dry so he could repaint a wall that he caught that was messed up, you could see it when the west sunlight hit the wall as you walked in ...not acceptable to this perfectionist in his job.  He went around and gave another coat to all the window sills as they are the ones that take the hardest hit of wear according to him especially if you have children or pets... which is the same thing to him also. He did touch up where they installed the counter also. Put a door back on after adjusting the hinges.Our 2nd painter finished his section and was waiting on the head painter asked if he could fix both bathroom doors (he realized if you stood the the side you could see in especially coming out of the laundry room down the hall ) and installed the hook and eye locks on the doors and then since head painter was still waiting on drywall , he chose to hang ALL my curtain rods, sweep down all the walls and then the floor  and empty the trash cans in the barn, porches and house while I was cleaning the wheelchair bathroom and shoving pots and pans in the cabinets.This company don't believe in sitting around and doing nothing, if they can't do what they are there for (like waiting for drywall or paint to dry) they find something to do that helps the owner with permission.One of them will be back today to finish the wall as the drywall still was damp when we all left.The negative side of this move...These 3 don't understand. Wilbur (boxer) has moved several times so I think/feel we are triggering him as the last move he didn't go with my daughter or her kids, he came to us.This week was hardest with Hubby on the fishing trip and not coming home at all and I am working longer hours at 209 carrying both our loads. My first 2 hrs of my day is attention and play time with these 3. THEN I get ready for work and I take them for a ride around the block(4 miles). Charlotte goes in the cage (that goes away when we move as they will stay in kennel in barn so they can go outside when they want) and the doors to bathroom and bedroom get shut. If Charlotte can't lay on the bed then no one lays on the bed .I try to be back in 9 hrs (basing it on if I was working for a company). I do have a couple friends  that will come let dogs out if I have to go longer than that. We do the same for them. Which is why we decided to build the kennel so the dogs could go in and out when we are gone and yet keep the house secure as we couldn't put a dog door in... we would have to take the bottom half completely.My 1st hour home is focused on getting them outside, playing with them and giving tons of attention. Then we all sit on the couch and watch the news (that is usually Hubby) while I eat dinner. Then back outside to play and just be outside for another hour. Then I get things around for the next day. We take a ride again. Then get around for bed with one more time of being outside. When we come in , it's off to bed, a little later than usually but I want to get the outside time in as much as possible with being with them.The positive of being outside with them and playing....I've lost another size in clothes and gained some muscle.Off to work  I go.... no whistling... I can't whistle... breaks my heart a little because both parents and brother whistled. Daddy told me Grandma couldn't whistle either."},

Hubby has a down spout to put on (it's there but Hubby forgot to get the piece to add it to the other pipe.)counter top is installed. Sink is installed. Plumber notified so he can come back and hook up faucet and dishwasher.This is the basement door. The door handle had been sticking and we were leaving it open a bit...well, it got bumped shut while moving things down the hall and it decided to latch and break...so the painter that had finished his work and was waiting on the other painter decided to work on it thinking he could fix it... he ended up handing me the handle and told me to replace it and the one on the bedroom door and laundry room door because they are starting to do the same thing... they are original to the house and the springs in them are wearing out... at least this door won't lock shut on me.Back to work."},

With in 30 min I felt okay....I'm okay with okay LOLHead contractor found out I was in hospital and put all his crew on alert to do what ever they could to help me....so when ever one was waiting for something they wiped down walls and ceilings...AS of today (8/22/2018) There is touch up on 4 spots, a coat of poly on one section of floor that was redone and another coat of paint on one of the mudroom walls.  ALL that is to be done Thursday (tomorrow). Would have been done today BUTCOUNTER TOP IS COMING IN TODAY (right where the floor is being redone) at 12:15... yes, really, that is the time they gave us...weird.Barn gutters are coming in either today or tomorrow (depends on weather)Screening for house gutters that got missed is Monday or Tuesday.Final appraisal is Thursday at 1 pmFriday the new furniture will be in at 1-2 (they are coming from an hour away).Hubby is fishing in the gulf... HA HA...if I knew it would have kicked up the finish mode I would have moved his trip up.I couldn't find my brand new dust mop so decided to clean the stoveI am so glad they didn't test the oven when they tested the burners and Hubby remembered the contractor that helped him move it in put it in there because he thought I would be using it the next day but they were going to put it in the laundry room when they got it in the house.So I cleaned the regular bathroomSo now when I walk down the hall I see this... still need goop be gone to get the paint splatters off the tub and the floor.But except for installing towel hooks and the curtains this room is DONE.At least I can soak in the soaker's tub and crawl onto the lounge for a nap LOL"},

{"title": "frugal while in the hospital... finishing up 209", "date": "Sunday, August 12, 2018", "text": "Yep, I'm in the hospital with my Crohn's....Hubby decided against going after daughter 4 who was going to help finish packing up the pantry and moving it and cleaning the east and west lofts on Saturday because he wasn't sure he wouldn't have to turn around and come back to the hospital because me. I got a dozen pictures of boxes of food asking where to put it from him instead. She knew exactly where to put it and made us both laugh when I shared them with her that he hadn't realized how I organized the pantry.We were giving the estimate of what my hospital bill will be after insurance with the offer of 5% off if we prepaid now (up to 10 days after release) and if it was more than the estimate they would still take 5% off the balance since we did prepay and if they over charged us they would send out the refund with in a week of the insurance paying.I seriously doubt if we are over paying with the meds I am getting.Doctor making the hospital calls for my GI has decided along with my GI and the hospital doctor that my meds need changed to stop this cycle of being in here this time of year. So he checked to make sure what he was wanting to give me had no blue dye since I have a sever allergy to blue dye (not natural kind ) AND that my insurance would cover the costs because he thinks stress is my biggest trigger... I am also to be on anti anxiety meds until things settle down and I can get in to a good routine and stabilize my diet. PLUS he checked to make sure the meds were generic so they would be cheaper.I brought my own diapers... saving the charge of those items which is double what I spent on the diapers. I brought my own toothpaste. But forgot the tooth brush...oh well. I brought my own soap, so there is no charge for that either.I have food at home that I can eat (soft diet) so no having to pit stop and grab something on way home. Since I can't cook at 209 I asked about the food I was eating for lunch there and it was okayed to eat also... well the egg roll was NOT cleared due to cabbage but if I make my own with bean sprouts and hamburger I can have egg rolls. I probably won't be making egg rolls or eating them for 2 weeks. In 2 weeks I can go back to my regular diet. WITH including 2 servings daily of  kefir or Greek style yogurt daily along with my vsl#3. I can have 1 - 20 oz soft drink per day, ginger soda/ginger ale being the number 1 preference but any others okay. I can still have up to 3 cups of coffee per day (I drink 2) andup to  48 ounces of tea (hot or cold) PLUS water of course.. Smaller meals, more often or even just 6 snacks a day.I have been ordered to get UP and MOVE more... as a chef I had a very active day at work and then more at home, now I sit more and my body is taking the blunt of the lack of movement. I am also going back to yoga as stress is a big issue.I've wrote up a \"if I can\" plan to finish packing and moving this week AND had it okayed by all 3 doctors with acknowledgement I will get sore core muscles and I will be tired but I listed timed breaks with food since I habitually carry water with me while working.As for 209... the last of the floors and odds and ends will be done by Friday. We have a person who is bring his son to finish the south and north lofts since I am down on Saturday. They think 40 hrs but more like 20 with the two of them... Already gave us the costs unless it takes longer.Hubby and I think we will give them a bonus as they are coming in last minute on the weekend to help us out after their day jobs through the week instead of having us on their regular list of jobs.Counter tops come in on the 22nd. Barn roofing has been delivered to be installed and the screening for the gutters should be in this week also.Just finish cleaning 209, packing up Staley, move everything and unpack it and then cleaning Staley... BEFORE Hubby leaves next week for deep sea fishing...Pictures...lots of pictures will be coming.Blessed Be everyone, stay healthy, take care of yourselves, give yourself ME time."},
{"title": "packing to move...trying to be frugal... stage of 209", "date": "Tuesday, August 7, 2018", "text": "West loft floor is done, East loft floor needs a 3rd coat.Stairs to west/east lofts is done.wheelchair bathroom is almost finished, covers for outlets and switches and the recessed door handle on the door to be done.bedroom and hall are stained, Carpenter aka Finisher whether he likes it or not LOL... is thinking of staining the south and north loft stairs along with the kitchen and dining room and then poly that entire side of the house at the same time as the bedroom and hall. That would leave the mudroom and front room to stain and poly... that leaves the regular bath open as we can enter through basement or kitchen while the front room, mudroom is stained and poly.Preparing the kitchen and dining room floors. Where the air compressor is sitting carpenter found a spot that was supposed to have been fixed by the other team and found they didn't even nail the piece down and it definitely wasn't how it was suppose to be either. Not smart to tick this guy off because he took a pic and sent it to the BOSS and the boss just put the other team on notice of one more screw up and they can look for other work and we got credited for the time the first team clocked as doing that area.I been taking a break from painting the wood that goes on the front yard fence to keep dogs in....and checking out our windmillwhen I get home... I have been working on filling the pantry with these garden items. We did start on the pantry in the basement at 209 since we can't be upstairs on the floors as they prep,stain and poly...These were suppose to hold over 500 lbs each shelf... after a couple hours of holding less than 200 lbs they started giving way in the middle. I am thankful I caught it before the boards broke, thankful is was metal cans and not canning jars. Since we bought them several months ago the place we bought them at can't do anything to help us and did tell me to let the company making them know and send pictures of what it did.25 buckets of 20-25 lbs of staples in them. 20 cases of jarred food and what isn't showing is the 30 cloth grocery bags of steel can foods and plastic jarred items... 1/6th of the pantry is moved to 209. I cleared the root cellar today.We have found by eating a decent size lunch that we can get away with eating a light snack for dinner.... We watch the specials at the little store around from us and know to go for a late lunch to the Chinese buffet.Have went to Arby's on Monday as the Chinese buffet is closed when the little store has a special I can't eat or neither of us wants.Head contractor asked how we were feeling..happy excited etc... we went exhausted, frustrated and over whelmed... bad enough Hubby thought about hiring the rest to be packed, moved and unpacked and I was like ...then we can pay our one kid that is trying to find extra work so she can get a car instead of bumming rides due to her car catching fire(wiring) and being a total loss, ins didn't cover that.She's giving me 10 hrs on Saturday....possible 12 hrs.Got to get around, laundry has to be done tonight as dryer goes to 209 tomorrow and I'll be down the drying rack and YEAH the clothes line as they just finished working on the road and are done crop dusting also."},
{"title": "Delete, Life keeps rolling.  Stay frugal plus 209", "date": "Tuesday, July 31, 2018", "text": "Oh yeah, start writing here, get pulled away to do something else and lose the line of thought... 4 times now. Life especially when you are remodeling the house you are moving in to during harvest season just keeps rolling right on top on you.Just a quick update... Carpenter just told Hubby that the painters should be done Thursday no later than Friday and he will start working on the floors as soon as they are done. He was walking through today trying to make sure EVERYTHING has been done and let Hubby know we will be off the floors for around a week. SO tomorrow I will be walking through myself. Which means Hubby and I start on the basement cleaning, sealing and loading it in.I don't know why Charlotte has went from sitting in the front seat with us and sniffing the AC vent to laying on Wilbur and now Rascal who usually doesn't tolerate being laid on by anyone. Rascal had his head tucked into the back of the seat so he looks like a black blob.We go over to 209 to check what was done, what we need to focus on and it's just a way to stop and LOOK instead of tunnel vision of doing mostly on Sundays but have on Saturdays.We have a morning glory growing on the back fenceWe have a vine coming out of the compost, think watermelonour grapes are almost ripe.I have a year's supply of corn for us and am now working on corn for Daughter4.I'm glad the zucchini being given to me comes in a bag and not the box like the corn is....We are now having tomatoes coming in from 209 gardens. I got 5 pints of sauce out of this batch. These are the field paste tomatoes I had last year and harvested the seed and then planted myself this year. I was glad to see it worked.The back storm door is onONCE AGAIN we have a broken door delivered...next one coming in is going to be delivered and installed by the Company.The one had the glass shatteredAND then we caught that the wrong door was put on one of the kitchen cabinets.Then Hubby put the stove in...for the propane test and the carpenter and him turned it on and sent me this pic.and I am like HUMMMM hey guys that's set up for natural gas, you have to change the orifices to propane.... ...there was 8 of them LOL... but they got it done and it looked like thisthe water softener is in and we got a thank you for choosing us letter . They delivery the salt, change filter and haul the trash away with them...good for our old age when looking at carrying 40 lbs salt bags.Head contractor let us know the company that was going to supply the counter top for the kitchen was giving him the run around so he went to another supplier of the same counter tops and got the estimate based on the same thing of the first one and the amount was doubled...found out the first company has been low balling estimates and then charging the real price at installation. New company reported them to supplier and our head contractor reported them to Better Business bureau and other contractors. MEAN time, the new company wanted us to come up and look at what the counter really would look like because we were told and shown it would be mid gray with rusty copper spots or swirls and that's not what it is as it's acid wash and there are white and light gray in it and it's not going to go with our kitchen. They showed us some others that would be close to what we had ordered when Hubby was looking at his boot and noticed the one sample tile close to the floor and he fell in love with it... so we ordered it instead... I love the sparkle.Carpenter wasn't happy with how the stair case stained and we batted a few ideas around and settled on thisFront room was primered... we actually loved the color and if we ever repaint it, it's going to be this color of gray.BUT for now it's crimson ...for Alabama State...roll tide roll LOL...Hubby's favorite team.Our head contractor liked our wheelchair bathroom paint so well , he used it in his own home and sent me this pic.ANDHubby got the back fence finished. He reused the fencing that was there (saving over $7000) and had plenty so the only expense was some zip ties to hook the chain link to the metal posts. Amish neighbor uses zip ties for goats and it hold them so we figured it would hold the 3 dogs. Still have to finish the front fencing.We will be sealing the basement next week and decided after we get that done to build something along this line (thanks to pinterest post) under the stairs that are a waste of space.Hubby took the this pic of me driving the tractor for the first time to bring his stuff up from where he was working on the fence. Will teach me how to mow with it next time.We went to a cook out at a friends house and they had a caddy for paper plates set out. I thought it would be nice for us for a regular dishes for just the two of us and went searching on line . Settled for this one as it can be taken apart and used differently for a buffet. I like things that do more than one thing.Then we went furniture shopping. We set the budget at $8000 for bought furniture and materials of anything we have to build aka closets ( this house as ZERO closets), roll cart for bathroom,bookcase for dining room etc. I have 3 bedrooms that I can not build closets in due to how the vents for heat/AC was ran. I have an entertainment cabinet Daughter2 gave me that was left at the place she moved in due to broken door that I can fix and turn in to a wardrobe. I have a clothes rack. I even bought a few new hangers to do thisI even did my summer dressed the same way.SO we went furniture shopping around and didn't find what we liked for the price we wanted to pay so went back to the local store that had a sale going on..... We got the couch and swivel recliner that my girlfriend and I saw and thought Hubby would like also... which he did.  The original price of the couch was thisWe paid $949.95...yes...$1000 OFF. Matching swivel recliner was $749.95, we paid $499.95.We priced 2 stools for the peninsula, $279.95 for each stool, found the same stools with a \"bar like\" table. Was $499.95 , bought for $269.95. less than the price of 1 stool that was exactly like what we priced.We came up with several ideas for the now \"extra\" table.The guy waiting on us remembered me saying something about no closets when I was in with my girlfriend and he had 2 wardrobes, $249.95 each, bought for $209.95 each.We need something in the wheel chair bathroom, laundry room and kitchen.Been looking at roll carts but they haven't been the style we want or were more than we will pay. They had one that will go in any of those area, $549.95 bought for $299.95.Was walking around and found end tables the exact thing I was been hunting for  $279.95, bought for $149.95.I bought a small china hutch that I was going to sand and redo as I don't care for the yellowish orange it is at a thrift shop for $30.. not thrilled with the lay out etc...but knew I was going to need something for the good dishes.Son 2 would love to have it redone for HIS house but didn't take it since I needed it and he only wanted it.I saw 2 china hutches...one oak bigger than what I have and one cherry, bigger than the oak that was my dream come true...Hubby prefers oak but wanted the style of the cherry. Both are discontinued so we couldn't order it in oak. Hubby wasn't thrilled with me buying the cherry one until I showed him the original price...$2499.95...sale price was $999.95...Hubby offered $899.95 (thinking they wouldn't take the offer as it was the price of the smaller oak) and they accepted.... saving US  $1600. Son 2 can chose how he wants the thrift shop one redone.We bought the best protection for the furniture and they gave us a $40 break on the delivery charge as we are outside their regular delivery area and charge $2/mile.Total saved $3078.64. and we still have about $3700 in the furniture budget for mattress, box springs, book cases etc.I am wrapping fragile items with cloth napkins, clothes and towels. Placemats are going between plates... Son2 saved up a pickup truck load of boxes from his Home Chef orders and work for me to come get since I need to take stuff to Daughter4 anyways.We got home Sunday evening from 209, the boys(Wilbur and Rascal) decided to go in the house and snooze awhile while Hubby and I sat outside and watched Charlotte run around...Here is Hubby who didn't know I have my phone on camera modeand here is where Charlotte went toShe is watching the pigs. Landlord's oldest son has cattle and pigs in the barn. He built the pigs area so his kids couldn't climb in it , which means Charlotte can't either or she would be in there. She goes in the the older steers and the calves all the time. She found out she can stand or lay on the hay and watch the pigs.Back to packing for me...Blessed Be"},
{"title": "3rd week of July and being frugal", "date": "Sunday, July 22, 2018", "text": "Just a ramble each day so I could remember by the end of the week.Sunday I was given zucchini  and sweet corn to process for pantryI was given a red tomato for our salad and a green tomato that was fried for the next night's dinner..I loaded our box trailer and we took it to 209 when we went over to check on other stuff. Hubby brought it home the next day after he went over to work on moving fence posts and I stayed home to deal with corn and zucchini.MondayI went and got canning jars and saved $ 4/ case between coupons and sale.I stopped at CVS and got Hubby's allergy meds and saved $12 between the coupon, sale and Extra Buck rewards.FridayI went to the grocery store and saved 31% plus got double fuel points.I bought my soon to be granddaughter a gift card for Target her favorite store at Kroger's and got double fuel points. Score for both of us.We used half of my Kroger fuel points  on gas,I have $1.20 but you can only spend $1 off per gal so Hubby used 60 cents saving the rest for the next fuel up in town.SaturdayWe have used Gas Buddy to find the cheapest gas when we were at 209.Using the herbs I have grown I mixed a batch of Italian seasoning.We split a sandwich and drink while working at 209 and came home earlier than usually for dinner.Dinner is what ever veggie I am processing with what ever is quick. By time we get to dinner time neither of us has much energy for even eating.THINGS I FORGOT Hubby was given a coupon for 50% off for the local pizza shop so he got calzones that provided us with 2 meals.(Tuesday)Hubby reserved his flight and rental car for his trip of deep sea fishing with his friend for next month. He checked several different places and compared it to cost of driving including wear and tear of car before deciding to fly. He used our AARP and his Enterprise discounts to get a price lower than what the gas would be. He reactivated his Delta sky miles card that his employer had got him when he was flying south for a couple years several years ago .His friend is using his discounts to get the hotel. This is his \"retirement\" gift from me and his friend but they are thinking it could become a yearly get together for them. Our son gave us his old carry on bag as he is now required to use his military one when traveling for work.(Tuesday)I super glued the end of my \"paint\" shoes so I wouldn't catch that little piece and trip and fall. (Wed)Our head contractor okayed us throwing our old paint in the dumpster he has at 209, we weren't sure if it was for hazard waste and it is. Saved us close to $100 extra , of course we are already paying for the dumpster anyways but sometimes a construction dumpster does not allow hazards like paint or asphalt roof shingles.(Wed.)The contractors working on the house have turned off the AC when it is cooler out side and the humidity is low enough for paint to dry. They only turn it on when the humidity is over 60 % .(all week)A sub contractor damaged one of the doors on the kitchen cabinets and they installed the pipes to the sinks wrong. I filed a complaint with the head contractor, the carpenter that was there reported it also. Sub contractor is now paying for repairs and the fix for the plumbing plus he gave us 5% off his final bill.Head contractor told me most wouldn't have bothered to say something to him so he could get it fixed, would have just bad mouthed both the sub contractor and him. (Thurs)On the not so frugal side of money but frugal side of time, I bought the ingredients prepared for a cook out instead of preparing them myself. The recipes I choice were based on the fact there are food allergies and diabetes concerns at this cook out. Saved me 2 hrs of prep time.(Sat)SundayI made 123 pasta ...one onion, 1 cup of meat,2 cups of veggies and 3 cups of pasta. It made enough for us to have 2 meals from it with the 2nd one being a reheat.Our neighbor at 209 gave us more corn to process for the pantry.A friend gave us some fruit salad she made that they weren't going to get ate. We had it with corn on the cob, cheese and crackers and called it dinner.The company that is installing our water softener offered to change the plumbing so we are only softening what is being used in the house instead of all of it. The sub contractor thought he had it so we would only be doing the house but the softener can't be installed where he thought it could. They said they weren't going to charge us for the change because they told him how to set the plumbing.The guy doing the installation let us know today as he thought he could be there to install Monday but it looks like next week now as he needs some things to come in first."},

Won't have hot water , so will be taking showers at in laws that's a lot closer than where we live. Barn has electric and running cold water, we have the out house if we can't use the inside bathrooms that are FINISHED.Wall paint (taking 4 coats) and floors (2 coats of stain, 2 coats of polyurethane) and it's not drying as quick as it would if the humidity was down.Crown moulding is doneBathroom is done...yeas the tape has been removed LOLWheelchair bathroom is done. Tape removed alsoLaundry room had 1st coat of paint and will be getting the floor laid as soon as the other coats of paint dries. Bedroom is done except for the floor.Hubby has been moving fence posts so we can put up the fence for the dogs. I started painting them...6 hrs and no where near done and I can be honest in saying that I can barely walk today as I have not did that many squats in YEARS.This is a section that will be on the dogs side of the fence so I painted it also...made the rest of the fence around the pond look like crap.Here is the pile of fence I need to paint so Hubby can put them on the posts.This is were I just started before the work day ended.Carpenter was staining the east loft when we were leaving Thursday. He was hoping to get another coat on today and start polyurethane coats Monday.We meet with the head contractor Monday afternoon. He had to change supplier for the counter top. Sent us what he was looking at ordering from a more responsible (his words) dealer.Hubby decided to move us Aug 1st ,even if that means into the barn. We can take showers at his parents that are closer and cut out 2 hrs of driving for each of us by doing so. A little bit of a push to do that but that would give me a solid month to clean Staley and get my rhubarb and flowers dug up.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Short..frugal moments", "date": "Monday, July 16, 2018", "text": "Every 3rd day Hubby takes a trailer load of our stuff to 209 as he is working on fence line. Since he is going that way it's saving us on the amount of trips when we can actually move in...waiting on wall paint to be done so they can to do wood floors.Neighbor at 209 has sent home beets and zucchini again and told us to check the sweet corn , it's almost ready.Landlord let us know to come get sweet corn as his father in law planted 2 varieties, one early and the other one later but they came in at the same time and everyone is swamped with trying to get it dealt with.I have been decluttering, sorting and packing daily to file the trailer every third day.I got the two bathroom doors for 209 done.We went looking for a recliner for Hubby and a new couch... found 1 we both like and can sit comfortably on AND it's on sale until the end of July. SO we will wait until closer to the end of the month so MAYBE we will be getting ready to actually move in   SIGH... Our head contractor is more frustrated than we are because he has other jobs lined up and less workers to work on them since they are still working on our place."},

I would like to have more zucchini but I am not going out to get a lot more, just enough to try another recipe I ran across that makes is taste like pineapple.Jade green beans, I got enough to process for us to have plenty for the year and a couple meals as fresh.Roma green beans, a wide green bean that I use for one pot green beans, ham and potatoes. I have enough for the year also.Candy onions, we gave one box to a friend as each box is 10 lbs. I have enough onions for 2-3 months.I have to find out where the local extension office is to take in a bit of my grapes which seem to have a problem they didn't have last year.We went to see Daddy who was on the tired side as he had joined a group exercise instead of a morning nap.Wilbur and Rascal sitting at my feet while I watch Charlotte to make sure she stays in the yard.This is Charlotte's \"I won't do it again\" after she was let out of her cage after a 15 minute time out for taking off AGAIN.  Wilbur \"told\" on her and Rascal chased her back out of the field to the house. Doesn't she look so sweet and innocent ?Hubby worked the \"pit\" at the fireworks so I stayed home and watched the ones that were shot off by the little village up the road from us.Weather has finally cooled off, turned off AC, opened windows (almost kicked furnace on when it dropped to 55 in the morning) and enjoyed the good breeze while I put polyurethane on the bathroom doors for 209. I need one more good day to finish the second door.Used gas buddy and Kroger fuel points for cheapest gas."},
{"title": "209 update", "date": "Monday, July 2, 2018", "text": "Head contractor is still saying July 15th for it to be finished... carpenter and painter are saying when the paint and then floors dry. HVAC is done, electric is being finished today. Plumbing will be when the dishwasher, sinks and toilets are installed AFTER the paint dries . Floors are sanded and covered until painting is done and then they will be finished. The basement is suppose to be ready for us to clean and seal. We had 7 inches of rain last week at 209 and there is a little bit of water from the outside door so that has to be changed so it doesn't happen again.Here is the pics.First is \"I blew a gasket\" because I was told the cold air return duct would take about a drawer space out of my cabinet IF the kick plate wasn't enough. HVAC contractor took half the cabinet and then didn't want to box it off so I could keep the rest of the cabinet from being covered with dog hair etc. Like I paid $400 for his return ...and I knew he could have done it a lot differently. Head contractor and carpenter saved him from me ripping his head right off his shoulders and came up with a compromise. Funny how he only needed 8 inches and it could be boxed in.I love my cabinets, were expensive but will hold up for decades .The empty spot is where the dish washer goes. The white vent will be painted but that's the only color that size comes in.Carpenter and Hubby hung my chandelier and then decided it was too low and raised it. Like someone is going to walk on my counter to hit their head? Hubby did say he had to lean almost to the middle of the cabinets to get his head in the picture.Kitchen sink light is in . They are hanging the pot rack light that goes over the stove today.bedroom ceiling fan done.Laundry room lightbathroom ceiling light. Painter stood in tub and held up a drop cloth where the shower curtain would be so the electrician could put the light so it shown in the tub but not interfere with the shower curtain. They said their wives complain about a lack of light to shave their legs... Hubby just laughed because I do that also. Won't have that problem now.Wheelchair bathroom light was done the same.south loft lights donenorth loft lights (and skylight) donethis is the wood we had the skylight boxed in with since there is about 3 ft from the skylight to the ceiling in that loft.east loft lightsstaircase light between east and west lofts. The north and south lofts don't have a light due to no place to install one. We will figure something out.west loft lightfront room is oakthe dining room and mud room is white(aka sugar )maple , the kitchen , hall and bedroom are red maple.the east and west lofts have red maple.Both bathrooms, laundry room, north and south lofts have to have floors replaced so we are using Sterling oak vinyl planks that are water resistant installed. Still looks like gray wood. Pictures to come when they get to that part.Hubby is still working on moving fence posts to move the fence. Front porch floor needs repainted LOL.Last time we updated the to do list, it was done from 600 plus to 350.Our plans are to be moved by end of Sept if not sooner.for no other reason than something to smile about.It's for the laundry room at 209.My 4 legged babies.Rascal being afraid of the storms rolling through during the night.Wilbur standing guard over Charlotte, he thinks of her has his baby.Charlotte looking back at off while she's on the front porch. I am standing in the house in the dining room looking out the window. It just happened that was the last time she was allowed out by herself as she is now trailing bunnies and birds through the corn fields and not able to find her way back home. No way for us to find her while she's in the field either. SO Hubby and I take turns of who goes out with her. Side benefit is both of us are \"slowing\" down in the evenings to got out and sit and watch her . She's doing better after this last time but not trusting her. Be glad when we move as there will be a fence around the plus acre for her to run and not get lost in a field or on the road.I'm not sure what type of grapes they are, this heat has been taking it's toll on them . Rain came in yesterday so that helps some.I went to the store....by myself and Hubby was shocked. I haven't been shopping for much, we aren't eating much. A neighbor of 209 gave us some tomatoes and green tomatoes on Friday. But there is a good size hole in 2 freezers and one frig was almost completely empty. They...meaning the head contractor is HOPING to be done with 209 by mid July which means we need to pick up the speed of getting the fence moved so we can haul dogs over with us and let them run around (instead of a 20 x 40 ft area fenced off with the barn open for them to go in out of the sun).SO I need meals that can keep us healthy (lecture from Doc) and not weigh us down but not salads a lot to trigger my tummy issues.Spent $456.96...saved $147.36  of almost 31% savings... got $1 off 35 gals of fuel for another savings of $35.What is on the menu:egg muffins (Kevin Jacob's blog, some frozen for later,  bfast/lunch/supper)Chicken Kiev (not rolled just butterflied)meatloaf in muffin tins(some frozen for later)Country fried Steak (Hubby loves it for a weekend bfast , might make extra for freezer)Roasted chicken followed  by chicken and rice casserole.Chicken saladPhilly cheese steak meatloaf (half sliced and frozen )Shredded beef , broccoli stir frycauliflower steakspork chopsribsground turkey Asian lettuce cupsHamburger pattiesMini (bfast) sausage patties on slider bunsCucumber, cream cheese sandwichesI have strawberries, rhubarb(in my patch here), watermelon, honeydew, pineapple and cantaloupe.I have potatoes to make potato salad, potato presse (recipe from Son 2 Home chef) and mashed potatoes, and mashed potato patties.I have sweet potatoes to make baked sweet potato and sweet potato wedges.I bought different lettuces, kale, spinach etc for salads and cooked greens (boy do I miss my gardens)Green tomatoes to fry, red tomatoes to go with cucumber and onions, and carrots to shred for sunshine salad(orange jello) I HIT THE SALESPASTA, I had coupons for $2 off of 3 or 4 and had several coupons. Kroger's had a pasta sale, buy 4 save .... I came home with 30 lbs of pasta for $11.70GARLIC POWDER. Not something I use a lot of as I grow garlic but I didn't grow as much this year since I knew we would be moving. I will run out about December so I got what was on sale that I can use when making pasta sauce instead of my fresh garlic.10 for $10COFFEE, Hubby drinks 3 times as much coffee as I do and we don't drink the same type (he drinks BOLD) I had coupons for 2 cans so picked them up as Kroger's had a sale. Ended up being half priced.FROZEN CHICKEN BREAST, on sale and I had 2 coupons, usually $9.99 I got for $4.99CHEESE on sale with couponsANCHOVY PASTE in tube...clearanceTOMATO PASTE in tube ...clearancePUFF TISSUES .... on sale with coupons and I was completely out due to allergies for both of us. I would hate to think how bad they would be without our meds.BACON...on sale with couponsMUFFIN MIXES...on sale with coupons. I don't normally buy muffin mixes but at this point even thinking about making anything from scratch is pushing the limits of my energy which was already low before the antibiotics that causes sever fatigue.SODA POP...on sale with coupons and I buy the drinks for the family reunion that is in Sept. I always get the drinks around July 4th when the prices are low and combine them with coupons. For the last 3 years I've been able to get all the drinks (including 3 cases of bottled water) for less than $25 for 50 -75 people.FOR FREE...olive oil, balsmatic vinegar, 64 oz diet cranberry mix juice, energy drink, 2 pkgs of Always underwear, Hefty slider bags, Klondikes, flatbread,loaf of bread, bibb lettuce and 2 bags of frozen corn.For the next 2 days I will be prepping everything as much as possible to take the\"what's for dinner when we get home\" and \"it's too hot to cook\"  out of our lives for a few weeks.Blessed BeSwelting is the term Daddy uses. Said it was a combination of sweating and melting. If it was after July 22 I would say the dog days of summer which runs from July 22 to Aug 22. I really hope it's just early and not that it's going to get worst at the end of July.We have taken to opening the doors before 7 am to get fresh air in the house and closing it back up by 9 am. Curtains are drawn across the tops and binder clipped to keep the sun out  with sheers shading the bottom so we get light and don't have to turn on lights. We took down the chandelier in the dining room (needed to take it to 209 anyways) and installed the old ceiling fan. We have to keep it on low or it triggers the gauge to the ac as it blows air there. Won't have that issue at 209 as our electrician made sure that issue wouldn't happen when he installed the thermostat.The grill is at 209, I doubt if  either of us would go out to cook on it after being outside most the day in the heat anyways. I've been fixing quick foods that can be reheated in the microwave for a couple meals. We don't care much for sandwiches. Frankly neither of us care to eat at the end of the day between being hot and tired. Hubby will grab a salad but I can't always eat salad due to my Crohn's. Couple suppers have been ice cream with fruit.I mended some shirts and a couple pair of work jeans for Hubby.I change the dogs water 4 times a day.I washed clothes with homemade laundry soap and vinegar for the softener. Still not using the clothes line as they are back to working on the road in front of us.  I do put the dryer on sensor and wash and dry the heaviest first so if it's not dry the first load it can be tossed in with the second load. What ever isn't dry in the last load goes on the drying rack.Hubby has quit needing a light on in the kitchen during the night when I leave the dining room curtain open at night. I close them at night as people from a mile away can see in if there is lights on in the house and they are driving down the road.Its a window that faces the away from the road so unless they are coming down the lane they can't see in.We have been going to bed by 9 (so no lights and the ac isn't as cool as during the day) and up by 4-5 am. Under doctor's orders I rest between 1 -3 in the afternoon.I continue to sort and pack for 209. I am using used cardboard boxes and Rubbermaid totes bought on sale at Home Depot by Son 2 using his military discount. The totes are for things that will be stored in the barn loft like Christmas stuff and out of season items.I've been searching for winter curtains for 209... I am not willing to pay $100 for 1 set of curtains so I will be finding material and making my own. The windows are not regular sized windows but not something we will be replacing this year.  I have curtains for the lofts as Son 2 gave me his old curtains that he didn't use any more. I am going to line them for winter.Only 12 more windows to figure something out.Hubby is doing a lot of outside work moving fence, dealing with the gardens, the pond etc over at 209. Gas Buddy and Kroger fuel points has been a lot of help on saving on gas. We are still under budget for that area.When we go to town we combine errands. I had a last minute doctor appt (thank you sinus infection heading in to strep) so pit stopped on the way home at the store to do a partial shopping. We did the rest of the shopping the next day as I had to go back in to get my meds for the infection.I would admit our meals have been BLAH... and that is something that bugs me (I am a chef after all) so Son 2 that started Home Chef has taken to sending me a picture of his meal (he eats the 2nd serving as his lunch) every night and I share it with Daughter 4. Who is a great cook and at the BLAH stage as she is single again and the kids are with their dad.He is plating them according the the directions... SO I am sharing them with you. He does add a side of fruit. Says he is eating healthier as he is getting more veggies in and actually is saving money of $5 a day from lunch and the $100 of food he was throwing out every 2 wks as it got bad before he got it ate.They include the recipes so he can make it for others if he wants or if it's not on the menu that they change weekly.Blessed be"},
{"title": "209 and frugal ", "date": "Monday, June 25, 2018", "text": "I haven't been to the store to buy any groceries.I used a volunteer lettuce plant from 209 and lettuce from the neighbor to make Kevin Jacob's lettuce soup. I cut the recipe in half, served it hot the first night, Hubby said it tasted like green potato soup to him, and cold the next day.I could taste the lettuce better when cold but liked it both ways.I fried a green tomato a friend gave me and potatoes and served applesauce for a light dinner.Made potato presse (recipe from Home Chef that son2 got as he is using that service and LOVES it)  double the recipe son got (his service is for 2 even though he is single,uses the other serving for his lunch). I doubled it so I could have leftovers for Wed as we will be on the road between doctor appts and ordering the windmill for the pond. Son2 said it reheated nicely in microwave on 50% power for a minute or two.I found a box of 30 dinner sausage patties that was froze solid together. So I cooked them ALL and then refroze the leftovers after dinner on a cookie sheet so I could bag them and then pull what I want for fast meals.I have to make a grocery list tonight, basic produce is needed, chicken as Hubby wants some chicken salad, bread and milk, not sure what until I finish making the menu.As for 209... we walked through on Sunday, crossing our T's and dotting our I's and found 2 switches and 6 outlets were not installed...Got a hold of the head contractor by email (he has his email on his phone) who forwarded to the sub contractor who admitted he just ripped his son's head(co owner of business) BECAUSE he was there on Friday and was suppose to check and make sure everything was correct. Son admitted he forgot to take the paperwork but did look around and noted 3 of the outlets weren't done.  HEAVENS.They already got a guy there (not the son as he is now doing crap duty.instead of one of the employes SNICKERING..unplugging a customer's sewer line as they do electric/plumbing and HVAC) and the guy at 209 that is no longer on the crap duty job also noted to Hubby that he thought he could do all of it if Hubby could help him run the one line. We have no problem helping.We cleared an area (again) for us to take stuff over that was packed...and the contractors took over it for their painting and building odds and ends. SIGH. Can't complain as they moved it to the barn so the ones sanding the floor wouldn't have to stop and wait on them.Front room floor is oak, dining room floor is maple, kitchen floor, hall and bedroom is pine.This is where the maple (came from our land)meets the pine.Can't wait to find out what the two rooms over the front room are. I am willing to guess the hall and the bedroom are pine since the original owner, a young man of 18 when he built the house, put the kitchen in.  The front room was put in by an Amish owner. He cut down oak trees in the pasture and made the floor boards.Front room oak floor sandedThis is the wood that the north loft skylight is being boxed in with.It will also be the bottom of walls in the south loft.They have the 2 access doors that will allow us to have a separate shut off for the showers done and ready to installand finally.... so floors,ceilings and walls can dry... the AC is in and running when needed.The contractors are turning it on when they leave and then off when they get in. They set it at 74 which is a good temp for paint and polyurethane .We put a portable AC in the loft where the carpenter is working on the skylight as he needs it during the day. Said it was a good thing we did as he got stuck in the tresses while boxing in the skylight (he said his size 14 feet got caught) and one of the other contractors went to see what he was banging on so much. They got him out and then stayed with him while he finished that area (they joked he was building his own casket but they didn't think we wanted to pay for it for him.)He said it wasn't bad because he at least didn't get over heated and pass out or have heat stroke which can happen in those areas because we had turned the AC on the night before so it would be cool when he arrived in the morning and wouldn't have to wait for it to cool that area.I started putting polyurethane on the bathroom doors and then had to take it off the first door and drag both doors in the house in the AC due to the wood had drew so much moisture from the air the polyurethane wasn't not drying at all. House stunk for a couple days until the humidity dropped enough I could get the house opened up and the first door back out the garage to get it finished. I will start the second door later this week as I see rain in the forecast tomorrow and it takes a good 3 days from start to finish on the doors of dry weather.They keep telling us July 15th if everything dries and the kitchen counter gets in.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "8 days of frugal", "date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2018", "text": "We made a milestone on 209 and celebrated by eating the special at the local restaurant , the special was a rib eye steak . We brought half the steak home and a baked potato and used it in another two meals. The rest of the meals came from the pantry/freezers.I went to the store and used coupons and sales for the odds and ends we needed...really odds LOL orange and lemon frosting for the cupcake mixes I had and some plain white to make \"lime\" frosting for the cupcake mix and cookies.That I made for the Father's Day cookout on Hubby's side on Sunday.I took some to Daddy for his Father's day. We split the day between the two dads saving gas.We used Gas Buddy app on our phones to find the cheapest gas where ever we are. We are driving to 209 or somewhere else for appts or supplies almost daily.I harvested rhubarb, strawberries and cherry tomatoes from gardens. The neighbor at 209 canned me more strawberry pie filling and strawberry jam and let me know the strawberries were almost done and gave me 3 heads of summer lettuce(aka Iceberg) . The seller of 209 wife gave us a tomato and green tomato when we stopped to drop off some mail that had came to us instead of them. She also told me where she got the heavy fabric that she had made curtains with that kept the cold out very well so I can check that out to see if I can find fabric cheaper than what it would take to buy new winter curtains as I am not finding anything insulated at thrift shops or yard sales.We picked up somethings off what we call the buying punch list (punch list is what contractors call the finishing list)at Menards with the 11 % rebate. Carbon/smoke detectors and a clock for the kitchen and one for the front room as the ones we had died, and furnace filter for 209 and dog food for here.We are working in 103-110 heat index weather. Drinking tons of water and eating a decent lunch from either the local store or Chinese buffet. we prefer the store as most times we can split the meal or bring it home.Suppers are next to nothing...maybe a salad,eggs or a wrap of leftovers. Soup has been a regular even though Hubby doesn't like much soup.The AC is running here, I do open the windows and doors in mornings , especially before the sun rises, curtains shutting out the sun in afternoons and late evenings as we have a picture window facing west. One ceiling fan and two other floor fans run. The one in the front room is on low all the time as it's right in front of the vent that air is doesn't \"drift\" out into the room.After putting the fan there I found we could raise the AC temp by 3 degrees. THAT being said... 209 will have ceiling fans in the dining room, front room and bedroom. The AC is installed (will be ran for the painters otherwise not on) but all the crews have mentioned if they keep the doors/windows shut on East side the house but open the west side in the morning, the house is cool. Then they shut the west side at 11 and open the east side , the house stays around 80 even when it was 100 outside. Humidity is an issue with trying to get things to dry.I trimmed my hair. Washed laundry in homemade soap and used dryer sensor for drying. Hung a few things off and on this week on the drying rack. Made gallons of unsweetened ice tea to go with the gallons of water we are drinking.Hubby has taken to shutting the TV off within 30 min after he goes to bed and not leaving his computer on all the time.Bought work jeans for Hubby for $10 each instead of the normal $30. Found all weather dresses and skirts on clearance for myself.Back to packing for the move which is suppose to be in 4 weeksBlessed Be"},
{"title": "209 update", "date": "Saturday, June 16, 2018", "text": "They did the ceiling with what they call knock down .... and then had to REDO the ceilings as it wasn't as dry as they thought and it messed it up ...Knockdown texture is created by watering down joint compound to a soupy consistency. A trowel is then used to apply the joint compound. ... The trowel is then run over the surface of the drywall, knocking off the stalactites and leaving the mottled finish. Think orange peel or golf ball dimples . This is what it looked like when it wasn't dry when they \"knocked it down\"  and this is what it looked like when it was dried the walls and floors are covered while they are doing the ceilingsthe water to the hot water heater is donethe electric in the basement(the last to be ran) is doneand they have started running all the vents to the rooms from the furnace The floor has been patched and is ready for sanding but since they have it covered due to ceiling work I couldn't get a picture of it.This week they are suppose to have the last of the vents in. The final outlets and switches in and sanding of the floors OR painting of the rooms.... they are trying to decide which way the mess will be less LOL.The kitchen cabinets are in the barn LOL...they would love them to be in by this coming week so they can get the counter tops ordered as they take 3 weeks at least to get in and Head contractor is pushing for July 15th.We straightened up the areas in the barn that is being used to storage, couple of the contractors mentioned it seemed almost empty.I would have to say that from my 1st project binder there is little that has been changed and what was changed was for the better except this....This was suppose to left open, it's the wall of the tub attached to the bathroom wall... I was going to build a shelf for this now useless spaceof 2 ft up, 3 ft deep and 10 inches wide for the bulk toilet paper and then a pantry rolling cart to slide under the shelf...  I'm not sure what to do about it now as it's even too low to put the cart in it. We are meeting this coming week about how to deal with it. I would hate to rip it back out plus the ceiling section didn't get done in that area so Hubby suggested enclosing it but it's such a waste of space when I have no \"floor\"space for storage due to needing the area for wheelchair to be able to turn around.  Guess we will  see how it comes out."},
{"title": "Frugal in the kitchen (small 209 update)", "date": "Sunday, June 10, 2018", "text": "209 update... they are have primered the entire 1st floor and the only thing left to primer is the door to the lofts in the kitchen and that stairwell. The ODOR takes my breath away so I won't be in the house much when over there. Ceiling is suppose to be done next. Head contractor was hunting down my kitchen cabinets that hadn't came in Wednesday like they were suppose to.I bought  3 thin steaks that were marked down, marinaded them in coke a cola and then sliced thin with bell peppers, onions and mushrooms for a Philly steak sub one night, stir fry the second night and the next will be a soup as what I trimmed from the steaks I simmered and then strained for broth. That's for tomorrow night and I might add a can of black beans to it if it seems on the thin side of soup.I bought a pork loin and was going to cut 4 pork chops from for tonight's dinner, and put  what is left of the loin will go in the crock pot on Wed. When I opened the package I found it smelled horrible and immediately called the store as it was NOT expired. They credited me for the cost and added a bit more for the inconvenience. So Hubby dug through the kitchen frig while I dealt with that and pulled out the 2 hamburgers I have cooked last week to go with mac and cheese and a veggie along with the last of the strawberries I picked from 209.My niece that just graduated was telling me at her party that she takes either left over chicken or pork and shredded it to put over tortilla chips with nacho cheese (optional lettuce, onions and tomatoes) for a quick meal. She has taken over the kitchen a lot since she was looking at going to college out of state , her parents insisted she know how to cook from scratch and run a budget for a home. She is staying at home for the next year as she took college classes during high school and found she can get her BA degree in a year if she stays in the same college. She is in robotics and has already done some work for a local company that offered to hire her but wasn't willing to work with her going to school like she wanted. Felt at this stage of the game remaining at the job she is working at and living at home and attending school full time on a scholarships and grants was smarter.I cleaned out Baby, the 7 cu ft deep freezer. We are completely out of corn...sigh.That's a good 6 wks. away of being in. We need NO bacon, bulk or smoked sausage or ham bones or peas/peas and carrots. I've yet to figure out why there was 4 wadded up brown grocery bags and an empty box at the bottom of that freezer.We started cleaning the pantry, one it's over due and two is to see what I must can or what we need to eat up and not get any more of. I acknowledged that I did can an \"extra year's\" worth to cover us this fall because I figured we wouldn't have a garden with planning to move... I didn't plan on us to almost stop eating from the pantry.I have a good 6 months extra in most things that I shouldn't have.I have 11 of these units.Three of these units have dry goods or store bought can goods that I just got for the \"tornado\" season that has arrived. So they were easy to straighten and check if everything was good. I went through 5 of them today checking lids on the home canned jars and  moving the oldest to the front so it's used up and what needed tossed.I also noted what we were not eating... dill pickles and hot salsa that only Hubby eats and must have stopped completely (it's his middle of the night when he used to eat lunch snack). Fruit... makes me scratch my head over that overage.Hubby used to drink 1 gal. of juice a week and now it's maybe 1 qrt. a week if that. We haven't been eating pancakes,waffles and French toast on a regular bases and it shows in the amount of different syrups and pie fillings I have on hand. I didn't bake pies last Tday dinner or cakes  or at Christmas and that shows by the abundance also.We need to eat at least 24 qrts. of chunky applesauce before apple season. Or I won't be canning any of that either.If I only use spaghetti sauce (red sauce here as my Nonna was Italian and from the old country) every  3rd week we will make it until tomatoes are on again to make sauce with.  I don't need to make pizza sauce, enchilada sauce or tomato juice this year. Diced tomatoes if I have enough tomatoes for sauce will be wanted.I have enough veggie soup, chicken potpie filling, canned turkey and canned  broth for this year until after Tday. Since we aren't doing much of a garden I might have room in the freezers to put the broth instead of canning it.SO my thoughts on this line is .... everyday cottage cheese , applesauce (Hubby only eats cottage cheese with fruit on it), dill pickles and beets on the table.EVERY NIGHT 2 jars/cans of fruit and 2-3 jars of veggies need to be brought up for meals the next day.Let's see how that one works.Blessed BeIt's seeing thisAnd knowing it's the answer to an area that is narrow in the bathroom that needs storage space at $75  BUT going out to the barn at 209 and rummage through the scraps and decided you can make it for the price of buy 4 wheels and use paint you already have.It's deciding to run a portable welder ( a need in the community so a part time/full time income) and double checking what Hubby has and what he will need to do a good job(including business requirements) and stay safe. AND then looking for it as auctions/garage sales and word of mouth before paying full price in the stores.It's about needing a narrow bookcase or something for the corner at the doorway to the staircase... right doorway of pictureand looking at what I have or what I can build before hiring someone else to make me something as it is a strange size and I am not making do for it's my dining room and a focal point when looking at this wall. I thought about floating shelves until I watched Charlotte pull on one that is upstairs. I do have a cabinet that might work but really wanted to use it in the one bathroom.It's about waiting until the floor is done (as it will have a new stain on it along with sealer) and kitchen cabinets (suppose to be on site this week but nothing is ever on time on this project) before choosing what to stain my china hutch that is a orange-ish yellow that I hate. I would rather paint it then look at it as it is.It's about sorting through EVERYTHING here including what is stored from the kids homes and only taking what we WANT not just pack it up and deal with it later. THOUGH that is tempting when it comes to the kids stuff and just letting them deal with it after we die ...except the one that would deal with it doesn't have anything here LOL. Trash guy probably hates me at this time as we are maxing out what we are allowed to put out each week. and I am now on a first name bases with the guy at the drop off for the thrift shop.It's about focusing on how to save money when we move, a more frugal lifestyle to stretch the retirement funds out more. It was suggested we sell extra garden at the auction we buy from... that is a maybe. Hubby welding. I don't know how the internet is going to be so I am not counting on my surveys for anything.We changed to a joint checking account when our bank decided to start charging if you didn't have an automatic deposit into your checking. Hubby does, I don't. We went paperless so we don't have any fees for that.Might help me to only be dealing with 1 checking instead of two, since Hubby is gotten very good about receipts and he will only use duplicate checks.If it's not LED or can be changed to LED, the Christmas decorations won't be going with us. I already passed a lot of it to daughter 2 but I know I have more. All the lights have been changed to LED if they weren't already LED.Every appliances is energy savings.It's about thinking about habits...Hubby has gotten better about turning off lights and setting TV on timer to go off but leaves his computer on about half the time. He has gotten so he won't kick the AC on until it's over 80 instead of 74  and found (thanks to Daddy) that by turning on a fan where he is that he is comfortable enough without the AC. He has taken to opening the windows if he gets up before me. Closing the top of the curtains to keep the sun out when it's hot. We chose to put 3 ceiling fans in all with LED lights in 209.I still need winter curtains for 209.I do full loads (doesn't matter about the water but it costs electric wise each time the washer runs) of laundry and will with dishwasher when we move. I have to use the dryer here (and drying rack) due to construction on the road in front of us spewing dust everywhere. At 209 I won't have that issue  we are installing a new clothes line that is towards the back away from the road and there is already clothesline INSIDE the house as Amish don't use dryers . Ester even told me how long it would take to dry on the porch if it wasn't snowing or raining during other seasons and how long in the basement when it was snowing or raining.We went with gas instant ready water heater, gas cook stove and gas furnace. Saves on generator (fuel) when we have no electric for what ever reason. English neighbor told us 5 times last winter she was without power due to cars hitting poles.We bought a TV and radio tower so Hubby can get local stations and connect with his HAM radio so no cable TV to deal with.It's about planning more perennials in the flower and veggie gardens and more heirloom and less hybrid. Starting a compost area.Our biggest yet to be dealt with complete is the food storage/cooking etc. It's gotten funny that we will hear Malinda or one of the kids ring the bell for Eli to come in for lunch and we look at each other and decide on lunch. Since Amish don't do day light saving time it rings at 1 pm right now.Breakfast bell is at 8 our time.Still we know we want to grow and store most of our own food or know where it comes from, which means in season to eat or be processed. I want to go back to baking our own bread. Hubby loves bagels so he bought me bagel things that you put the dough on and boil then bake them on it so they are formed like store bought from King Arthur flour( not that I needed them ) to be supportive of me learning to do that. I have made English muffins, tortilla wraps, pita bread, naan bread, all sorts of bread loaves...bagels not on that list. Might be a Father's day gift since he will be gone all day the day before.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "another update on 209...Pictures from Hubby", "date": "Thursday, May 31, 2018", "text": "I am down with my back injections and stress fracture in foot. Hubby went over to 209 to check up on things and mow. He decided the best way to keep me DOWN was to send pictures..LOLHere is Hubby petting Charlotte with Rascal trying to get Hubby to throw the ball for him this morning while I was sitting with ice on my back.Here is the house from the lane.Here is the two sections they missed when roofing that the carpenter found when he was checking on the skylight. They were finished this morning.Here is the south garden and here is the north garden including weeds not pulled due to finally getting rain. Then he went in the house and answered tons of questions and finally just called me as he didn't think to take the house binder with him.Here is the mudroom. We decide based on costs to not redo the cistern so the hand pump at the sink will be removed and given back to the Amish seller.This is standing in the middle of the kitchen/dining room area looking back towards the mudroom... doorways are to mudroom, upstairs east and west lofts with the archway to the front room to the right of staircase door way just out of range of the picture.this is looking from staircase across the dining room,kitchen and down the hall to the laundry room.I love this , it really made a difference in light coming into that hall and into that section of kitchen. The frig will be to the right of this doorway.and the French doors that they are still working out if the company that made it is going to fix it or replace it as there is a crack in the door at the very top that came from the factory that way.Standing at the front room archway this will be the dining room window and past it to the kitchen door and south/north lofts staircase door.This is my dining room ceiling that had a huge crack across it that is now taken care of.This shows that dining room windows at another angle so you can also see my new sliding window that will be over my kitchen sink.This is Hubby's favorite as he can see the kitchen sink window and the kitchen porch door... I have the bistro table and 2 swivel rockers sitting on that porch that he takes his breaks at.This is the wall ALL the contractors tell each other to not even think of changing this wall layout. My pots and pans peg board on the left, outlet, gas range, outlet and light switches with a pot rack over the range...it really has been the only thing I am not willing to change.master bedroom off the left side of hall, the basement door is on the left side of the hall also but Hubby didn't get a take a picture of doors LOLLaundry room.... this is at that very end of the hallway. There is a doorway to the left of this picture that goes into the bedroom so it might end up being part closet. I am waiting until the washer and dryer are in before I decide that one.One side of the regular bathroom that is on the right side of the hall.My soaker tub/ shower combo. The gap between the wall and tub in first pic is getting a slim pantry shelving unit on rolls to help with storage. Hubby or I will build it as we think we have enough scrap to do so.one section of the front room, the drywall finisher wanted to know why there was so many holes on this wall...it was where the coat hooks hung for 18 people.Boy did the head guy get twenty questions over ordering a 1 piece wheelchair shower, they usually come in 4 sections. His thoughts were sturdy as Hubby is not light weight even though it's for me in the future and something the could last 20 years...great thought but it barely made in into the front room and they having to take the bathroom door frame out to get it in the wheelchair bathroom.Here is where that shower will go, water lines already ran.last picture I got this morning...this is the wheelchair bathroom , the wall where the sink will be. You can see the doorway we closed off that went to the mudroom. They were checking to see where to put the toilet as the place where it was scheduled to go would cut through a main beam of the floor so I don't want that... It has to be set so I can get to it easily with a wheelchair. Carpenter suggested I get a small makeup vanity that I can wheel up to in this room as there is plenty of space for it.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "So many changes ...", "date": "Thursday, May 31, 2018", "text": "that we feel like bouncing balls.We got the garden in which was mostly tomatoes  except for some chives, garlic chives and the berry bushes.. Hubby will do that this weekend as I once again have a stress fracture in my foot...same place as 2 other times, my bones in my feet are closer together than they should be and very small ( I wear a 3 in children's shoes) and am going in for back injections.At 209 I picked strawberries and cut rhubarb. Amish neighbor is going to pick the rest of the strawberries (her patch died and mine is going to rot before I get back due to back injections ). She is going to can (process) some of the berries in pints for us in exchange of giving her the berries.Hubby called about windmill with pond aerator. He will go up later to pay for it so it can be started.... He also called about a dry hydrant for the pond ...a dry hydrant is where the fire truck can hook their pumper truck and suck water out of the pond to fight the fire. We live out in the country so there are not water hydrants. Our neighbor 2 houses down has one and gave us who to get call to get that rolling. He called about getting the main line from the septic to the county tile cleared of tree roots... this is the 2nd time he has called this company. If they don't respond by Friday he will be calling another company that is one town over from us. Trying to keep things local but if they don't answer and don't call back from messages you really can't do anything else.Hubby is looking strongly at a portable welder, several of the Amish have asked him if he could provide this service for them as right now they are having to haul everything about 15 miles (usually hiring the transport of what ever) and the guy that was doing it retired. The welder he is looking at is at auction and has a diesel generator we could also use for the house. Especially since we have a 500 gal tank for diesel fuel , we could actually save money by having the diesel generator as we use street diesel (they have off road diesel fuel for a lot of farm equipment) and getting a diesel truck for Hubby after we move. He has several offers of hauling for people but needs  bigger truck... okay he needs a newer truck as this 1998 truck(2 engines and a transmission later) is a worn out baby and needs replaced... even as we have scheduled brakes to be put on it on Friday.We have been getting a lunch from the local store for our lunches when at 209. Hubby decided that he wanted to only buy one meal and split it but get a side salad or coleslaw to split also. I've great with that. It will save us money.We are \"snacking\" for our dinner/supper so I told him I wanted to prep things we could snack on that was healthy since we are just too tired to cook (sometimes too tired to eat) and ice cream from DQ or eating tortilla chips has been  the answer. Not a great way to keep up the energy we are burning.I've been to the store three times this month... and Hubby picked up milk and bread once... Still with paying for the eating out from the grocery budget we are still UNDER budget.I also cut rhubarb here and some garlic scapes.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "209 update", "date": "Saturday, May 26, 2018", "text": "Head construction company guy *head contractor* told me end of May the house would be finished... The he got informed by the carpenter that wasn't going to happen and the carpenter had him come down and see why not...I am glad I wasn't there when the butt kicking started.Last week I let Head contractor know that once again the same crew that he kicked butt was not showing up and it was really causing problems and SLOWING down the drywall crew.Twenty four hours later crew was in, forty eight hours later we had this:Yeah Hubby is drinking from an old garden hose. Then I did... didn't even taste like garden hose and oh yeah we both know that taste.and then we got the hand pump to the cistern working, not tasting that water...will need to have cistern pumped out and clean and rain spouting that doesn't let the birds play in it before we use it. hot water heater is on wall, not fully installed as it is gas.There is also the plumbing for the regular bathroom and tub/shower combo frame in started...bath/shower pic 1st, toilet drain hole 2nd and sink drain hole 3rdand alsoMy kitchen sink drain and plumbing.While Carpenter was waiting for this stuff to be done... he walked around and was checking the work that had been done and found these 2 sections of roof that was missed (including by us) and let the company know to send the roofers back.Then he started installing the storm doors. He got 2 out of the 3 done.Hubby borrowed the disk from the Amish neighbor  and finished working the south gardenThis has the strawberries ...you can barely see the edge of them in the upper left had corner...this garden is 120 ft long and 40 ft wide... We will be cutting it back to 80 ft long and 40 ft wide.  I would like to move the rhubarb into this area also instead of the middle of the yard. The other side where the asparagus is is 100 ft by 50 ft. We will be turning this to grass except where the asparagus is. Too many tree roots in the dirt.Hubby was there this mowing while waiting for the truck to deliver the deck stuff we ordered. Said he got it pretty much done, probably because he didn't have anyone stopping him to get answers LOL.We have a big pow wow with the Head Contractor on Tuesday afternoon so I am hoping the work continues as it has the last 3 days.Hubby received an award from the OH EMS Star of Life for helping save a coworkers life last year. Coworker had a massive heart attack...everyone else that was helping work on the coworker said the only reason the guy lived and recovered (is back to work ) is because of Hubby aggressively using CPR until the squad got there with the automatic chest compression system.I am blessed by this manSIGH... it has been a week...maybe two... geeze.The rule at this point is BEHIND... behind in 209, behind in housekeeping here, laundry here, meals, sleep...really sleep  as they brought pigs in and the dogs are jumping and barking when they hear the noises the pigs make and then Wilbur thinks he must charge the pigs and try to dominate them (the pigs are behind a fence he can not get through but he could get his nose bit off when he sticks it through the fence). SO Wilbur was on a shock collar... that died and now on a leash when he proceeded to knock me off my feet and bash my head into the door jamb because he tried to run to get to the pigs. At least I got to him before he could charge the pigs again. Looking to buy a new shock collar... maybe something for the massive headache I got but no concession or whip last.Windows 10 update and wiped out my computer including it's memory...Lucky I had posted Dad's 91st birthday picture here or I wouldn't have it. I usually back up once a month, got side tracked with everything. Friend that does a lot of computer work told me to back up on thumb drive every day and on external hard drive once a month.Computer guy can reinstall original Windows(Windows 8) but I would have to buy Windows 10 ... I'll take the freebie and use that computer for other things.Bought a computer (http://theprudenthomemaker.com/ bought this and thought it was good).Used some Amazon credits to pay for it.Everything was running behind due to a contractor on over load without enough man power to handle all the work he agreed to... Several powwows later and a big shove from the carpenter/drywaller/clean up with mess the other left behind guys ...things started rolling again... 209 update on other post. AND both of us are having to drive as one of us needs to stay and lock up as we had someone casing the place and Charlotte is still being caged and can only \"hold it\" 6-8 hrs... we lean towards 6 because of her being hyper. With 2 hrs of being driving time that's only 4 hrs work time. Between the two of us we can get in 8 hrs. WHICH is more work time than the other contractors except our carpenter and his helper...Hubby's truck is making a sound and we are hoping it's just dirt in the brakes.I've still not go my garden stuff in as I get started and I get motioned to come make a decision. Hopefully by next Saturday that will be done. I have 18 tomato plants and some herbs left to plant.Was suppose to install Son2 new kitchen sink last month, it's getting done this weekend. Was suppose to spend time with a friend at their RV last month, will be after we install Son2 kitchen sink on our way home.Another time of both of us driving due to long hours.I love to say we stayed frugal...the only frugal has been where we chose to eat with coupons, discounts and gift cards...except for the little grocery store near 209... Beef and noodles, mashed potatoes and roll for $6.99 that makes 2 meals is cheap."},
{"title": "update 209", "date": "Thursday, May 17, 2018", "text": "Carpenter ripped out this section yesterday so we will now be able to take a queen size bed and dressers up the stairs without issues. He is going to frame it in to look like the rest of the doorways.I have a couple choices with the space beside the door... a cabinet I already own or shelves built...either corner or like a book shelf. Since this is my dining room I can see building a bookcase for my cookbooks. While he was working on this he told me that it will be at least 6  weeks before HE is finished and isn't sure the paint or floors will be done for 2-3 weeks after that.He had a worker putting drywall in where they cut it out to put electric boxes so he could start \"mudding\" the drywall this week.Electrican got the front porch light done, he thought it went well with the house.All the ceiling lights have wires now..but now my north and south lofts floors look like this due to putting in ceiling lights. They were glad we were changing the floor anyways. Just another job for the carpenter unless Hubby or I get to it before him.This is the wiring still sitting in the basement waiting for the final wiring to the lofts,kitchen and pump house to be ran.This was delivered...and every single one of us wondered why they put it at an angle when there is a perfect place to set it straight and not take up almost all the parking area.This is our -$1.00 electric bill...which is definitely a  mistake but thought I would share it as it will probably never happen again LOL. We have a security light that is $10 a month not counting the electric that the contractors have used.and one last picture... I asked permission  and was given it as long as they weren't in the picture so I waited until my neighbors left for Church.  I am amazed of how the lady of the home gets everything clean,laundry done,  gardens taken care of, 3 meals and 3 snacks daily with 7 children under 9 yrs of age with NO electric or running water unless you count running to the hand pump and pumping it. Man of the house has a lot to take care also with cattle, horses, plowing, planting, roofing etc.The good news is....Carpenter told me to move anything that goes in the garden shed and barn now, deal with our plants, trees and fencing now. THEN the basement should able to have stuff moved in about 2 wks (thinks we can do the deck and porches then also)and the lofts AFTER the main floors have been sanded ...then we will be on hold until the floors are completely done.I was thinking of summer curtains being put up when we moved but since we are looking at August I think I will plan on winter curtains.Blessed be"},
{"title": "Frugal week and No pictures but update on 209", "date": "Monday, May 14, 2018", "text": "I used my Free Mother's day gift of 8x10 photo from Walgreens for this picture ad Hubby's parents and grandparents had a picture hanging in their homes of their farms when Hubby was growing up. I thought it would be a good gift to Hubby.I stopped in at Krogers and got asparagus (for daughter4 cookout for her son's birthday, was cheaper to buy them then take a trip over to 209) and strawberies and angel food cake for us for today (Mother's day). I used coupons and saved 1/3rd of costs. That's all I bought even though I would have loved to got some of the black bean hummus on sale with the coupon I had.Daughter4 sent back the belt I had lent her so I don't have to go buy another belt or jeans since I've lost inches playing outside with the 3 dogs, mainly Charlotte,I gave her several shirts I was not longer wearing and I got a picture from my granddaughter in one of them as she went through the shirts first and got several tanks so Daughter4 won't have to buy her any for summer.Hubby took some leftover fence down to Daughter4 and helped her build it with the wood she already had to block her dogs to the back so they would stay out of her garden pots and sq ft box at her trellis on the front porch.Since they were not able to move like they hoped to a bigger place with a bigger yard.He also put the dirt that was in the sq fts we tore up and took it to her. We won't be putting ours in until later this fall or next spring.Son2 came up Saturday bringing  a car load of boxes for me to use to pack in and paid for our meal to go out to eat as he was suppose to come up today but had a conflict that would have put him here after 6 pm.Then he noticed I have a china buffet in the garage that I intended to redo... he thinks he would like if for his own dining room..I told him he had a week to decide plus he offered to buy it...then he wanted the tables and chairs Hubby just bought at auction... I'm not sure I am willing to give those up.We used of Kroger fuel pts, and Speedway gift card for fuel this week.Didn't go over to 209 unless we were needed as there was nothing we could do or we would be in the way of the contractors. Head contractor (who owns the business) is pushing to have it COMPLETED by  FIRST WEEK of JUNE.Told neighbors and seller that they needed to harvest asparagus and rhubarb as we wouldn't be there for a week. Hubby stopped by when he was coming home from some other place and said the daughters of the neighbor were out picking both areas. GOOD.The one day we were there we used our coupons for DQ and I got my \"summer has started\" foot long coney (not many places around here do actual footlongs but do 2 hotdogs in 1 bun)I canned 7 pints of pickled asparagus, 7 pints of asparagus soup, 11 pints of strawberry rhubarb pie filling, 11 qrts of rhubarb pie filling and 8 pints of victoria sauce (rhubarb). We had asparagus and rhubarb at every lunch with what I harvested.Hubby dug up 2 maple tree starts that had been in the old sand box here and put them in pots to see if we can get them to grow a bit more before planting them over at 209.  There is another one right at the electric pole here he is going to try to dig up also but figures he will end up killing it.Hubby went to auction and got a $700 patio table, 4 rocker swivel chairs,umbrella and stand,along with  post hole digger and auger for the tractor for  a total of $418.28. that doesn't cover the table let alone the post hole digger.Our trailer that we haul anything and everything that's over 20 yrs old finally broke beyond repair .We use this 3-4 times a week plus Hubby has job offeres that require it also.Hubby found one on sale plus the price was getting ready to go up because cost of steel is going up with the next delivery of trailerstractor on old trailer... new trailer that it will fit on better.We went in to Menards to order the deck stuff on Wed.Solid part is where the French doors will be. Ramp will end at sidewalk to mudroom (AKA back door)We had an estimate awhile back and it was almost $9000. We changed the flooring part to a textured compost, less chance of slipping when wet and what fasteners we were going to use and dropped the price below $6500. Sales person suggested we wait until this week to order is as the 11% sale would start again today.I started a chuck roast I had got on sale last week for today's meal... I plan to take part of it for meals later this week of  beef, bell peppers and onion subs , a blue plate special of shredded beef, mashed potatoes with gravy over all of it and then maybe some noodles or at least soup with what is left. I have kale, red cabbage and apples to make a salad for tonight. I can fry what is left of the red cabbage to go with fried potatoes and smoked sausage for later this weekHead contractor sent me a Happy Mother's day email to let me know they plan on finishing gutting 2 walls that we wanted removed, drywall everything that needs is, carpentry work will be done, electrical will be finished and the plumbing for water and propane will be started and finished by this weekend also sanding the floors. Next week is primering ceiling and walls, doing knock down (looks like orange peel or golf ball dimples) on the ceiling, then painting the walls, then it's finish the flooring and the roof on the barn and spouting on the house.... He is hoping to have us ready to move in Memorial weekend.  I think he is looking positive when the negative of weeks delays are common with this house and his crews.I did get this month's electric bill... it was -$1.00... not sure how we got a negative bill especially when there is a security light there that costs us $10.00/month to run. I'll have to check on that one this week.Blessed Be"},

My Daddy.I got him to smile by telling him it was for his first grandson and he first great grandson.Wnat Daddy to do something, corral a grandkid into getting him to do it. We thought we would lose him, he was sick of life in general and dog tired.Could barely get out of the wheelchair let alone adjust himself on the bed A little blurry as he didn't want to stop eating the brownies I brought him for his 91st birthday... is always a little sad on his birthday. They buried his Mommy on his 16th birthday. BUT as he says, her death freed the family to move where there was better work and a better home because they had to stay at Hocks Station while she was living to get her meds. Train was 3 days late due to flooding in the area and she died from withdraw. He eats like a horse now, can stand and balance and hit a ballon that the therapist hits to him. He pedals his \"mini \" exercise bike 40 min a day now. My Mother,First day of the nursing home that she knew she wouldn't be walking back out of as her cancer was back and running full force through her body. Still she didn't have to be bribed to smile for the camara. She's been gone 6 yrs and the hole she left can't be filled by any one of us. She ran this family with an iron fist like her great grandmother ran hers. Didn't know how to handle those of us that didn't buckle under and do as she wanted us to do. Said on her death bed she was proud of those of us that stood for what was best for us,that she didn't know it all. I should have recorded it as at times it's hard to hear her voice. Except Daughter 2 and Daughter 4 and I all sound exactly like her. Even Daddy, Pop(stepdad),Hubby and Son2 would not know who they were talking to if we called and they couldn't see us. LOL.Daddy could have gave up but he fought instead, Mother fought to her last breath...  How can I do any less?My congestion heart failure is flaring a bit, understandable with 209 and losing an Aunt that was like a sister to my brother. Daddy in the nursing home and we aren't sure if we will be able to bring him back out or how to pay for him to stay in.Son2 reenlisted, proud of him but heavens the worry of him deploying and me dealing with his cats and house is always there. Hubby is having troubles with his memory.... is it stress or dementia?....GOD only gives us what we can handle as he carrys us when we can no longer walk."},

So I uncovered my plants and moved them back out into the sunshine on the porch.Today I  start hardening off  the tomato plants I have raised  as we are to reach 70°.I took the straw off the last of the strawberries and garlic, put it in a boxes to take to 209 to use there. Hubby spread it out in the barn so it can dry out .Hubby took the flooring, tractor, and a small bistro table(we have folding chairs there and I would like a table to eat lunch at) to 209. He worked on the area that is fenced in to make secure for the dogs when they stay in the barn while we are gone.Decided on buying cattle panels(50 inches tall strong wire fencing) over feed lot panels( 34 inches high) which were only $1 different in price. He took a thermos of coffee and a wrap for his lunch.I made creamy turkey enchilidas and no bake cheesecake pie using pie filling for topping ...pantry meal.I signed us up for rewards from TSC as that is going to be our local supply store at 209 as the nearest Home Depot, Lowes and Menards are over 30 min away.I signed us up for VIP rewards at Ponderosa as it opened in Marion and we no longer take Daddy to lunch(he gets confused thinking he is going home to his house). Since I know we will at least half the time end up eating out when we go see him, I figured it was best to go were we get a senior citizen discount and rewards.In warm weather I will probably pack a meal for us. Once we move it won't be an issue as we will only be 30 min away and can go home.May 1st...May Day.... I harvested asparagus from 209 that will be enough for a meal for the two of us. Checked the rhubarb, should be ready Friday or Saturday.We went to chiropractic then took things over to 209 and while there tested the fenced area at the barn for the dogs...Charlotte and Wilbur enjoyed it as both of them love a barn where the blue heeler cattle dog,  Rascal cried the whole time we were there even when he could see me...We still have a lot of fence to move and add before they will be safe to run the yard...I mean acre. LOLMay 2nd, My Aunt that my parents raised died this morning. She was like a older sister to my brother. Her own daughter is a year younger than me. With Daddy turning 91 tomorrow and having a viewing and funeral I know we will have 2-3 meals out during the next week so I am not planning to be  buying any groceries unless I need milk or flour tortillas. I had to go down to the Pain doctor (2 hrs away one way) and he is going to see if ins will approve for another round of injections as my hands are going numb in my sleep and I struggle with sitting or bending without a lot of pain.May 3rd... I baked Aldi brownies for Daddy for his birthday gift. I had already used a discount and ordered him flowers with a ballon to be delivered in the morning. We stopped at 209 to drop off a few things, ended up answering several questions and since we mentioned we were going to the next town over to see Daddy, they asked if we could pick up a couple things for them and drop off on our way back... a couple items ended up being a lot more as they texted 3 times to add things (texted so it wouldn't interrupt our time with Daddy with a phone call). We dropped off everything on the way home. SO that worked nice, made a late dinner though.I did another harvest of asparagus and dropped some off to the people that sold us the house.Their patch from their previous sellers is only in it's 2nd year.May 4th. We removed the trellises  from the gardens and staked some things I didn't want to forget to dig up and take to 209. We had lunchmeat wraps and aspargus for a late lunch. Not sure what we will do with dinner as the viewing today is 5-8. We might stop some where with Son2 who was close to my aunt and get some dinner if any of us feel like eating.May 5th. Last night we didn't stop anywhere to eat, no one was hungry, so Son2 went to check on the VFW he is a board member and stops in 3-4 times a week to make sure everything is going okay. We went to Krogers since that was on Sunday's to do list and the weather is suppose to be decent we decided to go to 209 and do some cleaning up inside and out on Sunday (plus we won't be working around contractors). I don't like going to the store on the weekend but there is double fuel points and I can use all the break I can get on fuel at this time.Hubby went to an auction to try to get a post hole digger with auger. It looked to be in decent shape. I moved all the potted plants back out from where we put them when the storms and high winds went through and put the tomato plants out to harden off also. Played outside with the dogs to help burn Charlotte's( 11 months) energy off. Sometimes she will wear out both Wilbur(7 yrs old May 3rd) and Rascal (6 yrs old March 4th) unless we get her out and start playing with her ourselves. The good news is I lost a size playing with her outside...the bad news is I lost a size and I lent my belt to Daughter4. I've already darted these pants twice.Hubby called me droopy drawers the other day and told me to make sure I didn't wear those pants out in public. LOL I will just go back to wearing skirts more instead. I harvested 30 lbs of rhubarb.May 6thWe went to 209 and cleaned up the yard around the house so Hubby could mow (still needs trimmed)I did some weeding and harvested 20 lbs of asparagus. I moved things they had gutted out of house (they are careful to not tear up anything as they are doing demo especially woodwork etc) that we might need later to the barn. We loaded the outside doors that we promised to give to the seller. The house they bought had solid doors for outside doors, no windows and no screen doors. Since we were replacing the doors at 209 we just gave him the doors. I see no sense of wasting them and he and his brother that is our neighbor has been helpful in watching the house and making sure no one is messing around that shouldn't be.We ate leftovers and spent some time sitting on the porch just watching the birds and the dogs.Blessed BeMilk, possible tortilla wraps...then we checked both frigs and coupons and sales.... and Krogers has their double fuel points if you shop Friday.Saturday or Sunday... Since 209 needs mowed and the house and gardens need dealt with and it's not working well for us to do that with the contractors there... we decided to go over on Sunday and grocery store Friday after Aunt Carole's viewing since Son2 didn't feel like going out to eat either.I paid out of pocket $94.41 and saved $50.59 on 36 items...only 5 of those items didn't have a sale or coupon or combination of the two.I got the following:chuck roast (coupon on sale) $2.99/lb 7.8 lbs $23.38coffee (coupon on sale) 4.99bacon 2 (coupon on sale)4.49coleslaw mix .49 ( coupon on sale)we also use it in stirfrys)tortillas 3 (coupon ).99psst tortillas Regular .89old EL paso taco seasonings ( FREE)Cremet Pasta 5 (coupon on sale) 5 lbs .49/lb (pasta now restocked completely)Apples 3 lbs (coupn on sale)1.99Romaine hearts Regular (bag of 3) 2.49Mushrooms 6 lbs (coupons on sale) 11.97Bell Peppers 6 (coupons on sale) 5.28Shredded carrots(being lazy) .99Avocado2 (coupon on sale).39Ground beef 3lb (coupon on sale) 1.99/lb total 5.97Psst bread Regular .89Sub buns regular 2.89Doritos chips FREECentrum vitamins for Hubby (doc prefers him to be on this brand) 250 vitamins (coupons on sale)14.98 Liguid castille soap (coupon on sale) 5.99Notice I didn't get milk because I saw I had one in the garage frig.Good thing I didn't load up as I ended up with 30lbs of asparagus from 209 gardens and 20 lbs of rhubarb from here also.Canning season as Hubby calls it has started again.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Frugal week", "date": "Sunday, April 29, 2018", "text": "Stopped at Walgreens and got Hubby vitamins on sale with a couponand picked up the pic Daughter4's daughter sent me of her in uniform (ROTC,she's 15(turns 16 in July) in her 2nd year of college that she wanted my Daddy to have for his 91 st birthday this week .Told me today she wantedto follow in her Uncle's (Son2)footsteps. I didn't want to tell her she alreadyblowed way past him as he definitely was not in college at 15. Stopped at Krogers and got fueland facial tissues as we were out completely and it counted for my 5th trip (6trips this month and get $10 digital coupon) Tomorrow I will get bottled waterfor 209 and milkApril grocery budget is at $208.14 so should be under the budget of $250 with buying the milk and water tomorrow.Opened the house and turned off furnace on warm days. Opened the  house at 209 to WARM the house as the house is so well insulated that it doesn't allow the heat of the day to warm it up that much either... good and bad on that.Changed our big meal to lunch and went to eating either leftovers or appetizers/soups for dinner. Hubby was starting to pick back up the weight he had lost and that simple change he had started losing again.We are working hard on 209 and here during the day and pretty come to a stand still at dinner time.Hubby watched some shows using my Amazon prime.I have drove Hubby nuts with \"is it on sale? Can we wait until it's on sale? Is that the best price we can find?\" mode of everything.I cleared an area at 209 to plant some plants even though I will have to carry water to them if it doesn't rain. I got a lot of plants including herbs for 50% off as with it pushing May most won't care to plant cool weather crops now. I mended a pair of jeans for Hubby, a top for Daughter2 and fixed a dress that was given to me.We used gasbuddy to find the cheapest gas. Used Speedway fuel points that Hubby cashed in for gas and Kroger points that I got with groceries.We have taken our drinks and a couple times our lunches to 209. If we eat out while there(mostly to get inside some where WARM) we either get the special at the local store or go to the Chinese restuarant during lunch hour which on the cheap side (can't eat at McD's at that price)Blessed BeOkay... the tractor ordered came in . Hubby already mowed here with it just to make sure it ran decent before hauling it over to 209We got this used 500 gal tank for diesel fuel for the tractor for less than an used 200 tank was running.We got this tower for Hubby's Ham Radio antennia and for the tv antennia for less than 1/10th of the going price.Today Son2 went to Home Depot and bought our flooring for the 2 baths, laundry room and the 2 loft rooms he has claimed when he comes and spends the night.It is Anderson, Rigid Core Vinyl plank flooring Sterling oak.It has rubber backing so it can be in wet areas also with out adding a extra liner under it.It worked well for him and us as he needed us to bring our trailer down as he bought a riding lawn mower and wanted advice on a trimmer. We dropped off a small load of odds and ends to Daughter4 since we were in her area.Hubby said when he went over Saturday that he got all of the temporary fence we had for the dogs down and had a decent start on the section we will be making for the dogs for when we are not at home all day so they aren't cooped up in the house. They will have a nice section of the barn and fenced in area so they aren't out rooming around. Our neighbor is going to have his kids and himself make friends with the dogs so if needed, they could take care of them is something happened.We got 3 doors put on (not the storm doors yet) Both front doors which we now call kitchen door and front door along with back door is put on.One of the pleasures of where we moving to is watching the neighbors horses when they are grazing in the field next to us. We also watched the truck deliver feed as the neighbor took his wagons down to the road as it's hard for the feed truck to turn around up at the barn. Hubby would have just backed it up the lane so it must have been someone not comfortable with backing up long lanes.We met with the head contractor to firm up bathrooms as he wanted to upgrade the wheelchair shower since that area is bigger now that it is gutted than what he thought.ALSO he changed the cabinets in the kitchen (again, some more HA HA HA)When he sat down with the onsite head contractor they figured out that I could have a L shape with base cabinets (I am not getting any upper cabinets at all) I had picked out different styles but stayed with Maple coloring. It' looks on the brown side but when we had it in 209 it picked up a red tint to it.This was my favorite pick. They were talking of making double sided cabinets vs single side and a longer section. I made the limit at 8 ft. in length as lon as I get my dishwasher, sink and 6 ft of work counter I am fine.Head contractor is now on the onsite head contractor (it can get confusing at times) about not having the electric down, and the plumbing done as he wants to get the painting down before he does the floors and the floors done before he put in cabinets and wants to be done by end of MAY.Said he wanted to get things on site and Hubby pointed at me and I rattled off what was ON SITE.. I missed buying one light (did that today) and having the last of the paneling for the lofts picked up (waiting for sale or rebate) and the paint chips to him ;he uses Sherwin Williams and they told him for me to take what I wanted into the local one here and they would help me match it so if they can't match it exactly I can chose which way I want to go. I know the colors and shades so that's on the to do list tomorrow.FLooring is on trailer to go over tomorrow with tractor. Hubby is working on area for the dogs again with hope of getting that off the list this week.Our Amish neighbor stopped over as his wife wanted to know if we were keeping the strawberries or plowing them under( they would have dug them up for themselves)... definitely not plowing them under. He offered to have his girls and wife to take care of them (red clover is thick through them ) and harvest them for us if we would split the harvest 50/50... works for me and since it was his brother that planted them he was willing to share with his brother also.If I can I will also be taking my strawberry plants from here and will be sharing those plants with the neighbor and brother. Very connected community even with part of us being Englishers.Very helpful and the Widow (as they refer to her and she is Englisher like us) told our neighbor she had closed our mailbox a couple times as it was opening back up when the mail lady would pull out. We replaced the mailbox.I left her a thank you note as we seem to be passing each other on the road a lot.Blessed Be"},

I ball parked the apple kale slaw at $1.50 and the eggs benedict around $2. Asked why... they were charging $12.99. with a coffee.I told him they were really charging him for the glass plate he was eating on... He wasn't the one paying for it and he thinks he might try to make it at home for dinner as that was when he was eating it there.Baby is a 7 cubic ft chest deep freezerNewbie is 17 cubic ft chest deep freezerMonty is 27 cubic ft chest deep freezer (Montgomery Ward)That's so you know what freezer I am talking about.I cleaned out the second frig freezer and can say it doesn't do me any good to cook and put in freezer if I don't put it in vacuum bags.Things that got shoved on bottom and in back were freezer burnt pretty bad. It's the \"odds and ends freezer\". So when I transferred what was left to the new frig freezer. I limited it to meat that was going to be ate in next 2 weeks (unless I want beef and that's in Monty). I have my nuts and seeds, cheese and butter now in the freezer of the 2nd frig. Was given 18 lbs of assorted cheeses and 30 lbs of butter from a friend that we have helped  with food off and on.Cleaned more of  Baby. This one shows what I was eating until I ended up in hospital 3 times in 1 yrs and then not much has been eaten out of it . Tossed all the( 32 bags) corn that was frozen in 4 cup servings (we had 3 in the house at that time) that was now freezer burnt.This coming fall it will be put in 1 cup servings and vacuumed bags.Tossed out ham fat, chicken fat, and some bags that I couldn't read the date or the writing of what it was.Found smoked sausage, the last of the peas and peas and carrots. That should have been put in Newbie(my fruit/veggie/ dessert freezer) Smoked sausage went in the kitchen frig freezer.I cleared the north strawberry sq foot , saving the straw (in a box Son2 gave me) for 209 gardens/compost. This week is to be in the high 50s-low 60s and nothing in the lows to freeze the plants.I stayed out of the grocery stores, I stayed out of Menards etc stores. I did shop online at Walmart as our printer died and I have no more ink for it anyways. Microwave is barely workingis making a grinding noise and now taking 2 min to heat up coffee and the toaster just went on the blink and is burning everything... got what we needed and on sale with ship to store so no shipping costs and to all be picked up together.I car pooled with my girlfriend to go to her soon to be daughter-in-law's bridal shower. Had a great time and good food while learning some of the young lady's past.We ate dinner at my girlfriend's as she was suppose to have family from out of state stay with them after the shower but they got sick and didn't come at all so they had extra food. They are remodeling their house and was showing me the bathroom they got finished... the flooring was EXACTLY what I have been hunting for.BETTER yet, their bathroom is close to the shade that will be in our wheelchair bathroom so I could see how well the wall color and the flooring went together. ALSO Son2 offered to buy it for us so he can use his discount as a gift for our new home.Head contractor needs to meet with us to go over some details as a few things got changed (again, some more what ever LOL, got to keep the humor there) and it worked out that we all are free on the same day and NO one had to change anything to meet at the house and we were going to be there anyways working on putting the new doors on and the gardens.Our French doors are in so we have to pick them up and take them to 209 along with the cook stove that came in and hadn't been taken over yet.We found an used 500 gal fuel tank, didn't really need that big but the smaller ones were running higher. We need one for the fuel for the tractor as I don't want to cart 50 gal of fuel in my car or have several sitting around the barn for when we need it. Not driving the tractor to town to get fuel LOL.I am relearning to turn the water off when brushing my teeth, while soaping my hands, saving the water from washing produce etc.... Even though I won't be paying for water and sewage, I do pay for the electric.I don't know how good our well is as there is several other Englisher houses in that area that would be using the same underground water supply. The river is 2 miles from us (we are not in flood zone and are up on a knoll) so we should have good supply.I organized my seeds by planting time. cold that frost does not affect, cool that frost does affect and summer. Checked what I was low on as I am hoping to plant a fall garden and will need to start seed for that garden as I know that noone in that area sells plants for fall planting.We checked out the produce auction Friday... not many plants yet and we could tell there price was going to be high as there was more people than plants. So we will check back on Tuesday to see if it's any better. Left empty handed.This coming weekend is our local community garage sale. I have a list... winter curtains.... small side tables for beds...maybe wood or something I can turn into closets or storage for basement or barn. Railing for the basement outside ramp and the front porches.Blessed Be"},

Not a lot but with freezing temps I am hoping the rhubarb and strawberries survive it.... reminds me of Spring of 2011 our first year here.It was late May before we could plant anything and then it got so hot most of it fried before it made. I try not to worry, does not change a thing.. we have plenty in the pantry even with holes but I know the next 3 yrs are going to be really tight.I told Hubby that I was going to get some of my 12 inch flower pots and plant lettuce, scallions and spinch. Maybe some little finger carrots. I can plant them here and easily enough take the pots to 209We finally found a car I liked, could sit in and get out of without help and could afford. 2014 Jeep Compass Latitude 18645 miles( less than 5000 miles a year). Appraised at $16500 and we got it for $14000. We had set back $20000 for a car for me. SO the extra will go for new tires this winter, tires fine for now but not for winter and a go over by our mechanic in a couple weeks and cover the insurance( I increased the deductible) until I get rid of the Ford which will be next month as my son is in need of borrowing a car while his is in the shop for a week. He paid for the tags for the Ford as I transferred my speciality plates to the Jeep and the cost of the ins, still was cheaper for him than renting a car..The lady was selling it for her mom that is no longer driving.She is in her 80s. We are still looking for a truck for Hubby. He is looking at starting a welding service for the Amish (they mentioned the one that was doing it retired and they needed someone that had a portable welder). Hubby's brother in law does this type of work and is willing to sit down and talk it over. We just have to mesh with when we can meet.Hubby called to check on when the French patio doors would be in... they were suppose to be in 2-3 weeks ...They are in.. We will be picking them up next week as the contractor said he would have full crew in all of next week and could help unload them.Hubby called about the tractor that is to be in 3 wks..It will be in Monday but the company will \"test\"  everything before letting us pick it up... so sometime next week.I have breathing issues with the cleaner we have to use here...we have a lot of rust from the pipes even after having a whole  house filter to filter that from the well. Daughter4 whose has a child with sever allergies and asthma gave me her list of cleaners. I couldn't find any of them around here but found them on line and got them on sale with a discount coupon and free shipping...and ebates.I also got a microfiber mop (can be used wet or dry) for our wood floors and extra cloths. SO thanks to those that let me know microfiber mop works for hard wood.We had pork butt roast, then sandwiches. Then we had sloppy joes on top of Ramen noodles . Last night was the 2 chicken breasts I had froze with a leftover baked potato split between us and broccoli along with strawberries with plain Greek yogurt and choc syrup for the sweet. Today is leftover shredded pork butt, cheesey potatoes and an apple kale slaw . I have a graham cracker pie crust and strawberry glaze in the butler's pantry. Condensed milk in the pantry and cream cheese and strawberries in the frig so I decided to make a no bake cheesecake with strawberries and strawberry glaze on top.Tomorrow we will be going to the Scioto Valley produce auction (AKA Amish auction) so we will have soup and sandwiches when we get home. I need to finish that \"to Buy\" list.I need to update my seeds list. I am trying to make over 90% be heirloom to cut back on what seeds I buy.Blessed Be"},

I finished cooking the last of the hamburger and made it sloppy joes which fed us lunch for today (pork butt will be dinner). Hubby and I came up with using the rest of the sloppy joe as sloppy joes, hamburger pie, coney sauce,tacos(burritos, enchilida, nachos) sauce on Ramen noodles )or any pasta) over rice etc... I have to let it cool down so I can package it for the freezer. We will have the pork butt as roast tonight, over grits with gravy with slaw tomorrow . Then into the freezer with thoughts of pulled pork, BBQ pork, mock Brunswick stew, in tortilla wraps and with kraut and mashed potatoes.What did you buy this week?Blessed beI am acknowledging the dip in stock market, the lay off of 26% of GM employes in OH plant and an one day a week no pay no penalty until after shut down in July at Honda Engine plant in Anna OH triggered some fears of 2008 where we lost 2 houses we own... so it \"fight those fears\" I sat down and worked on a new budget and checked the pantry and nonfood . I had to estimate what the utilities will be and did it on the high side of what we were told was the average.Starting May 1st we will be making a mortgage payment and paying rent. I did orginally plan for this scenario for 6 months. Since I don't want to fly by the seat of my pants or have to take another draw from our retirement account (probably will for a car and truck). I spent yesterday, pretty much all day reworking the budget, checking on some ways to lower or keep things with in budget. Researching cleaning products like a microfiber mop with reusable head etc for my wood floors.These are my favorite places to glean thoughts :http://www.theprudenthomemaker.com/ (everything and anything)https://www.frugalwoods.com/ ( moving to country and costs)https://oldworldgardenfarms.com/ (house thoughts and gardening)And I read this book. I do NOT get any thing at except knowledge from posting this book. I do read Kevin Williams Blog   http://www.amish365.com/ (way of life as I am moving in the middle of many Amish)This is the book I  read he wrote.https://www.amazon.com/Amish-Cook-CookBook-Classic/dp/1449909442As our lifestyle will change a lot with the move.I set the budget... basic bills first that included paying the health ins along with copay and deductible. Then savings 10%( Hubby retirement trip with Son1 and best friend and 6 mos expenses) and reinvestment 10 % since we have retired early and don't want to run out of money, maintenance for house and vehicles , pet care . Then the \"extras\" memberships that we use a lot aka Amazon prime,Sam's etc, bday $ for the kids and grandkids, Christmas (gift cards this yr)  and then the gardens,groceries and non food. Yeah groceries and garden  got put behind the extras because we have a full pantry/non food and it's more of restock and restart the gardens(I have a lot of seeds especially since I ordered more heirloom this year) with acknowledgement we can always pull from the Christmas if needed.I have wrote the budget in a spiral notebook that I will track expenses daily  just to keep on top of fuel costs and items bought for 209 which is STILL under budget.We are hoping to have enough left to set up the gardens like we want.I need to change how I am \"running\" the kitchen (still, again, some more). More from scratch, less junk food, planned snacks. SOUP on the table more often, Casseroles and stir fries are common but I can do better.A major thing we noticed was we need to decide how we are going to garden. The Amish does in ground only, there is an area plowed and ready to disk when we get the tractor in(Amish neighbor offered to prep it for us). There is an area where they had the greenhouse(which they took) that can be converted to garden easily enough. We could just plant everything in dirt this year, spend the summer hoeing( something we both hate) and decide what to do later.We need to grow more ( and more heirloom) but keep in mind that the produce auction is only 6 miles from us and according to the Amish neighbor I will have several Amish families in the area selling their overflow along with eggs,noodles, etc.Blessed Be"},

Gray one is Bailey, she is timid for a bit when I am first around and then likes to play with my hair.Son2 saved over $500 not having to hire a petsitter. I also cleaned his glass stove top that he had burnt noodles on and couldn't get off, cleaned the oven and his kitchen sink he was having troubles getting clean (baking soda works wonders). Replaced his halogen lights with LED(on sale and 11% rebate at Menards).Measured his sink so he can get a replacement(he wants a 2 bowl instead of one).Fixed 3 dining room chairs and removed several empty boxes to my car so I can take them home. He has to pay extra to have them picked up in trash and they don't have recycling in this area and I can use them for packing or break them down to take to our recycling for free. I also started stripping his china cupboard (was my mother's) but realized the stain was different stains, some looked like paint and the shelf I did get stripped doesn't match the door I got stripped.Hubby will be picking it up later this month and bringing it home for me to work on there.It's going to be time consuming. ... and I went home to get some REST LOL.Hubby got to stay home with our 4 legged kids. He said bedtime was the same even though I wasn't there , they went to bed on their own  at 8 p.m.Wilbur brown,  Charlotte white, Rascal black. Rascal some times gets up and sleeps on the pillow beside me but pretty much has always preferred the floor since he can see out the door .AND then Hubby had to deal with thisMy first thought when he sent it was \"what is he taking a picture of and that's 1/4th of a mile from us\"Well the white spot is Charlotte and Rascal was with her but he blended in with the dirt .... Hubby had to call them 4 times (which is unusual as it's usually just once and they will come for him, I'm the call 4 times and threaten to get Daddy). He let them out the back door and saw them hauling butt to the front of the house so went to look out the front bedroom window and saw this.... probably a flock of birds was in front of the house. THEN the landlord's son took the skidloader down the road and Charlotte took off after him barking... she isn't much of a barker let alone doesn't usually chase anything that is that far from the house. Needless to say the rest of the day Hubby had her on a leash which meant he had to go out with her every single time. She didn't take off again when the next day he let her out without the leash. He said he didn't want to put the shock collar on her because he isn't familar with it. He has pretty much taken them every where he went while I was gone.I just laughed because he complains about taking them when I put them in the truck when we go. Gets warm this summer they won't get to go much anyways. Hot truck and pets don't go together.Neither of us bought any groceries except me picking up milk on the way home. Hubby ate from the pantry and a sandwich from Windy's when he was out at lunch time over at 209 and didn't think to stop at the local store that serves lunch specials ...we got this one Monday and I got mac and cheese, he got potato salad as sides and then we split them between us,$4.99.. we ended up having a whole sandwich left between us for dinner that night. I took food with me as Son2 does a lot of nurtrisystem and low fat stuff.... I did get Chinese from the local restaurant as take out, the lady set up the order as a lunch order combo to give me a price break as I ordered extra crab ragoon and fried dumplings(AKA potstickers) to go with the chicken broccoli(brown sauce) with white rice and eggdrop soup. I did this the day before I went home so I could take the left overs home, add rice and eggrolls and have enough to feed us again.We have been going over to see Daddy on Monday mornings,  then 209 after lunch...This coming Monday it will be 209 first to go over the changes with the electric, then lunch and then Daddy and possible Hubby's parents before we go back home. No the dogs won't be going with us. I will try to have enough packed to fill the truck so we aren't\"wasting\" a trip and not taking anything with. Each load that goes now is 1 load that we won't be taking later.Blessed Be"},

That is really for the guys that will be installing the furnace and AC next week in the basement and there is one in the barn also for those that are needing to cut something they can plug in instead of running a generator and charging the gas to us...cheaper for the electric bill.Monday we meet with the head electrician as there are some things we wanted that isn't going to be possible but he has suggestions to deal with it. Since I had a friend build their own home I know even when you build it yourself there will be things that don't work as you thought they would.Our one contractor replaced a door handle that he had to hack off because they locked the keys inside and thought that was the only set of keys(we have a set also but we are an hour away) and he was glad to tell us that you can NOT kick our doors in because he tried at every door. We thought it was funny because they gave us a lock box for the keys to be on the handle and it was on the handle without any keys. Glad to know you can't kick our doors in. You can't get the windows unlocked either as he tried those. He used to be in law enforcement.Offered to recheck house for security when we go to move in . He was limping a bit the next day with a sore foot but he didn't break his foot.We picked up the last lights for the bathrooms.  Hubby found 2 doors online at Menards he really liked for the barn doors for the bathrooms so we ordered those also  ...11% rebate at Menards is back on.Pretty much what is left on the to buy list or pay off list in set for May.I did order new pots and pans for the gas stove as I have the same set as Son2 had that warped on his ex girlfriend's gas stove. The pans were on sale with free shipping. I even ordered a wok, something I used to use on my gas grill 20 some years ago but had a kid (none would admit to who did it) ruin it  by hitting something with it and put a hole in the bottom. They come in at the end of the week.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "209 update", "date": "Wednesday, April 4, 2018", "text": "The entire roof is now under new felt(replaces tar paper and can be used without shingles for 2 yrs without leaks)  Shingles ordered are to be delivered Monday, but we won't have them put on until the metal chimney's are out and all the stink pipes etc are in.The backer board is up, meter,disconnect box for house and disconnect box for barn installed... they forgot to install security light on pole and had to come back to do that.Power from road is now on to this poleThe back yard is a series of trenches for electric lines to be buried... regretfully it started raining right after these were dug, then we had 4 inches of snow and then over 5 inches of rain. They are hoping they are down enough to start working again on installing the electric lines the 5th.This is the pump house, when they checked the pump had been totally removed (we figured on a new pump anyways) but so had the electric because at the time it was put it they didn't bury wires. SO we had an option, either dig a new well and put everything in the basement or dig another trench and run wires and move the bladder and whole house water filter to the pump AND add a small propane heater to keep it from freezing when it's cold...We chose redoing the pump house as we know that is the lower of those 2 bills.We still continue to buy stuff for the house. The big list was completed and under budget about $13,000. SO we decided to go ahead and get new exterior doors, storm doors, new clothesline and more fencing. We still waiting for sales and or rebates from Menards.Some days I get \"bored\" because this more hands off than I am used to and then overwhelmed with the paperwork I am having to keep up with and contacting our ins guy and rehab loan guy to keep things on track.If the weather would straighten up and give us a couple good dry decent temps with light breeze , things would be great...right now we are looking at  3 decent days to dry out and then starting another  5 day of rain/snow.Blessed Be"},

Charlotte loved running in and out which pretty much helped us to choose a dog door for 209. The husky in her definitely comes out.I decluttered 4 boxes that was sitting in our bedroom tossing about half of what was there.I baked 3 pounds of chicken breasts for wraps and chicken salad for this week.I put 1lb of beef cubes in water to  roast while the chicken breasts baked so make beef and broth for noodles for this week.I watered the tomato plants I have under the  grow light in the front room along with all the house plants.I started packing for our move this summer. We can store things in the barn as it locks up tight. I packed 6 boxes and we made some choices of wheither to keep all the curtains even though we should have extra or get rid of them now. We decided to pack them and decide later as we also have  Daughter4 moving this summer also and she might need curtains. I put these packed labeled boxes in a room that is empty (except needing the curtains flipped out to sheers that was hanging when we moved in 8 yrs ago) and I am down to the closet in another room to be gone through and packed....one down , 17 to go LOL Doing one room a week.Contractor decided to use a barn door on the one bathroom as a regular door would cause a problem if I was in a wheelchair and coming out of the bedroom when someone came out of the bath...we looked at the other bathroom door and if the contractor says it will work we will be putting a barn door on it also... I found the railing for 50% off and Hubby decided to make the doors himself. He found the wood that matched what we were looking at and it will costs less than $200 total for each door where if we bought it  at the store it would be over $1000 for each door and that didn't include the railing or recess handles.My son sent me pictures and measurements of his bathtub and what his shower head was, I really really like his tub and shower. I passed that info along to our contractor as I already had bought the shower head and he said he had just installed the same tub for his parents so he knew right where to go get it. Now I don't have to start checking out tubs , saving gas money and time for me.MondayI started fluffing the pillows and bedding as soon as I let Rascal and Charlotte out at 5:15 am. It will help with the allergies flaring which means less OTC meds being bought.I filled out the 2 Menards rebate forms, made copies of them and then have them ready to go out in mail.I did the Kroger's survey for the 50 fuel points.I am \"short\" $22 of having another 10¢/ gal off and that's only because they were out of Wendy's gift cards.  We have found if we use gift cards for eating out we stay in budget. Actually we spend less as I have found 3 gift cards we haven't used. We did get another Bob Evans hoping that Daddy will get well enough to go out with us. Brother said he seems to be getting better physically...not so much mentally.Uploaded Kroger's receipt to Receipt Hog.Used leftover biscuits for egg sandwich for bfast.We had a late lunch early dinner as Hubby was gone all morning and then had to turn around and leave for a refresher class as a weather spotter. Both of us had fruit later in the evening as a snack.TuesdayWe had bagels for bfastWe had to take a check to our IRA guy that Hubby's old employer sent , we took the shortest way to and from . Coming back the Ford's ABS light came on so Hubby called our mechanic and it will go in Wed night to be looked at first thing Thurs. morning..He allows us to make payments if we can't pay in full and he doesn't require it to be paid off to have your car back. Few and far between on mechanics that way.We had homemade and canned beef veggie soup with tortialla chips for lunchChicken fajhatis for dinner using the chicken I cooked  on Sunday. The rest will make chicken salad.It's been a rainy and windy day to stay inside once we got back home.WednesdayHubby got up and immediately went to get his blood work done.We had bagels and cream cheese when he got home.We priced the exterior doors along with storm doors which included the debate of one or two doggie doors.We went over the \"to buy\" list for 209, changed the style of fencing to keep the dogs in the yard to the cheapest we could find with the thought of changing to what we decide on later. We hope to reuse some of what is there but move it to suit the dogs as it was put up to contain goats.I decided to make wood shutters and then decided to make these to cover the bottom half of the window. I think I found them on pinterest and followed them to here http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Pallet-Wood-Vertical-Blinds/I will use the \"left over wood from the barn doors Hubby is making for the bathrooms.We had wraps for lunch and beef (cooked on Sunday) noodle over mashed potatoes with salad.Thursday.We had bagels for bfastI had yogurt and fruit for lunch and Hubby had beef noodles (no potatoes)We finalized what we still had on the to buy list for 209, and made a withdraw from the retirement fund.I ended up with the shakes , it was about half of what we thought we would end up pulling but still.We ordered the compact tractor that came with a front bucket and back hoe and Hubby ordered a mower to attach also . Since it was a cash purchase we got a discount of 25%.That cushions the fact our mechanic let me know I have only a couple more months left of driving my Ford Explorer. I have ran the wheels off more than once I mean ACTUALLY ran the wheels off. I've had it 15 yrs and would just LOVE to have it another 15 yrs.It's just not worth the thousands it would take to keep it going. SO that is a big look for on my to do list.We went over to check on 209, good thing we did as the roof was leaking at the chimney, not bad at all and no damage done because we caught it. We did what we could to protect things and let the contractor know who was sending someone ASAP. Hubby thinks the chimney cap got knocked loose some when they were roofing and the rain today came in at the right angle to cause the leak. Better NOW than later AFTER the ceiling and floors was done.Topped off gas at a little gas station that was 30¢ cheaper than everywhere else.We had left over beef noodles over mashed potatoes, cottage cheese (Hubby topped with Apple butter)applesauce, pickled beets (for me only) and biscuits for dinner.We called it an early night with the constant rain and cold wind blowing even the dogs called it an early night.Friday We went back over to 209 and checked on things (Contractor had already let us know they took care of issue of leak) And showed Son2 the house as he meet us there. He walked through, made a few suggestions and then stood on the kitchen porch and put his finger to his mouth for me to be silent...I couldn't figure out what he was trying to hear and then he looked at me and said... I need a chair so I can sit here and listen to the birds. He walked in to the dining area and we asked him what he thought,,, his words were \"I am committing both of you to Shady Pines (Golden Girls reference but there is one in Florda for real) I asked him why, his response was \"I want this house\".We all met up with friends at Hong Kong... no coupons but Son2 hasn't seen friends in a couple months and won't again until summer so we sucked that up.We got gas at Krogers using my fuel points.SaturdayWe went over to see Daddy...doing better physically, even taking himself to go look outside at the front door (they have a seating area for people to set and look outside) He is eating good and starting to flirt with the ladies...that is definitely normal. He knew who I was, asked about where we were at on the house, talked about the Reds opening game with Hubby. IS eating good and starting to make friends.Then we went to see Hubby's parents. His Mom is having trouble walking up and down stairs, know she's going to have to have both knees replaced but she has to lose weight...and that's hard when you can't hardly walk to begin with and do not swim. His Dad is still having trouble with breathing but is at least able to get up and move around some. He is back to going to church. They had been over to see the house and was talking about coming over to visit and help with stuff.We stopped by 209 on way home since we drive within a mile of it coming home. Measured the clothesline... Hubby and Son2 said it was 50 ft, I said it wasn't. It's is .... 46 ft...with only 3 lines. I use a 50 ft with 4 lines. We won't talk about it needing to be moved.EASTERWe had a quiet day, ate chicken salad and broccoli salad for dinner. A close family friend died last Thursday and her viewing is Monday with funeral Tuesday. She was the 3rd death for us this year.Blessed Be"},

We did pay HIGHER for the milk , but saved time, gas and what ever I would have spent on sale stuff. I cooked a corned beef , ate half and saved the other half in the freezer. I pulled it back out last night for todays dinner.I cooked 3 lbs of chicken breast, had that one night, some of it in a chicken cordon blu soup the next and put the rest in the freezer. Looking at possible chicken salad this coming week. We had the last of that soup with lunch meat wraps for lunch.We ate out 1 night because a group of Hubby's ex co workers was at the local restaurant celebrating a person retiring and they let us know. We got the special of the night and brought home half of each of our meals to eat the next day. I still have 1 baked potato that well be a twice baked potato to go with the corned beef tonight.We had scrambled eggs and biscuits last night even though neither of us was hungry...can't growl at Daddy for not eating and taking meds if I do it myself.I ordered construction paper in the colors of the rooms of 209 to use for labels on the packing boxes. Was cheaper than buying ink for the printer.Daughter2 has given us ALL the boxes she had used  and unpacked from her move with the comment we shouldn't have more to pack than she did...until we pointed out how many black trash bags and 14 suitcases that was also packed  😛not touching what the boys all carried out that was theirs and took to where ever they were staying.I mentioned going to Menards and immediately the dogs got excited... yeah we take them when we go to Menards LOLCooking stove was finally in for pick up, Hubby needed to pick up lights for the barn, electrician told him how many and it's 11 % rebate and I needed rubbermaid totes (18 gal) plus we needed ideas and prices for a couple things. I didn't get the totes as I wasn't willing to pay that price but we got tons of ideas and prices for the rest along with the lights and finally my stove.I found the same rubbermaid totes online at Home Depot (we don't have one close) and ordered them for 1/3 rd of the price even with shipping.I usually check prices on line before going to buy.

Nursing staff said he is not sleeping during the day (20 min nap at 3 pm, been doing that for 70 yrs) and maybe 4 hrs total during the night as he sleeps 2 hrs , up and then sleeps another 2.  They are wondering if his meds are doing it and are looking at changing them.Hopefully it will get figured out and he will be able to go home. He is going to be 91 on May 3rd.On the way home,Hubby and I talked about his parents, they don't eat right, too much snacks,candy and pop along with not eating veggies and fruit, maybe one meal a day at that plus just sitting all day and napping 2-4 and then can't sleep at night....His dad actually got a doctor's order to GET up every 20 min and walk for 10 as he was having troubles breathing and it was from nothing more than sitting too much.THEN we talked about ourselves...sigh...Hubby 98 % of the time takes his meds as soon as he gets up. ONCE IN A GREAT while....he will miss, usually when he has blood work and forgets to take them when he gets back. I on the other hand miss a lot of mine, Not my Crohn's meds or heart meds, I get those EVERY day. but the others .... I take meds 4 times a day and what I have found is I miss the 2 pm and the dinner meds if we are NOT home for dinner. So I found a small glass jar I had that I can put a day's worth of meds in and carry with me so I can take my meds. I have to eat with them so I will also need to start carrying something with me all the time.EATING... we both suck. I have meds I have to take first thing in the morning, I can't eat for 2 hrs after, by that time I'm off and running with the day and not stopping until lunch.Lunch is a 50/50 ...if not at a place I can stop like the other day when I was gutting somethings on 209 to clear it for the crew that was on their way there or if I didn't pack anything , lunch gets passed. IF I miss lunch I eat something at 2 pm (along with meds) which is usually just a couple fig newtons or granola bar for my meds.Dinner is depending...big lunch, no dinner, no lunch, good (probably too much )dinner. 7 pm I crave candy....to get pass that part I have switched to tea and going to bed to read, which really works as then I am asleep by 9 and the dogs get me up at 4-5:15 am....I actually have an alarm that tells me to PUT THE BOOK DOWN as I would stay up ALL night reading.Today shocking to both of us since we were late getting back in what was to be  an hour round trip to pick up new stove came in because a 3 hr trip, they couldn't find the stove, I came straight in and fixed lunch and told Hubby to wait to unload until we ate.Had 2 fig newtons for 2 pm meds and not sure what we will have for dinner as NEITHER of us are hunry since lunch ended up at 1 instead of 11:30..

If not used, it reduces the loan but does NOT lower our payment. Said with the deducting the stuff we purchased out of pocket, he was pretty sure the money we saved him from buying it (listed in the loan) and the contingency part would pretty close pay for the extra work we wanted but was going to put off. His men being  already there so that saves us time and work on our side. He will now be painting ceilings, walls and woodwork of the colors of our choice and refinishing the wood floors AND replacing a section of the barn roof while they are there since they have the construction dumpster. Let's us keep our money invested to make those payments.These are storm windows the seller made as the windows are single pane. He offered to make us more if needed (he thought all were there) for the cost of materials if they aren't there.His wife had a drying wheel.We ordered our French patio doors and asked about installation charges. They wanted $500 more than our contractor so our contractor got the job of installation.We tore out several shelving units and a closet unit to reuse through the house. Need to paint them but still saved us $1887.00 . Part of what I tore out...IF I hadn't need a bathroom with a tub I would have left this the dry goods pantry. His wife has a bike rim  to hang socks from to dry.She offered to connect me with the person that made hers when we moved to 209 hers also has hanging clips to put socks on and she had the baby's clothes hung on the inside circle.Our appliances are in that we ordered and so is the sink but got a phone call last night that for what ever reason the stove wasn't in and they are pushing to have it before the end of the month... the 1953 Crane sink fell through 😕, I don't know who was more disappointed me or my contractor.  UPDATE, when we picked up the appliances that was in and  the 11% rebate was on so we got the wood for the electic back board (it's a wooden board, think bill board, that is close to the electric pole that will be up at the house that the meter goes on, there will be 2 boxes \" think breaker box without the breakers, one for the power that goes to house and barn (which will have breaker boxes)and one to hook the generator to so we can build it a \"shelter\" and leave it in place. Helps me not have to move it as it is VERY heavy to the box and Hubby don't have to have it at the barn.We got a new mailbox as when we get the mail to take to the Sellers we noticed the mailbox was rusted pretty bad.This one has a flipper that comes up when someone opens the box so you can tell if you have mail. We might have to add to it to be able to see it from the house.We also got a new grill , smaller that is just big enough for the two of us but okay if we only have one of the kids and their family over. We also got a electric smoker that uses wood chips (we have PLENTY of wood chips) The grill is a one piece grill and smoker. Was great when we had kids still coming around regularly but not now as they don't and we understand it as we are over an hour away from them and will be still when we move to 209 especially with them in low paying jobs and the price of gas. We try to go to them and see all or most of them at one time. That's also hard to do as they all work different shifts and their kids are busy with activities on weekends... I remember my parents telling me that would happen unless we all lived in the same area... kids are definitely CITY, couple of them BIG city and we are still just old country folk. THE BEST NEWS at Menards was when ... we checked out and it came to over $500.. and we paid ZERO.... yep ZERO as I had saved up enough rebates. We will still get around $50 in rebate.We are going to take our grill over so we can heat coffee, water, food up on it. Hubby plans to put it in the barn were we can move it to use and yet store it.Hubby found cheaper fencing to make a temporary dog area so the dogs can go with us  so they are not cooped up in the house or Charlotte in a cage. We should be able to reuse the fence around the garden...not to keep deer out as it isn't high enough but to keep Wilbur out as he thinks plants is where he needs to do his business and Charlotte who thinks anything plant is a toy.Sellers let me know there are Asparagus , rhubarb and just remembered there was also strawberries.  We told them they could come get some of all of it to start those at their new home as I have strawberries and rhubarb I will be bringing myself.I mended a pair of pants.Hubby darned 3 pairs of socks.I dried 3 small loads of clothes on the drying rack.I got the electric down my $70 by insisting Daughter2 pay anything over the budgeted amount. Surprising how she changed how she was running the electric heater in her room.We have ate leftovers that was shoved in the freezers for most of the week, I have a nice white spot in the kitchen frig freezer. I will refill it from the other freezer. I am going to have to get milk today or tomorrow.We use gas buddy to find the cheapest gas and are still under budet for that with running back and forth from 209.We took a break with our friends who needed a break as they are repainting their entire inside of the house on their own at the local Chinese restaurant I had a $5 coupon off 2 dinners.Have a blessed Day."},
{"title": "stop spinning circles and", "date": "Friday, March 16, 2018", "text": "staying on task... can't remember if I am remembering everything LOLSolutionI usually use scrap paper or regular notebook paper. I might even put it on my calendar on my phone. I have found that my calendar on the phone sometimes does not remind me or I don't hear it even though it's up all the way because I don't carey the phone on me or I forget it just went off and didn't look to see what the notification was.So this spiral notebook goes with me. I list what the priorities of the day are, cross off what got done and transfer what did not get done to the next day. On the back of the page I put the notes of things needed to bring the next day or take care of when we get back home.I was making a breakfast we can eat as we drive the hour to 209, that is still staying in the routine . BUT since we can stand at the lp propane buddy heater and still see our breath INSIDE the house , we are eating our lunches out instead of packing. It's actually so we can get WARM. We found a good but cheap Chinese buffet that does a lower price for lunch. For $14 that included 20% tip (food servers and most bartenders only earn $4.08/ hr, tips is what they live on) and our drinks AND got warm before going back to work on 209.On this list was going to see my Daddy. He is not doing well at all. My brother and sister in law are now living with him until they have jumped hoops to get help in.We always take Daddy to Bob Evans for his sausage gravy and biscuits. SIL warned us he wouldn't want to go but probably would be okay if we went and got it for him as they hadn't been able to get him to go anywhere with them for over a week. I asked him if he wanted to go and got a \"no\". Hubby asked him if he was ready to go get his sausage gravy and biscuits and the man almost fell out of his chair trying to get up to go...somethings remain the same.LOL.  Get in restaurant and SIL was \"he'll need the menu read to him as he didn't bring his glasses, he'll want coffee...NOPE he takes water in a coffee cup no ice , large bowl of the gravy with 2 biscuits either apple butter or honey(that floats) and it will take him an hour to eat it...YEP. She was amazedGot him home and she's just standing back watching and I ask Daddy if he needs the bathroom and he says yep and goes (he forgets as he has dementa) and then I told her both him and Hubby will take naps ,not always at the same time but they will take a nap)...YEP. We got him 2 slices of 2 different pies like always and told her he would eat 1 slice mid morning the next day and 1 slice at lunch. He doesn't eat sweets after 2 pm . She already texted me and told my Brother got chewed out for eating one of his slices of pie and had to get another slice for him to calm Daddy down.. GOOD for Daddy as Brother is a diabetic and isn't suppose to be eating that anyways.We keep finding quarks in 209. Couldn't figure out why there was a patch in the middle of the kitchen/dining area wood floor, thought breeze way before the garage was converted...NO the seller tore out a wall there (Ibeamed the attic) and that was the only wood he had. The area had been the kitchen not the breeze way.When the garage was converted they move the kitchen to back side of that area and left the old kitchen as a dining room. Said trying to heat that area was horrible so he took it out. I thanked him because if it had still been there...we would have taken it out ourselves because it definitely would have cut up the house to small rooms.Today I am packing the last of Daughter2's stuff that she left here with plans to come back the very next day.. bad weather nixed that and then she found she needed Hubby to go down to her place and fix a couple things that her and a couple others have tried to fix and she just knows HER DADDY can fix it, so to save her gas money and time he is taking her stuff down to her tomorrow when he goes down to fix it.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "IT'S OURS", "date": "Sunday, March 11, 2018", "text": "We went to 209 right after the closing where we signed our life away. Hubby is taking a picture of me.I am taking a picture of Hubby at the same time.We all have writers cramps from signing 50 million times. Had extra papers to sign and the electrician found that he couldn't use any of the electric so besides the mortgage for the house, the rehab loan we had to come up with more out of pocket.By time we finish (FINGERS CROSSED) it will be another $125,000 out of pocket and slightly over $391,000 Good thing we budgeted $400,000.Even so, the new truck and new car will be postponed until I have enough saved up again for them.Right now our money is making over 10% so we are letting it make the payments instead of drawing the cash as the mortgage is 4.5%. That way we are still earning 5.5% on that money.We will have to pull the $125,000 as needed. Our contractor said he would pay everything out of the loan hoping that we can save in the other areas and not have to draw so much cash at the end.We meet our Amish neighbor as he saw the car and came over to make sure who it was and since it was us he introduced himself , he is the brother of the seller. AND he owns the little strip of land to the south of us along with his home north of us. So we worked out a deal that he would take care of the 3 acres behind us so that's off our shoulders and he said any area we don't want to mow he will let his calves graze to keep the grass down (we have an acre to the south of us) and the house sits on an acre. He will help us redo the one section of the barn roof. He is also the person that helped the Englisher that built the house 20 yrs ago build the house. He helped the Amish family that bought it from the Englisher as it was his wife's brother, then the seller was his own brother. He had a lot of details that you usually don't get until you have lived in the area for 3-6 months, sometimes never about the house. He told us about the widow that lives the next house over south of us. AND we now have the seller's address so they can show us where the 100 plus asparagus plants is. The rhubarb is under the grape harbor. I need to get some neem oil as Brandy as The Prudent Homemaker uses on her grapes.We go over Monday,okay we will probably go over every day just not sure if it will be both as we need to put the fence up for the dogs... anyways side track there, the electrican is coming in Monday to make sure where we want outlets,switches and boxes for ceiling lights as we will be doing the actual installation ($$ saved) of the light fixtures.dinner needs madeBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Planning to be frugal", "date": "Friday, March 9, 2018", "text": "Usually I post how I have been frugal...this one is how I intend to stay frugal as we start driving 2 1/2  hrs a day to work on 209 . Part of the time we will be taking the dogs and that will allow a longer work day if we both go. Charlotte, white dog which is the 9 month old puppy doesn't hold her pottyafter 7 hrs so we really try to not push it with her at this time. Rascal 5 yrs and Wilbur  soon to be 8 yrs are good for up to 12 hrs and that's more than we like for them to go (9 is about where I get antsy). I will take food and water for the dogs also.TO stay frugal as we will have high fuel bills with driving that distance I have chosen to do the following...Take a trash can with trash bags to 209...and bring that bag when full home to put off adding trash service. One month of trash service is $17.Fix bfast sandwiches or bfast burritos the night before to eat on way over taking our own coffee (thermos until we get electric in then we can take the spare pot)Water cooler that we can fill with ice and water that we can bring from home (have a black trash bag of paper cups given to us so construction crew can have water also) for on site.The outhouse will be put back on the septic to be used until the bathrooms will be put in (save on port a john and outhouse connects to the septic tank so no messy hole to deal with when we remove it.) but until it is I am borrowing a bedside potty from Daddy and will put it in an area that can give some privacy. We can dump it directly into septic tank.Lunches of tortilla wraps with lettuce, lunch meat,with cheese with a fruit and some veggies etc will be fixed the night before to be packed in morning into cooler.I will make 2-3 different snacks to pack the night before as I have to eat something when I take my meds.A pillow and blanket incase I need a nap in the truck.Dinners will be either casseroles that can be fixed in microwave or slide in to oven while we shower, crock pot  and  meals that are ready in 30 mins without lot of work to get it done. I will be making a list of Emergency meals  (GoodCheapEats.com https://goodcheapeats.com/2012/08/meal-planning-101/) so I can check to make sure we have everything already here as I don't plan to have any major grocery shopping to do for at least a month if not 3 months. I would like to think I could fix a big meal on Sunday and make plan overs but I really don't think I will be up to it but I will make that list also.Hubby \"cashed\" in some of his Speedway points for a fuel card to help pay for the $100 of gas. He has been \"racking\" them up for 5 yrs.I have enough Kroger points to get 30¢ off a gal.We know it will 10 gals to drive over and back in the truck. Gas prices are up ato $2.56 but the moving budget is set at $4/gal. I figured worse case scenero... $4/gal for gas 1800 miles of driving every day for 180 days(6 months) is $7200 TO help that it will be take what ever we can while driving over to work on it to bring that amount down. THIS IS NOT taking in discounts from Krogers or the Speedway card. We will need to get a discount card from the local gas station at 209 because they don't have Speedway.We close today so I need to get around. Blessed Be"},
{"title": "update on 209", "date": "Wednesday, March 7, 2018", "text": "We close Friday at 2 pm and leave with keys in hand.We paid for the house ins a year in advance , pretty big bite but we were expecting it as our ins agent warned us before we made an offer on the house.We have a vacant policy to be in place until we get moved in which is also expensive but covers things just encase the worse happens.We will make a stop to check on everything but the main thought is to figure out how to fence the dogs in so they can get out but can get in the barn and not get loose until we get the major fencing around for their area because we want to take them with us when we work on the house .They can't be in the house with contruction crew etc. Plus we need to decide what is going to be their area. I want the gardens blocked off from them as Wilbur is well known for using garden plants to hide his business in.Not the type of manure I want in my gardens.I fell coming up the outside steps to the back door and I broke my big toe in 2 places...the base is where I had a stress fracture 2 yrs ago... LUCKY it was Sunday the day AFTER we did the massive move for Daughter2 and maybe if I stay off it a bit it will be healed enough when we start working hard on the houseThis is our land. YES it looks like big foot has stepped there.It's the pond(fenced according to insurance) with everygreens planted around it. The back 3 acres is still unknown about what we are going to do with it. It's planted in hay. Hubby is going to ask the Amish gentleman that is selling us the house if he would like to harvest the hay in exchange for mowing if for us this year since we aren't doing anything with it and don't want to have to start mowing it to keep the weeds down.The barn looks to have a white roof. We think there is part of a fence south (bottom of picture is south. Driveway is north, barn west and pond east) of the barn that we could finish off that would let the dogs run but let me use that area for gardens outside that fence ... and then when we move in just connect the fence to the fence that runs to the side of the house.The thoughts right now is letting the dogs out the back door or patio doors and keeping them south of the driveway and only in the back and not in front so when someone is coming up the driveway  to deliver something I don't have to hurry to haul them in or have someone worry about Rascal clawing up their car like we do here. I plan to read OLD WORLD FARM GARDENS Raised Row gardening (Jim and Mary Competti) book that I bought and is on my kindle on how they did their gardens without using a tiller. Something to do to keep me off my foot?I measured the cabinet area of the china hutch I bought last year and need to refinish and fix. I have a 2 tier organizer for my plates now and want to continue to use it. I found I can use a 2 tier on the bottom and 1 tier on the top of each of the cabinets of the top part of the hutch. My silverware drawer is built in here so I also  measured what I needed to replace for the silverware. I ordered what I needed from Amazon using the last of my swagbuckes and Pinecone research gift cards. NO out of pocket The Hoosier cabinet I will have to refinish will have my mixing bowls and the baking pans I use the most.I know there will be areas I will need to figure something out... I know I am going to have to find a cabinet for my spices and herbs.Those might be stored in the mudroom in a cabinet there when I find one.I do have a shelving unit Hubby built that could be enclosed (I keep my spices and herbs in the dark) with little or no cost. I need a place to my oils and vinegars and I plan to make a shelf out of the porcelian table top I got when I bought the Hoosier.We went back through the to do list of extra projects and decided what needed to be done BEFORE we move and what we actually could do later or even next year. SO we are on the same page. I have a lot of furniture needing refinished, fixed, what ever LOL , that is going into this house so it's a priority that I need to list and then start on what is the most needed...like china hutch and Hoosier.Daughter2 gave us some twin beds for the loft bedrooms, one of them needs fixed and it's a simple fix plus matresses . She thought I might want a place to take a nap while working .Back to propping the foot upBlessed BeThe sort of is the person that lived there more like stored stuff in the rental but lived elsewhere did NOT have the water on so instead of reading a meter and transferring water to Daughter2, they have to come out and turn it on at the street  and read the meter and make sure the meter is working etc which is a different dept.So she won't have water until Monday or Tuesday (WHICH IS NOW WED and there is still NO water) which means she can't stay there without working bathroom though thankfully there is a gas station within 3 blocks of her we used while moving her stuff.But it ended up a dump and go type of move as she really couldn't put anything away before it was cleaned and couldn't clean until the water is on... BUT the weather was going to turn nasty this week so it's was do it now. Now her OCD and depression are running full force, we all just keep reminding her to think about WHAT is done and not what is left to do. As of today Hubby was helping her remove appliances (Daughter4 taking) and a cabinet (us to convert to \"closet') and the trash to the garage where landlord is going to have it hauled away next week... she's okay with where the stuff is as long as she gets the water on by tomorrow.This is 1/3rd of the 26 ft truck we rented which thankfully had a lift so we aren't hauling stuff up a ramp. This is also 7 hours of us ...Hubby and me, loading her stuff that was here. She still have the stuff in her bedroom but if she is sleeping here there is no point moving it yet.  Hubby picked up all her stuff in the 10X20 ft storage unit and part of the stuff at Daughter4s before he ran out of room. I went in the pick up and got the vacuum Son2 was holding for her and the rest of the stuff from Daughter4s. Bad enough dealing with a 12 inch curb and stairs EVERY WHERE in the house.What have we learned so far...to keep in our minds when we go to move.A dump and go only works if you are really super organized like Daughter 3 (4 kids also) Daugher 4 (3 kids) and Son2 (single, no kids, his computer crap makes up for at least 1 kid LOL)Make sure the 2 wheel cart is in good shape. Last move of Daughter2 in downpours and tornados around us the old cart broke. I had my small folding one that wasn't the best but we were down to boxes so it worked out okay.New cart was a blessing.DO NOT count on anyone to show up and help. 4 friends didn't show up, two of her sons had other things to do and had to leave after a couple hours and then SHE had to leave to go get one of the sons because her ex's wife got sick (flu) and was in the ER. END up just Hubby and one grandson and myself for the last 3 hrs...he asked how we could do it as he was struggling to keep up...mentioned something about us pushing 50 and then we let him know we are pushing 60. He almost fell .. except he was already sitting on the floor exhausted. Rubber maids, sturdy plastic containers for decorations etc instead of cardboard boxes.Trash bags are great for blankets, bedding, pillows as you can fill in the empty places with them. BUT paper grocery sacks and trash bags for breakables NOT good.I ask who packed it and my darling Daughter2 admitted she did and which I made it clear she was NOT packing anything of mine except CLOTH items. HEAVENS.MEDIUM cardboard boxes. Large ones weigh too much if you fill them up (unless with soft light stuff) and are bulky to lift even with light stuff and your entire body will let you know it the next day.You don't don't need every single keepsake your four kids have had since birth.You also don't need to find what you gave them when they moved out back in your storage area buried under your own stuff which I shoved right back into her home because I found it before I left to go to her house.She hasn't spoke to me in two days even though she is still living here which is actually Sleeping here.At least we are not fighting which was her teenage mode so she has matured ?? LOLYou don't need 20 pairs of pants (actually there was 50)and 50 shirts (100) when you wash every day and basically wear the same clothes during a 2 week period. NOR do you need 60 pairs of shoes,especially the ones that are missing it's mate...all of this was just ONE SON.Grandson not really happy with his Nonna (ME) at the moment but he did love it that he could find his favorite clothes right off the bat when he was looking for them. AND I put his dress clothes on hangers and hung them up and the rest that he does not even wear was left in the bags for yardsale this summer by his Momma. AND she told me she buried them under other sacks for the garage sale as he is not one to go dig for ANYTHING ... LOLLABEL LABEL LABEL... I even have color coded the labels. Unless I flip the purple color for the dining room and blue for the bedroom the colors match the rooms, you will be able to look at top or sides of boxes and know which room it goes to.She had nothing labeled where the boys did label all of the boxes they packed for their rooms. Guess whose stuff is already put away and who is digging through the rest.PUT THE CELL PHONE AWAY. Check it on breaks, not everyone should take a break at the same time unless it was meal time. Breaks are less than 15 min not 30 when you get sucked into Facebook, snapchap etcHave food and drink... lots of water Daughter2 did get a lot of pizza (had coupons and lunch time special combo) had 2 slices left but I didn't eat at all and some chips for the kids but didn't have enough drink. Grandson grabbed more when he went to gas station to potty and we even ran out of the water again. It was in the low 50s so it's wasn't really hot."},

{"title": "Staying frugal", "date": "Saturday, February 24, 2018", "text": "This is my old wringer washer that I finally replaced with an automatic as I was down with my Crohn's and looking at surgery(which did not happen) I kept this washer...yesterday Hubby pulled it out of storage and rigged it so I could use it BECAUSE he has dumped garlic buttter sauce from 50 wings ALL over his good coat,good jeans and new shirt...I feel like I have to remind him like a child to change into \"play\"clothes. SIGH... I had washed the clothes and coat 4 times with stain remover and nothing got better. In one last try before they got replaced, I used the wringer washer. No pretreatment just regular homemade laundry soap and hot water and IN WATER for 45 min and it was out. The water looked like yuck so I washed a another time in the wringer which the water looked \"clean\" and tossed it in the automatic to drain and spin as the coat would not have went through the wringer. BUT will not be replacing the coat and clothes and I will be telling Hubby to change in to play clothes LOL.Savings is $275.I did not go to store and I am not planning to going this weekend as Daughter2 might be moving out by next weekend (figures are crossed).She was planning on this weekend but the owner couldn't get her stuff out due to the down pours of rain. Which we won't be moving Daughter2 in pouring rain...did that and not going that way again. Daughter2 did research for a moving truck *Hubby has CDL and thought she found the best. Hubby saw a moving truck she had not mentioned checking so he did and we can get 3 days at this place instead of only 1 day where she was going to rent from for cheaper than the 1 day.PLUS he didn't input our AARP discount.We ordered the appliances for 209 at Menards today, all was on sale plus they have their 11% rebate so we saved almost $1000 between the two.I did swagbucks goal 4 times this week.I did 2 pinecone surveys.I used the drying rack every day as Daughter2 is starting to wash some stuff that was in storage that she will need in her house.I shut the furnace off the day it was 70 outside, aired out the house. Closed house back up when sun was sitting, closing curtains and such. Realized the next morning when it was chilly I had forgot to turn the furnace back on and Daughter2 said she hadn't turned on the space heater either.We had to take Wilbur and Charlotte back in to get their stitches out, Charlotte had one get a little infected but instead of giving her pills the vet suggested we clean it 3 times a day, use people antibotic on it and then a coating of vaseline... 3 days later no infection, Since we were in there we had Rascal's nails clipped.I have been coughing since the beginning of Feb when I was sick with what I thought was a cold or allegry attack... went to the doctor, Nope I was getting over the flu.... he was surprised I wasn't down in the hospital thinking it was a Crohn's attack (I was nausated but never threw up) ANYWAYS... I am ran down HA HA from it so I now have meds for the cough and orders to rest or I won't be in any shape to work on 209 in a couple weeks. If the cough doesn't improve in a week I will be back on steriods (SIGH). In exchange of some work Daughter2 is doing for me I am stocking some of Daughter2's pantry from mine. She is working on getting the \"dry\" goods before she moves in and then the persishibles when her frig is up and running.I know I am getting the better end of the deal as I priced out gettting the work done and the lowest bid was $200 and she's not \"taking\" $200 worth of pantry. She said it's worth it to her as she won't have to spend time going to the store.The dreariness of the rainy days we are having to turn lights on, so we have taken to trying to sit together in one spot to only have on 1 light.I have been looking to replace the white 10 inch cornelle plates. The last of my set from 30 yrs ago just shattered. Even though I have a set of 4  Iris cornelle I miss the 10 inch white ones.They fit my serving bowls as lids besides being my serving platters. I've been without since last Nov and just wasn't willing to pay the price I was seeing. I found them on sale onsite, had a code to save even more, got swagbucks and ebates also and got four including the shipping for 50% off, 4 for the price of 2 I can handle.I bought Daddy a new cane using my Walgreen points to pay for it.I filled out the survery for Bob Evans after taking Daddy there and got another $4 off if we use it in the next 30 days. Which we will of course.I have done the normal routine, open and close curtains, turn furnace down (or off LOL), printer and computers turned off when not in use. Power strip to coffee pot off when not in use. . Sensor used on dryers or drying rack instead of dryer. Cold water wash with homemade laundry soap and white vinegar for softener. Water added to shampoo,conditioner, body soap,hand soap, dish soap, lotions etc.Use scrap paper from mail, paid bills  etc. Make sure I do my Krogers and Menard receipts so I can get my points from Krogers for fuel and the rebates from Menards. I've also been uploading receipts to Receipt hog for credits. I try to remember to look at Ibota and checkout 51. Mobisave doesn't work for me.When we get out meds from CVS I make sure Hubby uses the CVS card as I have the pharmacy rewards on my card. My fitbit is connected to Walgreens so I get points for walking and sleeping, two things I do anyways. Washed baggies , foil and bx inserts.My tomato plants I started from seed I saved from last year are still alive. Some look decent while others I wonder when they are going to just die.  Still ever one that grows and produces a tomato is a freebie.Can't think of anything else at this point .. Need to start writing it back down daily like I have in the past.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "209 update", "date": "Thursday, February 22, 2018", "text": "We have the appraisal back...that was about $10,000 more than we thought it would be let alone needed it to be.We have the house inspection back and we had actually covered everything needing done when we went over it with the contractor. SO nothing added there.The underwriter had some questions (they always do) and I already had that paperwork around incase they asked so that was dealt with within 30 min...Now it's just sit and wait 12 days for the closing.We played a bit and plugged some things into the program Hubby is using for free. The door to the left of the green door is the east front door (or house 2)The green door by the stove is actually a 4 x 8 green pegboard I hang my pots and pans on . The program didn't allow just green boards LOL. This is the south side of the kitchen and it going to be the cooking center. The little table is a 24 x 30 inch porcelian top I just found that I will make into a table to be by the stove. Hallway goes to the bedroom(blue)bathroom(orange) and laundryroom (lime green)The gray cabinet with white top is suppose to be our French door frig and the dark box is a blue metal cabinet that was my late husband's grandmothers. While looking at this I noticed I will need to have something to hang the onions and garlic from by the stove and a shelf for the hot pads.This is looking at the west wall that is the kitchen and dining area. Outside those French doors will be a deck and a huge red barn. The Hoosier cabinet we hope will fit here , the round table will actually be my retangle porcelian table (we made it round because we only could do round and square)that was my parents that came from their landlord's family when my parents married. This is going to be my \"baking center\". The cabinet on the far right of the purple wall is my china hutch (I know it fits there because the lady that lived there had hers there), square table is our dining table...the door at the china hutch goes to the mudroom.First door which is actually the middle door of north wall goes to the staircase. The other door going to the red room is the front room. The purple wall is on the east side. I might put a bookcase between the windows to hold my cookbooks. Microwave and the roll cart it sits on is at the end of the penisula that my white kitchenaid mixer is on (blue one is also with a blender but doesn't show well) The roll cart holds the Lifetime wear cooking pans my Daddy bought Mother for Christmas after they bought their house...and two weeks later he was laid off when the company he worked for closed.They remind me that even in really hard times it can be okay.This is the east wall. The dishwasher might be moved to the penisula since I am not willing to go without it and the contractor was having a issue getting it in the cabinet with the Crane sink. The penisula will be my prep area. I can see us eating breakfast and lunch there if it is just one of us.Hubby said it might let him be in the kitchen with me without me telling him to get out of the walk way LOL.  It can go unsaid that this is the cleaning area of the kitchen. I am thinking of hanging this on the wall where the coffee pots are sitting (on dishwasher).I might put a bar like this also by stove for hotpads...something to think about.I am pretty sure we have dowel rods in the garage here.I already got the curtains for the purple area(I did have to buy 1 set as I had 2 sets but they were half price so that was fine) I have a couple different curtains I can use at the sink if I feel that need as the porch is right there and it is roofed so I might not need one. I haven't figured out where to put the trash can but if Wilbur is still with us I am bungie cording it to the wall as his late mommy the beloved Weebles taught him to knock it over and take the lid off so she could eat the trash as she wasn't big enough to do it.It's not something we have gotten broke completely with him.Tomorrow we go to Menards and order the range,frig,dishwasher and a dryer since everything is on sale AND they have the 11% rebate. It will save us over $1000. By ordering it, it won't be in until after closing so we don't have to deal with it sitting here amongst Daughter 2's stuff.She was suppose to be able to start cleaning her new place this coming weekend but due to pouring rain the owner wasn't able to get all her stuff out. Not sure how that is going since owner is getting married out of state on Saturday. Frustrating on this end for Daughter2's family and us but can't blame the owner for not wanting to get her stuff soaked as we did when Daughter2 moved out of the last place.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "update on 209.", "date": "Sunday, February 11, 2018", "text": "This is a Hoosier cabinet. Hubby has decided to build me one some what like this one. Our contractor actually ran across a flour bin in the trash and snatched and is GIVING it to us with the condition he gets to see the final cabinet. I'll be having it sealed to make it food safe.I don't think it's an original and neither does the contractor but still. Porcelian tables are not made any longer (I have an actually table that is about 100 yrs old) so Hubby is going to do butcher block of the table part.Hubby is looking to put cedar inside the cabinet to help keep pantry moths at bay.I've been looking at kitchen layouts from 1900-1930s . I found the following pictures at kitchen apartment therapy. https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/   I love this site.1929 apartment ... looks like yellow and green are common kitchen colors through the decades.1920s kitchen. yellow and blue. Love the china cupboard.This is Hubby's favorite as it has the Crane sink and the large Hoosier style cabinet. 1929 back to green and with yellow and orange in the flooring and accents on doors1900-1920... this reminds me of what was there when we first looked at the house and its my favoritethe bump outs remind me of 209, it's the reverse of ours but still... Some green and orange in this one.Being frugal with dealing this house (even if we didn't have the money going out for electric, heat, plumbing etc we would be frugal) is time consuming at times. I research for the best deals from my need to buy list, get used or on sales or with rebates. Tracking what we buy is necessary for when we sell it (or the kids do after we die) to lower the capital gains tax. We are pretty much at the point of having to wait to we can start working on the house (after closing). We also look at this as a 30 yr investment and already had set the payment with taxes, ins etc to be BELOW what social security would pay if we took it early at age 62 so we wouldn't be stressed about paying medical ins and the house or having to go back to work like several we know.Some are thinking we are nuts with what is going on with the stock market and being retired and then spending a small fortune on a home but we planned for this expense 10 years ago and still are remaing under budget (shock there). A close friend said something about being on a fixed income and I reminded them that they were working and on a fixed income as they are on salary AND could be laid off tomorrow without benefits. Nothing is certain ever except we live and die.He went home and told his wife he was retiring out and they needed to figure out what to do to stay in the home when they got older.The home inspector has went through and the HUD appraiser also has, so now it's wait for the paperwork and the final amount we need for down payment and closing costs.Sometimes it is overwhelming with appointments and shopping and decision making, other times it just drags forever."},

The only negative I found was I had to carry a lint brush with me as Charlotte's baby fine white fur stuck very well to it.  I wore it when we went to Basil's on Market for our Valentine's day dinner. Early but we got the all you can eat crab legs with house salad and truffle french fries for $30/each . It's not a meal on their menu.  Each time they brought out more crablegs for us( we ate 4 claws (4-5 \"fingers\") each their brought out more truffle french fries... I have enough french fries for a meal for the 3 of us if not more.Top it will chili, sour cream and cheese and call it done.I did notice that even though you could order a drink, appetizers etc plus the special. every single person that was getting the crab leg special was only ordering water to go with the meal.We decided since there is Valentines day and our anniversary(I made reservations for this meal at Basil's on Market) and we wanted to eat out at a nice sit down restaurant we would not get any fast food this month .We will be taking Daddy to Bob Evans but we have a coupon and gift card for that and Daddy pays the tip.We have been eating from the pantry, have not been to the grocery store since Jan 31s Someone is going to have to stop and get milk/ half and half/ heavy cream probably Monday.I used all the half and half and the heavy cream and custard pie is on the menu as I use a 1949 recipe.Daughter 2 got excited as I opened the beef veggie soup I had canned last fall. She is the only one that eats it in her house. She got a new place and will be moving March 1st. I will have to vacuum my own floors SIGH  well I won't when we move in new house ... HA HA.  Next time I can Veggie soup, I'll can some pints for her.I see empty spots in the pantry and freezers which is good though part of me wants to refill it...not doing that so don't have to move it.Lots of sales right now and I just started pitching the ads directly into the burn trash so not to even think about it.I washed baggies, box inserts,and foil.Daughter 2 brought home some plasticware that someone had left at work and didn't claim. She washed it out and brought it home. Hung delicates on drying rack, washed heavy clothes first so if they weren't completely dry they went in with second load for dryer. Cold water, homemade laundry soap and vinegar for the softener.Mixed water with dish soap, hand soap, body soap, shampoo and conditioner. Used orange peel vinegar to clean floors.Turned off coffee pots, laptops and printer when not in use. Daughter 2 said she is down to running heater in her room 6 hrs if that.Reloaded the medications, toilet paper, paper towels and dog treats from storage in upstairs.Reloaded dried fruit and M&M s from storage upstairs.Didn't go anywhere as Charlotte and Wilbur got fixed from Wed to Friday...Vet said she wasn't pregnant as I had him make sure before surgery, yes that was an unnecessary expense  but I feel better about the choice of surgery at this time. They are doing fine, Charlotte is recovering faster that Wilbur due to her age even though her surgery was more than his.Her favorite place to sleep even though she thinks she's hiding (under a glass dining table) and is now too big to curl in the middle.Wilbur was goofy. He slept most of the evening and then got up and did thisYes he is totally asleep standing with his head on the couch by Hubby. Hubby picked him up and laid him on couch.I transplanted the tomato seedlings I had started.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Feb goals/ 209 update", "date": "Friday, February 2, 2018", "text": "First 209 update. We signed loan papers as our mortgage guy held them when he found FHA was increasing amt allowed and he redid them...COOL .Him doing that saved us $5000 down payment and over $20,000 in interest in the long run.FHA home inspector is being scheduled along with HUD appraiser so closing is going to be close to March 6th. We spent 3 hrs with our contractor today going over the project binder I put together for him that will also be at the site.It was great to hear I love this, I am so happy you did this repeatedly as he said it will make his job a lot easier.. He had salvaged a 1950s Crane sink and is going to have it refinished for me. He will be either building a cabinet or reinforcing a boughten cabinet which ever is cheaper plus he helped me pick out a counter top that is more into what I am looking for that can handle the heavy sink.We set the budget for what we have on the have to buy list for the house and are looking at Habitat restore shops. Charlie (contacter) is also going to look through his warehouses to see if he has somethings that he savaged that is \"Cheaper\" for us and suggested I let his crew paint our ceilings as I am still having issues with my arm. Gave us the price with us buying the paint and supplies.  We stopped on the way home at one Restore home and got a fan for half the price it would have been new and it works.Grocery... after seeing the % of what I bought in dairy in Jan I have decided to keep the $250 as the Food money for Feb BUT lower what I bought of each. We eat a LOT of cheese. SO if I am keeping with having snacking cheese , then the cheese in the food needs to be  lowered. I can increase the milk or yogurt.as we use cheese to replace protein at times. Junk food was higher than normal but that's because I bought Daughter's 2 Pepsi as it was on sale. I bought corn chips ( I can't eat corn chips) for walking taco's and tortilla chips for nachos bellegrande .Daughter eats tortilla chips with guac as her breakfast and late night snack. More guac then chip and she buys the guac.I did get some black bean hummus that I will like to make from scratch. I have the list of ingredients that was in the mix to play with.I am waiting to see what the electric bill is with Daughter 2 using a space heater to heat her bedroom. She's good about keeping it turned low or even off once she gets the room warm. This past week she's had to keep in on all night due to having one of the dogs with her and us having to shut the staircase door which stops heat from going up at all from propane furnace due to Charlotte being in heat. We know that Wilbur doesn't spend the night HOWLING if he sleeps with me and Charlotte sleeps with Daughter 2. Charlotte whines a bit with Daughter 2 but she's not a barker or howler and snuggling her will calm her down to sleep. Rascal sleeps with me or on the loveseat in the front room.I have to sit down and figure things.Blessed BeThe tracker I uses goes for Jan 1st to the 31st. So even though we only get paid once a month around the 15th. We will be running the grocery budget by month  instead of half months.I set the budget for Jan at $420  with the goal to come in closer to $250.Shelf costs of food bought       $437.19coupons                                    $ 14.13discounts                                  $194.55total savings                            $208.68 (47.73 %)Out of pocket                         $228.5130 % is fresh produce, 50 % is dairy and the other 15% is a mix of ingredients for special meals,5 % junk food as I also bought Daughter 2 pepsi since it was on sale.Out of this  amount I spent in Jan ,$160 I just spent the 31st for the month of Feb.SO I decided to set Feb budget for $250."},
{"title": "update on 209", "date": "Monday, January 29, 2018", "text": "Okay , this picture shows where the 2 front doors are. Hubby doesn't have the 2 front porches on this but they are at the front doors. The door in the green room is the back door. We will be installing the French doors in the yellow room(kitchen) and then the deck by the end of summer if not sooner.The area on the front of the house were the double windows are do not have a porch.The deadline we have given ourselves to be moved completely to 209 is Sept 6th. Our landlord doesn't care if we go pass that date and as long as we give him 30 days notice of us being completely out he is fine.That's the date were we will start stressing of making double payments of rent and mortgage. Can you tell we have done this before?We have changed the laundry room(green room) to be in the closet (top left sliver mist room) and we will put Baby (7cf chest freezer) in the mudroom which is what we are calling the green room ...the colors of the rooms will be flipped to the closet being lime green and the mudroom silver mist. I plan to put a door in the closet where the window is because the clothes line is right there in a couple years.. You can barely see the top of the window in this layout in that room. I would rather have my laundry in the closet where I can immediately put clothes away than at the door where everyone comes in and out. Also it's easier to clean the dryer vent with it in the closet as it will go directly through the wall of the house and NOT through the crawl space and thourgh the foundation.Less chance of wind freezing pipes also due to air from vent coming in.Our mortgage guy, Rex called Friday morning and asked us to connect with contractor,Charlie and finalize the items for the house. Rex is at step 4 which needs the final bids. This is about 3 weeks ahead of schedule.Got a hold of Charlie,our contractor, who was stressing a little until I made it clear that  we understood he probably wouldn't be able to start early but we had things we could to that would help him like remove the line closet where the bathroom door needs to be widened and remove the shelves where the wheelchair shower will be.SO we are meeting this week to finalize the items to keep the FHA loan moving along. The more we pay cash for, the less we will owe on the loan so the less we will pay in interest.ON the frugal side, we bought part of the general paint supplies, the track lighting for over the kitchen sink, a double shower rod for the orange bathroom, a 3 arm rack for the kitchen sink dish cloths, 2 entry rugs for the porches, 4 new exterior door hands with dead bolts to put on AFTER the work is done and a Keysafe so we don't have to be there to let workers in at Menards with 11% rebate.I have bookmarked items on sale at Home Depot that  I want as soon as we meet with Charlie to make sure he can't get them cheaper as that sale goes off first part of March so I will order them if I need to.We started pulling items we have stored from houses we have lived in so we are \"saving\" the moneySo far we have found for the kitchen... 8 light chandelier (actually I have it hanging above me right now as we took down the ceiling fan that was there) saving $217.80 and a 3 light hanging pot rack savings $398.99. We have found a wooden medicine cabinet for orange bathroom saving$44.98 and a white medicine cabinet (needs a bit of work of fixing door to stay shut) saving $39.99 for WC bath (WC stands for wheelchair). Add the 7.5 % tax we pay that's a savings of $1,070.44The only piece of furniture I know for sure we will be buying is a recliner  for Hubby.I will continue to shop Habitat for Restore, Goodwill and auctions. I wished it was yardsale season LOLBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Last week of Jan", "date": "Sunday, January 28, 2018", "text": "One of the \"plates\" I have made from our dinner and shoved in frig for Daughter 2 to eat when she gets in around 11 PM. She had bought a white wine with herbs marinade for chicken which we loved so I picked up some more of the packages that were on sale and made this porkchop with OJ which was an option. I might try chicken with pineapple juice which is another option listed on the package. She is now splitting a lunch with the server that works with her so she's not bringing leftovers home and both are saving money.Hubby had bfast with some of his old co workers and used a gift card he was given when he retired.I went to the store for odds and ends after our chiro appt(all errands at same time) and used the gift card that was bought for Dec/Jan groceries....still have $50 on the card and ALL of the money set ($420)aside for Jan/Feb(we run bills from 15th to 15th since that's when we get Hubby's retirement check)We have washed plastic bags, foil, bread sacks and inserts to boxed food(not many of those).We ate from the pantry until Friday night when we ordered a extra large pizza that has fed the 3 of us all weekend (added salad, fruit etc) since both Hubby and Daughter 2 was in and out with things that meant they weren't even home during the night. I thought I would get a quiet night.. nope dogs decided they needed out ever 2 hrs and since Charlotte isn't completely potty trained I wasn't going to just tell her to go lay down. One of them always pottied but the other two must have just went along.Curtains are open to sunshine and closed with it's dreary and with windchills.We no longer open the staircase to upstairs until Daughter 2 texts us that she is coming home. Told us to not turn on heater unless the windchill is below 10° as she has noted when she really needs to have it warmed up otherwise she will turn it on when she gets home and gets around for bed. As she has sever curvature of the spine we don't want the cold to trigger pain which is why she focused on when she needed the heater turned on sooner. She's paying the difference between what we budget for electric and what it costs so she's really trying to keep it down.She started using the drying rack for when she doesn't have a full load of laundry. She has also tossed some of our laundry in to make a full load in the washer, side benny I don't have to do our laundry. 😉 when she does that.We turned the furnace down 2 ° during the day when there is sunshine and 6° at night when we aren't getting the windchills.We are buying items for 209 and keeping a  running budget. We went to Mendards for their 11 % rebate( after chiro appt also) to pick up some of the items. I stayed focused of general items that I know we will need like paint rollers, shower curtain rod, that kind of stuff. We meet with the contractor this week to finalize the plans so the mortgage guy can move to the next step of the rehab loan of 2 different inspections...things are moving a little quicker than planned according to the contractor as he had planned to have this meeting mid Feb so that's okay with us even if it means he won't actually start until mid March as he had planned as there is plenty of work for us to start on and not be in his way.Daughter 2 was given a name of a restaurant that has all you can eat crab legs on Fridays until the end of Lent for $30/person...She KNOWS I love crab legs so she passed the info along to us as our anniversary is mid Feb and we were looking for a different place to eat out at.She is also bringing home boxes and pieces of cardboard to use to separate the canning jars so won't have to buy so many speciality boxes for my 1000 plus canning jars....more on that on the 209 post.Not frugal but definitely will save my sanity ...might be frugal if I don't have a break down over the work load LOL... I am putting together a project binder for 209... printing off things we need the contractor to do (kitchen sink, cabinets, countertop, what lights etc)so it should help eleminate part of the \"got to call and ask\" Need this answer etc. Put everything on hold until we get over there (an hour away and yes we have the gas budgeted for that for daily trips for 6 months). Gathering things we have in storage we can reuse in the house."},
{"title": "209 ... the new house", "date": "Thursday, January 25, 2018", "text": "Hubby has been playing on a free program he downloaded  and made a layout of 209 which is what we call the new house.This is the first floor plan and the layout of the kitchen and the color of paints we think we want. Vibrate is the word LOL.Starting left bottom...is master bedroom is sapphire blue or it maybe be a powder blue but the program didn't have that shade. Room in upper left corner can be used for a closet is silver mist, we might make it into a sewing room/office and just build closet in bedroom like the other 3 bedrooms.Orange room will be standard bathroom with tub/shower comb. Yellow is the hall and the kitchen \"area\". The one wall of purple (other side is purple also) is what we call sitting area/ office/ what ever.There is a wall at the base of the stairs to the upstairs...we will be taking the built in hall tree out to open that up so we can get a full size bed box springs up those steps. Both sets of staircases have beautiful wood for walls. Red room is Hubby's favorite red and is the front room. This is also the red we had when we were raising the kids on Church st. Lime green is mudroom/laundry room and the pale lilac is the wheelchair accessible bathroom.  We are now matching those colors to paint chips we have and having 3-4 different shades of the color and will tape them to the walls when we start on the house. All woodwork will be glossy white  There will be a deck off the kitchen through the French doors and we will be redoing the porches on the front also.Menards was having their 11% rebate this week so we started picking up things we know we need to starting buying for 209. This is the light we are putting over the sink.We have had this chandelier for over 20 yrs and decided to clean it up and install it over the peninsula in the kitchen since the ceilings are only 8 ft , that way no one bashed their head.This pot rack we also have had over 20 yrs, will be cleaned up and used over what ever new LP gas range I get.I've had this ceiling light for over 30 yrs. I am not sure where it's going its going . Hubby said he could rewire it so it's like a hanging swag light.My Pop gave me this light after he found it at a yardsale because it reminded him of me. I wasn't living where we could use it. I told Hubby even if it doesn't go in the house , it was going in the barn...which would fit Pop to a tee as he has several of old lights hanging in his barn for light.This is the sink we have chose.I think I would prefer to handles instead of this one but this is what we saw so priced it. I can deal with not having 2 handles. I bought paint rollers, paint plastic tray liners, paint guards to keep paint off floor, double curved shower rod (only bought one as I can't remember if I need one for wheelchair shower) and I bought this.As Daddy suggested I get this for the kitchen so I can hang not only my dish cloth but a rag for other stuff to get away from paper towels.More later..right now I have to work on the binders.Blessed be"},

", "date": "Wednesday, January 24, 2018", "text": "First this is what I bought...from J Peterman as my birthday gift for myself.This is definitely my style though way more than I usually spend. I can tell you it will definitely keep me warm in the cold months as it is lined and the lace is attached to the liner.  I can take tucks in the waist if I ever lose any more weight ( I really hope to stay stable there as if I lose more weight and have a Crohn's attack I will end up being underweight with in a week) another bonus, is I could make a simple pattern from the skirt.This is close to the hoodie I used to borrow from my one grandson. He passed it to me after he out grew it and I wore it out after wearing it 5 more years. I wanted something more dressy than a sweatshirt type hoodie Once again, more than I usually pay.Awhile back I bought jeans on sale with a couple gift cards that I had been given... Faded Glory boot cut and a couple pairs of this that has became my favorite jeansLevi Strauss Signature curvy boot cut... (this is the model for Walmart)I already checked I do have plenty of warm weather clothes so won't need to be buying anything. I do hope HA HA to have time to do some sewing of skorts and aprons but with doing the house and everything I am doubtful of that being done as I will be making curtains for the house warm weather first and cold weather second.I already bought \"summer\" shoes when they were on clearance at Walmart.

Monday .we had ham (from son 2 in exchange for part of the prime rib we had Christmas Eve) sandwiches and broccoli cheese soup...using up one bag of cheese that we really don't care for but was given. Worked well in the soup. I met my Swagbucks goal PLUS got 100 more for a survey that I did while BORED and didn't want to just surf the web or social media. NOT FRUGAL.. I ordered a skirt and a hoodie from J Peterman catalog...if you are not familar with this company I can tell you the clothes are expensive...some vintage or in the style of vintage. I ran across this company while reading Simple Abundance several years ago and have looked at the catalog for YEARS as I read Simple Abundance each year as a devotional . I saw a skirt and hoodie that I LOVED last year...but thought as a bit too much ...okay A LOT too much for my style of living...but every time I checked the catalog that was what I looked for.. It went on sale for 50% off...My birthday is in a few days...I have my spending money allowence (we give ourselves $50 a month for what ever we want) for Dec-Jan and now Jan - Feb....I have $25 in change saved.... I put in on my credit card ...knowing I HAVE to have it paid off in 3 wks... It was just under $200 with shipping. That's not frugal SIGH. Hubby said if I wear it like I have my winter coat ( 10 years )and my little black dress(now 30 plus years ) My demin skirt (20 plus years) then it's not a bad buy.Since I just got rid of the hoodie I wore when the Daughter 1 was in Jr high (she's 46 this year) I think I can wear both long enough to not regret the money spent.Jan16th  Tuesday .Having leftover ham slices, mashed potato patties from leftover mashed potatoes , green beans from pantry and biscuits. I woke up cold this morning due to WilburHe must have gotten cold through the night and took ALL the blankets on the bed to make himself a bed. I woke up with a flannel sheet and Charlotte curled into me trying to stay warm herself. Thankfully since I am not willing to fight a boxer (LOL) over blankets I had a couple fleece throw blankets at the top and covered Charlotte and myself up.  Back is definitely not happy with having been cold through the night.Jan 17th..Wednesday.We spent the afternoon measuring the rooms at the new house (209 is what we call it as it is on township road 209) , Ate lunch at Arby's over by the house since I didn't plan to be there nor had anything to pack to eat before or after being there. Thankful for the Amish family that allowed us to come in (didn't have to because closing isn't until March) and our realtor that took her lunch time to let us in.We had scalloped potatoes and ham casserole for dinner using the last of the ham.Jan 18th... Thursday. My 59th birthday. Hubby asked what I wanted to do and I chose to go see my Daddy. Best birthday present ever was/is having Daddy as my dad and I made sure he knew I felt truely blessed for having him. Hubby bought 3 -4 piece chicken dinners from the local restaurant for dinner so I wasn't cooking as Daughter 2 didn't get in until 11 after her youngest ball game.Jan 19th ... Friday, I caught a charge on bank account that shouldn't be there .. a bank fee so the bank told us to come in on Monday so we can sit down as they know what triggered it...Hubby only gets \"paid\" once a month instead of weekly and software didn't regisiter that he had more than enough to go in to NOT have that fee...they also think they have a better account for fit our needs. Daughter 2 vacuumed the house, I swept the bathroom and kitchen and Hubby did the dishes. Daughter 2 also did our laundry when she did her own so I could focus on starting to put the binders together for working on 209. We had summer sausage /pepperoni , cheese and crackers for lunch and leftovers for dinner.Jan 20th... Saturday. Daugher 2 straightened up the frig (she has OCD so I ignore it when she straightens something as I have seen her pick up dog toys and put them in order of size where I toss the toys) and then since her boys were all at friends or doing something with their stepbrothers she went to have a PJ party at a girlfriends house... She borrowed a few DVDs and took some creamcheese with dried Italian salad dressing and crackers. She will roll the creamcheese in the dry dressing. Plus she took some yogurt and Grapenuts to make parfaits for breakfast. All what we had here. Hubby and I worked on drawling plans, making lists and starting 2 sets of project plan binders..one for the house the other for here. We ate leftovers and basically snacked.Jan 21st Sunday...Heavens, Charlottewent out this morning and got mud(and cow poop) from her chin to her tail. Looked like she laid in it, might have crawled under the gate but what a mess. She got a bath...not thrilled but at least it wasn't a fight to keep her in the tub. Tub got sanitized and I then got a bath and everything got washed. Frugal part was I had kept the oatmeal soap I used on Miss Kira so I didn't use blue Dawn which is what I use on Rascal.We had friends as us to meet them for dinner at Hong Kong today, but Son 2 wanted to go also and wanted it to be for lunch since he is furloughed and that was the cheaper meal. They were willing  so we are going for lunch instead. I have a coupon that we were going to use for us and decided to let Son 2 use instead. We will have bacon Sandwiches for dinner tonight. I haven't done any grocery shopping this week.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Retirement Mid Jan", "date": "Monday, January 15, 2018", "text": "Okay, I would have to say flipping to retirement ins has been a lesson in having patience for companies that do not have things in place BEFORE it's needed. We are still waiting for the money that Hubby's company gave him for medical, still waiting for our insurance to show I am covered and not just Hubby. I just want to bang my head on the table when I keep getting excuses as why things are still messed up after 6 wks of dealing when it was suppose to be only 4 wks..Glad we put back 3 months of costs of ins in savings since we are having to use OUR money instead of the money the company gave us for that.Glad We put back the FULL amount of out of pocket/deductible also because we are using it to pay medical bills because they keep saying Hubby is covered under family plan but I am not the family...I'm the only other one besides him on this insurance.Glad we had 3 months of household bill amts in savings so we weren't late in paying the bills when it took 4 days to transfer his monthly amt from his 401k to our checking...don't seem to have even a 1 day delay when it comes out of the checking for bills so I don't understand the issue of it going in to the checking. BUT still at least our bank warned us to not count on it for 5 business days.Glad he isn't driving to work every night during these winter storms that keep hitting every 3-4 days.Paying bills once a month is kind of yucky... but I found we actually save more money when worried we won't have money towards the \"end\" off our month, which is actually the middle of the month now.We are more focused on what we can make do with now to have money when we move which we priced out at $4000 not counting someone to pack it in their boxes, just load it and drive it and unload it.. We plan on FREE boxes except for my canning jars, just because we have dealt with broken canning jars of food. Daughter 2 thinks some of the boxes they get in would work for canning jars boxes also so she is going to bring them home if I ever can get her to REMEMBER as she is leaving work LOL.Blessed BeThis is one of the 3 upstairs bedrooms. Two of them are this size, the 3rd is a bit smaller.There is one area that isn't finished that we are debating on making attic storage or another bedroom.Probably will be storage as it has NO windows and unless we put in skylights there is not another option for a window. Might be just me but I have problems with rooms without windows.Beautiful wood...BUT I am not a fan of total wood BUT I don't want to remove it or paint it either... A friend suggested I leave the ceiling part wood and make a \"quilt\" railing to hang fabric from . Then I could change the \"colors\" as I wanted and not mess up the wood. Might work...I could even change the fabric due to the seasons.Since the central air will not be in this area we decides on this style of ductless ACNone of the bedrooms have closets. Two of the are open lofts with no privacy at all.We thought about doing something along this line, this is a partial walland it also being the back of the closet. . Daughter 2 lived in a house that had these type of sloping ceilings in the bedrooms said they put in drawers on the lower side and the double bars on the higher side and it worked decent for her sons, one that has more clothes than his mother LOL.. Still in thinking stage as this probably won't be done until next fall/winter.The well has been chlorinated and flushed and tested so that's off the list. Still waiting on getting the septic tank cleaned that the septic tested but the winter storms rolling through has been an issue.Contractor is having 2 antique sinks refinished and I get first choice to look is I want one of them for the kitchen... If not I have picked this one outThe top faucet is probably what I will buy as it is the style I have used for years and does well with my large pots.Hubby liked this type of shower head for  the showers. Son 2 has one and it does well for handicap also.We both thought this style faucet would be good for the bathroom sinks and tub.or maybe one with two handles for the water but same style.We don't know if we will have ceiling lights but we are looking to see what we like. We also know we want an outside light at each door but haven't found \"the one\" yet. We have a chandelier,pot rack, 2 ceiling fans and 2 old copper lights that we could reuse.This is the color (cherry cocoa) and style of the kitchen cabinets I chose. I don't want my kitchen to blend in since the dining room.family room and kitchen are one room. I would love to have a granite counter top with shades of green and rust(copper) in it but I can't afford granite so our contractor is looking to see what he can find in our price range to give me the same look.Appliances will be blackthis in black with brass handles would be my dream stove...not sure that dream is going to happen because it is the last thing we will buy.We have to replace our French door with freezer on the bottom frig as our repairman said it was dying . He's repaired it four times already and it's on it's last legs. Guess 10 yrs is the best you can get now days. I have a smaller second one so if it goes out before we are ready to replace it.I hope the microwave doesn't crap as it's on the \"old\" side also.We have to start thinking about furniture also as somethings we have too much and others what we have needs redone or replaced.Enjoy the dayBlessed BeBut Mommy I am so sweet and innocentHe deserved to have his face ripped off.Life with a puppy. The only good part is this is a stuffed bear that the youngest grandson was going to throw away as there is no place around here that will take used stuffed toys so he gave it the pup.Pup had it 3 months before she decided he needed to die.Tuesday we went to town for an appointment so took stuff to Goodwill and check in the store for a pole lamp. There was no lamp but I was able to get Daughter( actually I should list daughters as 1,2,3,and 4...she would be 2) 3 dozen plastic hangers and 2 pairs of gloves for $7.We went to Menard's to get dog food, distilled water for humidifier,a clip on light for above the stove due that light fixture dying and 3 pots for Daughter's vines she has salvaged from a dying plant.Along with what was on the list we found a pole lamp in our price range,got LED light bulbs for the pole lamp and clap lamp(I did not want to buy a new fixture since we are moving and won't have that stove  after wards and we decided only LED lights at the new home) Out of pocket ZERO as we used the rebates we had saved. We also checked out some sinks, faucets and lights that we might want for the new house.We went to Kroger's and got milk, heavy cream, half and half, cottage cheese, chip dip, sour cream, Greek yogurt,colby cheese(sliced for daughter), Single serving package of guac(daughter's lunches), moz sticks, red and green leaf lettuce, romaine lettuce, bibb lettuce , baby spinach, carrots,celery, broccoli,Frito's, chips and a beef roast as Son #1 called and said he was coming home tomorrow to visit for the day (he didn't make it home for Christmas due to work) so I decided a pot roast with root veggies would work as I wouldn't be in the kitchen and we could do more visiting. I had a small roast that would work for 2 people but not enough for 4.... out of pocket for the groceries of $131. ZERO ... I had a gift card that I used.FINALLY they figured out what was wrong with our health ins BILLING acct and got it fixed so we can at least get it set up on auto pay. AND they got it so we can check our health ins.I made my Swag buck's goal 4 times this week.I saved 3 five dollar bills and 5 one dollar bills and some change for our Christmas savings.WEDNESDAY  We finished taking down the Christmas decorations and picking up some down limbes out in the yard. I decluttered a cabinet in the kitchen. Ate beef roast(what I had bought along with what was in the freezer) with the potatoes from root celler  I tossed in the roaster with it and salad and the last of the cookie brownies and cherry pie while visiting SON 1. Daughter got in late after taking her son home after he got off work as his car is broke down and in the repair shop.THURSDAY. Strange to not be finance day after decades of it being finance day. So I just checked to make sure everything was as it was suppose to be.Dropped off Fed ex stuff to local hardware store pick up. Got gas at the cheapest place according to Gasbuddy, went to the bank and then put the mail in the mail box at the end of the lane on the way back in.Basically it was a big block drive so the dogs got a ride this morning. I decluttered the mudroom and sorted through the fruit we store there and cleaned out the mudroom frig. Need to inventory it still but at least nothing falls out when you open the door. Hubby straightened up his tools so he isn't buying something because he couldn't find it.Hubby and SON 1 along with a friend plan to go deep sea fishing this fall , celebrete Hubby's retirement and turning 60. Friend found a better deal for 1/3rd the original price so they are going to lock that deal down NOW.Realtor called and let us know the outhouse will be torn down tomorrow and the septic guy who lives right aroung the corner will hopefully be able to deal with cleaning it and running the test by tomorrow evening if the weather we are getting doesn't put a stop all the whole project. Freezing rain and sleet tonight, 4-7 inches of snow over night with 30 mph winds tomorrow...Hubby bought us sandwiches for dinner using a coupon and gift card so ZERO out of pocket.FRIDAYUnder a winter weather advisory. Rain this morning, freezing rain/sleet to come along with 3-5 inches of snow and 30 mph winds..... Daughter 2 had to drive an hour in this crap to make appts for her sons that the ex made and then he had to go work out of state... since he is working OUTSIDE in this crap she felt he got the worse end of this deal. BUT since it was crap , she stayed in that area with friends.SO Hubby and I ate odds and ends out of the frig for our dinner. Hubby listened to the scanner and checked on neighbors and friends by phone to make sure everyone was doing ok. We didn't lose electric but a friend did and had some issues getting his generator to run even after just checking to make sure it was good last week.We turned the furnace up since we have 2 more tanks to use before we move. Landlord said if we didn't use it all he would buy it from us since he will still have to keep heat in the house so it isn't going to be us losing money. He also reminded us he still had our deposit and he could use it for the last month we are here if we wanted to do it that way or we could pay and then he give back the deposit when we leave.Landlord told us to turn the water off to the barn as there is going to be no animals in it except the pig(he has a water trough that is filled by bucket, we can fill that in the house if landlord's son doesn't want to transport water from his house that's 1 1/2 miles away). That means we don't have to worry about those pipes freezing. YEAH for all of us.I inventoried the spice and herb cabinet (took measurements of cabinet so I know what I will need to build when we move). There is over 100 of them, that's down over 20 and I am making a list of what I need to focus on using up that I used cheffing but not so much at home, I would like to get these used up first since there is over 20 of them and that's about a shelf. My canning ingredients (pectin, citric acid etc) is also in this cabinet so I listed it so when the season starts I will already know what I need to get.I also know what I need to plant at the new house immediately so I might start those in pots to get them going.SATURDAY...I'm home alone with 3 dogs that think that means it's a free for all... LOL.Daughter 2 scheduled an appt to see a apartment at noon as the roads should be better in the area she stayed over night in. The person showing it said if she had to cancel due to weather she would call her and let her know and then they set up an appt as a back up on Tuesday at 10 just in case the roads weren't clear today. Figures cross that this apt will work for her and she can get it if it does. Gets her and the boys all back together and in school district they already are in.  She is also looking at some house rentals today since she is in the area.Hauling kids to games, practices and work ...you know parent stuff. Doing what she can for the stepmom that now has 7 kids under her roof. ( Just update, Daughter 2 didn't get to see the apartment so her and the manager are trying to work out a time this week)Hubby is at a SCARES event today all day that tests how their HAM radios work in bad weather ,I think they ordered the weather and it came in early :), and what distance the radio signal will go.SO I decided on using the chili I canned for dinner tonight.Our \"paycheck\" LOL as in our monthly stipend for retirement came in yesterday so today is finance day. Takes 4 days for it to process so I can do better about knowing when it will actually come in.I made a menu of the whiteboard of 5 meals I am fixing this week , not in order because that depends on what is going on. I will make plan overs from the leftovers to get the other 2-3 meals.I will list what work, eg inventory, decluttering, packing I plan to do this week as Daughter 2 says it helps that she can look at my list when she gets in at night and see if she can do anything to help.SUNDAYI fixed beef and noodles and mashed potatoes. Beef and broth was from the roast I made on Wed. I have a quart of some of the beef and broth for soup for Hubby and me that I put in frig,if we don't eat it today or tomorrow I will freeze it.I repotted Daughter2 vines into bigger pots that have drainage holes in the bottom so it's healthier for the vines. I planted tomato seeds I had harvested from some field paste tomatoes (first time doing that so not sure if they will do well). I did some winter sowing using this website http://www.agardenforthehouse.com/2018/01/winter-sowing/. I planted kale, mustard, winter lettuce, mache and spinach. Kind of weird to do this for me but I didn't have to buy anything so if it works I know to plan on using it again.I got my Swagbucks goal X 7. I usually get half the points through crave first thing in the morning while I do my devotionals and book work. I might have to get on a couple times a day to get it down but right now I want to earn as much as I can within reasonable time to get gift cards for the dogs needs.Have a warm and safe weekBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Jan Frugal", "date": "Monday, January 8, 2018", "text": "Tuesday I cleaned out the kitchen frig and organized it to suit the changes we decided to make in our diet. I gave our small grocery list to our Daughter to pick on her way home from work that night  as she was stopping to get herself some stuff...guess that was a REALLY frugal move because she FORGOT to get what I added to HER list. We still haven't went to the store. BUT we are now down to 1 pint of milk and 2 of us take milk in our coffee so either tomorrow or Monday I will be making the store run.Wednesday and Thursday I inventoried the 80 % butler's pantry and all of the kitchen frig freezer. We ate from the pantry.Friday I took down the Christmas stuff and dealt with that. Took ALL the empty canning jars and put them in the packing boxes we bought just for them. Hubby didn't realize I had that many empty. We ate leftoversSaturday I sorted condensed some of the food stuff and washed about 2 more cases of canning jars and boxed them up. I made pasta with meat sauce and garlic cheddar biscuits. Since it was suppose to get really bad Hubby bought milk at the gas station since he was topping off the truck. Frugal because that is all we have bought , not frugal as it cost $4 for the gal. Daughter felt bad as it was on the list of the stuff she forgot.Sunday we went to our landlord's 50th birthday party. Daughter decided to stay home, her OCD kicked in after 2 days of being at home and we came home to a clean house and laundry done but she forgot to fix supper(her night to cook so she ordered and paid for calzones from the local pizza joint. Since she had never ordered from there she didn't realize how big they were so we now have leftover calzones for another meal.Today I had doctor appt about my shoulder/arm (the one they operated on) So Hubby drove and ran a couple errands he had while I was in the doctor...GOOD news is it is NOT the shoulder. Bad news it is my CP causing some issues with my bicep which already have tendonitis. I got a shot that should help in a couple of days when the freaking pain of having it injected into my shoulder joint wears off.I fixed. SINCE I know how bad the pain is going to get with this shot I fixed one pot green beans potatoes and ham. White corn bread in a cast iron skillet, cherry pie and a box mix that I bought at Aldi's at Thanksgiving that was a brownie toppped by choc chip cookie dough.. between that and the leftover calzone we should be fed for a few days."},
{"title": "WHAT THE ???? Retirement mess up.", "date": "Saturday, January 6, 2018", "text": "Hubby just laughed but I was frustrated.

Health ins will send us a paper bill (already let us know how much and gave us a 30 day grace period since it wasn't our screw up).BUT REALLY???!!!!ON TOP of at 12/31/17 my specialist and primary doctor became out of network... primary willing to work with us ...specialist wasn't allowed to so referred me to her own specialist...THEN on the news on 1/2/18 we saw were they had made an AGREEMENT to keep  the specialist IN net work on 12/26/17...

{"title": "OFFER ACCEPTED", "date": "Friday, January 5, 2018", "text": "Sellers have accepted our offer, they have already moved out of the house, still working at getting their greenhouse and garden shed removed and clearing out the woodworking area in the barn. We have preapproval of a REHAB loan (plus we have back up $$ incase something falls through)as this house belongs to AMISH...no electric, plumbing or heat since they took the wood burning stoves (our ins wouldn't cover them anyways as primary heat). A total of 5 acres which 3 acres behind the barn is in hay right now so we will be figuring out what to do about that. Amish neighbor might be willing to take care of mowing it if he can have the hay in exchange of it. The acre next to the house is in hay also but I think I am going to move the gardens to that area next year...that is a wait and see how it goes for a year or so.I have named the sections to not confuse Hubby and me about which half we are talking about. Section closest to driveway is house 1 (used to be garage) and the other is house 2. The smaller middle section is how the garage attached to the house.This will be our veiw from the front porch or my kitchen window since I took one look at what they called the kitchen and realized not only would my stove not fit but neither would my refrigerator.  They plowed the garden area so I might actually get to plant somethings this year.This is actually from the driveway. Grape harbor...looks like maybe rhubarb also. Two seater outhouse( small white buildng) that is connected to septic tank . We plan to turn part of the barn into a garage since we have no plans of having livestock.The white building to the far left is the pump house where the well is.They had a Honda gas motor on it One like you would put on a snowblower.This is the back side of the house. We will be putting  a patio door about the middle of the house which will be off the kitchen and be building a deck.This is what their kitchen was. That's a hand pump that they pumped water out of that they had in a 5 gal bucket. That's a kersone cook stove beside the door which will be where our contractor is putting a wheelchair bathroom. This room will become the mudroom/laundry room combination. IF there is room I might put an area to prep produce, work flowers etc...There are 3\"bedrooms\" upstairs , what code calls open lofts as there are no walls,doors or closets...we will add those and a storage space.1 bedroom downstairs with a area that was pantry that we will convert to closet.Another room that was pantry that will be the 2nd bathroom (tub/shower combo)The old dining room will be either another downstairs bedroom (will need closet) or maybe a man's cave for Hubby.The middle room...this is a partical picture and there is NOTHING in this area now.This is about half of the area the window is where the patio door will be . The other side that is not showing will be the kitchen sink and the penisula. This will be a kitchen/dining room/ family room area.Pretty much the enter downstairs is wood floors.There is a basement under the house 2..a very good basement.I don't know who is more excited about getting in the house after closing to get the work down and make this a home , Hubby, me or the contractor who LOVES rehabs AND reusing OLD stuff. He already told me he has 2 antique sinks being refinished and I get to look at them first to see if I want either one of them.Right now closing is March 6th... I picked the date as it is my late younger brother's birthday and we were the closest of the siblings. BUT I do hope it's more like FEB.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "MY plans for 2018", "date": "Tuesday, January 2, 2018", "text": "We chose to save $5 bills when we get them along with the regular budgeted savings. I also save all my change except for the 3 quarters, 2 dimes, 1 nickle and 5 pennies I keep in my purse.It is going to be a busy and full year as we are in process of buying a house, buying a truck for Hubby buying a suv or car for me. Moving Daughter when she gets her own place again (LORD PLEASE SOON, the 2 hr drive the other night due to bad weather and having to drive 30mph \"annoyed\" (her word) her and worried the crap out of us and her brother who lives at the other end of her route.. All we thought about was the cost of gas and wear and tear on her car  with driving 2 hrs a day to and from work along with driving her sons to practice and to their dad's where they are staying until she gets a new place AND packing and moving ourselves.AND add the bill we just got to do the updates required for the house (mortgage and ins requirements)..I will try to meet my SWAGBUCKS goal every day. Since the dogs get me up early I use that time and the time right before bed to do that. Hard sometimes to do as I get knocked out of the surveries most the time.I am doing Pinecone research still, not as many as I don't have cable or DVR or children under 18We will use CASH for groceries or gift cards that are gotten on discount and I am looking at eating from the pantry and shopping Aldi's the most. I do have a $250 gift card from Krogers and $75 gift card from Walmart and over $200 rebate \"check\" for Menards.We will use GASBUDDY for checking for the cheapest gas. Hubby uses Speedway fuel card for extra cents off and I have a Kroger's pts card but we won't be buying much at Krogers so that might not be an option at times.I paid for the Grocery Budget Bootcamp (Tiffiny) ...yes believe me I thought about it for a week.Talked it over with Hubby, daughter and then son that visits regularly. Then I decided if it saved me $25 a month I would \"break even\" So I signed up and read the welcome and first class and realized a a problem in how I am managing the pantry. A tweak in the basic grocery list and what will be a week of reorganizing the kitchen will save us about $30 in a 10 day span because I won't be losing produce or tossing leftovers as much.Daughter brings home half her lunch almost daily and that's not getting ate either so she decided what she gets for lunch (she's a bartender on first shift and can not leave so she gets 50% off her meals) she will focus on something that can help extend the dinner we have the next night. A lesson that is for the 22nd is inventorying what you have...I started NOW as it will take me all this month to get that done with the other work I have.I joined Home Storage Solutions 101 Declutter 365. I did this last year and it really helped...I didn't get it done due to surgery but with moving I really need to get this done BEFORE we move as we do NOT need to pack clutter and take it with us even though we have a huge barn we could use for storage. Daugher has offered to take donations to Goodwill as she has one right around from her work so we won't be making special trips to town and she can take it as I get it together instead of it sitting until we do go to town.Menu planning will be USE UP THE LEFTOVERS FIRST plan. I thought about a pantry challenge... with acknowledgement that we still would eat out more than I like even with having the eating out calendar we have done extra due to being on the road at the wrong times. Since I know this \"be gone so much\" time isn't going to last more than a couple months we are trying to change times that we have to be somewhere. The hardest is when I have to take my meds that require me to eat a MEAL not a snack.The biggest will be dealing with the house we are buying. I budgeted paying the asking price (actually I budgeted what it would cost to build the house we had decided on if we found land instead of a house) but HOPE they take less when offered due to the amount and COST of getting the house back up to code and qualifying it for a traditional mortgage and covereage under home ins.That's going to be the priority for this year. It helps that Hubby can go down to the neighbors and pick up work here and there and another friend called tonight and asked if he would be interested in driving some for him towards the end of summer beginning of fall  short term.Blessed Be"},

{"title": "Retirement update", "date": "Sunday, December 31, 2017", "text": "We have enough saved and set it up to ride out down turns in the stock market. We have it set up that payments will come in at 3 different times(we will have 3 different accounts )a month instead of just the first of the month and only once a month. I heard from a lot of retirees this is a hard adjustment. Dad has his set on 2. Mom O has hers on 3. Social Security comes in at the first of the month.I take a sheet of notebook paper each month and deduct ALL the expenses out as I pretty much know what my utilities average and I use the HIGH side of that average. BEFORE we start even thinking of getting groceries or gas or spending money. IT took me a year (we were in a bankruptcy) to save 3 months expenses so I could put in the checking and deduct everything BEFORE we even got our first retirement check (which is Jan 10th). How I did this was add up monthly bills MINUS the things we could go without (Amazon prime, sam's club, netflex -we don't have cable, no groceries and only 2 tanks of gas, health ins costs. Times it by 3 and divided it by 52 as I knew I had a year to save it up. THAT amount was paid into ALLY bank so we wouldn't use it on a automatic withdrawl just like it was a weekly bill. I then added what ever I could save into our regular savings also and stocked piled using sales and coupons.We still haven't settled on additional savings plan , key requirement when you retire and look at living another 30 some years as several in Hubby's family have lived over 100 and he's not 60 until next year. We have decided only 1 acct will be pulled from for now especially with buying a house and rehabbing it. We don't want to get into the mind frame of Ok we saved what we budgeted so we can spend the rest attitude at times we could save MORE.NOR do we want to run out and buy a ton of things for the new house. (FRUGALWOODS WEB SITE)CHANGE IN HEALTH INS...OH HEAVENS help me from pulling my hair out... Hubby's company changed ins providers that take affect 1/1/2018 for employees.BUT he retired 12/1/2017 so should have been put on retirement health ins 1/1/2018....NOOOOOO some reason they put the wrong date in and it's going to be end of Jan  before that gets switched so I had to fill out paperwork FOR employee to make sure we HAD ins and then will have to do retiree paperwork. AT least they are making sure we are COVERED. Health ins money will go into a money market fund so I can keep that separate from the rest.We are tracking each month what we spend in gas and where we are going. We know we will be going to visit parents more often and doing things with kids/grandkids. BUT we can't afford to just run all the time (the medical appts and retirement appts have worn us out this month). MOVING will be costly. We are pricing different ways to get it done.With Daughter moving home (Pray for her as she has 2 places that should open up for her to rent in Jan) will increase the utilities but she brings enough leftovers home from her lunch at work that she covers her own dinners. She has offered to pay for the increase.I can give myself a headache thinking the changes that will happen in the coming year.Blessed Be"},

I ran into Walmart after the appoint to get the 7 inch sq disposable plates I use to vacuum cookies and a new mouse for laptop. Mine died, Hubby gave me his so I got the new one for him.Got gas on way home as we found the other Speedway was 3¢ cheaper than to one we had planned to go to. Sat down and figured out how much taxes we would pay if we pulled money from the 401K this month on top of the earnings from work. Car is going down hill fast since the transfer case is no longer working, Used left over London broil with onions and mushrooms to make wraps for our meal. Hubby picked up the turkeys we are deep frying for SCARES on Saturday from a friend that bought them and had them thawing at his house, Hubby also brought home 2 sandwiches after he went to grandson's bowling meet. Used coupons for sandwiches so bought one and got one. He got the cheaper sandwiches instead of our favorites. Both of us are watching how much we eat not just what we eat.15th. Had to go start paperwork for pre approval of mortgage for new home. Checked gasbuddy for cheapest gas, used speedway fuel card for discount, got breakfast sandwich for our lunch at Speedway as Hubby had a coupon for buy 1 get one free and they were $2 for the 2 of them so we got 2 sandwiches for $1 and we had our drinks. Mortgage guy said for not being out of a bankruptcy for even a year yet we have done very well at rebuilding our savings and  credit. Usually credit takes 2 yrs to rebuild after bankruptcy and if he hadn't seen the date he would have thought it was over 2 yrs (GO US) SIDE NOTE if you are or have been in a bankruptcy get a copy of your payments so if you go to get any kind of loan in the 4 yrs after you have that because they will ask for it. On the way home we stopped at a restaurant (planned) that we were told by Hubby's co workers that was reasonable... FOR LESS than the price at MC D's or WENDY'S we had a balanced meal and drink even with leaving a tip.I brought part of my sandwich and fries home.  We have 2 financial places. One with 401(k) work and one we rolled over pension to into an IRA. We contacted both of them to get that scheduled to get rolling as needed in mortgage. We snacked on what we had in frig when we got munchies.16th Hubby fixed bfast from pantry. We have a Christmas dinner tonight with the SCARES so we will snack for lunch as we will be prepping 30 lbs of potatoes donated by our daughter, for mashed potatoes and deep frying 2 turkeys. Turkeys came from friend so our outlay is only the cost of the oil that we bought at Sam's club and we donate the used oil to a friend that heats his work shop with it and will give us \"credit\" for oil when we have work done by him.17th  Started making candy and cookies for the kids from the pantry. Fixed today's and tomorrow's meals18th Took our truck to mechanic for oil change and tires (on sale). Had MRI (paid by ins) of shoulder that had surgery during the summer19th Had appointment with finance guy so used coupon and ate lunch at a restaurant we only are around when in that area. At leftovers for dinner.20th Hubby was in Wapak to meet a couple friends so picked up prime rib we had ordered that was in that town also. We ate from the pantry as I was finishing cookies and candy so Hubby could make the snickerdoodles when he got in.21st  We checked the kids schedules and routed the cookie delivery to be the shortest route. Our daughter paid for our lunch as we had to deliver the Christmas stuff to her at work.22nd Hubby had bfast with ex co workers using a gift card he was given to pay for it. I made dinner from the pantry and freezer23rd We were just hanging around the house when the dogs started barking and when I went to the door I found our one daughter that had been living with a friend climbing out of her car with her suitcase. One this child would not be on our door step unless it's last resort. The place she was suppose to get on Friday got backed up as the elderly lady isn't going into the nursing home until Jan now so she came home rather than stay with the friend and strain that relationship. We ate from the pantry and she talked about what she thought should be her \"share of the housework, groceries and rules about coming in.\" I am not sure but it sure sounded a lot like the same rules we had when she was 17 and living at home LOL. She agreed she would help pay the electric bill , the only bill that will be affected by her staying here especially since we had to put an electric heater in the room she is using upstairs. She offered to take the items I am going to take to Goodwill with her and drop them off when she goes to work saving us a trip to town as the Goodwill is within a couple blocks of her job. She also started looking (again) for another place just incase the elderly lady doesn't go in to the nursing as what was planned.24th Daughter went and got a couple of her sons and one of their girlfriends to come see us, she provided the drinks and snacks for everyone. We had the prime rib, daughter ate it as leftover when she got in and did the dishes (that was nice to wake up to a clean sink) and the 2 sons that usually come called after they got home from work. I put together a stocking for my daughter since she was going to be here separate from what we had already given her that she saved to open with her sons at their other grandparents on Christmas.25th  We ate left over sweet rolls for bfast, snacky food that had been given to us for lunch and leftover prime rib with onions mushrooms for philly steak wraps for dinner.  Daughter came up with a menu from the pantry after I wrote out what we had going on this week so she knew where we were and could help take care of the dogs(which 2 are hers anyways). We also talked of shower schedules as she leaves for work at 9 and won't be home until after 6 and maybe later as she tries to help her ex run the boys to sports practice and games.  Hubby had to dig the cars out by hand as he didn't want to bother the landlord on Christmas as usually he has someone come take care of that.. We haven't had snow to amount to anything on Christmas day in 7 yrs. I put the prime rib bones and fatty meat to simmer for broth to finish the broth on Wed and sliced the rest for the freezer. I will give Army son some as he is bringing us some ham on Wed.Tomorrow is the 26th  We will be at Daddy's to give him his presents (he has always celebrated Boxing Day as it was his mother's habit) We have gift cards that was given to us to take him out to lunch. Our other 3 daughters went together to give us cash to leave tip money and have gas to go. Daughter that lives with us had a friend let her know he was dropping off chili to her at work tomorrow so we will have that if we are hungry after getting back tomorrow. I also have homecanned soup if we don't want the chili.Daughter that moved in ran vacuum and decluttered a WHOLE room AND my small desk. I really hope her OCD stays kicked in until we get 2 more rooms done LOL.Blessed be"},

{"title": "13 days into retirement", "date": "Wednesday, December 13, 2017", "text": "You can barely see Rascal (black dog)..just his eyes reflecting the flash LOL . It's a 3 dog night most nights but Rascal has always left the bed after he thinks I am asleep and Wilbur (boxer) has taken to getting up and going to curl up with Hubby on the couch. Hubby sleeps sitting up due to health issues. Charlotte (white fur) sprawls and she's only going to be 6 months on the 18th.She was suppose to be a medium size dog like her parents but the husky is coming out in her with her LONG legs . She's as long as Rascal and Wilbur and almost as tall.Our days have been medical appointments as much as we can squeeze in this last month on the better insurance. Medical for the 5 infections I have picked up Thanks to having strep throat and not knowing it and another medical for my surgery arm that was doing good but has locked up now on Thursday. ADD dogs out (especially Charlotte as she is still potty training lol and does NOT bark will growl and yip but no bark) and dogs in.Add to that we are looking for a house...might have found one but still looking until the day it closes. Hubby has added attending a sporting event for each of the 3 grandsons that is playing. I've been able through the years to catch at least one for each but he hasn't with working. One of the positives of being retired. Plus he will be having breakfast with his 3rd shift coworkers once a month and breakfast with die cast coworkers every 4-6 wksPantry is over stocked... (I do have a place I can get boxes for the 1000 plus canning jars I have full ). I have canned goods where I don't normally have them so made a list and posted it on the side of the frig of what and where and the date I put it there. We have found a menu does not work for us as we end up stretching the meal for 2-3 more meals.Good to stretch the food might also be bad to stretch is as the food isn't getting used up LOLMoney is tight as we won't get regular income for a year maybe two. Add on to needing 2 vehicles and the down payment for a house.We have a budget, it's the amount Hubby would get if he collected social security at 62. Daddy was living on his investments and in 2008 lost everything except the assets so had to live on his social security. It was not a pretty picture but he did it. He still only spends $35 a week on his groceries, eating soups mostly. My niece does his grocery shopping once a week with her own shopping as she is within 5 miles of him when she is shopping. Gives her excuse to stop in and check on him also.I am watching as we seem to nickle and dime ourselves by going to the store...so now it goes on a post it on the microwave and WHEN we go to town for another appointment we can decide to either go get it or wait until the next trip. I pitch the store ads when they come in the mail. Don't need to think wow ...that's on sale...I can shove it somewhere .I haven't been to the store since Dec 1st. Mom O who has been retired now going on 20 yrs said this is really good. I have to make sure the milk expiration date is at least a couple weeks out to stay out of the store.Deciding where to put the investments is hard. I read JL Collins The Simple Path to Wealth . I used to read the Morning Star online and I have watched CNN about the stocks. Stocks is risky but treasure notes. money markets and annuities are not going to make you money for the long haul. I interviewed 4 financial advisors and picked the one closest to my decisions that does sort of want to bang his head against a wall when I bring up paying cash out of investments instead of paying interest and private mortgage insurance for 10 yrs like they suggest we do.I decided since Hubby is clueless and wants to remain  clueless (not really he just doesn't want the stress ) that we would be invested with 50/50 mix, 50 stock and 50 bonds. PLUS we were going to pull the down payment and enough money to get a new to us car (Daddy can't get in the truck) along with the taxes. I read JL Collins book The Simple path to wealth and read Frugalwoods blog about retirement. Might pay cash for the house. Then we wouldn't have to worry about a down swing (remembering 2008) and not having money to make the mortgage. We could easily live off Social Security.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "What We did this week that was frugal", "date": "Tuesday, December 12, 2017", "text": "I signed up again for Frugalwoods Uber  frugal month challenge for JanuaryHubby borrowed a book from EMA to study for the test to move up the ladder with his HAM radio license. The test is free for him.I dug through some gifts/candy that I had bought before and divided it up as Christmas giftsI opened the curtains for sunshine to help warm the house and closed them before it was dark to keep the warmth in. When the wind is over 25 mph I close the bedroom door to keep the heat in the front room. Wind sucks the heat out right through the walls it seems.I finished either putting plastic on the windows or taping them shut to stop drafts.I turn off lights in rooms we are not in, except Christmas lights. We only keep them lit during certain hours.Hubby has moved his laptop to the dining room during the day so he is not turning on the lamp, he sits in the darkest part of the front room as it's on the north end of the house.I turn the printer off after using it.I turn my laptop off at the power strip after using it.I turn my coffee pot off at the power strip after using it., I reheat in microwave then end up drinking it cold anyways from sitting when I side track doing something so I am getting to the point of not reheating it all the time.I washed the laundry with full loads on short wash with homemade laundry soap and dried some on the drying rack and others in the dryer using the sensor instead of the timer. By using the sensor I have noticed I am not over drying and not having static cling issuesWe ate leftovers/planovers most of the week. I \"refilled\" the paper towels (pup is getting better about making it outside but still has accidents on the way to the door during the night) toilet paper, dish soap, Hubby's vitamins, dog biscuits and dog dental bones from the pantry supply which my kids call Mom's grocery store.My doctor gave me some free samples of a medication he wanted me to use but was worried about it triggering my Crohns. Didn't want me to spend the money and then not be able to take it. As long as I eat before and after taking it I do okay. So he gave me a prescription to finish out.I turned the lotion bottle upside down into a container. I had added water to a couple times but thought there was more, sure was as I am going into week 2 of still using it.I put an old wool blanket rolled up at the bottom of the staircase to the upstairs to keep the cold air from coming down as we don't heat the upstairs at all.I canned beef broth.I canned turkey with broth.I canned turkey broth.I canned ham broth.I cut the pork shoulder roast into 3 meals, froze 2 and made bbq pulled pork with the third which has left enough leftovers that I am putting what is left in the freezer for another meal.Hubby bought the 2 picture frames for Christmas gifts at Walmart using a gift card we was given last year and 100 lbs of dog food during Menard's 11% rebate sale...using rebates we had gotten back, I finished the last of the Christmas shopping except for a kitten that I was just told is my new  four legged great grandbaby , his name is Milo.Hubby ordered the Christmas Prime rib as he was told by a friend  that goes to the same butcher shop it was down to $6.95/lb, We might have both sons at Christmas unless they work or the weather is bad.We have combined errands with appointments. This has been a juggling act with medical appointments since I am fighting now 5 different infections (doc is to the point of calling me after hours or seeing me after hours), with different stops for meds and we are looking at houses to buy since Hubby retired and we don't need to live around here any more for his work. We also keep a list of houses we want to look at when going to see family so it's not a \"special\" trip to look at the property.I used my Amazon gift card that I earned through our health ins to pay for Raw apple cider vinegar with mother as my doctor would like me to start a combination drink of it with honey and lemon juice in water. That pretty much finishes off that gift card.Since I am having trouble sleeping due to meds I am doing Swagbucks. Keeps me from moving around and bothering Hubby while he is trying to sleep because the dogs will start playing if I move around much at all.We had 3 different houses in the same area, the realtor really pushed to get us in all 3 the same afternoon.We are very interested in one that we had drove by several times. We have a contractor doing a walk through on Tuesday as we want to apply for a FHA 203K rehab loan as it has no heat, no electric and no plumbing at it is an AMISH house with 5 acres.It does have a 2 seater outhouse connected to the septic tank/leach bed (reminds me of my childhood). We will see how this goes. Depending on what the cost of bringing it up to \"Englisher\" standard and the owners accepting it if no one else bids on it before we get this paperwork all done as we had a regular loan available but it won't cover the house at all due to no utilities. We have to meeting for the loan on the 15th in the morning  to see if its' doable we are basing what we can afford to pay on what Hubby would bring in with social security at 62. My Daddy had to start living on just SS in 2008 when he lost over 50% of his investments in the stock market . I already made it clear I didn't want to make things tight for us to meet the payments and our loan officer said he was thankful I gave him the amount I am willing to pay so he can say , hey this is going to be over that or  SCORE LOL Trying to not get my hopes up as it's a great house and wouldn't be hard to switch over to wheelchair accessible which we KNOW is in my future.I dug out the fake tabletop Christmas tree we had bought in 2008 for the 800 sq ft rental we moved into. Hubby feels better now and so far the pup, Charlotte, isn't trying to get ahold of it and since it's table top Wilbur doesn't think of it as his bathroom LOL. Our dog Rascal is used to fake and real Christmas trees and doesn't bother them.We are a little bit over budget with Christmas but way under budget with the cookies and candy.I downloaded a free Kindle bookGot a free calendar from a company  through Shutterfly . I uploaded some pictures and paid the shipping, saved over $25.Hubby is doing a TRX exercise class twice a week at the plant's wellness center. We pay $26 a YEAR to be members so the classes is free.I got a deep tissue massage at the wellness center, two hours for $62 including tax, lowest I have found in this area is $50 for one hour.My doctor ordered this but our insurance doesn't pay for it.Arm that had surgery in Sept is not working right, can't lift the arm above shoulder or move it in certain ways when I was already doing that, made appointment to see Doc on Thursday while still on the better ins.Shopping list has been sitting on the front of microwave for four days. We waited until we were already going to town for an appointment.Head guy at SCARES (ham radio group for Homeland security) asked Hubby to go to town and take unit (old ambulance) in for an oil change. We worked it out to be done when we are already in town...no wasted gas.We used our Krogers points for fuel saving $35, filled up the truck and some gas cans for the generator, sounds like we might be needing it with the weather coming in.Made Swagbucks goal 7 times , wasn't easy .I mended a hat and a dog toy.Hubby replace the board  to my root cellar shelving unit that got destroyed by a leaking water jug using scrap wood we had .Limiting who I am sending Christmas cards to. IF I didn't get one from them last year I won't send one this year. Most are now doing FB or other social media. Just not the same for me.Hubby was asked to do an interview with the company's \"magazine\" Instead of driving the hour for the interview the person called him and did it over the phone to save him time and money.Since they had taken a new picture for his retirement badge she was going to use that as the picture for the article. It's about him doing CPR on a friend/co worker at work. It was a really really bad heart attack and no one expected him to live (doing great and even back to work). ER told the man's family he made it because Hubby worked hard on him until the rest of the squad got there. Plant is updating equipment also."},
{"title": "Grocery  store shopping 1st week of Dec", "date": "Sunday, December 3, 2017", "text": "I have been slowly decorating the house .The candles on the mantle have a red bulb, in a colored picture they look like pink smears according to my son. He liked this picture best. Still haven't decided if I am doing anything with the chandelier this year.We had some friends that wanted us to meet up with them at Hong Kong buffet. We used a coupon and it was in the budget so we went. Since we were going to be  in town we decided to go to the store so I checked what we needed to what is now our basic list. We didn't need much. At dinner our friends who was just at the store told us about the pork shoulder sale and the hamburger sale.December food budget is $260 .Non food is $100...dogs stuff is on separate budget.I spend $104.52. saved 29%. I got pork shoulder with bone for 94¢/lb (normal price $2.49/lb). I got 9.36 lbs. I got hamburger $1.99/lb(normal price $3.33). I got 6 lbs  I got mushrooms (one white and one portobella) with coupon of 50¢ on each package and I picked the marked down packages saving another 50¢ each. I got milk $1.59. I let Hubby pick out some sweet rolls and he got some canned biscuits for some meals he wants to make (I can also deep fry them into doughnuts and doughnut holes). I noticed he went with the cheaper ones instead of the name brand like he is used to.This morning we ordered some items from King Arthur Flour after checking to make sure it was the lowest price we could find of somethings he wants to try. I used a discount coupon I had and got lower shipping also.We now have $71.84 left in food...that is plenty for any produce or dairy we need.Hubby ordered ink refills for his pen that was cheaper than the pens he had been using (out of non food). He has problems with his hands when holding a pen or silverware. We have been searching for silverware...think we might have found the one we both feel comfortable with.Menu got tossed out the door with how we both have been hauling butt getting things done. We know we have another busy week with making a trip to see Daddy, massage therapy for me(it's at night for 2 hrs) and 3 appts for both of us. SO I have to sit down and figure that out. Plus I haven't  transferred things to the new calendars either. That can be today.Blessed BeHubby is officially retired from the plant. He has been asked repeatedly what he is going to do now. We figured it out with in hours...not clock in at the plant....make coffee...let dogs out and in ...he might retire quickly on the dog part as he was not thrilled to be up at 2 am since he was not at work. Ended up with both of us up and wide awake.I do have a post it note on the microwave of his honey to do list...there is 2 things on it. My honey do list is 5 pages long LOL.We divided the home blessing. I swish and swipe the bathroom, shine mirrors and windows, dust and declutter .He vacuums and hauls out trash and Goodwill donations. We will share sweeping and mopping the kitchen, butler's pantry, mudroom and bath as long as we have a swiffer wet mop. We both do laundry and dishes. Not sure what days that all will happen on as I won't be trying to not be noisy while he is sleeping.We have to figure out going to the end of the lane for the mail since he won't be picking up as he leaves for work. Mail box is  2/10ths (why do they not call it 1/5th?) of a mile down the lane.I might have to start crossing days off on the calendar to remember which day it is, we've lost track a couple time when he was on shut down.MEAL is a big issue as our eating schedules are the same... I don't eat much bfast if any, he eats a bowl of cereal or something light because he was going to bed. I eat lunch at 11:30 with meds, he doesn't want to eat lunch since he is fighting sleep, I eat a snack at 2 with med , he wants to eat lunch if he is awake. We decided to have dinner at 4:30 so we could eat at the table instead of on tv trays and catch the news. THEN he wants a snack at 11 pm because that was his break at work and was hungry at 2 another break time at work. I can guess around 4:30 this morning he will be hungry also as that is his work lunch time. PLUS we haven't stayed with our menu at all this week. We see where the issues will be on that part.It's going to be an interesting year.Blessed Be"},

Don't you love old drafty farm houses? LOL I will buy Vit D milk as I am making coconut cream pies for Daddy and he needs the fat and Vit D. If I have coupons for fresh mushrooms and they are on sale or marked down I will get them.

Please sit down...$1.99/lb. I got  5 lbs as that was all I could afford. We decided to not freeze it but go ahead and eat it for our Tday dinner tomorrow as we both are tired of turkey and then I will slice and freeze the rest packaged as meal servings.What we didn't buy was new Christmas lights to replace the ones that died last year on the front porch. The wind beats them a lot.We used what had been at the back door and used LED rope lighting for the back door.  We decided against  live trees for the porch and house as Wilbur uses the evergreen in the back yard as his \"dump\" station and I don't want him starting in the house or on the porch. LOL the pup Charlotte is almost house broke and I can see that going downhill fast if Wilbur starts.We have some small fake trees I might put one on the dining table where Charlotte won't get ahold of it and make it a chew toy like she does all the sticks in the yard.We priced different health insurances against what we will get with retirement (at a cost to us of course). Some are definitely cheaper but don't cover pre-existing conditions not catastrophic , we both have heart issues plus I have Cerebral palsy, Crohn's, and deformed spine. I usually hit catastrophic on my health ins in March. So we will bite the bullet and pay for the insurance the company offers the retirees that will cover pre-existing and does cover catastrophic. We will look for a different dentist that charges less for cash payments along with a different eye/glasses place.I have to change my primary and my GI .My GI referred me and I have to call them this coming week to start that process on my end. My primary is trying to see if he can be added to our ins  as a provider.I have about 30 days to get this switched.Hubby and I sat down and refigured our budget with paying for the ins and the deductibles along with cash for the dental and eyes. We added car payments (which we haven't had in over 20 yrs) and re-investments as we don't want to run out of money. We planned for the worse and then added 4% for raising costs. It's not as bad as we thought it would be as long as we stay on budget with in reason (less would be better). Hubby is looking into starting a ledger like he did when he farmed. He can go for it LOL.We have a few things to pick up at Walmart this week. Two picture frames for the puzzles we did for his parents and box tape as I use to tape the windows to keep the winds out during the winter.Blessed Be"},

I've been canning soups. The mushrooms,cheese sauce and beans won't be replaced until next year but the green chilis will be this week.I'm out of fresh carrots,fresh celery,romaine lettuce, green onions and almost out of milk...that's my Aldi's run.I still need to go get my dried beef that I have a rain check for at Krogers. I only buy it this time of year and get enough for the year. I use it for dried beef pickles (with cream cheese) and dried beef gravy.It goes on this shelf also.Except for the juice, everything on the top shelf will be gone this weekend as it's the items I've stock piled for Thanksgiving. The canned veggies was for emergency supplies( I don't store anything glass during tornado season in the root cellar, it's where we take cover) I always use at Thanksgiving, they will be replaced in the spring when I restock the root cellar for tornados. .About 25 lbs of potatoes to make mashed potatoes.  I will used the oldest first.I had to refill my kitchen onion basket which took one strand of these onionsI pulled 18 rolls of toilet paper, a package of paper towels (thanks to Charlotte not being completely house broke yet) and the last box of black trash bags (had another large box but gave it to daughter to use when we moved her).I pulled a box of dog snaps treats, a box of dog dental treats, a bottle of Dawn, a bottle of Bayer back and body  and 2 containers of coffee for us and 1 for Thanksgiving dinner.I still haven't gotten the dried fruit /veggie cabinet sorted out or the herbs and spices cabinet sorted out yet either and they need done soon, they are full I just can't find anything LOLBlessed Be"},

Daughter that was moving (the kids and her are staying with friends to keep the kids in the same school district while she hunts for a new place) gave us the cereal.She didn't know why the boys weren't eating it but it had been there a week so she gave it to us...might not have been eating because it was STALE. That didn't stop Hubby ...it is now gone into his tummy.I went to Aldi's, spent $54 and got $5 off with the grand opening coupon they gave me last week. I have 2  more coupons for the following 2 wks (1 a wk). Not sure what will be on those lists besides another ham, maybe cream cheese . The only thing we need for stocking up I have a rain check for at Krogers and Aldi's doesn't sell it. I'll see, have to spend $35 to get the $5 off but I am not going to be buying something just to get $5 off.I roasted the two turkeys today we bought at Krogers for 57¢/lb(Walmart at 68¢ and Aldi's was         99 ¢) We had turkey wraps for dinner. I made a small batch of white bean/Poultry  chili and we try that for Monday night dinner. IF we like it I will make more and can it.  I tossed both carcasses in water today and made bone broth. Will be straining it and canning that also.The meat will be bagged(tomorrow in 2 cups bags and frozen for meals.By putting it in the freezer already cooked the meat from 2 turkeys takes up less room than 1-15 lb turkey would.We ate out after going to viewing and before going to Aldi's, ate the special and used a coupon we had. Provided us dinner that night, lunch for Hubby that night and dinner the next night for both of us. I added veggies and melted cheese over the french fries (neither of us prefer french fries) along with some cooked bulk sausage that I keep in the freezer) . I would definitely say we got bang for our buck.I picked up another 10 lbs of pasta at Krogers for 49¢/box.We are trying to set the frigs up to reflect how we will be eating from the pantry and not be wasteful as I know it's easy in the winter to get tired of heavy winter meals. We love variety so I need to keep that in mind.I mended a shirt and pair pants.I added water to my lotion bottle.We ate from the pantry except for once. Our week's run Saturday to Sunday. Tonight a couple friends called and asked if we could go out to dinner with them because they are leaving after Thanksgiving for about a month. I told them we would love to but it's not in the budget for this month due to spending extra money paying for the gas to move our daughter and the new vet bills, there was some silence but then oh , okay, we understand. They called back and offered to pay for our dinner as an early Christmas present so I accepted.Since they are retired and on a budget they understand the \"it's not in the budget\".Blessed be"},

{"title": "What I have so far staying in budget and where I was a year ago", "date": "Friday, November 10, 2017", "text": "I have a habit of looking back a year or two at pictures and seeing what I was doing at this time of year. These are from last year.Well I am not doing tomatoes.. but I do have some apples to finish up and a few tomatoes to use fresh along with red bell peppers.Butter to can.We priced taking our daughter's dogs to a different vet but it's the same price after driving to it.The other vet was closer to her so would be easy for her to meet us there and her deal with it instead of transferring stuff to our vet. She hasn't lived long in the area she has been living in and wants a regular vet. But for now they will go to our vet and she's already called him about their past records since our vet gives us a paper at the end of each appt of what was done. I can just keep those until she takes the dogs back to her.If she ends up in an apartment we will most likely keep them. Neither are apartment dogs.I turned a rotating fan on at the door of the root cellar so it had circulation.The humidifier is running,kicked off during a power outage and I forget to turn it back on until I got a nose bleed.We went back to Menards and got another 52 lbs of dog food as our dog has decided to eat it instead of his own and if the boxer eats our dog's food he will get the back door trots,which means I trot out that door with him as we don't trust him to NOT cruise right across the open fields around us. We have a person will to buy our other dog food off us as they use the same thing So that helps there.AND as of today, I am short ONLY 3 things, (2 I have rain checks for from Krogers so if I don't find them cheaper I can at least buy them later.) on the stock up list.We removed apricots even though they are Hubby's favorite fruit we just can't handle the price I am finding. When they come in season next spring I will be buying them and canning them myself. I haven't been to Aldi's as tomorrow(Friday) we have a viewing to go to (Hubby's coworker grandpa) and decided since we drive within a mile of Aldi's we would just go then. No second trips to the same area as it's not where we go normally.I need a few things (besides the turkeys) for our Tday dinner.Kind of holding off until the \"guests\" let me know what they are bringing.Today I finished stocking the following:Cranberry sauce whole berrychoc pie crustsGraham cracker pie crustsButter (to be canned as we don't see the price coming down as it's even up in Europe and bought canning jars on clearance for the butter)worcestershire sauceHorseradish cream sauceRain checks are sauerkraut and dried beef(just in case I can't get kraut at Aldi's)I bought 2 turkeys (was the limit) for 57¢/lb. They were around 15 lbs. I am roasting them for OUR freezer and for soup and broth. I have a BIT...just a bit of freezer space for that plus that will be a few quick meals this coming weeks as next week asI will be prepping for our Tday dinner that is Sunday. I might get another one later but for now this will be good enough. That leaves the ham for our freezer but I have until Christmas to get those 2.Bought 5 other items for presents(a real score as they were on clearance) but decided to wait to buy picture frames until after our Tday dinner.I think I'm short one gift but I know what it is and where to get it.I bought 12 -2 liters of soda pop for our Tday dinner that was marked down to 88¢ and I had $1.50 off if I spent $10.00, getting the price down to 75.5¢ I have plenty of cups..like a black trash sack full as everyone and their brother seems to think we need to have their extra cups.I have been told that water at the hall is bad tasting so I will use my own to make coffee and have water for those that want to drink that. Not hard to refill water jugs with my own water.My daughter lent me her buffet coffee maker for coffee. I have creamer and sugar and coffee.I will also take some tea bags for those that prefer tea. There will be ice so they can make cold tea if they want from hot tea.The best news was I spent far less than what we budgeted for stocking up, Thanksgiving and Christmas.Which is good as we just got the $800 bill for getting the truck fuel lines fixed."},

We have been making a point of getting one on one time with Rascal.AND he is slowly learning how to play with the pup.Since we have 2 more dogs (our daughter is giving us some money for food and the entire fee  we pay our landlord for having them but we are doing all the rest until she gets back into a place of her own with her boys back with her as they are split up staying with friends) We know we will have to come up with some food, treats, vet care etc. Her boys, my darling grandsons admitted they had been giving the dogs people food and her and I knowing that 3 teenage boys along with all their friends feeding these dogs people food explains the issues the dogs were having AND why her dog food was lasting so long but not her groceries. Like teenage boys don't enough on their own.I would like to have a turkey this week for our meals and to make soup with and a hamSO on this week's buy list.. I compared prices between Krogers and Walmart online as our Walmart does not do price match any more. Aldi's only shows what they have on sale in their ads I go to them before Krogers.Menards More Alpo from Menards even if it's not the extra 5 lbs bag. As we have to have enough to go 2 months as I don't see her getting a place that fast that she can have the dogs for now.canning jars if they still have someWalmartif no canning jars at Menards2 picture frames for gifts we are doing to friendscorn pads for Hubby's toes. He doesn't have corns but his steel toes are rubbing and these work to protect without being bunched upa present that we know we can get there cheapand price turkeys and butter.I might order canned apricots later as this is the only way it's looking like I will get them.Aldi's I need to spend $35 to use my $5 coupon.kraut in jar (needs to be cheaper than Krogers 1.99)ham I found a couple casserole recipes on Amish365.com that also has mock lemon pie which is actually vinegar pie.HE has a lot of Amish recipes on his blog.cream cheese (needs to be cheaper than Krogers 1.59)saltinescheck on butter (Kroger's 2.49)Krogersturkey at 57¢/lb(limit 2)canning jars (digital coupon)dried beef in jar (sale)whole berry cranberry sauce (sale)horseradish cream sauceChocolate cookie pie crustgraham cracker pie crusts (sale)PSST tortilla wraps(usually 99¢ for a package)Starbucks coffee(sale ...for Daddy)Creamette pasta (49¢when I buy 10)2 lt pop (buy 4 at 88¢ each. I will buy 12 (Tday dinner) and use digital coupon of $1.50 off $10 in pop) That's the list but it depends on how much I have after we take 3 dogs to the vets and pay the bills.This would run about $400 if I get the amount to finish stocking up except for ham, turkey and prime rib ...well and the apricots that might not get bought at all .

I usually take my veggies/fruit from the pantry during this time of year but I need room for turkey and ham. If I take the bulk of our meals from the freezers the next 17 days I will have enough room for turkeys and a ham.Set grocery list for every 10-14 days for perishables..work in progressso far we are thinking milk, half and half, heavy cream(I make my own whipped cream), romaine lettuce, celery and carrots. One dozen eggs a month so Hubby can have his sunny side up eggs once a week. Green onions once a month.I might buy a red,yellow or orange bell pepper if I want it for salad or stuffing it (I can't eat green which is actually an unripe bell pepper due to my Crohns). Cabbage once a month and apples once a month. At this point we are stocked with enough variety that there shouldn't be an issue.We set the grocery budget based on Mom O budget.

I've seen his grocery list, I'm not eating bean soup daily(he can't swallow solid foods any more) She spends $145 every 10 days. so that's $441.04 a month but that is also including her softener salt ,furnace filters,laundry products that we have another fund for house maintenance items and I make my own laundry soap and use vinegar for the softener.

{"title": "8 weeks to Christmas ", "date": "Sunday, October 29, 2017", "text": "The cookie and candy list has been finalized. Until Hubby comes up with something else 😏.While at my GI appointment an elderly lady pulled several gags on me after she heard my doctor say something about the gag gifts I do for the kids and grandkids. I pulled them on Hubby and he thought they were good also.Inexpensive and very doable for the 3 dozen we make gifts for.I found a couple gifts at a thrift shop after my GI appt.We are still working on one large gift that we knew would be time consuming but not expensive.I bought a strand of lights for the light bulbs as it was cheaper to buy a 100 bulb strand than the replacement bulbs for several of my window decorations.I have some Christmas cards already bought so I will start signing them and getting them ready to mail around Thanksgiving as I want to include a short note.Blessed BeWe finally made it to Sam's club... saved 6 %. not including how much cheaper compared to other stores for what I bought.We got some funny looks with having 5 boxes of oil that weighed 35 lbs each. Turkey fryers take a box each and we always buy back up as more than one time had a fryer spring a hole or boil over. YES we have a fire extinguisher always on hand for that reason.Hubby built a box on the back of our trailer years ago...has had to replace it a couple times but it keeps things from getting wet (like kids' furniture) or blown off (plants from auction). We consider this a \"light\" run as usually the box is full , the bed of the truck is full and the back seat is full... this time it was not even filling the box on the trailer. Got diapers for the great grandson with $8 off.It will take care of him for a couple months making his parents happy to not be forking out that type of money at the holidays.But it has pretty much wrapped up what we needed and a few things that was on the want list except for the items that come on sale in Nov/Dec.I check butter at Walmart... OUCH But I lucked out at Aldi's at their grand opening and got it for $1.99. We have enough right now with using powdered butter from Rainy Day Foods for baking and canned butter for the table. I got eggs for 59 ¢ a dozen so I can finish dehydrating the older eggs. I also got another roasting chicken for 95¢/lb. We had it for dinner and it's now in the stock pot so I can debone it tomorrow and toss the bones in the trash as it goes to the road in the morning for pick up.I will end up with 4 meals from it.Krogers had digital coupon for 4 x points for gift cards. We needed gift cards for Christmas so we picked them up and then I did the survey to get more points for Nov.. We used 20¢/gal for the gas for going to Sam's club and  the other places we stopped at.We went to Lock 16 steakhouse for a belated birthday dinner for Hubby.We went at lunch time to get the cheaper price. Brought home leftovers to make 2 more meals with adding veggies and a fruit.We went to Dollar General where I had a $2 coupon off $10. I got cleaner for the swiffer mop that Hubby bought several years ago and he loves using. The cleaner was buy 2 get $1 off, bought 2 cans for the autospray for the kitchen that was a $1 off and a 2 cup glass measuring cup. Total paid was around $12 .We went passed a house that was between stores that we thought we would be interested in buying. It was surrounded by a woods and not what we were looking for.I washed foil, food bags, reused tea bags, opened curtains in morning and close late afternoon when there is no sun. Did laundry with homemade laundry soap with vinegar for the softener, used the drying rack for light weight stuff, dried heavy items first so if needed to be rebooted they were with the next load.  I did my surveys for Pinecone and worked daily on Swagbucks.Hubby used gasbuddy for other gas for the truck, he packed his lunch(always has) from leftovers.Mended another pair of socks that his steel toe boots wear out in that area.His truck went in for both fuel lines to be replaced. Haven't gotten that bill but we already know we can make payments on it. SO blessed with the mechanic we have.I dried more onions and eggs... worked on some red bell peppers... have the rest of what is in the mudroom to finish. All the tomatoes just finished turning red and I had some of them with the bell peppers as I heard that would help the bell peppers turn. Got a recipe for apple shrub that I have never had.Hubby mentioned he only had 1 vitamin pill left so I went upstairs and brought down more for him and then decided to make sure all my meds and vitamins were full also. So nice to fill everything up and not have to worry about going back into town and finding coupons and sales to fill those needs.A co worker of Hubby's gave us a Mc D's gift card that had $5 on it as no one in his family eats there. I saved it for later.The curtain rod over the kitchen sink kept falling down every time I shut the bottom half of the curtains. Hubby suggested buying a different style rod, I put a clothespin on the end of the rod so it couldn't pull through the hook that holds it. Problem solved for the price of a clothes[in that I've had for years.My GI who has really helped calm my Crohn's down is not going to be in network starting Jan due to ins changes. She prescribed me enough meds using 90 day supply to go a year so I didn't have to stress about finding a doctor right away as she can do phone consults at no charge to me if I end up in the hospital ER with an attack. She also referred a couple doctors that will be in network that she had worked with before and said she would go to them herself...She has Crohn's so she definitely understands. I ordered a gift from Dad O for Christmas from Amazon and had them gift wrap it for me as I know I wouldn't be able to and do a decent job of it. Even Hubby thought it was neat when we got it in.I had saved some older food safe buckets with Gamma seal lids which came in hand when we got home from Sam's club to transfer the 50 lbs of flour and 75 lbs of sugar. That was a $70 savings and not a worry of getting to the store to buy the buckets and put up with the flour and sugar sitting in the kitchen.We always try to make a trip to town that is for more than one thing. Twice in the past week we had to drive over an hr to appts so I juggled the errand list so we could do at least one thing extra with those appts. This week is almost as busy with appts.Have a Blessed Week."},
{"title": "What amount we should eat in a year.", "date": "Saturday, October 28, 2017", "text": "Taking the information from https://www.choosemyplate.gov/MyPlateHubby and I at our ages should eat the following in 1 year.Fruit: Hubby 2 cups and me 1 1/2 cups per day..that's almost a quart a day so that's 365 quarts a year.Veggies:Hubby 2 1/2 cups and me 2 cups per day  that's a bit over 410 qrts of veggies. We eat the rainbow diet of veggies....reds, yellows/oranges, white/tan, greens, blue/purple and blackthat comes to a total of 775 qrts for a year.... I can mostly in pints so that's 1550 pints...If I was buying all of it at the store it would be 1550 in cans. This is also why I dehydrate a lot also.That's not touching canned beans, butter, jams, jellies, fruit butter, syrups, sauces, meats,eggs, condiments etc....Grains... My plate cut back from the 7-11 servings to 5 oz for me and 6 for Hubby per day. That's 11 oz total per day that's almost 251 lbs of grain for a year.Protein is 5 oz for me and 5.5 oz for Hubby (we do more manual labor than most so we eat more than that) but I base my storage on those numbers that is 10.5 oz per day. That's almost 240 lbs of protein a year.Dairy... okay we are both cheese hounds. I couldn't drink milk as a child but could eat cheese and butter (we don't eat margarine due to chemicals in it)  My plate says we each should have 3 cups for a total of 6 cups per day. Cheese is 1.5 oz natural or 2 oz for process cheese equals 1 cup.. We have at least 1 of our servings as cheese . But think about that.. if we were only drinking milk or eating yogurt that's 2190 cups per year. As it is 1/3 of that is cheese that's just a bit over 68 lbs for the cheese alone in a year or 5.7 lbs a month. I buy it when it's on sale and try to have a coupon.Oils... Hubby 6 teaspoons and myself 5 teaspoons per day, that's a total of 11 teaspoons a day. That's 4015 teaspoons a year..there are 48 teaspoons in a cup. That's a bit over 83.5 cups , a cup is 1/2 lbs so that's 41.75 lbs of oil.... that includes not only the oils we use but also peanuts,peanut butter, butter,olives, avocados, salad dressings, mayo and Miracle Whip and other condiments along with baked goods (breads, cakes, doughnuts, etc). I do deep fry about every 6-8 weeks. If I deep fry I found we don't eat out plus the side benefit is my cast iron skillets get seasoned and I have several of those.Yes I have a big pantry"},
{"title": "In the pantry... ", "date": "Monday, October 23, 2017", "text": "We went shopping for personal items and then I was rummaging around for Christmas presents and decided to straighten this area up. It's part of the pantry.. personal items, dog stuff etc but I keep it upstairs in the corner of the boys room... we don't have any kids living with us but I call the one bedroom boys rooms (most of the grandkids are boys) and then there is Becka's room even though I have some granddaughters besides Becka, she's the only one that can tolerate being in the boonies to stay. Boys love the barn and cattle.FYI... We decided to stock for a year. Hubby is retiring (5 wks 4 days, not that I am counting or anything) as he does have other offers of work that is part time and seasonal on top of finding out ALL our doctors will be out of network with the new insurance turning a 80/20 plan into a 60/40 plan instead along with $10,000 deductible after paying $1000 a month for the insurance. YES we know we are BLESSED even with that because we know others that are paying $2000 a month and higher deductible than us.SO until we see how things goes financially we decided to stock EVERYTHING for a year since I already do that with the food.I even stocked extra humidifier treatment and Mr Clean, I cut the squares in half, it's the only thing I can use on my enamel coated pans.Tea and coffee along with water is the major drinks here. Our Bunn coffee maker doesn't let us reuse the grounds by adding more, makes a total mess when we tried it a couple times. I can only drink Folgers and Maxwell house, rest rips my Crohn's up. So we cut back on no more than 3 cups of coffee (Hubby drank 3 pots of coffee) and we drink tea in the afternoons and evenings ..The big red boxes of tea are top right of bookcase Yes I stocked dental treats for Rascal.That's a year supply for him.The dog items (actually there is some cat items also) is for the 4 legged grand-babies for Christmas.If I don't have a Crohn's attack then this will last closer to 2 years.If I have one attack cut it down to 18 months two attacks it's a year. It will be frugal for me to NOT have any (besides the fact it's out of network and horrible to go through) and to do that I have to take my meds...My VSL#3 is NOT cheap  even for over counter and my insurance will not cover it even with a prescription. I look for it on sale and have gotten lucky enough to find it twice at a price I can afford that scored me 4 bottles each time. My doctor would love to have me drop the dosage but we fear it will trigger an attack and that will make it all worse.The only part of the pantry left not organized is my spice and herb cabinet and the dried fruit/veggie cabinet...maybe by the end of the week.Blessed Be Rascal is pouting... It was Monday morning... trash goes to the road and he gets a ride around the block (so does Mommy 😉) BUT this week Hubby was on first shift for EMT classes so he took the trash when he left for work at 5 AM...we didn't get a ride around the block (4 miles total for the block here.) So there was no reason for Mommy to go around the block either.Five days we ate from the pantry.One of those was a failure as I roasted a chicken knowing we both would be worn out by dinner time with his classes (11 hr work day) and me in the gardens pulling the last of the harvest to go with the apples we were given. This is sitting in the mudroom for me to finish up this week.We ate the chicken the first night, ate beef cubes ( that I thought was beef cubed steak)cooked with mushrooms and onions and baked potatoes with the line of thinking we would finish the chicken the next night as chicken and dumplings... that didn't happened due to me falling and injuring the arm I just had surgery on...pit stop at WENDY'S after I was checked out. (not torn but definitely pulled muscles that are tight still from the surgery) ... and the next night was PIZZA which feed us dinner and 2 lunches) after 18 hrs of working in the gardens and yard work that Hubby picked up on his way back from taking the tiller back to a friend that lent us his big one. He woke me up when he got in as I had sat down after showering and went to sleep, I barely remember eating.Chicken got dumped in trash with big reminder that the night we have the roasted chicken (which needs to be no later than Saturday so the bones can go to trash at road on Monday morning and not sit in the trash can all week for the wild life to take interest in) that the leftovers goes in the stock pot that evening and dealt with BEFORE BED on the SAME night.We didn't go to Sam's club again or Lock 16 for a belated birthday meal for Hubby. Looks like Nov. for that now. I started going through the recipes for Christmas cookies and candy so if there is anything missing I can add it to this list.We did score with a savings of 42% at Dollar General on stocking up the pantry of personal items and 63% at CVS on medical supplies Hubby felt we needed and 29% at Kroger's that was on odds and ends they had sales on, I had coupons and it was on the we use but not necessary list. The young lady at Dollar General made a point of showing me my receipt and letting me know I had another $7 in savings in coupons.I use my herb tea bags twice and regular tea bags 3 times and found if I put those 2 together I can get another cup of tea.I put together some Christmas presents with what I had..I washed foil, box inserts (thanks kid for bringing me yours). Used homemade laundry soap and vinegar for the softener in the laundry , hung what I could on the drying rack and dried the heaviest first in the dryer so there is no reboot at the end of laundry due to something not getting dried completely. We turn off the furnace during the day (even today with no sunshine to warm the house). All the winter curtains on the main floor are up. The staircase doors to the upstairs and basement are kept shut with an old wool blanket at the bottom of the upstairs door so the cold air doesn't seep on down. Winter bedding is on the bed, warm throws on the backs or arms of furniture if we get chilly sitting. I added water to lotion, shampoo, conditioner, body soap, and dish soap. I wipe my razor blade with rubbing alcohol. Grandpa was a barber and told me to always do this so it would last longer even with disposable blades. I am able to use mine about a month of regular shaving.I made apple bread to use up some of the apples for our breakfast and snacks over the weekend.Hope you had a frugal week.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "End of the gardens ", "date": "Monday, October 23, 2017", "text": "It always makes me sad to wrap it up... part relieved as it means the days are not so busy even with produce sitting in the mudroom to be processed.But I did take one last picture of the flowers before the straw bales were hauled away. Next year we will be trying raised garden rows like Old World Garden Farms.Hubby tilled up the north garden and then planted annual rye for the winter cover crop. That's the rhubarb patch behind him that I will divide up in the spring. This is from the other way.Rascal is trying to figure out where everything went.He is back by the pole where the peonies were and his potties on them.These south square foot gardens have the fall garlic, some spring flower bulbs as the flower garden beside the house is coming up and the far end one has the strawberries.We call this with fond memories \"the tomato patch\" because the first year we tilled it up was because we had 50 extra tomato plants and no where to put them.Hubby tilled this also and put rye in it. We don't PLAN to plant it but we never know.This is at the far end of the tomato patch. It is my herb garden. There is still garlic chives, chives, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and curly parsley growing. I cut everything back for winter but as warm is it is right now and the rain we are getting today I can see having a small harvest if we don't get the frost like they forecasted for this week.This one we left even knowing we will have to deal with it in the cold. I did pick the green beans off the scarlet runner beans on the trellis and have them drying to replant next year in the north garden. There are a few blooms still on it and the birds are picking at it's leaves. The flowers bloomed after the mole ate through the box and seemed to fill out more... must have needed thinned??? The wind is blowing the leaves off the maple trees today. It's dreary, wet and cool...not cold as that is  yet to come... just a reminder that the circle of life continues.We do gag gifts for the kids and grandkids...great grandson gets toys. Older  family gets food gifts or something along that line.The story on these gifts is I was putting the boxes together and taping them, putting the gift inside and then tape the top... got almost through them and glanced at the table and realized I forgot to put the gift inside... gag on me LOL.While searching for something else I ran across and present we had bought last year for a friend but sent something else instead. They are getting it this year.I've rechecked the list for cookies and candy... Cookies are set but I need to pull a few more candy recipes. We have some tried and true and always a few new. I check ingredients as I pull the recipe.We STILL haven't made it to Sam's club (or Lock 16 steak house for Hubby's birthday. It looks like it's a Nov 4th run almost a month after his birthday. Guess that is the best since I am just now going through the recipes.We have started going through the Christmas decorations as we picked up at yard sales and need to check them for lights etc.Still a little frustrated that a gift we thought was going to be good was a flop...so back to the drawing board to replace that one.Are you getting ready for the holidays?"},
{"title": "frugal week  starting Oct 9th", "date": "Monday, October 16, 2017", "text": "We found Christmas gifts for a couple of friends at a yard sale. Found a couple for Dad and Mom O at Menards and yard sale.I did the usually of washing storage/freezer bags (not if it had meat or grease)  and foil. Opened curtains at dawn and closed them at night since it's now not as hot and I need the sunlight to warm the house. Turned lights off when not in room. Used homemade laundry soap.Used drying rack when possible. Washed inserts to different boxed food and taped to the roll I now have on the wall (have one of those racks that holds 3 different items on rolls. I have paper towels (select a size as we don't need full sheets most the time) wax paper and now inserts that I can use before the wax paper. Actually holds up better in the freezer when flash freezing items.Using my single use tea bag 3-4 times.We turned the furnace on at bedtime and off when we got up. If I get cold sleeping my arm/shoulder stiffness and causes pain. Pain anywhere triggers my Crohn's.Since I had my back injections we went out for a meal afterwards...got breakfast so once again the meal was half of what we usually spend PLUS it fed Hubby that night as I was in no shape to eat let alone cook so he didn't go get fast food for himself.  I fixed a large lasagna for the weekend and that made it to last night with me adding extra sides to fill us up.We used Kroger fuel points and Speedway card along with checking with Gasbuddy for the cheapest gas.I harvest herbs while Hubby harvested the majority of the last of the tomatoes (enough now canned for the year of pasta sauce and tomato juice) and horseradish (1/2 gal in freezer) and bell peppers... that still have not turned SIGH.The humming birds haven't been around for over a week now but the bees are having a buffet with the humming bird feeders. We decide to let them hang until we don't see the bees any more. I still have some flowers that they are into also. Mums are pretty much done after that last hot spell.Landlord bought a new ceiling light for the butler's pantry that was LED and Hubby installed it over the weekend.We cut out electric bill by $40 by canning outside using the turkey fryers . It costs us $15 for propane for the fryers.Hubby started clearing the north garden and I am starting on clearing the south gardens this afternoon. I bartered pumpkins last month with the young man (landlord's oldest son) that has steers and a pig in the barn here to haul the straw bales away from here. We decided to try Old World Garden Farms raised rows next year. Straw bales kept the weeding down and plants did well but seeds didn't make at all as the wind kept blowing the dirt away even with packing it down and watering it.Hubby ( hopefully) mowed for the last time.We are still looking for brown socks for me and jeans for Hubby on sale.Back to eating from the pantry 😁Standing in my kitchen looking towards the butler's pantry this is what you would see. The door with the Live, laugh landry is the door that goes to the basement.When the basement door is shut , which is few and far between this is what you would see. I copied this from Julia Child and it has worked great for myself and my youngest daughter that also has one....there is a cast iron skillet missing from the left bottom and a skillet that is missing above all the others. I was fixing dinner.YES that is a braid of garlic hanging there to remind me to USE it. It was gift as they didn't remember I grew my own garlic. I don't braid so it's something different for me.If you were in the butler's panty and the basement door was shut this is what you would see.Tea balls on top, cheese grater next row down, immersion blender next row , whisks the next row, ricer and old masher in the next. I don't keep anything in the bottom row. It hits the water storage (that's for flushing the toilets) and stops the door from being opened all the way.If you are standing in the kitchen door way and looking to your right this is your view. Hubby made both. The white one was a bookcase that stands over 7 ft tall and is 4 feet wide.I have a one pot, two cast iron dutch ovens and the 2 beverage jugs we use for family dinners on top of it.Next shelf down, cake mixes and cookie mixes on sale with coupons so it's about 50¢....I use the cake mixes as a short cut for cookies and dump cakes. Cookie mixes also but usually you will find oatmeal cookie mix for using on top of fruit crisps or pies when I am under the gun for a dessert.Next shelf is frostings (on sale with coupons so about 50¢) less waste with the just the two of us as we don't frost most of the cakes we do eat. Bisquick....Hubby just refuses to try anything else and since he is the one that makes the waffles and pancakes he can have his Bisquick LOL. Wondra instant flour (me) and a small container of AP flour if I only need a small amt so I'm not lifting 25 lbs of sugar to get to the bucket of AP flour. Tostadas and ramen noodles, then Parmesan cheese in the bottle, then Velveeta cheese( bought on sale with coupons) and then Hubby's go to when he is on his own or he is cooking and doesn't really want to but I am not available for whatever reason...Velveeta mac and cheese (served with hamburger or sausage in it or smoked sausage on the side).Down one more shelf, Carnation Essentials mixes(bought on sale with coupons) for when I am having a Crohn's attack and am on a liquid diet for 3-7 days. I have one week supply of 4 of them a day. Cream of wheat, grits, quick oats and regular oats.Funnel cake pourer and mix. Tortilla chips (taco salad, refried beans and cheese, salsa etc) Fritos (walking taco salad, chili,salsa. veggie dip) potato chips...one of the few things I can get down during a Crohn's attack that will settle my stomach faster than meds. We limit how much we eat of the \"chips\" because they are part of our meals or for my Crohn's. Then there is boxes of gingersnaps, vanilla wafers, lady fingers, graham crackers and Grape nuts (I use grape nuts in parfaits with yogurt or pudding).Next row is what we call the home take out row...this is my first line of battle against the eat out monster. Instant polenta, hamburger helper ( I have hamburger and bulk sausage cooked, bagged and in freezers) freezer to plate meal (thank you to son that also forgets to thaw his chicken). Instant rice mixes that Hubby uses to stuff his green bell pepper that I don't eat. Gnocchi that I do eat.Rice noodles, powdered egg drop soup (Hubby makes me when I am sick or have Crohns attack)Stove top stuffing (me as Hubby doesn't like stuffing/dressing of any kind). Instant mashed potatoes (won't be buying that any more since I can now make my own dehydrated potato granules) a few boxes of potatoes that was bought before I bought the buckets of sliced, diced and hash browns.Whistle Stop fried green tomato batter that I use for anything that is being battered and deep fried. I even used it to batter eggplant and fried green tomatoes that went in the freezer. My sweeteners...black strap molasses, pancake syrup for Hubby ( I use dark Karo and it's in the frig) Maple syrup (goes in frig after opening) honey,light corn syrup,sorghum, boiled apple cider syrup and basmatic vinegar syrup bought from Italy from a friend and Hubby's plastic containers he uses to pack his lunch. These will be moved when he retires and I go through all the plastic containers .Next row down is what Hubby calls my King Arthur flour row.  It has easy roll dough improver, baker's special dried milk, non-diastatic malt powder, whipped cream stabilizer,lime juice powder, lemon juice powder, pizza dough flavor (great for making crackers) baker's cinnamon filling mix (with a promise of having homemade cinnamon rolls when he retires), organic barley malt, Ammonium carbonate, instant yeast (2 lbs). Chicken bouillon, beef bouillon, and tomato bouillon. Cocoa, regular and dark, instant choc drink, dried milk , dried buttermilk and coffee creamer which is used more for instant hot cocoa mix than coffee.Bottom row... soda... Vernors ginger soda (sick/Crohn's) Sprite (sick/Crohn's) coke just a few for company because they feel weird if I have to go to the root cellar to get it and then wipe the bottle clean. Variety of cranberry juice (Hubby) V8 Fusion (crohn's) lemon juice and lime juice bottled ( just gifted)small cans of pineapple juice, instant coffee ( for instant mocha for friends) instant raspberry tea and instant lemon tea (in laws drink)This next shelving unit was built when we were renting a 800 sq house with few cabinets. Hubby built it for my small appliances. It's now a joke in the family as it holds all the alcohol when we don't really drink...I use the most of it for cooking... along with most the wine we have stored in the pantry. The kids know not to buy a bottle of something without checking to see if we have it...should really store it with the herbs and spices since it's used in that line more. Takes 2 pictures as I can't stand in front of it due to the narrowness of this area.Top shelf meat slicer with limoncello  and Grappa from Italy from friend.Next shelf, mixes that I add water or Sprite instead of booze for the kids and grandkids, syrups for coffees.Next shelf  the booze.. up front is the whiskey I use for hot toddy's.Next is the tea shelf that is the overflow of the tea from the tea drawer. Son thought I could use more tea.Next shelf down is tapioca pudding, pudding, jello and a stash of candy bars that I bought on sale with coupons.Bottom shelf is my favorite.It has the beer for the marinades I do from ribs/pork/brats ...no it's not been chilled so it's okay just like in the warehouse. AND the popcorn we have grew. I will have to grow more next years as I figure I have enough to go 12-18 months depending on whether we pop weekly or biweekly. We LOVE popcorn.This is Hubby's go to when he is hungry but shouldn't be eating like before bed. His parents are the same way so I know where he got that habit from.When we married it was a box every other day, now it's more like a couple weeks and I figure it won't be that when he retires as I plan to have a healthy snack (like popcorn) in the evenings since our dinner will still be around 5 and I know he will struggle to go to sleep as he has worked 3rd shift even as a kid when he was farming ...over 45 yrs at least.Only 2 more areas left to do... the dining room with the dried fruit/veggies along with the herbs and spice cabinet and the paper/personal goods in the upstairs.Oh yeah...We started with the gifts and I thought since I was still canning that I take a picture of on going projects ... HA HAI remember when my late husband would start shopping for toys for the kids in Jan. I would finish up with buying the clothes starting Oct 16th when the layaway for Christmas started.These are the 2 presents that get shipped and usually it's at the last minute so we have to pay extra to get them there in time. SO now they can be shipped through the regular mail saving us MONEY.I have another present for Mom O that is almost done and Hubby is working on the present for Dad O.I have most of the great grandson's presents...just need to wrap them and finish the last 2 of his presents.We are still thinking of Daddy's,kids and grandkids presents. Hey it's not November with me working on Tday dinner items and trying to think of Christmas. Best is we got the ones that need shipped done !!!!😀😀"},
{"title": "The root cellar is done", "date": "Tuesday, October 10, 2017", "text": "YEAH!!!! that leaves the butler's pantry and right now that's a mess from the canning. I don't keep food in the kitchen beyond different vinegars and oils. About 1/4 of the canned goods in this area was part of the emergency food that now needs ate up.Wee Be Little pumpkins 2 a week for 20 wks Might be 4 a week as we love molasses custard baked in them also besides just having them with butter melted in them as they roast.Canned beans. Canned meat. Canned butter. Yes that is soda behind the winter squash. For when I have Crohn's flare ups (ginger soda) or we get sick (sprite) and some coke for when we have guest that doesn't drink tea or coffee. I drink 4 oz a night of coke cola... yes really 4 oz. I like it room temp and flat. Drives Hubby buggy as the bottle sits all week before I finish it.  12 winter squash will last 12 weeks. The red crate is sweet potatoes we bought at auction and the white box is our sweet potatoes the mice left us.The bottom shelf is the blankets and water for emergency. Shelf up in canned potatoes, mashed potatoes in ice cream container,assorted lentils, quinoa, barley, millet etc. Top shelf is juice bought on sale and odds and end veggies bought for emergency supply.The white buckets in this room is dehydrated potatoes, hash browns, sliced and diced.The two blue crates in baking potatoes and potatoes about 3 inch diameter or more. The cat litter box is empty and just being used to keep crate off floor.Son cleaned it with bleach before passing to me.Pie plate is what I put potatoes in to bring up to fix for meals. It was my late husband's grandmother's.Bucket next to crate of potatoes (which is sitting on another bleached cat litter bucket) is ramen noodles. The potatoes are seconds...less than 3 inches, possibly nicked or has a bit of green on them. The nicked/green ones got sorted out and are being used to make dehydrate mashed potato granules. There is about 25-30 lbs per crate of the potatoes.I would have loved to had more sweet potatoes and delicata squash.  BUT I have plenty to get me through the year until next season.Blessed be"},
{"title": "Frugal first week.", "date": "Monday, October 9, 2017", "text": "We bought 2 games on sale for retirementWe bought 3 gifts for the great grandson on sale. We bought a puzzle Hubby wants to put together and frame for his dad.We bought 8 bags of softener salt on sale . We usually wait for the 11 % rebate at Menards but this sale saved us $2 a bag which is more than the rebate. We will try to remember to go back before the sale is over and get enough for the truck to use as weight for this winter and that will be our softener salt in the spring.I got $15 off a 101 oz can of olive oil.I got cashews for the cheapest price I have found.I dehydrated basil, the last of the sage, the last of the oregano and the last of the rosemary. I still have basil, and thyme and chives.I harvested the last of the jalapeno peppers.I dehydrated 20 lbs of onions for onion flakes and onion powder, the last 10 lbs that can't be stored is being caramelized as I sit here.I harvested Roma tomatoes and started cooking them for sauce.I harvested,cooked and froze the last of the eggplant.Instead of going to the Golden corral as our standard after I have a doctor appt  about 2 hrs away one way, we went to China buffet at lunch time, Hubby got his potstickers and dumplings and we spent half of what we usually do at Golden corral. That was our eat out for last week. This week will be tonight as it's Hubby's birthday and that is part of the gift from me, I already gave his is colored tee shirts.I pulled some of the garden plants as I harvested so Hubby doesn't have to worry about dealing with that this coming weeks.I found some lotion in a pump bottle half price.Hubby got his last free set of steel toe work boots . Company pays twice a year for his boots. This set won't see the inside of the plant as Hubby \"breaks\" his boots in for about 3-4 months before wearing them in plant to avoid blisters. These are $140 boots along with $25 sole inserts that will wear a good 2-3 yearsLast year we got a membership for Sam's club through Living Social. It was the $100 membership and we got it for about half price and then a $20 gift card, and about $45 in food and when we went the first time we saved about $50 on things we bought. This year we \"downsized\" the membership to standard at $45...BUT we still had $30 cash rewards sitting there so I used it to pay on the membership so it only cost me $15 for the membership this year. We buy our frying oil (we deep fry 4 turkeys for our family dinner and 2 for SCARES Christmas dinner) We use around 14 gals but always want a little more as we have had issues of containers blowing a hole or splash over. Four containers of oil at 35 lbs each (est 4.5 gal.) is $28 less at Sam's than anywhere else we have priced. I always price the day we go just in case someone is cheaper.So we get 5 and consider the 5th one free for my cooking through the year.I open curtains in morning, close them in evening. Not having to run heat or Central air or AC in bedroom. I have had to turn the fan (after the wind coming in the window isn't enough) on where I am working during the sunny days.  I have cooked from the pantry and when it's cooler I use the oven to help warm the kitchen. I've used my homemade laundry soap in laundry, quick cycle and the drying rack for about half the laundry.It takes a full 24 hrs to get things dry in the basement so I have to be careful that I don't have something start molding instead of drying. When using the dryer I wash and dry heaviest items first so it they need rebooted (I use auto dry) they can go in the next load instead of just rebooting the dryer.I've mended a couple shirts and pants.We used up ALL the leftovers from the week  :)  The electric will be up with all the canning and 5 dehydrators going.We have figured out if we eat a \"large\" lunch instead of just a wrap sandwich we don't want to eat at dinner. SO using that for when Hubby retires in 7 weeks and 3 days. We decided the main meal of the day to be lunch as I can't eat a lot at breakfast. We will have soup or sandwich or chef salad for dinner instead.Not that will save us much as I have most of the pantry stocked but it will help on keeping the weight down as Hubby won't be putting in 150,000 plus steps a week when he retires.Right now the forecast isn't calling for a frost for at least 7 days possible 10.Still with me having my back injections and now adding injections for the shoulder arm I will be down probably 7 - 10 days from this coming Friday. Hubby will be on 1st shift through the week due to EMT class so that means he won't be able to help in the mornings like he does on 3rd. SO the frugal part is working to get as much in from the gardens BEFORE the injections.Joke of the day... Hubby yelled from the mudroom and scared the crap right out of me as he isn't one to yell... When I came running and asked what was wrong, he pointed at the small amt of white space in the freezer and told me we were in a crisis and needed to fill it back up... HA HA. That's the family's running joke about me, because any time I get white space in the freezers I fill it back up."},

I pulled the jalapeno pepper plant and what was left on it is now on a paper plate. I might end up putting it in the dehydrator if it doesn't finish drying on it's on."},
{"title": "curbing the eating out monster.", "date": "Thursday, October 5, 2017", "text": "No they don't have anything to do with eating out... these are my son's cats Cuddles to the left that he fostered for a friend and then adopted and Bailey that he got from a rescue shelter. Bailey is not happy with Cuddles who is trying to take over BOTH boxes. I used to \"babysit\" them a lot when son was out of town with work. He is home most the time now and I miss my grandbabies so once a month he sends me a pic of the two.Our eating out budget is our monster. We use eating out as entertainment as Hubby doesn't like watching any movies even at home and I don't like sports unless I have family or friend in the game. We don't go to the malls and there really isn't anything around us to go do something like hiking...so we go to restaurants.We have tried putting the eat out money in with the groceries...that didn't work as well as we had hoped.It's also has been Hubby's answer to when I go down with my Crohn's and he doesn't like to cook, sometimes he won't even use the microwave.This morning we sat down and listed the restaurants that we go to with the knowledge it averages to be $40 each time out with tip. YES I kept track this year. how many times and the costs AND told Hubby and then  I watched his face fall. It averaged out to 2.7 times a week of eating out AND $5,320.Bob Evans ... 6 times a year as the only time we go is with my Daddy that loves this place and their sausage gravy and biscuits (he is homebound). That remains as at the age of 90  I am not going to tell him I can't take him even if I have to eat nail soup for a week.YES we pay for him. I started getting gift cards for this from Krogers and at least earn double points.Mt Victory plaza inn. 3 times a year with Hubby's parents Mom and Dad O. Also with remain as they are in their 80s but they pay for themselves. This will drop down to 2 times a year as they are to the point of not wanting to go out in the cold and wet of winter or fall and it's about 40 min from their home.Lock 16 steak house..Hubby's birthday and our anniversary. He can get whatever steak his little heart desires. We will drop this down to Hubby's birthday because I really don't care if I eat much steak...give me pork chops LOL.Mizolsol China and Mel-o-dee's is when we are at our son's but he is now starting to cook for us instead of us going out to eat or him ordering in. That was 2 times a year for each., we paid for ourselves and Son paid for himself and the tip..he tips very well. But he agreed that we could drop this down to 2 total.Perkins... 4 times a year after blood work so I don't pass out after fasting 14 hrs. I can't drink OJ after fasting so I am going to try to remember to bring my hot tea with a bit of honey in it and see if that will keep the faint away with having a bfast already fixed and just needing nuked when we get home 30 min drive home so I'm closer to fasting 15 hrs.Golden Corral 4 times a year. Two times after my back injections which is 2 hrs from home and 2 times after our meetings with our finance guy which is 2 hrs away from home . We only live here due to Hubby's job so are looking at moving closer to kids, doctors etc. drop to 2Hong Kong ... was 12 times a year as we meet with friends and our son but are looking at 6 times a year.China Buffet ...we stopped going here when Hong Kong opened due to that's where our friends and son prefer. We  decided to go to China buffet 4Inn Between Tavern. 12 meals in 12 meals taken out...it's within 3 miles of us, great food , great specials and way too much eating out... Their deep fried chicken dinner on Wed and their deep fried fish every Friday especially during Lent. SO we are giving up the chicken dinner and making it 6 times a year with 3 of those time probably being during Lent.Cracker barrel...used to be 12 times a year is now twice a year. Both of us is okay with this just going away completely.Taco Bells... Hum this started when I was in college and ate there every day. We have weaned me down to 12 times a year. This year I plan on 0 as I can make the same food at home...I know but the drinks keeps me going back not the food.Wendy's 12 times a year This is Hubby's go to LOL we decided 0 I have frozen hamburgers and bacon just need to keep buns on hand so he can have his baconator. Neither of us eats French fries that much nor do I drink soda fountain pop.Subway 12 times a year ...philly cheese steak foot long on flat bread toasted with loaded with veggies. I haven't found a flatbread equal to it nor do I keep steak around that much so we decided  4 times a year even though  90% of the time I either use coupons or my points.Applebees... 2 times a year. Once was when his parents wanted to go another was when A friend wanted us to try their blackened steak. We decide 0 this year.We told his parents we would prefer to eat at their Chinese place than Applebees or we could bring the meal. And we can just tell the other friend we aren't going there.Wingers... sigh their wings in garlic butter and the deep fried veggies... was 4 times a year is now 2.KFC...not for the chicken but Monday night potpie special and Tuesday night country fried steak ...was 12 not 0Trojans' den..12 calzones... 0Al's pizza 6...every other month rotated between philly steak pizza, Al's combo(loaded with veggies)and taco pizza... now 3. No I can't match their pizzas.Dairy Queen... we don't get food we get ice cream using whatever coupon. Was 12 times will go down to 6 . I don't keep ice cream on hand beyond klondikes or Hubby will eat a quart at a time and that's down from the half gal.Wagner's... is actually a grocery store but we found they have great fried chicken and we can get exactly the amt we want for less than KFC or Inn Between. 4 times a yearNew place... this was happening about 12 times a year someone from work would  want us to go with them now it will be 4This averages to once a week with $2080 for the year.. I don't see it be that high as I know I will split the pizza up to make 4 meals so that will make 9 times of  less eating out. Hubby will be retired so less likely of coworker asking us to go with them. I decided to keep us focused to make a yearly calendar with the restaurants listed each month. When we go we mark it off ...might replace some of our favorites with new places as Son brought up going to a Mexican place he likes instead of Misolsol China... and that's okay too. I have a full pantry, I am checking to make sure I can make Hubby's favorite take out from home. Daughter suggested a couple options for me to replace my \"new drink\" at Taco Bell LOL. Have to adjust to making 1 drink for just me as Hubby only drinks water, coffee and unsweetened tea.I would love to see this go down to every other week but I feel at this time Hubby might feel deprived and maybe resentful since he is retiring. To help with this I am asking him to help make the menu to get in some meals he would like to have.Do you have an eating out monster?"},
{"title": "Oh yeah it's October", "date": "Sunday, October 1, 2017", "text": "You know how some nights go....dead tired, fall asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow then when you wake up and feel like you slept all night only to find out that you only slept a few hours so you take that potty break, get a glass of water and then go back to bed hoping that you fall back to sleep only to just lay there HOURS? Yeah that night...was last night. Of course my mind decided to start running so I updated the stock pantry list and tried going back to bed and then it started listing all the work I need to get done... so I thought \"dump it\" on paper , got up again , got paper, pen and dumped it.and then flipped the page and added thisYes I even did math trying to figure if I should break the grocery money down per week or month or bimonthly and NO it didn't help me go to sleep, that happened around 3 when I might as well got up AND Rascal woke me up at 7 even though Hubby had let him out and dealt with fresh water and food.This morning over coffee I talked to Hubby about how huge the list was and then stopped because of the look on his face...then it clicked...it's OCTOBER and every OCTOBER I am on overload between the gardens,getting ready for winter, weather changing back and forth triggers pain, pain and not eating right and not getting good sleep triggers my Crohn's and this year I focused on filling the pantry completely now instead of filling it in Nov/Dec/ Jan as he reminded me of pork for New Year's Eve and Day.SO...First I have several medical appointments on top of my therapy I need to stay on top of and along with that is quick simple meals for dinner that I don't have issues with and  WITHOUT eating out.We decided on 3 things concerning the pantry...First we will not buy anything unless it is a need and we BOTH agree it's a need. We have already agreed on what is left that is NEEDED to be stocked in the pantry. We also talked over what we think of as Fresh produce/dairy needed on a weekly/ 10 day/ bi weekly (haven't figured that one out yet) time frame and still are figuring out what is reasonable for fresh food.I highlighted what is needed on the pantry list... we could go without it but it would make things a lot rougher. Most of them are at Sam's club and we usually go to a certain Steak house for Hubby's birthday and Sam's club is right across the street. A steak at Lock 16 in Lima OH for his birthday and Prime rib for Christmas eve is the only thing he ever asks for.Second I would keep track of what we buy, spend per category and per store for the next 12 months starting today. http://www.lifefreedomfamily.com/2017/09/the-great-grocery-project-one-year-recap.html?m=1 is the base plan of what I plan to use.Third, we would be using a lot of ideas/menus from Brandy http://www.theprudenthomemaker.com/Fourth, I would keep better track of the savings   http://thecouponproject.com/downloads/savings-tracker/ I have used this savings tracker for years.I prioritized what I was doing in the gardens and what I am processing. I will need to get up a bit earlier to get things around for the dehydrators before I start canning and I have to pay attention to leaving during the day for appointments.I checked the weather forecast for the next 10-14 days and it's decent even if we get the rain (PLEASE) that they are forecasting. SO for those days the work..yard/gardens/weatherization will be done. The week of the 16th Hubby will be taking classes for his EMT recert on 1st shift I will focus on inside the house (weatherization, winter bedding, etc)and sewing the winter curtains.My goal is to have this workload completely before Nov 1st when Nanowrimo starts for those that want to write books and need support to get it in gear. https://nanowrimo.org/ AND start on Thanksgiving and Christmas.Blessed BeI had a Crohn's attack at the first of the week so stayed home. Was able to still can pasta sauce and applesauce and work on pantry shelves.  I need soy sauce , that's the empty spot on the bottom where there are 2 bottles by themselves.This one is pretty full.Bottom two shelves is assorted dried beans and canned beans.I've done swagbucks and pinecone research.Hubby got the truck brakes fixed and the truck is now getting 5 more miles/gallon.I went Wed to my therapy free at wellness center and came straight back home..Thursday we went to check out a house that really came close to what we are looking for...by Saturday it had sold when we decided to take a second look. Wasn't on the market a week.Friday we went to Hubby's parents as his dad is having trouble breathing and they are now checking his heart as everything else has came back good. He has an ultrasound for his heart this week and then some blood work and possibly a stress test.His mom fixed lunch and was telling me she spends $145 every 10 days for the two of them.Her daughter had her go to Aldi's but Mom O wasn't happy with the taste of the green beans until  I compared what she liked to what was Aldi's and pointed out that what she liked had salt where Aldi's didn't and she was salting the green beans also when she cooked and then turned around and told me that Dad O wasn't suppose to have salt so she had slowly replaced the salt on the table with salt substitute... when I repeated back to her what she had just said and had her check how much salt was already in the green beans she was knocking her knuckles against her head. DUH But she did give me some tips for cooking for two for when Hubby retires.On the way back we swung by G &R tavern in Waldo OH and picked up a full roll (32 slices) of their bologna that we had ordered ahead of time. It's special bologna and something I can eat without problems. We love it fried. twice a year we buy a roll and then freeze it so we can have the sandwiches without driving 2 hrs to have it.Also it's half the price as a roll than what they serve as the sandwich.We split the roll with a friend that never goes there but loves the bologna (because we shared LOL).Plus we aren't going out to the way to go there.Saturday I went to the community(Village) yard sales. I didn't find any curtains like I was hoping. Found one set and since all the rooms have 2 I almost didn't buy it until my girlfriend ask if I was putting a curtain in the butler's pantry. Found a winter throw rug for the mud room, a crib blanket for my feet in bed,a gray winter shawl , 5 canning jars, and 2 gym bags as mine is ripped and I figured if I didn't get the second one for $2 Hubby's would rip and I would be kicking my butt.. I found a knit neck scarf for my one daughter who is always cold, some tank tops for my other daughter that is burning up under her uniform, a circular saw and hedge trimmer for my son and a toy truck for great grandson.We came home instead of hitting Wendy's which was right there, ate lunch and went to town to use the Kroger points for gas and I do the shopping. Saved 50¢/gal on gas. I went to CVS and bought CVS allergy meds(on sale) and Xlear, had a coupon for the Xlear and 30% off total price from CVS so I saved closer to 40%.I then went to Krogers...first I hate shopping on weekends especially in the afternoon. This wasn't as bad as I feared with it being the last day of the month also. They were restocking from the morning shoppers so I did some substituting and stayed in my price point of things. I saved 21%.Hubby dug up the sweet potatoes.... it was a good yield...for the mice. He wears a size 10 boot.Double the amount shown in this picture and the  mice ate almost every single one. Well fed for sure...grrr but at least they weren't in my pantry doing that. We ended up with about 3 meals worth.I doubt if we will try again.This morning we put the groceries away in the pantry and Hubby hung the onions for me.AND we talked about where the pantry was and what we should still try to stock before he retires. What we felt would be fresh that would need to be bought, do we go every 7 days or 10 days like his mom or just when we are going to be in the town. Something for us to decide tonight over dinner.Have a Blessed week."},
{"title": "Kitchen Scraps...", "date": "Tuesday, September 26, 2017", "text": "One of the memories my youngest daughter and I share is the Thanksgiving dinner we were prepping the veggie tray and someone who will remain nameless thought they were helping tossed the peels in the trash and we looked in the trash can and mourned the lost of the the veggie broth we would have made... that is when my Daddy told me that sometimes I get too frugal in the kitchen. I looked back at him and asked who was it that told me each and every bite was important because when you are hungry one bite can mean a lot...it was him.I wash my veggies and  keep the peelings off onions, carrots, potatoes, stems of cauliflower and broccoli plus the strings and ends of celery, bell pepper cores (without most of the seeds) and toss them in a freezer bag, when I get a gal of peelings I make veggie broth/stock. Price it at the store and you will start tossing your peelings in the freezer also. Garlic skins in the freezer bag..The ends of mushrooms also (store mushrooms in a brown lunch bag and put in frig and they will last longer). They can go together and make veggie broth or I can use the broccoli stems for stir fry,salads or cream of broccoli soup or slaw if I have enough. Mushrooms simmered are a good base for sauces, gravies or mushroom soup. Potato peels simmered make a good starch water for gravies and I have used the water also for potato soup or baked potato skins. I don't do cabbage for broth... I will make freezer slaw if I have enough of the outer tougher leaves to make it with.I eat radish greens,carrot tops,beet greens and turnip greens...and the greens of scallions(AKA green onions).I also saute these and freeze them to toss in broth or casseroles or soups.Citrus peels go in vinegar for cleaning or dried for zest or put in salt or sugar , I will candy them during the holidays to give as gifts.Bones go into a stock pot to make broth... fish (which isn't very often since the grandson isn't around that fishes) pork (goes well in cabbage dishes and stews) ham (beans, cabbage) beef (noodles, soups, stews) poultry(soups, stews, noodles) not touching gravy. Gravy and bread was my Daddy's breakfast during warm months, oatmeal was for winter. That's what he ate for 16 yrs every morning.I also keep, strain and freeze these meats fat (well not fish). I have kept shrimp shells for seafood broth but Hubby's cholesterol goes up with shell fish so I don't do that unless I know the kids are going to be around.Dried out cheese or rinds are saved to thicken or flavor sauces and casseroles.I will cut mold off and use the rest of the cheese.Fruit skins and cores can make juice or jams or syrups including watermelon rind  as pickles or shrubs.Bread heels, crumbs etc go into bread crumbs, bread pudding (sweet or savory) French toast, into soups, salads, dressings (AKA stuffings) coatings for foods.Herb stems are kept in bags for adding to stocks and broths. I'll be straining it anyways and it gives the same flavor.I simmer corn cobs to make corn cob syrup (good on corn bread and Johnny cakes/hoe cakes) and corn cob jam.If you save the husks you can make tamales.I reuse my pickling brine including the pickled beet brine.At one time both my parents grew grease bean a type of green bean. Mom called them shuck beans... regretfully they thought you could only eat the bean inside (like a pea) and threw away the outside which is called leather britches that can be cooked long time after you dehydrate them.I use old cookies for topping on fruit crisps or pies or as pie crust (like a graham cracker crust)No wine goes down the drain no matter how old or how long is has been open. I either use it in cooking or turn it into vinegar ...usually cooking.We drink coffee, we drink day old coffee or even a couple days old coffee, or it goes in stews or gravies. Grounds go to the compost or garden.Egg shells get washed, dried and crushed for the gardens.Put bread heel in sugar and it will soften it that goes also for cookies when sealed in a container or bag.Tea bags as I sit here drinking my 3rd cup of tea from the same bag. I have gathered a couple of the same tea bags and brewed in water then cooked rice in that water. Used it as a hair conditioner, tossed in the garden ...tons of things to do with used tea bags.I cook all my winter squash including pumpkin, dehydrate it for using later. I use the squash seeds in shell for snacks and out of the shell as nuts.When I was growing up Daddy always had a spot for the compost from the house went. He moved it every year. Just didn't plant that area... about a 4 ft x 4 ft area . Here on this farm we use the fields as we get enough compost from the manure/straw from the barns. When I check the ph in the gardens late fall I will put what is needed for it on it then to \"marry\" over winter."},
{"title": "Done this week.", "date": "Sunday, September 24, 2017", "text": "I pray that everyone is finding a blessing each and every day.As today I was up at 3 am sick with allergies and praying it wasn't like the sinus infection Hubby came down with ...my blessing is it's just a bad allergy flare up and the meds I keep on hand are working really well. It's a day of rest anyways so being totally worn out from not being able to breath and being sick from the meds I can rest.I cleaned another shelving unit in the basement. This is one is the speciality flours, assorted bread crumbs,dehydrated eggs (top shelf) pastas (2nd and 3rd shelves, ramen noodles in 1 -5 gal bucket)) and different rices, bottom shelf (and 2 of the 5 gal buckets). School scissors is in the hanging basket to cut the panty hose the onions are in (not shown) along with the cleaning rag that I had and put there so I wouldn't forget to toss in laundry.Like it was hard to walk 10 ft to the washer and toss it with the rest of the cleaning rags...SIGH. 5  shelving units to go.The buckets do show that gamma seal lids we got at Menards during the 11% rebate for all the food buckets so I don't have to either fix something else because I forgot to have Hubby pry open the bucket before he goes to bed or hurt myself (sure did ) trying to pry it open with my bad arm. I have found since we put them on that I am using more from the buckets than I was and we are having a better variety on the table. Boy do I miss my strength.Other side of the same shelving unit. On the floor( actually it's on a board) you can see my shortening...the oils and vinegars sit there also but Hubby had the storm door sitting there and the flash from the camera kept reflecting so it wasn't a good picture.I didn't think I should share a picture of the flash of my cell phone. ;)I found paprika and cayenne at my price point so stocked that up. I will make my spice blends AFTER I finish the gardens. I did go through my spice blend recipes to make sure I had what I needed to make them.I make over 2 dozen spice blends that can be bought at the store. but is cheaper for me to make it at home. A negative of being a professional personal/private chef is the costs of spices, herbs, condiments and booze that is can be required. I am thankful that I had several instructors that taught how to grow herbs, buy spices in bulk and what to sub for what you didn't want to use(broth or flavored water for booze) or couldn't afford to use. I can now use my dried cayenne for just straight cayenne powder. Next year I will have to grow cayenne so that's on my buy list for plants. Positive side is I serve a variety of foods from different countries.I did get the good news that I will not have to have surgery on the left shoulder at this time. I do have a slight, very slight bone spur and a lot of arthritis but nothing damaged or in the way of being damaged UNLESS I throw the shoulder out of place and don't immediately get it put back into place. The reason I am not able to put the right hand behind my back isn't the surgery but how my cerebral palsy has reacted to the surgery and sling. I have some stretches added to my daily stretches for my CP and my appointment to start therapy at Hubby's company's wellness center (we pay $26/yr for the 2 of us... yes just $26) . Doc did suggest I talk to my back doctor (pain doc) and see if he can help ease the stiffness as I am due for my injections. Shoulder doc, pain doc, Crohny doc and doc...doc is primary who is also a friend. that's the only way Hubby can keep the doc's straight .We met with our friends for dinner , no coupon and not during lunch time so that was not really frugal and worn out from being at the auction  but her hubby let us know at the dinner she was having knee replacement surgery and wouldn't be going out for dinner for a couple months.Very glad we decided to suck it up and meet them.Our youngest owes us money and is now at the stage of being able to make us payments (She's finally back to work full time) It was going to cost her to transfer it to me since we live 1 1/2 hrs away and neither of us is driving it. I said something to our son that I owe money to (he paid the deposit for the rental hall for our Tday dinner) and he suggested she pay him because he can transfer to me for free AND since he owes our mechanic and is making payments to him on a monthly basis through me (son uses debit/credit card only and mechanic charges a fee for use of  debit/credit card) I could just pay off the bill he has with the mechanic instead of paying him. He will also get the hall cheaper by being the one to sign for it since he is a member.A friend that stays in motels all the time due to work sent me the tea they leave in the room. Housekeeping told him they have to pitch it when he checks out because it might be contaminated so he kept it and sent it to me.I've saved my butter wrappers and they are in the freezer. I bakes a beef roast in the oven with root veggies, a pork roast with sweet potatoes in the crock pot for the first day of fall and made cheeseburgers and onions for the last day of summer. We ate leftovers the rest of the time except when we with friends that one time.We went to Amish produce auction. We have NEVER left with spending so little (only 1 /5 of what we budget and usually spend) and still we got most of what we went for. We got 40 of 10-15 lbs pumpkins for $28. That is 70¢ a pumpkin.We got 43 wee be little pumpkins ( the type that most people use for decorations.. we eat them) for 50¢ a piece, they are big enough that one will make a serving for each of us. We got 50 lbs of candy onions (think sweet onions ) for 60¢ lb. I have now gave the kids most of the others and will dehydrate what is left of what I had as the new onions are cured better so will store better. We got 70 lbs of apples for 40¢/lb. We wasn't going to get any but our friends let us know that it looked like not many would be coming from their neighbor. Better to have too many than not enough as we eat applesauce daily if I have it canned.We stopped at the produce market farm and got the last of the winter squash. They didn't have delicata or hubbard so we will most likely go without.We delivered pumpkins/potatoes and onions to 5 of the 6 kids. We got to see 4 of them as the one was running her kids to games and the other parent. She was happy we had dropped off the food but not thrilled her dad put a 50 lbs bag of potatoes on her driver's seat and passenger seat of her car.Lucky for her that her boyfriend stopped in and moved them for her as he laughed at watching her rolling them out of the car onto a blanket to pull them into the house. She might remember to get that key she made us to us before we deliver something again.  I got to play a bit with my great grandson while his momma helped Hubby unload what she was taking... and she took the rest to deliver to 2 of our friends that wasn't home so we wouldn't have to make another 1 1/2 hr one way trip or leave it where it could be stolen. I got to see my one granddaughter that I haven't seen in over a year as she is always doing something when we are in the area.Hubby mowed all of the yard and ditches including all the trimming.We had 5 not so good pumpkins in the 40 that I decided instead of trying to process it right now along with tomatoes etc that I would just use the for decorations. Hubby decided afterwards he would toss them to the cows and pig landlord's son has here. They were okay with that.I washed some jars I found in the garage that had came from an auction last year and was shoved under the bench behind the metal tool box that used to sit in the truck bed. Hubby uses it for storage.I bartered 7 pumpkins with the landlord's oldest son (he has a boy and girl) in exchange of him hauling the dead plants and straw from the gardens when I wrap that up. He said he could actually use it because they need  that type of stuff for the compost pile they have at his grandmother's house.He can get the stuff when he cleans the barn next month or in early Nov.My son gave me a pair of flannel pj bottoms that he didn't like (too warm for him) that I can wear as long as I roll the waistband when I am walking so I don't trip on the length. So that's off my to sew list.We decided against planting anything for winter since the gardens are still going crazy. I can buy romaine lettuce at Aldi's once a month for our lettuce needs. Our friend planted lettuce 3 times in the last month and this heat just killed it off.I have 3 appointments still to schedule but am waiting on the one so I can hopefully tie at least 1 if not 2 in with the trip.Hubby told me this morning after he went out and played 10(ball as we started limiting him to 10 throws after spending 8 hrs doing nothing but playing ball with him as a pup) with Rascal that I have herbs, tomatoes, and eggplants to deal with and he wasn't sure but maybe bell peppers by the end of the week as they still haven't turned orange or red yet. I know I have some onions in the one box in the north gardens that need pulled and cured. I know I have flowers to dead head.Blessed be and have a wonderful first week of fall."},
{"title": "Warm snap/ preparing for our new future", "date": "Tuesday, September 19, 2017", "text": "Menard's had their 11 % rebate sale still going on so we replaced the bad turkey fryers that went out while I was using them canning. Hubby bought 1 new fryer (not the pot part just the burner and stand) and one burner saving over $60 of buying 2 new ones.Which was good as I canned over 20 pts of caponata in one day. We got 40 lbs of dog food bringing us up to 80 lbs so that should take us through 4 months with just Rascal. I bought 2 new throw rugs for less than $4 each, a rubber one (think front door rug) to go on the metal trunk at the end of our bed so Rascal's nails don't scratch it and it stays in place and one for in front of the stove(the picture) as that one was sliding on me and that's an accident waiting to happen... I have accidents every day don't need to \"plan\" for one.Caponata: eggplant, onions and tomatoes and in this case bell peppers because I still had 6 left after canning and didn't want to see them any more LOL.I sorted through my bag of chef potatoes (baking potatoes) and they are in the root cellar.I still have 50 lbs to dehydrate for mashed potatoes though a few of them might go in storage.I rewrote the stock up list as I can't trust my brain and more than I can my body, as once again I fell and hit my arm that I had surgery on...GRRR.Daddy's first ride in his Goodwill wheelchair fixed by my sister in law.Daddy was smiling all the way up the hill as Hubby pushed him up, said he enjoyed the ride back down as Hubby took him down backwards since it was so steep. Grandson(14 yr old...Daddy's great grandson) asked if he could sit on his lap for a ride. Daddy told him no...then waited a beat and said he would sit on the grandson's lap instead and it was okay if he popped a wheelie....as daughter told everyone the boys had found an old wheelchair in the barn and they cleaned it up and brought it in a pop wheelies through the house with it.I made brownies with mini choc chips and carrot cake (cut the raisins up as Daddy can't eat whole raisins) for the family reunion from the pantry. My older daughter let me know while in route she forgot to get the veggie tray and since we were going to be there early could we stop and get something and she could pay us back. She told us what she was going to pay. We stopped and got a veggie tray, a fruit tray and a  dozen of assorted muffins and still was less than what she would have paid. PLUS she told us to bring the leftovers home.Since we both forgot to grab some chicken that my brother brought to the reunion to bring home for dinner we snacked on the veggie and fruit trays along with what was left of the brownies and carrot cake (grandsons didn't realize  they left it or we wouldn't have had it to bring home) Hubby had a lunch meat wrap to go with is even though he was not feeling good all day. Woke with no voice and a nasty sore throat Sunday and today.On the way back home from the reunion, we realized the route we take to the Amish auction (this coming Friday)was going to have a detour that day which also meant we couldn't get to the 2 places that was on our list with the towing the trailer to pick up winter food from so today I went over and got what I could. Winter sq isn't coming in for them very well but I got 4 squashes when I wanted 12. Might be going without if I don't find more. I did well at the Amish country store, even though I didn't get the paprika or cayenne like I wanted because of the price.I will see if I can find fresh cayenne that I can dry and grind myself.They were out of paprika so I will have to get it else where as I make other spice blends with it. By going today we can go another way to the auction and not add 60 miles detour to get to the other places while hauling a trailer which cuts the gas mileage in half as it is.Hubby woke me up coughing through the night and when I did get up this morning he couldn't hardly talk so I called and got him in to the ENT doc which Hubby was NOT happy with me for doing...good thing I did as he has an infection and it was triggering his GERD to the point it was going to be doing DAMAGE... he is on meds for the infection and will have his primary deal with allergy meds to take in the spring and fall for now on. OTC just doesn't work for him it seems.This week is suppose to be mid 80s with rain... I put the flower pots out to get rained on. We had to turn the AC back on as it's is way to hot in here especially for Hubby without it. AC is set at 78 °.We are ate out twice ( medical appts both times only 9 more to go and hopefully none will result in surgery),  got the cheapest meal (bfast)we could and used coupons and both times brought food home for another meal with only adding a veggie or fruit. I only bought milk and lettuce from the store for us for our weekly (well biweekly now). The rest is stock up only.Hubby told me he would rather see me spending the money to stock up on sale NOW rather than put the money in an account earning next to nothing in interest and then spending more for it AND paying for gas to go to town for it this winter. We have 3.75 mos. of our budget saved right now for this coming winter. Our goal is/was 4 mos as we know we will have money coming in with in 2 mos of his retirement of Dec 1st.It's just the time of the retirement being winter...higher utilities, more gas costs to drive to town due to having to warm up the truck and weight in the back of the truck, on top of the health ins costs. In middle of writing this we lost the transformer in the back yard so everything shut down. Power surge caught it.BUT since it didn't make any sound ( they usually explode)I didn't realize it had blew. Everyone in neighborhood was out. So Hubby cranked up the generator. Two hours later everyone had electric but us. Landlord  came down to see if there was something going on that Hubby was missing and found the insulator laying in the yard, it was split in half. An hour later the repair truck was here and the transformer on the road blew as he was pulling up. He shut down the electric and within 30 mins had everything fixed (thanks (NOT) to now dead squirrel) .Waited to make sure we could turn lights on in the house before leaving.  I can say we can handle being without electric for about 24 hours before we would need to go get gas. We can get gas from the neighbor that is 1/2 mile from us. Their generator is propane ran and they have gas tanks due to their business. The propane tank for the grill is full and there is backup if needed.Hubby took another night of work off due to still being sick. I had my MRI for my other shoulder this morning so we got all our prescriptions while in town.We also swung by the chiropractor to see if he could squeeze us in since we were in town instead of us coming back in 2 hrs later. Worked better for the doctor also as he had no one this morning and was back to back with clients later.I washed foil and box inserts and hung them on the drying rack to dry. I hung a load of laundry I washed in cold tap water and homemade laundry soap (I use vinegar for softener). I added water to shampoo and conditioner. I saved veggie peels in freezer to make veggie stock later. I save meat grease for later also. I am collecting scarlet runner beans as they dry to replant next year. I get one bean about every other week.The birds pretty much munched down on the blooms and the mole did a really good job of messing up all the flowers and those beans in that sq ft garden.Bought myself 2 pairs of jeans (first in 10 yrs if not longer) that was marked down 30% and bras (sorry to the  guys). Nothing is fitting right and beyond my sewing talents or it's so worn out it's not worth wearing any more...and believe me I have clothes I bought and wore regular since 2005, my jeans I've been wearing is my youngest daughter's and she bought them in 2001) I might cry when I have to give up my one skort that I bought in Philly PA in 2005 at an USPCA convention. I have taken it in more than once as I now weigh close to 25 lbs less.I found socks that fit with a rebate so I am set for winter mostly... I think I'm set but I haven't put all the warm weather stuff away and put the cold weather stuff out completely. Hubby thinks jeans is all he needs and only a few pairs for wearing for good. He has to try on his dress pants also.Electric bill dropped 20 % since I went to doing the canning outside and not heating up the house or using the electric stove as much as I do use the pressure canner on the kitchen stove.We checked our board games and puzzles for something to do this winter when Hubby first retires. He would like a few new board games and puzzles so I will be checking the yards sales in 2 wks. I have made a yard sale list...I am hoping to find winter curtains (need 8 sets) along with bookshelves  and maybe ...a desk. Son is going to check the Goodwill he bought his desk at to see if they have anything. Manual can opener, my spare is getting in bad shape.I called the wellness center to see how it was going about starting my rehab there ... The lady doing it finally got the release she needed and is working out a program for me. I had glenoid labrum tear with SLAP lesion along with bone spurs, bursitis and tendonitis along with the bicep tendon having a hole in it. I am still struggling to put my arm/hand behind me.Our son got us a hall for Tday dinner to get it out of everyone's house.At first he hated the thought when I asked him to rent it and I was paying for it until he saw the costs of us transporting everything including the gas and renting tables etc and realized we would be saving over half the costs we have spent.PLUS I made it clear it was a potluck meal this yr. so it's not us providing all the food.Can't really remember much else that I haven't posted on Thursday...Blessed be"},
{"title": "Frugal bomb...", "date": "Thursday, September 14, 2017", "text": "It's only Thursday and I am going to start this because I know I won't remember much by Sunday when I usually write due to a family reunion that is 3 hrs away one way on Sunday and I will have to drive as Hubby works Sunday night.Daddy gave me 800 jars, about 100 of them is old glass mayo jars that I won't can in but will put dry goods in so I can free up my canning jars. I'm down to about 50 jars to can with.My new dehydrator, about half the size of my Excalibur in 2015 , this new one that I got on sale...well I got what I paid for. It either over dries the bottom and everything on top molds, OR I am rotating trays ever hr and the food falls off and it still won't dry what ever is in the middle . I decided to send it to the craft room and maybe when I get around to making something like ornaments it will work well there. So we ordered another one just like I have and it has replacement parts so if something goes wrong I can buy the parts, or strip it off the other one.My old pressure canner needs new seal and gauge...so it's now a water bath on the stove, but the new one is doing okay still.Meantime 2 of the 3 turkey fries that I was using for the water bath (aka Cold packer) ...are out of commission. One died completely and the other is struggling to heat up correctly. Hubby is going to replace 1 as we need 2 for when we deep fry turkeys for the ham radio group at Christmas and see if he can take the bad two and make one working one. Figures when I am starting back up on tomatoes.I've dump hot coffee all over the kitchen floor and was thankful I hadn't put the sugar or milk in it. Tripped over a metal trunk that has been sitting at the end of my bed since 1985. Nice bruise on the shin now , along with catching myself with the arm that had surgery so I wouldn't bash my cheekbone on the corner and have to have that repaired again. Then took Rascal out to play 10 (ball) and hit the ceiling of the porch with the ball and beaned myself in the head....all of that was from 5:15 to 6.A,M.Next day I went out with Rascal and went to kick the ball off the stoop for him...bent all 5 toes to my shin by kicking the stoop instead and falling because of it, it's not as smooth as the porch as my shoes slide very well when I kick the ball off the front porch.Today I ran the knife through the tip of my thumb working on bell peppers.(50 lbs plus now roasted and skinned). I've yet to figure how I did that but I can tell you that bell pepper juice BURNS on open cuts.Good thing Hubby is an EMT because we saved a small fortune on me getting medical care this week from HIM instead of the Doctor's office or ER.Went an hour away to pick up 400 lbs of potatoes. Got 100 lbs of what they call 2nds..green spots, nicks , weird shapes LOL (18¢/ lb) I will sort through these tomorrow and the nicked ones will be used to make mashed potato granules. The rest will be split with family that only wanted 5-10 lbs. I have 2 daughters that wanted 100 lbs each for storage along with my in laws wanting to split a 50 lb bag between their family  (24¢/lb) I got 50lbs of \"chef\" potatoes...more like what we would buy for baking potatoes (30¢/lb)...so I walked out with 400 lbs of potatoes that averaged at a bit over 23¢ a lbs. FRESH POTATOES that have been cured by people I know as our kids grew up together and Hubby played baseball on the church baseball league with the Dads. I did get a couple more shelving units clean, straightened and  inventoried.This is pretty full, there is one spot that it looks full but isn't and that is where the Miracle Whip is...Hubby won't eat mayo . That's the last jar from last year. Need that refilled.This is chips of different flavors, marshmallows of different sizes, choc condense milk, caramel condense milk, condense milk, evaporated milk, coconut cream, coconut milk, instant milk, powdered white sauce and powdered sour cream.It also holds the majority of the appliances that we use for our family meals that are of about 50 plus people.and last but not least...the last of the canned butter. I will use this for our \"eating\" butter, the dried powder butter will be for baking and the stick butter will be for cooking, mostly for pancakes or French toast. That should get us through until the cash flow starts back up.Prayers for everyone to stay safe. Including MYSELF LOLBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Where is the Energizer Bunny when I need him???", "date": "Sunday, September 10, 2017", "text": "Because my batteries are definitely running low.I forget what I have canned this week but I know today I did 24 -1/2pints of butter, 5 pints of pickles, 6 pints of peperonata, dehydrated 3 dozen eggs, 4 bunches of celery,20 lbs of roasted tomatoes for olive oil and fire roasted bell peppers to put in freezer for Brandy's Red bell pepper soup (www.theprudenthomemaker.com) I also cooked some orange tomatoes to strain and cook done for sauce tomorrow.  I put some onions that were cured in the hose to hang in the basement and picked some of the coriander off the dead cilantro.Dishes are stacked, dinner is over due to Hubby bringing Wendy's home after he worked 36 hrs straight himself ( at the plant, then security at 5 k and the Ham Radio operator at park )I did start working on my monthly goals. Straightening the pantry is one of them. I got this shelving unit dealt with and took a picture. Side benefit was I realized I only had one shelf of applesauce (we use 2 each year). And there is next to none of cherries or apricots.Since this seemed to be a good way of looking at what is missing or what I have to much of  I did this shelving unit.This one looks good, or at least will until Thanksgiving and Christmas then half of it will be gone.To the left is another shelving unit ...it has bare spots that need filled in. ONLY 8 more shelving units to clean and straighten.I went through Hubby's clothes. He does NOT need socks LOL... I forgot I ordered him a case as he takes a unusual size.  The rest he pretty much needs. He found hiking boots half price so I talked him into buying 2 since finding something he can wear with his ankles is hard. I found tee shirts with pockets in different colors on sale as he likes different colors but has worn black,dark gray or dark blue for work. Figured since I could afford them with this sale I would get him a nice variety of COLORS since he is retiring.I went through my clothes, or part of my clothes and I NEED socks LOL. I wear a girls size but have a hard time finding them heavy enough for winter. My feet get cold but sweat easy. I am thinking about trying to crochet a pair for myself and see how that works , I can always wear them in bed if it doesn't. I need pj bottoms, I have flannel and I have a pattern I don't have the time right now as the garden is overflowing.I caught a sale at King Arthur's flour and still had a discount coupon so I ordered all that I could and keep the shipping at the same price.I've scored my Swagbucks goal twice this week...probably because I've been up at 3 am canning.Did 2 Pinecone  surveysI turned the furnace on twice for about an hour to take the chill (62°) off. I've been opening the bathroom curtain and the kitchen door to the mudroom to let the East sun come in and warm the house.Once it starts getting cold I won't open the kitchen door to mudroom as we don't heat that area.I did the usual of opening curtains in the morning and shutting them at night, turning lights off, turning computer and printer off. Turning my coffee maker off at power strip so even the clock on it doesn't run.Turned ceiling fan off in bedroom.Got rid of dehumidifier as it was only working as a fan now. Landlord will replace next year. Got stuff on sale with rebate also to set up humidifier when we start the furnace full time.Use short cycle, tap cold with laundry with homemade laundry soap. Used the drying rack for light weights since I still can't hang clothes out on line...arm is cranky...better but cranky.Added water to dish soap, shower soap and used the \"rinsed\" out shower soap to refill sink soap. Just have to shake it before using.Continue to use turkey fryer bases for cold packers while doing water bath canning which in turns actually lets me get 3 times more done and doesn't run up the electric bill.We are \"interviewing\" different financial advisors about investing Hubby's retirement money.... I had one tell me I didn't know a thing about investing and staying calm for the long haul  etc...Hubby actually started laughing out loud. Needless to say, we thanked him for his time and started to leave when his boss stopped me and asked what I would invest in and I rattled it off with the reasons why.. Told me to remember I did know about investing and asked to see the one that was so sure I didn't know anything in his office.We see another one tomorrow that a friend's parents (who did investing on their own most the time) used while they were alive.Guess all those years of reading the Morningstar for Dad has paid off, just not what I really want to do but frugal wise I'm not willing to pay someone 1 %... example..if we take 4% to live on, and we pay the broker 1%...that's 25 % of our income NOT INCLUDING the cost of the stock/bonds etc that we would be buying.... I'll do our own financing for that price. BUT man do I hate reading the Morningstar. To those that don't know  the Morningstar evaluates funds (stocks, bonds etc) for up to three time periods: three, five and 10 years. It's like watching the Dow Jones which I didn't like doing either.Meantime back on the home front , the garden is running over me and I can't even give the produce away as everyone else's gardens are running over them.To those that are dealing with Mother Nature at her worse....I'm praying for youAND thankful I'm not dealing with her.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Preparing for winter", "date": "Monday, September 4, 2017", "text": "This is a woolly worm aka woolly bear worm. He/she was at my door yesterday.Their job here is to predict the coming winter. HA HA Blonde or light brown means light and warm winter, if they are just brown means normal winter, striped colors means a winter that will change, example black then brown then black means hard winter, normal winter, then hard winter...you will notice this one is BLACK...I really hope he/she is WRONG because the last time they were black we had the a lot of snow and the year after that we had the winter vortex.I would rather have the snow, not ice or wind, just snow. Just saying, not asking for it.Our local weather forecaster is waiting to see what type and when Canada gets snow but did say it could be a crazy winter.Better to prepare more than usual since we also will be retired and a lower income means tighter budget, which in turns means the electric bill needs to stay down and we don't need to be having to order more propane with a service charge of $100 if we don't fill the tank. I already ordered and paid for this winter's fuel of 700 gals. That is a huge check mark for done.SO Hubby and I agreed...grill propane tanks need to be filled after SCARES Christmas dinner (we deep fry turkeys for it). That's the first part of Dec and when Hubby is retiring. Those tanks not only run our grill but run the MR Buddy propane heaters we use in the house when it's extremely cold and provide another way to cook when the electric is out.Draft old farmhouses out in the boonies with no wind block gets COLD.I have plastic to put over upstairs windows including the trim as wind leaks there also. In late November I put Christmas decorations that are heavy plastic  like this  WOWindow Posters Santa Claus Jolly Christmas Window Decoration 34.5\"x60\" Backlit Poster No I don't get money for this. but I have 3( Christmas tree and snowman also) of them and I put them on the worse 3 windows upstairs....it helps. I do set a reminder on my cell phone to go up and turn the overhead light on at dusk and back off before bed as that is how these are lit up (lamps work but I have 3 in one room so overhead is cheaper to do with LED light). All windows will be checked to see if they need caulked. Landlord checked outside when he power washed the siding this summer. I will put up the heaviest curtains we have (I lined them with BLANKETS) on the worst windows. I have a set of insulated drapes (came with this house) that will go in the north upstairs bedroom. That leaves 4 rooms that need heavier curtains due to the loss of ones I had . I have sheers to put under the curtains.I will tape the windows ...sigh, yes I use tape and tape the windows shut. The windows are that bad.I will make sure we have the winter bedding aired, washed and ready.I might need blankets sooner as the nights are down in the 50's now. Winter clothes also...Hubby needs clothes as he has lost weight so I know his winter clothes isn't going to fit. I should be okay except for some flannel pjs bottoms, I have flannel fabric ,might need elastic with a slight shove to get the craft room cleaned back up so I can sort out my sewing supplies.I need to clean out the garage...basically move garden table and stuff and swing so we can put a car in the garage during the winter.Hubby moved generator out of garage to outside electric box so if we lose power it's just flip the switch and plug generator in and kick it on. He built a \"lean to \" to cover it so it's vented but protected.Another big check mark in the done area.All 3 freezers are full, both refrigerator freezers are full...well might not be if I took the 50 million ice packs out of them but full enough that we need to do some eating to get turkey and ham in there. I have empty spots in the butler's pantry of dry goods. That's now on the stock listWe ordered dehydrated foods from Rainy Day Foods suggested by Brandy at theprudenthomemaker.com I have empty spots in the pantry in the basement.This unit needs applesauce..I use 2 shelved worth what ever I can will have to be put somewhere else until I get some some room. I need cherries (next to cranberries that is next to store bought fruit) and apricots (lonely can on bottom shelf). Bread flours are to the left, all purpose to the right.Tomato juice and pasta sauce are big holes but after walking the gardens today it's more of me having the energy to get the canning done before we lose the produce without messing up my shoulder.I should be able to fill it before Dec.Make sure we have extra staples to cover what I use during Thanksgiving and Christmas baking might be a tight one since I usually restock that in Dec during the Christmas sales and won't this year as we won't have any income.The loss of the winter curtains is going to be the hardest as I have to make those because otherwise they are $100 per window due to the size of windows. I will have to look for cheap blankets if I don't find they at the yard sales the end of this month or thrift shops to line the fabric I have.Blessed BeI reread Brandy's (theprudenthomemaker.com)frugal posts along with all the comments on a daily bases, there always seem to be another suggestion or thought I can use.I reread Brandy's (theprudenthomemaker.com) post of eating from the pantry and checked her pantry menu to my pantry. I found a couple holes that will be filled as I didn't realize I was out of bouillon.I finished Rehab at the hospital for my shoulder and can now work out at the wellness center where Hubby works. So instead of 2 trips at a 40 mile round trip each time at a total of 3 hrs away from home and cost of gas at $20.40 (current gas is $2.55). I will now do 3 trips to the wellness center which is a 10 mile round trip each time for a total of 3 hrs away from home (because I will take advantage of whirlpool which will equal in time of driving) and $7.65 at current gas price.I use Hubby's bungee cords for my exercise bands instead of buying exercise bands here at home.I washed foil, cold cereal inserts, and freezer bags for reuse.I open curtains for sunshine, close at dark. Use lights only when necessary. Changed when I read so I am not using light just to read. I changed the bedside lamp to a smaller lamp with LED so if I do read after going to bed it's using a lamp that is cheaper to use, plus gave me a bit more room on the night stand.We don't get enough sunshine in the winter to use solar lamps.I kept my grease from meats and onion \"juice/oils\" from cooking onions.I tried to extend each main dish to feed us 2 -3 times, one to stretch our food but also to cut down on my time cooking meals when I am processing food for storage.I canned (water bath aka cold packer)outside to cut down on electric costs as I am running 2 dehydrators and cut down on the heat in the house...which now I wouldn't mind some heat in the house as it's in the mid 60s in the mornings without the furnace. I ran the furnace 1 day on 62, kicked on 1 time, ran 30 min and didn't run again so OFF it went BUT at least we know our furnace is in working order unlike last year when it wasn't.I will be also using the pressure canner this week.I continue to shop sales, coupons, rebates etc to stock up the pantry and non foods.I rewrote the stock up list in a priority first with it listed per stores that I know I will be getting it BECAUSE  Hubby's company is changing next year's retirement package...so he is coming out in Dec. That is the month I spend $$$ for restocking the staples that I used to make Thanksgiving and Christmas so that stock up is being done prior to the holidays. IF I have money I will get choc etc that goes on sale at Christmas.I harvested tomatoes, eggplant, rosemary, thyme, oregano, basil and bell peppers.I put the potted plants out in the yard around the annual flower bed so if it does rain as forecasted they will get watered, also looks good if it doesn't and I don't get out to move them back to the porch. Blessed BeI would love to say that these boards that are on the side of my frig that is at the door of the butler's pantry, are cleared because we don't need anything ...but actually they are cleared because the amount was more than the boards could hold.Right top is items needed for household..softener salt, filters, auto items etc.Right bottom is for canning items, freezing items and whatever is needed for holidays upcoming .Left top is weekly needs of food (which we plan to go to biweekly when we go to chiro)Left bottom is monthly needs of non-food.Fall months are my prime stock up for items I don't grow or can't buy at the Amish produce auction.Even more now with Hubby retiring out beginning of Dec rather than Jan. so it will be 3-4 months before he gets seasonal work instead of 2-3.I am blessed with the over flow of food to produce.This week's to buy...Hummingbird food, I think we are starting to get  \"visitors'\" as they travel to their winter homes. Milk,lettuce, ice cream (maybe) eggs and butter (price depending) Aldi's has ground beef and strawberry jam on sale so I will check on those.Part of Fall stock upFirst we went to Brandy's website theprudenthomemaker.com and checked what she had listed as her pantry menu and then compared it to what we have...there was a couple \"holes\" that are now on the stock list and we feel good at what we are facing.Usually in Dec I refill the pantry with staples used at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Since Hubby is retiring first of Dec there won't be any pay coming in for 6-10 wks. He told me to stock extra for the holidays NOW.Eggs if right price as I need 24 dozen between noodles and cookies in Nov. I am trying to have that much dehydrated and then another 24 dozen dehydrated for us. I have 18 dozen dehydrated and powdered.Butter is running $3.78/lb right now, I will check Aldi's tomorrow. We ordered powdered butter from Rainy day Foods. We have never used powdered butter so will be doing a test run on how it does with cookies. I've already been told to lower the amount of water I use to make it.Mushrooms if on sale, with coupons etc to dehydrate. I have enough canned...well not really I will never have enough canned or enough mushrooms. :/Winter squash :3 Acorn,3 Butternut,3 spaghetti squash and if they have Delectia  3 of them. Hurley farms market is the best price. This will be Sept 22nd.on way past from Amish produce auctionPumpkins, we have 4 for dehydrating and decoration, we will buy 30 for the kids,grandkids and great grandson for Halloween. We might also buy pie pumpkins to make pies from for Thanksgiving. Plus crate of Jack be littles or Wee be littles (usually used for decorations but edible and we roast them for side dish) if the price is good. Last year we got them for 1¢ each . These are bought at Amish produce AuctionPotatoes from Michael produce farm( I would have to drive to) if the price is less than 20 ¢ / lb other wise I will order them for Save a lot that has them running for 28 ¢/lb that is right here in 50 lbs bags The savings in gas will be enough to just order them.Sweet potatoes, I do have some planted in straw bales in garden...not sure how they are making. I bought 20 lbs at Amish auction last week...I would like to have another 20-30 lbs.BUT if my crop hasn't done any and I don't get them at Auction or produce farm we will make do.Apples, our friends neighbor said he thought he would have extra. If he does we might get enough to finish filling out the applesauce and dried apples needed. Otherwise I can go over to the Greenthumb market and get them there for cheaper since we no longer have a pick your own orchard near and it that's too much I might just go without.Ginger...if it comes on sale at the stores I will get fresh to dry for powder and teas and a tube for fresh. ( I have garlic to dry and onions to dry). Whole cloves (Amish Country store before Amish produce auction )Vanilla bean (I make my own vanilla extract and sugar) Vanilla bean paste.Dried blueberries, mixed berries,cranberries, raisins, figs and prunes as they come on sale (check Amish Country store) King Arthur Flour fruit cake blend when on sale. Hubby's favorite and the kids/grandkids love it in oatmeal cookie bars at Christmas.Dried veggie soup as this is the only thing Hubby likes as a dip.Nuts:pecans. walnuts, peanuts, cashews,almonds,pinenuts and sunflower seedsPeanut butter. I make over 100 dozen buckeyes at Christmas.. I don't use butter..just pb and xxx sugar and then Freeze then dip in choc.(Check Amish Country store)Candy M&Ms and Reese's pieces... we use this for cookies,trail mix and on top of ice cream/frozen yogurt. Assorted choc chips on sale because I will wipe out my supply when I make cookies and fudge for the family. Generic is ok.Staples: flour in Nov as I will already have the bulk of the Cookies and homemade noodles made and vacuum packed. Wheat germ for granola bars and yogurt, Wondra flour, Bisquick (Hubby insists) semolina flour(Amish Country store) chicken and beef bouillon, regular sugar,xxx sugar, brown sugar lt and dark, honey. This is going to be MORE than usual as Hubby said to \"overstock\" to make up for not stocking in Dec. I have already saved this money and put it aside.condense milk and evaporated milkLard/Butter crisco/ oil (turkey deep fryer)This is just part of the list but what I am focusing on getting in the pantry this month.In the gardens...I have tomatoes to make pasta sauce, juice, steak sauce, and if still have enough BBQ sauce. The last 2 yrs I have ran out of pasta sauce.... I just walked the gardens and I should have plenty if I can get them out before they rot. I have some I will over roast.I have onions to hang in nylon hose (about the only time I buy panty hose) that I will dry for the damaged ones or the ones starting to go bad for dried onions and powder for onion powder.I have garlic I can dry and change to garlic powderI have a bell peppers I can roast and then dry or can. Dried can be mixed with dried cayenne to make crushed red peppers ( I use any color not just red).I have a few cucumbers left. Hubby asked for more refrigerator pickles since I now have enough bread and butter. I thought about small dill as we use mini dills to make dried beef cream cheese rolls for Thanksgiving. Since I have 3 quarts of refrigerator pickles sitting in the frig so the mini dills win out.Menards is having their 11 % rebate still, so I will pick up more cases of distilled water for humidifier, humidifier treatment additive, washing soda, fly traps(usually marked down by now) ant traps(usually marked down by now) and paper plates...sigh, a battle I am not going to win but at least he is down to using it for his snacks and reuses it if it's just crumbs on the plate AND will put the crumbs in the trash instead of shoving plate and crumbs in to the microwave.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Can I do any more at one time?", "date": "Sunday, August 27, 2017", "text": "Yes I have 3 cold packers aka water bath canners with food being processed at the same time, I also had the pressure canner in the house going along with 2 other burners with food being cooked to be canned AND it's been like that for the last 2 days. I could easily see a couple more of those days this week depending on the rain that is forecasted to come in Monday around noon.I met my swag bucks goal one time this week. The other's I just did what I could, I figured 3 pts a day is more than what I was doing.I usually catch a couple surveys but since I don't have a DVR I'm getting bumped out.We have an antenna only.We saved gas with Kroger points, Speedway, Wagner IGA points and Gasbuddy. Hubby has been riding the motorcycle to work. Have used almost 15 gal. of gas in the lawnmowers this week. Had to move twice and haven't had the issue alls summer.We shopped Menards for sales and household items to score on the 11 %  rebate and got additional rebate from Whink rust remover.I washed the insert to the cold cereal that Hubby used to make a trail like mix to carry when he is working SCARES ( group of radio operators that would with Homeland security)I got the stain out of Hubby's dress shirt FINALLY after 4 different washings and different soaps.I did laundry with cold tap water and homemade laundry soap. Still can't use clothes line due to surgery.Used my stain remover that came with my home dry cleaning kit.No AC or furnace...open windows , let sun shine in. close up before it cools off. Wear shawl in mornings and evenings.I harvest cherry,Roma and regular tomatoes, green onions, green tomatoes, eggplant, bell peppers,2 thumb size cucumbers, a single green bean (thank you to the birds that ate the blooms) and surprise oregano and rosemary that the Bunny family didn't eat.I battered and slightly deep fried eggplant and green tomatoes for the freezer . I will either bake or finish deep frying them when I serve them.I froze sausage grease and beef grease and 1 pint of blackberries this week.I canned 14 qrts beef vegetable soup, 16 pts of zesty chili, 21 pts mild chili,10 qrts. blackberry pie filling,14 pts blackberries, 14 pts bread and butter pickles,8 pts peperonata, and 8 -1/2 pts of caponata.I dehydrated 6 dozen eggs, 2 lbs of carrots, 1 bunch of celery, 9 pints of blackberries, and Roma tomatoes sliced and sprinkled with seasoned salt.I've used whatever I was canning that day to make something for dinnerOh yeah, we went to the produce auction. I now have mums that the people parked next to us ran out of room in their SUV and couldn't find anyone to buy them from them so I bought them for $2 each which is what they spent. The big mums Hubby bought for me for $4 each. Also go pumpkins $3.50 each for the large ones and  less for the others, storage onions (half go to a friend that will pay us back when they get home from vacation)colored bell peppers , roma tom, yellow roma tom, yellow tom, sweet potatoes, beets (for Hubby's mom) 50 lbs of red onions (behind pumpkins), apples, pickles, maple syrup , blackberries  etc ... I priced against what we would have spent if we had bought from store... we saved $640. We picked up some peaches at the produce farm down the road from the auction. I just wanted some to eat this week.Hubby asked where Brandy (The Prudent Homemaker) got dried cheese sauce from. I went to her Bulk food and grains page, clicked on the Walton food link that cheese was listed under and it took me to Rainy Day Foods website which is Walton's food subsidiary and it was a good thing stuff was on sale because we definitely placed a big order. Still it was under budget for our stocking up AND the sale actually covered more than the shipping costs. Hubby figured out if we didn't go to the store every week to get dairy products we would have the money back in gas with in 3 mos.We ordered dehydrated sour cream, something I use regularly but Hubby doesn't like so it sometimes goes bad before I get a large container used up but the small one doesn't last long enough. Hash browns, diced potatoes and sliced potatoes means we won't have potatoes going bad in the root cellar or have to eat them ASAP. Never had that problem when the kids were home. Butter powder for making cookies at the holiday so I only have to stock for our usage which is 1 stick a week unless Hubby makes pancakes, then he greases the skillet with butter. Clear jel that I just used the last of it with the blackberry pie filling. Golden raisins that I struggle to find around here, and mango that Hubby requested. Dried sweet Garden peas and dried carrots so I am not taking up freezer room with them and we only need like 1 cup of at a meal and that leaves an open bag in the freezer that half the time get's knocked back open and dumped in the freezer.Instant milk, that should stop the extra trip for milk especially during the winter. Hubby can get it at the local store on his way home IF he heads home 2 hrs after he gets off work, If he doesn't work out at the wellness center then it is go without or make a trip back to the store using a gal of gas.Shortening powder.. sugar cookies call for this and I get it as I have a granddaughter that only eats sugar cookies and I bake everyone else's favorites at Christmas but because I don't use shortening for my cooking, I end up throwing part of it away. I hope this works for us. Teriyaki sauce mix...my fix...HA HA... I crave this about once a week, okay daily but I limit the salt intake by not eating it daily AND FINALLY the cheese sauce that started this to begin with.The dryer just buzzed and I am tired, still working on rebuilding my strength with my arm and it wearing on me.Tomorrow is another day.... and for one last thought. I bought this painting and showed it to Hubby and told him it was the house I wanted...with a walkout basement and 1-3 acres of land because I want fruit trees, berry bushes and maybe a cow or couple pigs so we needed a barn and grazing area.He thought it was a great looking home."},
{"title": "Frugal update 8.20.17", "date": "Sunday, August 20, 2017", "text": "Hubby really doesn't know if he meant to take a picture of his shadow or if he meant to take a picture of the hose...I think he meant to check his phone for the time because he just turned on the water for the garden and we switch the controls in an hour to water the other gardens... Frugal to time water and frugal to take thousands of pictures and be able to see them without spending a fortune getting the film developed because he constantly takes pictures of the floor , his feet whatever when he checks the time on his phone.We had enough rain we didn't have to water as much as normal. We don't pay for water (in country have water well and septic tank, leach bed) but we do pay the electric to run the water pump (yep no electric means no water for anything). I moved the flowers off the porch to get the rain also.Windows and doors open every morning, I close them up if going to be very humid or hot with no breeze unless I was running in and out from the gardens due to canning. Curtains are clipped close with binder clips to keep some of the sun out. I see no point of closing them completely and then turning on the lights to work since the house doesn't get that hot with the curtains clipped.AC off at night after the sun sets and I turn on a fan but don't open the windows if it's not going to cool down or humidity is high.Lights are off as long as the sun is shining. If I need a light for something it's a light that shines only where I need it.Harvested oregano (\"Italian\" bunny had a litter and they all like oregano, basil and rosemary but hopped right by the lettuce) and rosemary to dehydrate for the first time this season and probably the last because now her litter is coming with  her and they aren't afraid of my dog who bumps them with his nose to get them to hop..right under him.  A bird was picking on one and he chased the bird off and then brought the bunny into Hubby who carried it back out and put it in the bean field where Mommy bunny goes in and out while I sidetracked Rascal. An hour later Baby Bunny laying curled up with Rascal. I do not need a pet bunny. I don't think Mommy bunny is happy about it either as she was at the edge of the field hopping in and out.I harvested eggplant, onions, tomatoes, bell peppers,2 small cucumbers and yard long red beans. I gave the beans and eggplant (she has bell peppers and tomatoes)to my daughter who is off work without pay due to having mono.She didn't have time off to cover being off sick so she lost the job. She has an interview on Wed so hopefully she is well enough to hold on to it as the doctor told her she could go back to work. She wants a full time job NOT through a temp service but most companies in her area hire only through a temp service.I mended 3 shirts and a pair of shorts. Hubby darned two pairs of work socks.I am out of the sling so I am back to doing most the cooking. Hubby lifts anything heavy and washes whatever I can't pick up yet.We gave the boxed food we bought that he was going to fix to our daughter to help her through this time. She has helped us more than once.After rehab on Friday I went shopping to try to finish the stocking up.I used my CVS extra bucks to pay for the Xlear spray along with a $2 coupon. I had enough left over to pick up the last of the calcium tablets I needed for stocking.OOP $3I used my Reward points at Walgreens to pay for the Gold bond products that I had coupons for also. OOP $ 7.27.I went to Walmart and got the different beans that was cheapest there along with some clearance items they had I needed also.I went to Krogers, got buy one get one of pork tenderloin, beef roast, and chicken breast. Their frozen chicken breast was on sale for $2 less than normal and I had a $2 coupon. Bacon was on sale, I had one free coupons and 5 other coupons. Pasta was on sale, between the sale and my coupons I walked out with 4 free pounds of the 10 lbs I bought. I also got toilet paper, on sale and with $2 coupon for 2 -6 rolls...I got 2 packages of cheese for free. I saved over $100 and it took 30 min to check me out with the coupons I had.I went to IGA and got the buy one get one sale of hamburger and sausage. They also had carrots and celery for half the price of everywhere else so I got 2 bunches of celery and 4 lbs of carrots. I will dehydrate half of it.The sausage is going into zesty chili to be canned. The majority of the hamburger will go into mild chili (using our tomatoes and onions) to be canned. IF there is enough left I will make some salisbury steak for the freezer. I did take some to make a bacon \"sushi\" roll with hamburger and cheese(free cheese) in it...google BBQ bacon sushi for different recipes. I weaved the bacon slices (the free bacon)and precooked in the oven until done enough to hold shape before adding the hamburger but not so done it was crunchy. I hate slimy bacon.I canned pasta sauce and tomato juice and put onions to cure. I planted some onions...again.I need to finish putting everything away and update stock up list.We continue to research the best way to invest the retirement and how to deal with the funds we will be given for medical. Along with new(to us) vehicles.We used Speedway points, Kroger points and gas buddy for gas.We went to see my Daddy and took him to Bob Evans(he is housebound) to lunch. We used a gift card and Daddy paid the balance and the tip. We all saved. We listened to him talk about choices he made when he retired and had to use his assets for 3 yrs for daily living. Hubby's parents did it for four years including buying a house (they rented like we do) and 2 vehicles. Daddy also told me when I caramelize onions to save the juice/oil from them to cook potatoes in or add to soups.He knows I keep pretty much all my meat fats and freeze them.We went to a friends' home for last of the summer cookout. I made a bacon sushi roll (free bacon, free cheese and cheap hamburger) low carb bread(friend diabetic and doesn't eat grain, on sale cottage cheese and on sale eggs) and part of a pineapple side down cake... I made it for Daddy but divided the cake into 3 round cake pans, cake mix was free and the pineapple was marked down to 59¢) I took a bag of blue tortilla chips (that had been free from Krogers) also. After we started talking about it we figured out NO ONE paid full price for anything that was there.I bought a new pressure canner that was on sale for cheaper for the parts I need to replace on my old canner. I still kept the old canner, it can be used as water bath until I find the parts at a better price.I followed WHIO tv instructions to make a way for me to \"watch\" the eclipse without buying glasses. I remember my cousin making one with the paper and foil also, and then nailing me when I turned to look over my shoulder instead of at the paper. I do have a blind spot in my eye but lucky for me it's not right in the middle to mess my vision up as bad as it could have if she hadn't stepped behind me and shoved my head back to not see it. Years later when the spot showed up Mother told me she felt like turning me across her knee again because of me disobeying my cousin...who by that time was deceased.I sorted through my seeds for what I can plant for fall and what I need for spring to check with sales. It doesn't look like I need anything. A coworker of Hubby's gave us seedlings of field tomatoes...they are like Roma but thicker skinned because they are harvested by machine. He told us to get a hold of him in the spring and he will give us more if he gets any. He was given them due to a farmer running out of space to place them. He didn't know if they were heirloom or hybrid so I might try to keep some seeds and see if they grow for me next year.A person at the cookout offered to share his apples with us when they are ready next month. Especially if we are willing to climb the ladder to get them as he doesn't like doing that due to bad knees. Our friend who is the guy's neighbor doesn't like to climb ladders either.I made caponata from the eggplant and tomatoes from the gardensI cooked chicken to make chicken salad.I have the 2 beef roasts in the oven to slowly roast overnight to make beef veggie soup and beef and broth for noodles. I will can the broth and the veggie soup. Other canning this week will be zesty chili, mild chili, tomato juice and pasta sauce. Caponata if there is any left.Can't think of anything else off the top of my head.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Why I am the way I am.", "date": "Sunday, August 13, 2017", "text": "Four hundred and one variety...that is different/variety things not number of things.In my pantry when fully stocked there is 20,852 items...not counting what is in the freezers.With 80% being what I grow or buy at the cheapest price and process myself to keep it frugal.Why? because I have went hungry as a child. I went hungry as an adult but I made sure my kids didn't and in 2007 I watched my Hubby worry there wouldn't be food on the table when he went to 3 days a week (company didn't lay off full time workers and kept them at 3 day which is equal to unemployment but gave them health ins that wouldn't be available if they had laid them off. Temporary workers were let go. We lost both the house we lived in and the one our one daughter lived in. Now we are looking at retirement, with health insurance going through the roof and not sure what income we will have after he retires and we pay for the insurance.He has been offered part time, seasonal work with a couple companies owned by our landlord's families. Landord has made it very clear he would work with us just to keep us here, would prefer for us to live here another 10 yrs or more.My parents grew up during the Great Depression. Hubby's parents weren't born yet, his dad grew up on farm(cattle/pig and grain) and his mom's dad worked for the electric company. Hubby grew up farming and all grocery money and bill money was on the farm loan so it was more of will the crops pay of the loan and if not what's the interest to roll over to the next yr's loan.His mom did some gardening but enough to go year to year. Daddy didn't know it was the Great Depression as he grew up in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Everyone was poor and ate pretty the same thing. Milk (evaporated milk) gravy and bread or oatmeal for breakfast and bean soup and bread for lunch and supper. Spring brought sassafras tea and wild greens, summer brought fish and the gardens. If there was enough money after buying his mother's medication they got shells to hunt with. Mother on the other hand, understood the difference. Her dad worked in lumber yard and rail road... and was without a job for 2 yrs. He refused to work the program that was offered and his family paid the price for his pride in the way of not having food or clothings at times. Mother finally got a job at the age of 10 working for a \"junk man\" cleaning up things for him. She made 5¢ a day that was spent on beans to feed her parents and siblings. There was never enough grown in the gardens with how big the family was to put any up for winter.Daddy did know how to dry food on a tin roof covered to keep the animals off the food but there wasn't enough food to do it often. Mother was clueless.As a child my parents had decided my older brother would not only graduate from high school(first of both their families) but go to college the day he was born. Good thing he wanted to go because both him and I know he would have went even if he didn't want to. Both did whatever work they could often working 2-3 jobs to make ends meet, money went to pay off the mortgage and put money aside for his college education. Dad grew a good size garden and started hunting. One neighbor taught Mother how to can corn, tomatoes and green beans. Another neighbor showed her how to make and can grape juice as we had a very small harbor of concord grapes. By this time Grandpa(Daddy's side as Mother's dad had died when they first bought the house) was raising chickens and potatoes along with a huge garden for himself and his daughter that remained as his care taker.Grandma died when Dad was 16) So we would get eggs once a month when we went to visit, sometimes a chicken that wasn't laying and old and in season we would get 100 lbs of potatoes when Daddy went to help dig potatoes with Grandpa. Grandpa had an acre planted of potatoes and that was how he made his money to pay his bills.I would pick up cans and pop bottles for Daddy to take into recycle to get money to go towards my brother's college fund. Many times food was on the slim side when the garden didn't produce or Dad didn't get anything when he went hunting or fishing. If soup was on the table I knew not to ask for more than what I was given which usually was a 8 oz cup.Most times it was a water based soup.As an adult when my late husband died I went through a time, almost a year where I wasn't sure what I was going to put on the table. He didn't have medical insurance (heart attack, ambulance run, ER, doctors, tests) and no life insurance  (funeral home, casket,open and closing of grave to be paid up front etc) and I had just left my part time job because it was costing us more for me to work with the kids in childcare than me to stay home. No income, didn't qualify for any assistance as it was based on what I WOULD get from SS survivor benefits that took 3 mos to get. Then I had to pay back the ones that lent me money to keep the home and bills paid. I made it Went from 130 to 75 lbs), kids never went hungry, though saw me count pennies many times for their lunch money (no help there and didn't qualify for health ins either) I sold everything I could that wouldn't affect my kids..The elderly neighbor gave me tomato plants to grow on my deck (lived in the city), my lawyer's secretary gave me corn and green beans. My Daddy brought me dried beans,potatoes, eggs and bar soap. Mother brought me ham, flour, sugar, yeast and toilet paper. I didn't have water in the kitchen but did upstairs. House was one step from being condemned when we bought it , he died 6 wks later. I finished bring it up before I remarried.It appraised for $120,000 right before we moved.Ask my kids what meals they loved as a child...beef veggie soup and noodles with homemade bread...both dishes were served when I was scraping the bottom of the barrel for food. I was shocked it wasn't the beef roast that I used the scraps for the soup or the roasted chicken that made the noodles. They still ask me to can veggie soup for them for Christmas, noodles dried and given at Thanksgiving.My answer to those times it to have a large pantry that will feed my family for 2 years. Have variety as I understood my parents for years struggled to eat and enjoy bean soup. And to try to make sure I have a variety to also meet nutritional needs I have with my Crohn's.Right now I could go 19 months with the holes I have in the pantry...the holes are 192 varieties that either are low or gone completely. Those holes are the last 5 mos I want in the pantry by Dec 31st.My goal for the next four months it so have enough cash to pay 6 mos bills ahead of time, enough in the pantry to go 2 yrs and household items(cleaners. softener salt etc) and personal items to go one year and OTC meds to go 6 months and all prescriptions filled as of Dec 31st.AND pray the car holds together until AFTER Hubby retires because he qualifies for $5000 reimbursement if he buys a car through the program. We plan to replace Hubby's truck the following year.Hubby is trying to save his vacation to cash out to cover some of the Jan bills, (he will get one paycheck before he retires out)when he retires but I am not counting on that due to he takes vacation when I am in the hospital with Crohn's.Off to make zucchini bread pancakes for supper.Blessed BeTop shelf is 26 pints of enchilada sauce and 26 half pints pizza sauce.Enchiladas one week, pizza or calzones the next.Next shelf down is pasta sauce, red sauce( 32 qrts pasta and 12 pints red sauce)6 store bought alfredo sauce and 4 #10 cans of tomato sauce to change into pasta sauce or go in chili...chili will be first.Third shelf down is diced tomatoes (60 pints) and 6 cans of stewed tomatoes my son gave us and 6 cans of Rotel tomatoes a friend gave us.That bottom shelf was full of tomato juice that is old enough that I decided to convert it to pasta sauce that will be used first of the sauces and using this year's tomatoes to make fresh juice.I have holes in a few places that make me leary of the coming year with Hubby retiring and insurance going through the roof, not sure how much money will be coming in and we have to live below what is coming in ( in the last year I've cut the budget by 50%)...but after inventorying all 401 varieties ( yes that is varieties not items....when fully stocked there is 20,852 items( yes you read that correctly) in the pantry not including freezers) in my pantry (not including 3 deep freezers and 2 refrig freezers) Hubby and I was able to pinpoint where my focus should be to fill in. FRUGALLY of course!!Tomatoes... I need 20 qrts of pasta sauce  and at least 8 qrts of tomato juice. I should be able to get this from the tomatoes in the gardens. IF I get that and still get tomates I will make red sauce. I can bread and slightly deep fry some green tomatoes for the freezer or make green tomato sauce if it turns cold before they ripen.I have NO chili. Hubby eats hot spicy and I eat mild. I can pints of these for quick meals or snacks of nachos.  I need at least 26 pints of each, 52 would be better...depends on the meat prices.The one small store near us does buy 3 lb sausage get 6 lbs free...if I can hit that sale it will be a definite big help.Garlic powder. I grow my own garlic so I can dehydrate some of them and blend to powder.This will be done this fall as the dehydrator is running daily with other things now.Onion powder. If we get bulk onions(25-50 lbs) at the Amish auction I can dehydrate and blend for powder otherwise...not going in the cabinet. My onions I grew this year did better but not enough to carry us through until the next season. We usually get 25 lbs for $5 sometimes in a bad year it might be closer to $15.Applesauce, I have 36 qrts...that means we can have 1 qrt every other week. I would like to have 52 which is 16 more qrts but that depends on the price of apples and if anyone gives us apples.  More would be better as we used to eat it at every meal.but I haven't been able to find apples in my price range.I have 12 half pints of butter canned.I got some butter at $1.99/lb. I'm going to can it(no room in freezers and I grew up with canned butter since we didn't have a frig for a while, neither parent had ice boxes growing up). Last week I saw butter at almost $5/lb. I don't eat margarine due to my health issues. We \"Eat\" 1/4 lbs a week, a half pint is almost 1/4 lb. BUT we use over 10 lbs from Thanksgiving to Christmas so hopefully the prices will be down by then or there are going to be some traditional foods not made or given.Eggs... I got 5 dozen for 75¢ a dozen to dehydrate. We go through 5 dozen a month with me baking and making pasta and eating. I use 15 dozen at Thanksgiving and 15 dozen at Christmas ( 6 kids, 22 grandkids and one great grandkid). I have 12 dozen dehydrated right now. My goal is to have 20 dozen dehydrated by Jan when Hubby retires. Eating fresh eggs might become a treat instead of common meal. Though a fried egg on homemade bread is a pretty cheap meal but I've seen eggs hit over $3/dzn.In the dehydrated cabinet the holes show the most...I need bell peppers (garden) tomatoes (garden) oregano(garden) rosemary(garden) carrots, celery, sweet potatoes, potatoes, mushrooms,ginger and pumpkin. I blend the pumpkin to powder, easier to add to dry mixes or water for pie filling/custard.The root cellar is close to empty. I have a few potatoes and sweet potatoes left in it that will be dehydrated if I find them at reasonable price. I'll be calling the produce farm that grows potatoes at the beginning of Sept for prices along with looking at the Amish auction.We will buy our winter squash from Hurley's produce market. They grow them organically and usually are the lowest price unless we can get them at the Amish auction.Pumpkins will come from the Amish auction. We get a pallet (usually 25-35 pumpkins) to share with the kids. Last year we spent 50¢ per pumpkin and they weighed in at 25-35 lbs each. Depending on prices we will get sugar pumpkins (pie pumpkins) and jack be littles or wee be littles.... usually used for decorations but can be cooked for single servings.I love baking molasses custard in them.I would like to learn how to make orange marmalade, lemon curd and lime curd,possible orange curd LOL, but that's low on the list and might end up being a Christmas present from my kids instead."},
{"title": "First week of Aug", "date": "Sunday, August 6, 2017", "text": "Frugal fail...sending Hubby to store for ice cream... he bought the expensive klondikes yes they are my favorite and yes I was craving chocolate which took half of the $20 budgeted for the month.His answer was they are medicine because I need to calcium and I'm not eating cheese, yogurt or drinking milk and it's chocolate to help with the cravings and it was DARK choc so that helped with the depression....Then on the way to Great Grandson's 1st birthday party that was 2 hrs away..we pit stopped at the gas station to potty and walked out with $21 of food because it was lunch time and I have to take my meds with food and we didn't think about bringing snacks as we knew we would eat at the party but the grandson let me know After we headed that way we wouldn't be eating until closer to 2 ...at least most of it was healthy and we brought half of  it home and I was able to cover it with the eat out fund that we put aside for the month.At least we thought to take water. We didn't eat on the way back l even though it was pass dinner time like we planned and ate mini eggrolls that was in the freezer instead since I had meds to take with food...I wasn't hungry but hey meds need to have food or I get sick.I gave my great grandson his afghan made with yarn that matched his and his parents birthstone. I only had to buy one skein of yard due to his Mom being an Oct baby and I didn't have enough of that color of pink.I think I will start looking for shades of blue to make him one for his 2nd birthday. We took water to the birthday party to drink, it was in park. I took my ice pack sling for my arm in case and instead of buying a bag of ice for the cooler to keep it cold I dug out every lunch box, medication ice pack etc I had tucked away and put that in the cooler. Did a decent job for being out 8 hrs, sling was still froze as it was on the bottom but the rest was starting to really get warm.I scored at CVS between the coupons and sales I eliminated 7 more products I needed in the pantry. I budgeted $300 for these items...paid $144.04  with a savings of $155.96... not only am I happy about the savings but happy that I actually knew what to budget. My next goal is to finish stocking the personal care stuff and medical supplies. I've been watching the sales and have the coupons already.I don't buy name brand much but what I do I try to match coupons and sales. Like Pantene shampoo/conditioner... CVS had it buy 3 for $12. I had a coupon that was buy 3 save $5 and a coupon that was buy 3 save $2. I got 6 large bottles  shampoo/conditioner for less than $3 each...THEN I ADD 1/3 of water to them  so I will end up with over 2 bottles for free.bringing the price down to around $2 for a large bottle. Doesn't work as well with Sauve.I gave what few cucumbers we got that Hubby didn't want to eat for a friend that made refrigerator pickles so I would have pickles for myself since I can't handle canning with my arm in a cradle sling. I gave tomatoes that were going to go to waste to my ex son in law and his wife. Their tomatoes are still green.My cucumbers and squash got hit with the squash bug... I won't replant as I have friends that are being ran over produce.We turn the AC off every morning and open the house. THEN only turn it back on it's it's over 80 and there is no breeze. If there is a breeze. Ac stays off (hubby will use room AC while sleeping during the day) .Hubby has started turning the lights off without reminders and turns the tv off after the news as figured he didn't need to zone out with the tv on.We ate from the pantry and ate Plan overs twice. We will be making the menu today for this coming week. We have enough pasta left over for tonight.Our pressure switch went out on the water pump and the landlord showed me how to fix it and keep the water on until he got a new switch that he installed himself.Which was luckily to be the next day right after breakfast. We put in the order for our propane and pulled the money to pay it. Put a hole in the savings but it's paid in full at the lowest price. It always seems to go up the 2nd week of Aug.I am starting my winter produce list that I buy at the Sept auction.I can imagine that it will change weekly as I recheck the pantry.I am looking at the Christmas to buy list also this week and making a list of what is still needed.Mostly there are 2 crafts I want to make that I don't have all the supplies for. I have a back up plan if the costs is above when I have budgeted.I contacted Menards about a rebate that should have came in and hadn't and they traced it and it was sent. Glitch in their system.My son bought 3 of the shirts I had bought (I bought 5) for when I was wearing the sling, I'm to the point I can put on a shirt over my head if I don't raise my hand, actually I lean over and put the bad arm in first.We are working towards not using disposable items as much. I got rid of the paper napkins decades ago but Hubby's go to when he eats lunch or a snack is a paper plate. I told him I wasn't buying the better paper plates (as he won't do the thin cheap ones) for him to use when he retires so he needed to quit pulling the paper plates that are in the supply for the family reunion and Thanksgiving (because I don't wash dishes by hand for 100 people).., He is doing better.I caught he was doing it when he was on shut down and was actually home and the plates are stored on the shelf going to the basement which is an area I don't look much at. BUT since we ate lunch together every day I caught it. He also wants to use my freezer bags for things he is putting in the frig and going to eat later. I am reminding him to put it in a storage containerI transferred money to our Ally savings.I checked our credit scores at credit karmaWe used Gas buddy, Speedway fuel card with speedway fuel points and Kroger points for gas.We look our Maybe buy house list when we are going some where to see if we can do a drive buy to save fuel. Other that noticing we are now having Oct weather in Aug everything is pretty steady on the frugal front...as long as I limit paper plates and buy the ice cream myself."},
{"title": "first physical therapy", "date": "Wednesday, August 2, 2017", "text": "the black thing is the ice pack the hospital provided.It's almost as awkward as the cradle slingIt wasn't the nightmare others told. Maybe because I was in better shape, wringer washer, clothesline and 1200 sq ft of gardens is a lot of exercise.OR maybe it's because I actually did the exercises they told me to do after the surgery until I got into the physical therapy. Still looking at 11 more weeks unless the doctor changes the orders when I see him the 10th. I have a love hate relationship with the cradle sling.It's too big to fit me correctly and causes some raw spots from rubbing along with pinching nerves in my back shoulder area.Due to the mess up of my therapy not being ordered until after surgery,my twice a week is scattered instead of the same days each week.Also the time is bounced around so a couple are in the afternoon when Hubby sleeps. A couple of friends had offered to transport me but can't due to other conflicting things.. So the doctor cleared me to drive myself. Still because of the bouncing of days and times we will be spending more on gas than I would like as there isn't anything else going on to combine with..I would say the lack of decent sleep by having to have the cradle to my side is the biggest issue.The rash that started under my arm I was warned about was pretty much stopped because I had the meds here at 2 am when I woke with it and didn't have to wait until the local store opened at 9 am.I can do more than I thought, just slower and not some things like eat jello without issues.My physical therapy is stretches right now as they didn't think I would be in as good as shape as what I am. My baseline testing put me closer to the beginning of 3rd week instead of the end of 1st week . I am hoping that advancement continues and I get out of cradle sling sooner.Blessed BE"},
{"title": "one handed frugal  $20 grocery for Aug", "date": "Tuesday, August 1, 2017", "text": "when you look forward to harvesting the gardens just to get out of the house that isn't concerning medical issues. I already found out walking outside in high humidity will help a sling rash under your arm to flare even bigger. Frugal side.I already bought stuff for it at the dollar store.I didn't buy all the gadgets that I was told I would need to survive with one hand for a month or so...maybe because we have several one handed family/ friends that get along with all that stuff?Finger carrots, baby eggplant and one zucchiniThere was 6 beets that I roasted,then realized I was hungry so ate 3 of them before this picture. Since hubby doesn't care for beets it made him happy and neither of us had figure out what I could eat for lunch.Cherry tomatoes are starting , several had busted due to downpours.large onions aren't mine but the small ones along with the cucumbers are. I'm thinking refrigerator pickles might be the easiest for Hubby since I'm stocked for dill pickles but don't have any bread and butter pickles.These tomatoes aren't very big,there are some that are size of baseballs or bigger that are still green in the gardens. I mentioned fried green tomatoes to Hubby and watched his eyes roll...rough when your wife is a chef and down to one hand LOL.The now deceased mole destroyed my scarlet runner beans. I don't think they will recover in time to get beans off them.We have August bills paid and the rent,electric and this coming winter's propane ( price right now is $1.29/gal and we use 900 gals to be paid in full at signing of contract this coming week) sitting in the savings until due.The bad news is my car that I was going to sell to my youngest has a broken drive shaft. She's now looking for different car and I'm looking at a repair bill.It's still good enough for driving, just not the 2 1/2 hrs a day she does to work. Our mechanic, bless him and his, is willing to use used parts if they are good enough to put in his own cars and lets people make payments without holding the car until paid in full.We know we have 4 outings that will cost us some money so I put that money back also added a bit more to it as we will be going to a friend's summer cookout and I'm not sure what I'll take.Monty..the 27 cubic ft chest deep freezer (Montgomery Ward) is full to the point if you don't put things just so the top won't close. Mostly meat but the veggies have crept in.Newbie the 21 cubic ft chest deep freezer (new freezer) is full of veggies, fruit and cooked meat.I could get some sliced cheese in there...maybe.Baby the 7 cubic ft chest deep freezer(it's the littlest) that sits in the mudroom has some of everything but mainly it's breakfast or soup food. It holds this year's amount of corn as the one bin is the perfect size. I don't think a sheet of paper would fit. I really need to make chili but Hubby isn't thrilled with canning it.The meat for it is in Baby.The kitchen frig is full,it's freezer has enough room left for 2 boxes of ice cream sandwiches,my ice packet for my shoulder and 2 ice pack refills for my shoulder.The mudroom frig is seasonal fruit (local produce)and produce from the gardens.The freezer must be full as Hubby told me to NOT open it.That's usually the sign he put too much in it and it falls out when the door is opened. Since the door is held shut with tape, has been for years, it's hard to look and see with only one hand and not worth possible set back if I get hit with something.The dry goods of the pantry are in good shape until Thanksgiving and will be wiped out by time Christmas/Yule is over with. I'll restock during the holiday sales.The canned goods (home canned and store bought)...I would like more especially meat and fruit but right now I could easily stretch it for a year.Longer by eating the fresh as it is in season.I'll restock pie filling,pumpkin,apples,winter squash,sweet potatoes in Sept.at the Amish produce auction and Hurley Farms. I also noted on my calendar to call the local produce farm that grows potatoes next month as they close the first week of Oct.I'll restock ham,turkey and roasts this fall.Maybe pork loin as last year the prices were a bit too high.We need personal items and some household items like water softener salt that costs $72 plus tax per fill but we will wait until there is a sale.I also want to add to the emergency  fund (and pay off car repairs). I figure $20 for the month of Aug for the day to day groceries.We need to eat from the freezers so I have room for the fall meat."},

Hubby will have to finish around the house and trim as the neighbor's mower was too big to get in some areas around my gardens. But he cut down a 6 hr job to a 2 hr job for Hubby and we made sure he knew we were very grateful.Let's Hubby work in the gardens with me and cuts MY time down.Hubby told me to do the afghan first as doing it with a arm in a sling is time consuming and difficult (yes I tried to just to see if I could do it) and he isn't willing to learn to crochet. I could ask one of my kids to finish it but I am going to block out time to finish it myself. Anything else he can deal with himself.torn muscles ( they located 4 on the MRI,) bone spur above bursa ...it hurts now but Hey I can still use it unlike a couple years ago I couldn't lift my coffee cup out of the microwave and put it on top of the microwave.I've looking forward to having the surgery and getting this fixed... I am not looking forward to the IV. I have very small veins that roll, blow out and disappear.I've made nurses cry because of how it goes.MEAN TIME water and water and more water... try to pump it up as of midnight the liquids are shut off and surgery is at 2: 00 pm.The good thing is even though I had to buy some clothes to wear, I bought mens elastic band shorts in my son's size because I tried his shorts on and I could make them work and I bought 6 shirts that my son fondly calls Hawaii shirts for a total of $50. My son is buying the shorts and at least 2 of the shirts if not 3 of them off me after I am done with them so I will get back $35. Thankfully I have a lot of slip on shoes so I didn't have to go buy any.I best get back at it.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Tuesday before surgery", "date": "Tuesday, July 25, 2017", "text": "Yesterday I spent the afternoon in town getting fitted for my sling which looks like this. There is a huge wedge of foam between the arm and the body. The lady had told me I had a $44 copay...hum... I politely told her she needed to call my ins and confirm that because as of 2 wks ago my deductible and copays had been met and I was what Hubby's employer considers catastrophic and they pay 100%. She really didn't want to take the time, wanted me to pay it and then wait for a refund. Very polite but I politely insisted she call them and I would come back to get the sling after I went grocery shopping. She called me 30 min later and confirmed what I told her. Kept apologizing and then one of the other ladies that knows me told it that the young lady had got nailed the week before because someone told her their copay was at zero and she didn't confirm it and let them have the sling when in reality they were suppose to pay over $500 for it. Lucky for the young lady that they were able to get ahold of the spouse and the spouse came in and paid it or it would have came out of the young lady's paycheck. I told her that she needed to confirm the day before what the copay is because with our ins it can change in one day.  I didn't have a problem with her wanting the copay but I know that it would take me MONTHS to get that money back since they can't give me credit for it as all medical bills are paid in full from the ins as of now. After fitting me she put it in a case and zip tied it shut. If the hospital feels that it is over kill and I don't need that, we are to return it to the doctor's office as ins won't pay for it if we don't use it...it's $2500...talk about prices running wild.Since I was in town and I had the grocery money on me with plans to stop after the appt at Krogers for the sales. I went to Aldi's had picked up this month's part of the \"stock\" up items.Scored as 4 of the veggies I was picking up was down to less than 50¢ a can.. We need 97 items restocked, that's 97 variety not 97 total... more like cases.I got 11 yesterday off the list. I usually restock Aug through Nov but I am not sure how I will be doing after surgery and during physical therapy. I've been warned I should  have someone take me the first week because I will be crying when I leave therapy from how bad it hurts.I stopped at Krogers and got the sales. Came home and picked a few veggies out of the gardens.Have my list of MUST DO BEFORE SURGERY for today and ready to get started.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Frugal preparing for Surgery", "date": "Sunday, July 23, 2017", "text": "Surgery is Thursday afternoon.... I have bought clothes from Goodwill what I couldn't bum from others with acknowledgement that my son is buying some of what I bought off me when I am done with them. I might use what is left for paint shirts since I just toss what I had been painting in into the trash.Figured when the shirt is HARD after washing due to the amount of paint on it , it's time to toss it.I dug through the medical equipment bag and found a mesh sling to use in the shower so my main sling isn't getting wet nor am I chancing messing anything up when I get the go ahead to shower. I think it was the youngest that had the sling. I have other supplies including the stool softener that seems to be number one with everyone that had the surgery that I talked to...makes me wonder if they didn't know that pain medication causes your digestive system to slow down and can cause constipation.Our friend that has had this surgery 3 times told me the worse was physical therapy and being able to reach above your head...he could only lift to the top of his head...I'm still hanging clothes on a line that is 6 ft from the ground... going to be some difference there I think. More worried about my elbow freezing up on me again with the lack of movement by being in the sling for so long.Hubby doesn't braid hair and he's not the greatest on ponytails either even with his own ponytail, so I dug out my bandanas and tied them so I can pull them on with one hand to keep my hair out of my face while working in the gardens.This herb garden is running me over daily with harvest...which is very good except for the lack of rosemary,basil and oregano...the rabbit must be Italian.Bunny sure hopped right by the lettuce and spinach to those 3 herbs and never touched anything else.I have inventoried the pantry (not freezers) and wrote out what we need to be stocked so it doesn't matter which one of us is doing the shopping. I also listed the most I would pay for each item.I have made a general menu based on what we have  with side notes of what is needed to be bought for the meal when it's made. We decided we would sit down on Thursday when we do finances and figure out a menu for the coming week as Hubby will be doing the prepping and I am trying to not over load him since he is doing my work in the gardens ...can't wait until he has to start doing the canning.  We decided on one meal a week either store bought made or eating out to give him a break.I don't think it will happen that often because of what I have prepped and put in the freezer that it's more of a thaw, combine and warm up type meals but I would rather budget for it than not.We have decided for Aug since I am down and he might be buying one meal a week out that we would buy milk, eggs, in season fruit and lettuce as our lettuce  is done from Aldi's.Dog food for the dog as we are only doing 5 lbs at a time instead of the 40lbs as usually with the dampness we can't store it in the basement or garage. I've been using coupons and sales to keep the cost as the same as the 40 lb bags.Any other money goes for stocking up.I mended some clothes, changed some buttons  on a couple things so I can wear them after surgery using buttons from my late mom's button can. I'm down to a flat sheet that the hem got ripped out by the wind on the clothesline, a skirt that needs a hook and eye on the waist band and a skort that needs a new zipper in the mending basket.We have ate zucchini, the last of the lettuce , the last of the spinach and green tomatoes from the gardens. I left the last head of lettuce and spinach to go to seed.I have harvested and preserved spearmint, peppermint, choc. mint, chives, garlic chives, thyme, curly parsley, flat parsley, cilantro for coriander seeds, and basil. I bought a jar of oregano (maybe bunny will quit eating it) that was on sale from an Amish store.I repotted 7 pots of flowers that were root bound and now have 7 pots plus 14 more areas in the gardens of flowers.All of them are doing fine.I saved 10% on my MRI bill by paying it in full early.I combined errands with tests being ran for surgery.Used Kroger points and Speedway fuel card to save on gas money. Used sales and coupons when shopping. I shop Aldi's FIRST. We would use the motorcycle if it wasn't storming so much. Wet roads and bikes aren't the greatest either. We only have the truck right now besides the bike.Helped a daughter fix her roof that her landlord was dragging his feet on doing (been 2 months). She'll be breaking her lease as she has already started court proceedings against him for not honoring the repair list he signed off on that he was going to do when she moved in. Well I guess that means HE broke the lease not her.Meantime she is living there until the court part is over. She likes where she is but you can't live with roof leaking and ceiling dropping, broken pipes and no furnace in OH winters. She paid for the supplies, and two meals and gas.Helped as we were bringing her car to our mechanic and she offered it to be used to go see my Dad after my surgery so I don't have to flip with her brother or rent a car as Dad can't get in a truck.I cooked 10 lbs of hamburger and bagged it for meals and put it in the freezer. While doing that I had a bit more (not a pound) of hamburger so cooked it also, added a can of black beans that someone had given me, some leftover corn, homemade salsa and simmered for taco soup. Served it with cheese quesadillas and topped the soup with cheese and sour cream. Hubby thought it was really good , especially after I told him how I put it together.I have two 2 x 2 square pots to plant for fall crops that I can do after surgery with one hand. Sort seeds is on the I'm bored list.I have made a list on the whiteboard of things I need to get done that I can do with one hand so when I start the \"I'm bored, I can't do anything\" crap with Hubby he can pick something off the board and tell me to do it...Yes I can act like a whiney 2 yr old that needs a nap after I've had surgery...he's worse and he admits it.I wrote out what I have to get done before surgery... each day is listed separately and priorities are noted. Keeps me on track and will become the list of what he needs to take care of after I have surgery.I cancelled our Amazon subscribe and save as it is no longer saving me money.I open curtains and windows in the mornings and late evenings (if not humid) and close them in the late mornings. Fans are on when we are in the room. Central air is off when I have a breeze and no rain.I used the clothesline, homemade laundry soap and tap cold water cycle doing the laundry.I started my Christmas shopping from what I already have here.I mailed out the rebate forms that  we had from this past week. Checked coupons and sales for this week's to buy for stock up. I am breaking it down to what is on sale with coupons only unless I am at Aldi'sHave a frugal week. Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Mid July... 11 days to surgery..staying frugal", "date": "Sunday, July 16, 2017", "text": "I have a post it on my desk that I sit down at every morning that says\"what can I do frugal today?\"Sometimes that is only take a shower when I really really want to soak in the tub even though we don't pay for water (live in the boonies) we pay for the electric to heat the water and the electric to run the pump for the water. BUT the last few days I've had to soak due to a rash from the weeds we cleared from our daughter's. Not the type of soak I was wanting. I used epsom salt, witch hazel, rubbing alcohol and Aloe on the advice of my doctor since I am allergic to so many things that most use for rashesWikibuy cancelled my order for the 2nd dehydrator. I got one during Amazon's Prime day sales for half of the normal price cheaper than what I would have gotten through Wikibuy and BIGGER... that is frugal.I made 5 gallons of laundry soap that cost me less than $1.50 to make.Used the clothesline or drying rack when I did the laundry.Used the inserts to the cold cereal (Hubby's meal before he lays down in the mornings)to layer meat on cookie sheets for the freezer to freeze individually before I bag them. I buy cereal when it's on sale and I have coupons that puts a big box around $2.Hubby fixed his tailgate twice and then fixed his rear lights.AC has been off a couple nights and I kept the windows shut and just turned the fan in the bedroom on low. Windows open every morning, curtains closed in the afternoon.Hubby ran the window AC in the bedroom when there is enough breeze I won't turn on the Central Air.Lights off when not in room or needed, Computers and coffee makers on powerstrips that are turned off ( I unplug at night or during storms)The fuel tank for the tiller is to be in this week and that will be fixed. They gave us a discount due the wait of getting the part in.We used Speedway fuel card and Kroger pts for our gas.I am weeding daily to keep up with it so Hubby isn't overwhelmed when I go down on surgery. Cherry tomatoes are starting to turn, eggplants are about half my thumb length, bell peppers are getting a decent size, Should have a couple nice green tomatoes to fry next week.Still have lettuce which is a shock with this heat.I got my son's wardrobe done without buying anything to refinish it. Score for both of us.I am working on the buy list to be stocked up when Hubby retires and by doing so I have found some things that should have been in one spot but was in another so we aren't as low as I thought.I brought a bookcase that was sitting in the farrowing house (storage building now) that we bought over a year ago and used it upstairs to sort the Personal Items on for storage.I moved a smaller bookcase into another bedroom upstairs to put empty canning jars on so I can get to them if I try canning with one hand.I dehydrated spearmint, peppermint, thyme and basil.I used milk/water mixture to treat the mold on the plants. I use borax and sugar at the base of the hummingbirds feeders to get rid of the ants. I use borax to scrub the bathroom and floors.I changed a 30 day med order to a 90 day on 2 prescriptions saving $10 between the two so that is $40 a year.We went to a hog roast on behalf of the man that Hubby had to do CPR (none of the Medical people had ever seen someone that gray that survived with very little damage). I took 2 salads from our pantry and gardens.We took water also instead of buying it.I picked up medical items I will need after surgery on sale at Dollar General.We went to Menards to pick up weed killer for our daughter (should have done that before we all got rashes from the honeyvine milkweed) and ran across several good FOOD buys of things we needed to fill in the pantry. I almost have my pasta filled back in and I got a few more boxed dinners that Hubby thought he could handle to get us pass the two week mark.I figure by then I can start cooking with one hand and not mess myself up.I fixed egg sandwiches tonight for dinner just to see if I could crack eggs one handed, fry them and then make the sandwich and then cut it. Closing the bread sack was the hardest.We are at what Hubby's employer considers catastrophic medical wise so we no longer have copays or deductible which hit just at the right time with the surgery in 11 days. What we do owe is sitting in the saving waiting for the bills. Two of them will give us discounts for paying before the due date. We try to wait until about 3 -4 days before it's due to pay it.I wrote up a menu for 37 weeks even included sides on some. If there was a recipe I noted where it was (computer bookmarks main, side etc, what cook book , BRANDY.( The Prudent Homemaker) yeah the eat beans for a week and whatever is on her menus that I had already in the pantry and freezers is listed. I am half way through my have to be done before surgery list. Even if I only get 1/4th of what is left done... I will consider it a success.May you find peace in your dayBlessed Be"},
{"title": "Second week of July...remembering", "date": "Monday, July 10, 2017", "text": "Do you have a certain bowl that when the family sees is they can tell you what is in it without looking?This bowl used to belong to my late Husband's grandmother. After the rest of the family had went through and got what they wanted before the auction, we went through it for what he wanted. I asked for this bowl. He told me that that bowl had mashed potatoes in it during the cold months and either potato salad or macaroni salad during the warm months. SO that's what I put in it. My kids will also tell you that is held popcorn many times also.It was at one time the only large bowl I had. The kids keep trying to claim it.This bowl doesn't see much action now days with just Hubby and me. I only make about 1/3rd of the potato salad and now pasta salad (Hubby prefers it) and less than that with mashed potatoes. Popcorn is only once in awhile since I have to watch corn products with my Crohn's. Even though it's not used regularly, it sits in the front of the cabinet with mixing bowls.Why? Because it reminds me to be frugal in the kitchen. Grandma Cate grew all their food and took care of the farm animals while Grandpa ran the sawmill. If she didn't grow it, find it wild and can or dry it  they didn't have it to eat. They ate fresh in season, milk came from the cow in the barn, ham from the pig. She had chickens always and 2 turkeys that she raised for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I never got to meet her but I try to honor the lessons she passed to her grandson who is now with her.Hubby and I spent his \"shut down\" working around the house and helping our youngest with her to do list at her house. Older daughter didn't have anything that needed done right now but will before winter hits so we postponed going to her house. Yard work caught up, all gardens weeded and planted , there is no room for anything else at this point.. I potted up 8 of the tomato plants and 2 dozen onions to give to youngest daughter as she is the only one gardening this year besides us. I found some strawberry plants that had came up in the old strawberry box so I transplanted them into the new beds. The old bed got killed off last winter and these just started up. We put the swing together and moved the set into the garage so we can sit and swing in the garage during the heat of the day when we are out in the back yard area.Moved the fire pit to the driveway. It's portable and kept blowing away in the other area of the yard , I can roll it in the garage during storms and it's not going to catch anything on fire in the driveway plus the garden hose is right there if needed.Wikibuy cancelled my dehydrator order due to lack of supplies...so back to hunting for that.Turned off AC when we were outside all day. I opened windows and doors every morning,open curtains in the morning, close the top of them in the afternoons to keep the sun out but breeze coming through the screens.Walked behind Hubby turning off lights and fans when he left the room. He got better by the end of the week of stopping before he left a room and checking to make sure he left nothing on. He called it practicing for retirement of not having me nagging him about it. It's funny because he used to get on the oldest about her leaving tvs and lights on in HER home 24/7 and then complain about her electric bill.We went out once with our friends (coupon) and ordered calzones once (daily special).We ate onions and lettuce from the gardens and I had mint tea from the garden.. Have blooms on tomato plants and some soon to be cherry tomatoes. Have an eggplant growing. Have spinach that will be ready this week. Have jalapeno peppers that I can pick today for our meal. Harvest spearmint and peppermint.Checked the garlic that is curing.Moved dehydrator to garage. Usually in the summer I set it on the table on the front porch so it doesn't heat up the house but this summer the table is turned upside down every day to keep it from blowing away with the storms that are rolling through. So it went to the garage. The good side of that is Hubby cleaned half of one side of the garage so nothing would be around the dehydrator and in doing so found several things he thought he had lost. Lost it alright in his clutter of dump here and deal with it later.I finished son's wardrobe and can take it to him on Thursday when we flip our truck for his car so we can go see Dad and take Dad out to eat. Dad can't get in and out of our truck. Son uses the truck to haul stuff he can't move in his car while he has it.I finished getting the emergency supplies with a note to myself that we can eat everything in that area in December as I get fresh supplies in March.I decluttered a couple boxes in the front room and put them in storage where they belong.We used Speedway fuel card and Kroger points for gas.I combined coupons and sales to stock up for this winter when we have no income and for items that I will need while down due to surgery.I bought Hamburger Helper ...4 boxes (my coupon stated I had to have 4) that was on sale. I don't usually buy Hamburger Helper but Hubby used to when he was a single parent. So I got them for when he is cooking while I am down. We figure 8 wks of me not cooking at all. I can't lift my pots and pans with one hand (both shoulders need surgery, right one is the first one to operated on). I found hamburger on sale, I cooked 3 lbs and divided it in to 4 bags (yes I know that's less than a pound but Hubby who is a big meat eater doesn't realize it ), and labeled the bags for the Hamburger Helper and froze it. I will make some meatloaf in cupcake tins. prebake them and then freeze them also. I found pork loin on sale and then marked down, cut it in half for pork roasts as we have plenty of pork chops in the freezer. I can always use the meat slicer to cut it in to pork chops if needed. I found London Broil beef marked down, cut it in half and froze it. It can be London Broil or sliced on meat slicer for Philly steak or stirfries. I am trying to get 8 wks of meals that are just warm up or finish putting together.I got several medical supplies, dish soap and body soap with coupons and on sale. I bought Olay bar soap, coupon and sale to make laundry soap. It seems to be the only soap both of us can stand the smell of .We both are losing weight but decided (again) to postpone buying anything.I watched fireworks twice from our front porch and Hubby worked the pit during the fireworks in town. We had brats and watermelon and potato salad on the 4th. We ate twice a day while he was off work and had a snack of ice cream that I had put between cookies and froze.I think I will put some in the freezer before surgery including some brownies.We get the grocery ads on Tuesday in the mail. They go straight to the burn trash.I decluttered the area that I store the bath/health products.I took yarn that I already had from other projects to crochet a twin size afghan for my great grandson that I am now finishing up as his first birthday is right after my surgery.I got frozen peas and frozen peas and carrots for 10 for $10 to finish the \"stocking\" of the freezers. If I don't freeze or can anything , we will be okay going through the winter until next garden season.We use one bag a month except in the spring when peas come on.I transferred more savings to Ally bank and noticed we made more in the interest in one month than we did in 2 yrs together from our regular bank.We carried individual thermos of water while out instead of buying water some where.I've started a list of items we need from Menard's , we are waiting until the 11% rebate comes along. I still check Lowe's (no Home Depot around) to see what they are sale price is ."},
{"title": "Hello July", "date": "Tuesday, July 4, 2017", "text": "and the flowers continue to grow LOL. If you read June's post this is the same flower box. Notice how much the scarlet runner beans have grew.You can just barely see the red on the blooms that are starting. You will also notice spots from where flower pots sat for a week to catch the rain that kept coming in like a watering hose set on a timer.Mommy Hummer isn't around any more but Daddy Hummer is using the back yard feeder while Baby Hummer is using the front yard feeder... much longer and I won't be able to tell the difference between Daddy and Baby as Baby's green feathers are getting more like Daddy's.I got all the warm weather clothes, bedding and furniture throws out and the cold weather ones washed, dried and put away correctly (meaning I didn't dump it somewhere instead of walking upstairs and putting it in the closets where it belongs out of season).We got all the yard mowed (4 hr job just mowing) and the bushes all trimmed and about half the things trimmed with weed eater ...that will be finished tomorrow. Plus Hubby needs to cut a tree that has decided to grow up in the lilac bush. Landlord's oldest (has cattle and hogs in the barn here at the house) did some tree trimming on the other trees and then hauled that wood including some bigger limbs that had fell out of other trees during the storms for us since we \"look\" after the cattle and hogs for free.Bugs got the rhubarb but I didn't cut it down, I hope the bugs stay on the rhubarb and leave the rest of the garden alone.Garden produce done:rhubarb, strawberries(which we didn't get any due to late freeze), snow peas, garlic scapes, leaf lettuce, radishes, beets(actually just the greens as the beets didn't grow),rose petals and lavender.I pulled the garlic, it's about a month earlier than normal but it's ready and with the constant flow of rains I didn't want it to rot in ground.It's taking it about 2 wks longer to cure than normal.I harvested one lonely green bell pepper that is suppose to be red or orange but fell off it's plant during the last storm.I can't eat green bell peppers (messes with my Crohn's) so Hubby is going to get to eat it with his brats tomorrow with cooked onions.I planted more tomato plants and still have 18 more to get in ground this coming week.I planted more onions...over 100... and I have 200 more to plant. I just can't bring myself to toss them away and no one wants them to grow so in they go. I usually store them in panty hose hung from rafters or rod in closets along with drying a few. A friend mentioned she cuts some up while in the \"green onion\" stage including the green and dehydrates them for winter....she also stores the dehydrated green to use instead of chives. I grow chives regular and garlic so I don't need to do that but a mixture of onion and their greens would work for me I think.I have 3 heads of lettuce that need ate this week...We will only eat two and I will let the other bolt and reseed for this fall. There is some spinach ready also.I need to replant lettuce, spinach, onions (SIGH) and then I will have to think because I am having surgery and will be down to one shoulder for about 4 months...end of July until end of Nov. and then the plan is for me to have the same surgery on the other. I don't think the doctor thought I was funny when he asked how I was even using the arm with the way it was torn and I held my arm up and said like this. But Hubby is concerned with him being able to handle MY workload on top of his and taking care of me.I spent $30 at the end of June for sea salt grinders (idine salt causes me issues with my Crohn's) tortilla wraps, milk and lunch meat that I had coupons for and was on sale. Even though we don't care for sandwiches much we have been eating lunch meat, cheese and veggies in wraps for our mid day meals. I struggle to eat, always thinking of causing a flare up.I have my son's wardrobe and small cabinet yet to do and a set date to go to the older daughter's to help her with yard work that she doesn't have tools for.We want to go see both our parents before my surgery.I had 71 declutter missions from Home Storage Solutions 101 declutter 365 at the beginning of June. I am down to 55 (go me ;) ) 22 which can be done with 1 hand!Yeah that is a biggy. If you wonder why, tie your dominate arm to your side as if in a sling and not move the arm away from your body for the day.I  saute a lot of fresh veggies that have to be cut...try cutting with one hand. I have a meat slicer, mandoline, chopper, and apple peeler. Hubby knows he is going to be prepping. Better is I was born left handed and was changed to right due to superstition so I'm not as bad off as other can be.We hauled 3 loads (about 5 -10 boxes) to thrift shop. Took some leftover scrap wood from the old homestead (moved in 2008) and built 4 bedside stands for the youngest daughter and her kids. I thought that dropped it down to only OUR stuff...nope, I already saw 4 boxes of assorted toys and books that belong to the grandkids that they have out grown so nope, not yet. I should have charge when it went over a certain amt of time of me storing this.I switched where I was getting my vsl from and saved over $10 a bottle AND it arrives on time.We bought a plumbing auger (snake), we have a drain that is starting to cause problems and we have natural drains (hole in concrete basement floor for pipes to go into to flow down field tile and then we have a separate sewer line which goes to the septic tank and leach beds. Luckily it's the gray water drain but I don't like using much drain cleaners because the fumes come back up those natural drains in the basement. Got it on sale and used it here and then at the one daughter's who was going to pay around $60 for a house call.We used our Kroger points and Speedway fuel card for gas.We have been doing better about eating out of the pantry until last Friday when I was in the ER for my Crohn's (stress of medical issues and surgery).Yes Hubby is sleeping. He's had a lot of practice through the years of sleeping at the hospital with one us. He is the one the kids, especially the girls want with them when they go in , even now as adults.The bad news was partial blockage of bowel and major Crohn's flare up. The decent news was I could go home with a pain med of my choice( I can only take 3 different ones or I flare up) and drink my meals for 3 days and see if I could \"get through\" it. Better news was if we paid the copay right there as I was being registered we could save 5 %..Hubby wrote the check. That made the fourth medical bill we paid that we got discounted for paying before it was due.Not so much good news is Hubby bought his meals for the weekend at the grocery store since I was on liquids. The OK news was he bought a family size meal of fried chicken and split it up so I wasn't smelling him cooking. He used the last of the chicken to make himself chicken salad. I am thankful today I am back to eating somewhat. I'll probably be eating baby food while in my wheelchair when I get older.We researched money market vs savings etc for our new savings for emergency acct. Best interest was Ally Bank.I ordered a 2nd dehydrator just like my other one. Excalibur dehydrator. I found one on Amazon for what I thought was the lowest price I could find until I hit Wikibuy and got it for $40 less. I read about Wikibuy on Forbes.I have a lot of things I have to get done before the surgery at the end of the month or they won't get done at all. Like my great grandson's afghan for his first birthday about a month after my surgery.The \"good\" side of this surgery besides getting my arm and shoulder fixed is it will give us the expenses of when it's done on the NEW ins that starts in Jan. We pay 10 % now and will be paying 20% then.One last picture...this is our lane, 2/10ths (why don't they call it 1/5th) of a mile. Hubby usually mows it last so when he is coming back up it he knows he is coming home and the job is finished.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "End of June frugal", "date": "Tuesday, June 27, 2017", "text": "I have scarlet runner beans on the trellis. These were \"leftover\" flowers from the ones that went into hanging pots my daughters made. So I decided to plant them here with the scarlet runner beans I plant each year for the humming birds.They like the red blooms.Every day frugal choices... windows open when it's cool, curtains shut during hottest part of day. Fans when in rooms and turned off when not. AC only when it's above 80° and it's set for 78°. We wash dishes by hand,,,no dishwasher here. I mix blue Dawn ,2/3rds soap to 1/3rd water and put that in small dish soap bottles. I use blue Dawn because it is a multi-use item. I use vinegar to clean the windows and the sinks (vinegar and baking soda helps keep drains clear).Turn off power strips to coffee makers, computers etc. We had summer heat in  the 90s-100s and now are down to low 70's with night lows in the low 50's ...was tempting to turn furnace on when the house was down in low 60's but instead got \"Fall\" like clothes back out and wore them. Did laundry with cold tap water, homemade laundry soap and dried on clothes line and drying rack.Make a point of transferring money to savings acct every week even it's only $1. Save all my change. Use Speedway rewards card for 3¢ off a gal. Used Kroger's rewards card  and split the point into 2 different fill ups. Used CVS points to get money off items that was on sale and I had coupons for. Kept my Walgreen's card connected to my exercise tracker to get points there.Didn't water the gardens because of all the rain. Also couldn't fertilize so that's going to go farther.Reorganized stock up in upstairs... made list of what is needed to run us through 6 months, figuring 4 months without income or very little income beginning of 2018 when Hubby retires. Researched his options with retirement. We paid off our Ch 13 (slow pay bankruptcy) in Dec that was caused when he went to 3 days a wk for 2 yrs and medical bills going through the roof with my heart failure. Rebuilding credit and savings and researched the credit cards to get. One for each of us. Didn't worry about interest rate because we pay in full before it's due. Do need to research best place to put savings for 3-6 months emergency fund.Did click list at Kroger's. Definitely kept me reined in.  THEN went a week later to Kroger's with paper coupons after matching meat coupons with sales . Yes meat coupons that are so few and far between.My meat slicer I replaced has had a work out.  I also pulled a London broil that had been in the freezer and sliced half of it very thin for  Philly steak subs(wraps) and then used the leftover for stir fry with snow peas from the garden and finished those leftovers in a frittata. The other half was marinaded, grilled and then sliced. We used the leftovers on top of salad from the garden. Sliced eggplant, yellow squash and zucchini with my meat slicer for several meals.Sliced chicken breasts and did the same as the London Broil.Harvest garlic scapes, garlic, storage onions, green onions, lettuce, snow peas (done), radishes (done),thyme, oregano, garlic chives, chives, rose petals(done), and lavender. Have more herbs that will need harvested and processed for storage this coming week.Cut my pain meds in 4ths with approval of doctor.Got a $20 discount, swagbucks and 2 days free on the car rental I got last week when we were down to only the motorcycle and it was storming.Our son borrowed our truck while his was in for repairs and he found we had a very small gas leak in the fuel line as he parks in the garage and we are on a gravel lane. Our mechanic (who lets us make payments without interest) said if he can just repair it instead of replace it he will. That will be done during shut down so we won't need to rent a car. Mechanic will bring Hubby back home when he drops it off and drop off truck here at home when it's done. Our youngest has our car as she lost her ride to work when she left her ex.I cashed in my Pine Cone survey points and my Swag bucks.Our landlord decided to NOT raise the rent with property taxes that went up and since we pay for our dogs to be here on a monthly charge we figured he would just want to leave is as if we still had Miss Kira but he actually lowered it by 5% due to us doing all the mowing including the part he said he would take care of in the lease. He has mowed the entire thing a couple times when our mower was down for repairs.Hubby repaired the riding lawn mower, wheel broke off the mower deck.Hubby got a bonus and we put half in savings and the other half was for a trimmer as ours died and it's big need here. We found one at the hardware store on sale for $50 cheaper than I had priced everywhere else at PLUS we had a $25 coupon off  $100 of anything we bought at the store AND then since we bought a gal of the fuel (50/1) for it we got another discount and double the yrs in warranty and they do the servicing of it for the warranty. SO I was able to put more in to savings. :)Compared to last year we lowered our electric by 5 %. this past month AND our propane usage by 35%Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Mid June  frugal? ", "date": "Tuesday, June 13, 2017", "text": "The climbing rose bush has went wild. The front garden has exploded with flowers(weeds that bloomed) and the birds are thrilled. Frugal we don't have to buy bird food except for the hummingbird and only because we feel it's better for them to have calcium etc to make the egg shells stronger. AND YES I know the back door is propped open. When we are out we prop it open so Rascal will go get a drink of water...bugger butt won't drink out of the outside pan that he drank out before. LOL.I harvested rose petals, lavender, spearmint,peppermint and choc mint for tea.I harvest thyme, oregano, chives and garlic chives for the dehydrator and for use.I harvest lettuce (had some bolt before it got the size of baby lettuce), green onions, some of the garlic bulbs to cure and snow peas. Might get one more meal off the snow peas.I transplanted a hanging basket that now is 4 pots of flowers.I planted Italian green beans (wide green bean), over 150 candy onion starts, beets, carrots, nasturtiums, zucchini, yellow summer squash, Armenian cucumbers, pickle cucumbers , red noodle beans and yard long green beans.We had/have several doctor appts this month. Hubby has one left, I have 5.Hubby was diagnosed with GERD. ENT doc put him on generic meds and changed his diet...which is now a lot closer to mine (SMILING BIG TIME). Not that I wanted him to have GERD but I'm not having to fix extra stuff for him any more .I have a bone spur in my rotor cuff that is going to be dealt with ...Jumping the hoops of ins as both shoulders have issues but I can only to one at a time and have to wait for the MRI to be approved etc...I used short wash with tap cold water and homemade laundry soap and used the clothes line.I dug out the old drip hoses and put them in the south gardens. We were going to change how we watered but with knowing we will be moving within a year or so we decided to hold off on buying anything for gardens.I have 2 rooms to finish prepping for summer this coming week and putting the last of the cold weather stuff away.We took 3 loads of \"stuff\" to the thrift shop.... I think we are almost through what was the kids stuff. LOLI turn AC off during the late evening to morning hours (unless it's storming) and leave the windows open.. Hubby runs a small AC in the bedroom while he sleeps days , it's set at 75 with med fan. He prefers 72 but with having the ceiling fan on also (only room with a ceiling fan) he sleeps ok.We are looking for a home with land, our realtor is sending us updated lists that meets what we told him we were looking for in 6 different counties. Saves everyone time and gas instead of running around. When we go look at the houses , we do a \"run by\" before we call him... pictures of what looks far off the road or without close neighbors aren't always what they really are.Hubby ride the motorcycle to work when it's not forecasted for rain.I changed some of my routine to help ease the grief of losing Miss Kira along with Rascal changing some of his also. Miss Kira did  perimeter clockwise..Rascal walks counterclockwise. If I use the word perimeter he will walk in the driveway and watch me but not walk with me. If I say walk, he runs to the edge of the perimeter across the driveway and waits for me. He begs (sits pretty and barks at the truck door) for a ride in the morning when Hubby gets home and then doesn't care the rest of the day...if I/we are leaving and we tell him he can't go, he goes and lays down unlike Miss Kira that would HOWL and CRY and then go pout.. The only thing he begs for is a ride not food or his treats. He definitely was following Kira's lead instead of being himself. He is more of a barker than she was and he is jumping up and checking whatever is going down the road where she only did it if someone pulled in the drive.We had our small tiller fixed instead of replacing it but are replacing the weed eater instead of fixing it. Based it on price and the age of what we had.I broke down and applied through our bank for a credit card so I could rent a car when we went to go to Dad's as we only have the truck and bike now. I don't care for credit cards but rental cars required credit cards. I got a limited at my request amt for 0% interest for 15 billing cycles (which is less than 15 months) and then it goes up...but since I don't carry a balance I don't really care what it goes up to.Bank thought I was weird for requesting a low amt but what ever LOL.We ate from the pantry except for twice, both times got \"lunch\" out and took home leftovers for dinner due to doc appts.Blessed Be."},

Hubby works graveyard shift at a physical demanding job. Both of us have  cholesterol issues...well he doesn't if he doesn't eat certain seafood). Mine is all over the place and it doesn't seem to matter if I just look at it or eat it. I have Crohn's.

It also calls absorption issues so I fight malnutrition constantly. I border lined diabetes due to meds...steroids...

{"title": "Frugal end to May", "date": "Tuesday, May 30, 2017", "text": "Rascal was messing around the climbing rose bush and got this stuck on him some how so I put it in the vase for my dining table.It's been a rough week emotionally, 2 different tornadoes was within 1/4 of mile from our son's, worried a lot as he has no basement, he had some limbs down but no real damage, then  our dog Miss Kira  passing and Hubby , who is an EMT at work having to do CPR on a co-worker for about 10 min and said he didn't think the guy was going to come back...THANKFULLY , he is recovering and now out of ICU. I gave Hubby the last of the grocery money to get gas to go see him and to donate some to help the guy as his wife and him are raising 3 young grandkids. My emotions triggered my Crohn's and then we had a 2 hr drive (1 way) to Hubby's brother's wedding the day after Miss Kira died, rough leaving Rascal here alone. We used Kroger points and Speedway gas cards to save on gas.The Gardens have been soaked repeatedly that I am not sure if I will be able to finish planting or get in to weed what was planted.  I keep moving the potted plants off the porch to the yard when it's going to rain to not have to water them .I did plant some scarlet runner beans in the front flower bed, more for the blooms for the hummingbirds than for the beans. I was given under size tomato plants that need to be repotted and allowed to get bigger before planting in the garden.Sorry, I keep forgetting to raise the screen in the mornings so I can get better pictures LOL. This is Mommy Hummer... Daddy Hummer usually uses the other feeder ...this morning (when I didn't have my phone) Baby Hummer came by himself to feed at this feeder. The other day he was with Mommy Hummer.I have been listening to my online classes through our health ins (we have earned enough pts that if Hubby doesn't retire this year, his health ins will be free next year and mine will be $1.50 a week.Plus we save $ on the copay and deductible and have a 90-10 plan instead of the 80-20 plan with larger payments,co pays and deductibles. We are planning on him coming out this year BUT you just never know what life is going to throw at you. I work on the afghan I am crocheting for my great grandson. Over half way done. On the days I don't have class I do Swagbucks videos for the same length of time.I mixed equal amounts of 20 mule team borax and sugar for the ants.I harvest thyme (twice), garlic scapes (twice), chives, garlic chives, lavender and rose petals.We ate most of what was on the menu, the leftover was what Kira (and Rascal also even though he ate 3 bowls of dry dog food also) was eating as she could no longer handle dry dog food.Electric bill came in $50 under budget.That will go back up as I had to turn the dehumidifier on because it's 90% humidity in the basement pantry.While I was in the root cellar during tornadoes I made a list of what was still missing and plan to have it finished by July. Part of it I think I can find stuff we have to work (like plastic to keep things from getting wet if the house gets blew off it's foundation), so that's the focus of this week.We also started listing what we use daily so I can makes sure that is stocked for the 4 months we go without income. Our neighbors that farm and run a construction business said they thought they could give us some off and on work, that was nice for the offer even if they can't do it at the time because construction and farming slows down a lot during the winter.Do the same routine with opening curtains (binder clipping tops to limit sun coming in) and opening windows. Run fans when we are the room. Hubby uses the ceiling fan when he sleeps during the day. We do have a room AC that he also uses if it's too hot for him to sleep so we don't have to use the Central air. When we do use the central air it's at 76.Hubby needed new shoes( he does one pair for yard work, one for dress..yard work need to go in the trash), there is one pair that is the best for his feet. We priced it at a big shoe store while killing time before the wedding and it was running about $150...OUCH. He was talking about just finding something else. I found them on Amazon for $90... Since they will last him for at least a couple years (yard work pair is over 4 yrs old) it's a price we are willing to pay. I found the shoes I wear at Walmart so used my swagbucks to order through so I would get some back. Also ordered 3 blouses that were on clearance as I wasn't finding anything to go with 4 skirts I bought at yard sales and thrift shops and am down to 1 outfit to wear to weddings and such. We can wear jeans to church.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Grief", "date": "Sunday, May 28, 2017", "text": "Friday(5/26/ 17) morning at 8:30 I lit this candle on behalf of my older dog Miss Kira. Hubby was taking her to have her put to sleep as she had stopped eating on her own and only ate a little from my hand as I tried to get her to eat. She gave me a kiss instead and I let her go...with heartbreaking and fighting denial that made me want to pretend she would be instantly cured of the tumor or better go in her sleep....I stayed home with Rascal, he was only 6 wks old and hadn't been with his mommy due to his mommy fighting to live after being starved while she was expecting. So Kira was his doggy mommy when I am just mommy.... I side tracked him so he wouldn't get upset with her getting to go in the truck with Hubby and him not. (her favorite thing to do was ride in the truck with her Daddy without Rascal and me) When Hubby brought her collar home and put it with her leash in the mudroom. Later when the breeze changed direction her tags made a sound and he ran to the mudroom to see her.. with tears running down my face I took the collar and let him smell it. His eyes became sad and his head dropped and walked away and hide between my foot stool and the couch where she hid when she wanted to be left alone. He knew she wouldn't be without that collar,But life goes on as we grieve . I have her lamb that she rested her head on, at time Rascal and I both need to smell it to smell her one more time. I know her scent will fade with time, and so will the  grief...Walking the perimeter for me is hard, she was my perimeter buddy and her cute prance brought a smile through the worst of weather we walked in. I remind myself she isn't in pain, wasn't when we let her go. She's not stuck in a perimeter and can roam to her heart's content. Her ashes will bring joy to others as they were mixed with wild flowers and sprinkled in a meadow. She loved walking through my flower gardens and smelling the flowers several times a day.My Hubby grieves, she loved him the most and made that clear. She would sit in truck for hours with him. He said he needed to be the one to take her, to tell her to go on as she stopped and looked back at him as she left him.Rascal is withdrawn and we try to let him have his time of grief but encourage him to eat, to play to go outside though one of us usually go out with him so he doesn't feel so alone. His routine and habits will change as he is now \"top dog\" as Hubby calls him. He finally slept on the loveseat and then on the couch that she had claimed as hers. He now lays beside Hubby's chair at the dining table where she laid instead of by me like he did... He's not playing unless we push the issue with him. I get him out to play 10 (10 throws of the ball) and am lucky to get 1 at this point. He will go out with me when I can bring myself to walk the perimeter but doesn't walk with me even if I take the ball to play 10, he will catch the ball and then go back up to the drive to watch me but not be with me.  I hope some day that he will walk with me.I grieve, I just grieve. She had brought me out of sever depression when I got her out of the shelter 7 yrs ago. Spent 5 yrs of her life in the shelter ( first 2 owners lost their homes and gave her back).Now I fight the depression without her. I fight it in honor of her, to be there for Rascal as she would want me to .... I try to keep in mind she's better, she's free, she's happy...I told Hubby I am not sure I could handle losing one of the kids, grandkids or great grandson. I nearly starved myself to death when I lost my younger brother...the grief just hits harder and harder as I age.Hold your love ones a little longer today, call. text, whatever, the ones you can't hold and let them know you love them.Life is too short, far too short, and shorter when they walk on 4 legs.Blessed be  my baby girl..Miss KiraYour last walk baby, I love you.

{"title": "this week ", "date": "Wednesday, May 24, 2017", "text": "started out being really frugal.Monday we went to Wagner's IGA and hit the clearance cart to go along with the few odds and ends I didn't want to pay the Kroger's prices. Did a huge score on different breads and sweets for the freezer.Plus points for fuel and 5¢ each for bringing my own bags.I stopped a FISH thrift shop and got 2 pillows to recover,scarf,2 skirts(one which be use to recover the one pillow)5 nightgowns of the style I love but never want to pay the price for and 1 pair of shorts for a total of $11.I went to doctor appt... I had dropped my A1C from 6.4 to 5.8 (GO ME) and my cholesterol below 200, WITHOUT the statin ..haven't seem that low in a decade. Doc took me off 4 different meds as my blood work showed I was finally up to normal. Doc changed my one med from 90 days to 360 and sent it to a certain pharmacy because they sell it for half the price of getting it every 90 days for a year.. Saved me around $50.I went to CVS to pick up Hubby's meds and the clerk caught I had been bumped out of the rewards for prescriptions so she put me back in.I maxed out on May's pts at Walgreen as my FITBIT tracker is connected to their app. I now have a $10 credit but 3000 pts away from having a $20 credit.I went to Ollies as they had fans in and  I had a 15% off coupons. I picked up 4 fans of different sizes and styles for 1/4 th less before the coupon than I had priced elsewhere.Hubby called our phone company and complained that the credit we were suppose to get from April when both our land land and internet was out for a week wasn't on the bill like it was suppose to be. Took him 2 hrs to get it dealt with which didn't put him in a good mood at all but as I reminded him it got the credit If it's not on the next bill he will go through the roof.I requested a credit from my GI office as they had charged me for her to file out family leave and she doesn't do that unless you are having a procedure and the front desk didn't know that as she had just started...also I found out my ins PAYS for that to be done so I shouldn't have paid anyways.She lets the hospital doctor do that instead. BUT Hubby's employer wants it filed in Jan so my primary was able to do it since he does all my blood work and meds to fight the malnutrition the Crohn's causes.  They were suppose to credit it to the Jan bill , then when that didn't happen it was send a check and then when I went in April it still hadn't been credited or sent . My GI nailed the billing office and stood over them until she saw that is was credited to my bill from April... GOOD DOCTOR.I made potato salad, after I boiled the potatoes I just lifted them out instead of dumping the water and added some cold water and then put the eggs in to boil them.Tuesday we had chiro appt and dogs went to vet.I scheduled a manicure (not my norm) for Friday when we go in for another doctor appt at the salon across from Chiro. Since I'm not getting a gel just a regular manicure it wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. This is my Mother's day present from the kids...it's going to cost them $5 each including the tip.Our chiro was less than $6 for the two of us thanks to our ins now covering that .AND THEN OUR WORLD FELL APARTTook the dogs to the vet to get their nails clipped (takes 3 of us to hold them down and clip). I always get the dogs weighed. Miss Kira...our older dog...about 100 yrs in dog years...had dropped another 3 lbs in one month... she did that in April and we didn't think anything of it as she was starting to run the perimeter more with the warmer weather... but this time I knew it was bad we had another dog, Cookie do that when she got cancer..Miss Kira has a tumor in her spleen/intestines that is already the size of a baseball. Doc felt it pretty good and she didn't moan, yelp or anything while he did it so she's pretty much pain free at the moment. She jumped down from the table that is 4 ft off the floor which bugs the crap out of me but shows she's stable in that area. No sense of doing a MRI as I wouldn't have her operated on at her age and there is a possible chance of the tumor exploding when they cut her open. Her quality of life means more to me. We almost lost her the spring of 2011 right after we moved here due to someone tossing rat poison out and her getting a hold of it. Almost put her into kidney failure even though I got the package away from her and her teeth was only through the cover on top. Law said the package had been coated with grease so everyone was watching out...our landlord had his dog poisoned a couple years ago and they never found who did it...anyways...she's moving slow,her perimeter walks are closer to half the perimeter in the morning and not much during the rest of the day. Her eating is slowing down unless it's people food then she can out eat me. Good thing we scored on bread as that with eggs is her favorite and french fries...She's eating grass at the edge of the garden pretty much every time she does go out. AND she finally didn't look away when I took her picture yesterday.She is getting her way pretty much with what few weeks we have left with her. We know from Cookie that 4-6 wks will pretty much be the end and we won't let her go into pain . She still lays on her tummy so we know when she stops that or we can see the shape of it in her belly like we did Cookie it will be time to let her go... MEANTIME she has scored extra rides in the truck from her Daddy...on the other hand Rascal... who loves getting his picture taken.Yes he is begging,that's about as far as he raises his front feet unless he is wanting a hug. He has stayed close to me, he isn't trying to get her to play any more. isn't swiping the chew bone from her to get her to chase him. He is smelling her more instead so I know even though I haven't picked up the odor YET he has.He isn't playing 10 (fetch the ball) with me, just wants to be close but not play. When I walk the perimeter he stays with her most the time now. Protecting the weaker of our pack.I did the wash on speed wash, tap water cold, homemade soap and then dried everything on the clothes line. She laid in the house on the hassock to watch me out the window (she didn't want out as I left the door open so she could come out whenever she wanted) and he laid under the tree watching her and me.Hubby told me to feed her whatever she would eat. He didn't want her to feel hungry and she does let me know when she wants something but I think the dog food isn't going to be what she eats much longer. Rascal will definitely eat her share.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "being frugal May 19 2017", "date": "Friday, May 19, 2017", "text": "In our home being frugal is a lifestyle that changes with life.I had a friend tell me how frugal they are and how little it costs to run their home until I started playing 20 questions with her and then she realized they weren't being frugal at all.Spending $200 a week for two people at Krogers and doing the survey for another 50 pts so you can get $1. off 35 gals of gas, is not frugal. Keeping the curtains shut ALL the time and then run the furnace because none of the sunlight can heat the house and have to turn on ALL the lights (not just in the room they are in either) isn't being frugal. I did talk them into using LED light bulbs, Not opening windows and doors when it's warm out and there is a breeze and turning the AC to 70° (when they heat the house to 78° during the winter) isn't being frugal. Using the dryer as an iron because they left the clothes in the dryer and they got wrinkled not frugal. Buying the latest and newest of anything and then not using it is not frugal. Buying clothes or anything because they are on sale and you have coupons and then never wear them or use them is not frugal.Carrying 15 store credit cards and just making payments instead of paying them off.I didn't say anything to her that it wasn't being frugal, she realized it with just telling me about it.Not carrying life ins and not having a will is going to be a huge problem for those you leave behind especially if you don't have your funeral and burial expenses paid which they just found out AFTER he didn't keep the life ins that he could have had when he retired.By time they got the funeral and burial arranged and paid for the two of them it was over $30,000 that came out of their assets instead of the life ins that wasn't costing him more than $39 a month that would have paid those bills.Even if you don't own anything , get a will, otherwise it goes through probate ($$$)when you die in most states. Your family or friends have to file in court to deal with your bills and funeral etc. Get POD(pay on Death) on all checking savings accts make sure you have beneficiaries on everything IRA , 401k life ins ...list two if not 3.Getting trees trimmed, fence and locks on gates around pools or pets if they bite , repairing sidewalks, cleaning out the rain gutters have them drain AWAY from the foundation (add the hose things if needed), using septic cleaner (ridx most common around here) and cleaning the filters in the septic system.Her husband put a lock on the gate around their pool and their house ins dropped $50 . They just spent thousands repairing their foundation because the downspouts drained there. They had to pay for their son's car to be fixed after their tree that is into the driveway dropped a limb on his brand new car.Sometimes it's pennies you are saving...and they do add up to dollars. AND sometimes you have to spend the dollars to save the hundreds or thousands.It can be doing the laundry on short cycle with tap water and homemade soap or cheap that isn't brand name.Using the clothes dryer on sensor, drying rack, clothesline or combination of all.Eating from the pantry that I have spent time matching sales and coupons or hours growing, tending, harvesting, processing and then cooking for our meals OR eating out with coupons combined with specials or during bfast or lunch time when it's cheaper. Using senior citizen discounts is another one.It's listing what we need, what we want and what we are willing to pay and then searching for substitutions that are cheaper and then  waiting for the sale (or Menard's 11% rebate).It's thrift shops , yard sales and networking for things.It's making do, using it up, wearing it out and sometimes doing without. Like the trimmer that just died and I'm using scissors to trim with the things that took 30 min with the trimmer.BUT it's also about having beauty in our lives of 2 dogs, hummingbird feeders, birdhouse, flowers table cloths, oil lamps and candles...and my 100 plus herbs and spices that I use on a regular bases (that is sometimes a negative from my cheffing years LOL) I grow most of my herbs, half of my teas and have a source through an Amish store for the spices.It's about sitting outside and enjoying it and not focusing on the trimming that isn't getting done (our friend is trying to find us a used one that is in our price range), the gardens that are starting to get weeds already or the storms that are gathering west of us AGAIN.It's not about not buying, as the huge outlay of money we spent just this week will tell you...but the over 1/3rd savings when everything was totalled up shows the frugal. Things we need to run this home, maintain it bought at the lowest price we waited for. The amount I budgeted was 50% higher than what we paid.It's about talking to our car ins guy about us renting a car when I need to get my dad instead of owning an old gas guzzler with full coverage when we don't need except for when I get Dad, We need a truck, or even two would be a lot better as one vehicle isn't doing well for us,.It's about looking at a secure credit card that is based on our savings to pay for the car rental instead of just a credit card that we can run up another bill. If the car rental took debit cards I wouldn't even bother with that.Frugal can have some negative also...Using cash only ( 7 yrs of cash only) no credit cards or loans means our credit score is low...that's not a good thing when we will be buying a house, on the other side we will have the cash to pay for a house with in reason Our finance guy is still working out which way is better with our tax guy. Lucky for us, both are FREE. as they are close friends .It's about needing clothes (Hubby has lost 20 lbs and is continuing to lose and I am not out in the workforce and chef jackets and dress clothes don't do well in gardens) that wear well with the hard manual work we do. Used clothes is fine, under clothes socks and Hubby\"s work boots are new. I can usually get shoes off the grandkids as they outgrow my size. That benefit is going to end this year as the youngest is about to pass me and the great grandson isn't even one yet.It's about turning off fans when you aren't in the room, turning off the lights when you leave the room. opening the curtains for light/warmth closing them when it's hot out to keep the house cooler.It's about turning the central air on (which I don't like AC to begin with ) because the old dog (around 100 in dog years) throws up when she gets to hot and dehydrates when I can turn on the central air to 76 keep her cool and not run up the vet bill which is twice what I pay for running the Central air if I only run it during the hottest part of the day. We will run it if it is raining and the fan can't keep the house cool enough,It's about using the outdoor grill instead of the stove and heating up the house when it's hot out. Using the oven when it's cold in the winterUsing leftovers to make more meals, eating more legumes and less meat. It's about doing my own nails even though I LOVE getting a manicure and pedicure.Being frugal in your choices is good. Being frugal as a lifestyle will reap more rewards.Blessed BeWe have a few things we will get the rest of this month but not much. Yes the bill was huge , but about 1/3rd less than what we budgeted for when we waited for coupons, sales and rebates.This was what the list wasDollar GeneralAdvil Allergy and Congestion BOUGHTSensodyne toothpaste BOUGHT (STORE BRAND)Super Glue BOUGHThand soap BOUGHT LG REFILLCorned beef hash BOUGHTCVSXlear nose spray BOUGHTMake up.BOUGHT WHAT WAS ON SALE WITH REWARDSMenards (at 11% rebate)dog food BOUGHTdog snap treats BOUGHThouse water filter BOUGHTWater pitcher filters BOUGHTsoftener salt BOUGHTdryer vent kit (daughter) BOUGHThummingbird nectar BOUGHTcanned veggies for emergency supply BOUGHT (done)clothes line pins (mine are worn out) BOUGHTregular canning lids BOUGHThardware for daughter's clothes line Hubby is making her (BOUGHT)ground clear (usually get this from landlord but he ran out himself) BOUGHTgarden hose (one got a huge hole) BOUGHTgarden hose sprayer (old one got ran over) BOUGHTkitchen brush (for my cast iron) BOUGHT25 cu ft of potting soil( as I gave  my kids what I had for their pots) BOUGHTFood..

Used to be 2 family bags a week. Starbucks decaf ground coffee...not for us but for my Dad that just went to decaf and complained he is drinking brown water with his milk .I left him some when we were there and my brother had him make him a pot to try it. Dad told him he thought it wasn't decaf because of the taste but wasn't going to tell me that he liked it better because he knew the price of it. Brother told me anyways as we all figured Dad wouldn't let me know because of the price. Man is 90 yrs old, buying his coffee is no big deal.I will be glad when the gardens start coming in so the fresh veggies being bought will be lowerBlessed BeHome from the auction and unloaded in front of garage. I got the flowers we wanted and a few more as Hubby did the opening bid on some flats and no one bid against him. Oh well 36 flowers for $5 isn't bad and what I didn't want, I passed to 2 of my daughters. Got tomato plants, bell pepper plants and candy onion plants . I had to pick up eggplant over to the hardware store.I've put in almost 40 hrs and still have some to plant.... BECAUSE I had a friend give me their extras LOLI did put in this new flower garden. I will have scarlet runner beans on the trellis as the Hummingbirds love the red flowers on them, the green beans they produce is a side benefit for us. We had a baby hummingbird the other day. I wished I could have gotten a picture.IF the winds we keep getting don't kill it off is should be a decent garden. We have went from floods to freeze to frosts to storms with winds 30-60 mph in the last 10 days and that train of storms is still rolling through this week. Temps have been to almost 90°.We went over and saw both set of parents and spent some time with them.Then made 2 trips down to the kids and realized we forgot somethings so will be going back down.We ate mostly from the menu which was from the pantry. Leftovers got made into other dishes so I didn't fix a couple meals.We hauled another 2 loads to thrift shop and 1 load down to kids.There are big holes in the farrowing house.I should not have to buy any more green onions at the store as mine is starting to come in. The snow peas and Lincoln peas are up and look to have survived the nasty weather. Rhubarb is about to run me over. That's a priority this week.I got laundry done on the day I could use the clothesline even though the winds were around 20 mph I was able to keep it on the line and not have to rewash anything. Sure did dry fast.I haven't gotten around to baking...going to have to change my schedule to add that in along with the sewing I want to get done.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Menu to this coming week", "date": "Monday, May 8, 2017", "text": "I am horrible at planning menus for just Hubby and me. For work as a Chef, no problem, as a mother that had over 7 at the table, no problem...just Hubby and me BIG PROBLEM.We like variety...we like different cultures , types, etc  it is the negative side of being a chef.I have also learned after noting what got threw in the garbage this past month that the 4th serving gets tossed... I eat bfast for my lunch... We have 2 servings at dinner and then Hubby takes the 4th for his lunch. Some things I am able to cut down to 3 servings or divide the four into 3 others not so much.I used to freeze it for my Dad but he can't swallow solid food any more and then I gave it to our son but now he's on a special diet for his weight and that doesn't work either. When Hubby retires we decided to just plate it and cover it for the next day and both of us would eat it for dinner... meantime I need to quit tossing food.We decided if it's something that has to be made as 4 that I have something else for him to take to work and we eat the last 2 servings the following day's dinner.This week's menuDinner onlyone pot green beans, potatoes and ham from freezer  and cornbreadHobo packets , smoked sausage, celery , carrot, onion , potatoes, cheddar cheese and ice cube wrapped in a packet of foil and baked at 350° for 20-30 min with crescentsAmerican chicken and broccoli stir fry and rice. I will pick up some potstickers and egg rolls from the freeze dept as I have coupons and they are on sale this week when I get out of the dentist office (no special trip to store)Steak and potato ( not sure what kind I will fix depends on weather) and saladgrilled chipped chopped ham and cheese sandwich and soup as we will be spending the day at the Amish produce auction and I won't be up to fixing a meal after that.Prime rib roast...veggies unknown at this point. I will probable make hash with the leftovers possible some soup if enough is left for both.We celebrated with my Dad that turned 90. Took him to Bob Evans and which point about at the halfway point of my eating my meal he leaned over and told me I had ate enough and to box up the rest. He didn't forget that the last time we went out to eat I told him instead of being quiet about me eating too much or the wrong thing to tell me, to share his wisdom of being a diabetic for 30 yrs and still only taking 1/2 of a metaformin daily to control it. I was a good day as he walked through his \"memory lane\" while showing me the items he wanted to share the story about in his home.His love of sausage gravy and biscuits continues through down to his great grandkids and most likely will another generation as the great great grandson is starting to reach the stage of being able to eat soft foods.We did a stop by a viewing of a classmate and nephew of a old childhood friend of mine...very sad.Triggered some of the old feelings of when I lost my late husband.Then we can home to thisRight to our driveway,, grass was  a tiny strip on this side, no grass on the other side and it only got worse before it got better.THEN there was a FREEZE... I'm not sure if the peas and spring crops made it yet as we have another cold morning tomorrow before it starting warming back up. I did cover up what I could.We flopped the truck with daughter as she has my car to go get Dad as he can't get in the truck. Cheaper to flop than to rent a car, she did say if we sold her the car she was willing to flop it with us to go get him instead of us buying a car that I won't drive all that much. We will see.We ate from the pantry through the week and then ate out most of the weekend. Got a Philly cheese steak pizza and chef salad that feed us 3 meals over the weekend.I'm not going to crab about it with how the days have been rolling.Lawn is mowed but the trimmer was broke and Hubby couldn't fix it so a friend did. I got it back today.I've been sorting through the farrowing house that has became our storage unit... Took 2 loads already to the thrift shop and have another one loaded to go tomorrow.I made a list of the breads etc that we like and want me to start baking... AND I listed the time that was needed to do so so it's not \"Oh let's have this bread\" and then realise it uses a starter that need began the day before or it's something that takes 4 hrs. I did tell Hubby if it's a 4 hr bread I could start it before I started supper and it would be done before I went to bed. We will see."},

{"title": "The Merry Month of May", "date": "Sunday, April 30, 2017", "text": "I saw this on Pinterest when searching for storage solutions and thought it looked wonderful.May 3rd is my Dad's 90th birthday, we plan to go over on the 5th to celebrate with him. My brother or niece is taking him out on his birthday and the other one is doing it the next day...I got a feeling he is going to have a birthday WEEK. I put on my FaceBook to family and friends to mail him a card or call him and had his neighbor (my soul sister's mom) mentioned she would take him for a ride and sandwich for his birthday. He has been her garden guru for over 30 yrs.We will be meeting with Hubby's parents to buy their old truck. Another trip.ALSO will make 2 trips down to see the kids and drop off stuff might be 3 as 3 of the kids need help with yard work and getting rid of some things.We have a produce auction to go to May 12th and maybe the 26th.My to do list....sigh...Priority. transplant sweet potato slips...then move vacuum to where the slips are sitting, the exercise bike to where the vacuum is setting and my desk and computer tray to where the exercise bike is so I don't have to clean off the dining table of my work every single meal. I also will hang the shelf I bought at a yard sale on the wall at my desk for storage and bring in the file cabinet I also bought at yard sale for my desk area. IF I can I'll move the printer to my desk and use the area the printer sit in for my jacket, boots etc for when I walk out that door to take dogs on perimeter. IF I can get that done things will be easier to maintain.Plant something every day in the gardens or in pots. Weed and harvest and immediately process (I\"m bad about letting it sit in frig or wherever) when needed.Make the weed killer spray, do another round of Neem oil spray, deal with fire ant nests and spray house for regular ants. Will have to check mice baits as Landlord's son told me he found a couple in the grainary which is right across the driveway from the house.Get a better routine for Home Blessing and sewing to include time for push mowing that I will be doing instead of Hubby.Keep laundry caught up and try to use clothesline (without the items getting blew in the garden).Change out the lights to LED bulbs in closets.I need to get the pressure canner checked STILL.Finish great Grandson's afghan...this is doable while I take the webinars of the courses I need for our health ins points , well really at this point I want the points for the Amazon card since I've already got my ins paid forI need to update the yard sale list.TO finish emergency supplies...pillows for us, a blanket for the dogs to lay on .Fresh water!! Double check cook stove and those supplies.Instant coffee would be good as when Hubby is wet and cold (he is with Homeland Security and does HAM radio for them so he knows) he wants hot black coffee.Recheck medical supplies for both us and the dogs. Buy corned beef, corned beef hash, minute rice and cream of chicken soup to finish out the food supplies.Go through the pantry and the butler's pantry for old stuff and what will need to be focused on putting up this season. Since I know we will go 4 months without any income I want to make sure we have a variety and plenty of food with Hubby being home also. We hope to find a new home in the spring and move during warmer weather. We've moved enough and moved the kids enough in winter and nasty cold wet rain of springs and falls to NOT want to do it again.I need to update the grocery list and non food list and check for coupons and sales.I need to keep checking that we are not missing something along the way as we move towards retirement.I want to increase the savings from 20 % (still have 2 loans we pay on) to 30%. I'm not sure we can do that every month until he retires but I would like to try for it.Blessed Be each and everyone of you.Miss Kira( about 100 yrs old doggy years) on the left and Rascal (a bit over 28 yrs in dogs years) on the right have had me up all night several times this month with the storms and winds that have went through.She doesn't like her picture taken and usually does a better job of moving before I click my camera. I've learned if I want ANY sleep to sleep on the floor in the front room. She doesn't want us in the bedroom since that's the wall that takes the hit from the winds during storms. AND she wants me on the floor where both of them can lay next to me instead of the couch where one of them is going to end up still on the floor. I have taken to laying the cushions for the lawn chairs on the floor and top with thick blankets for my bedroll.One of landlord's sons rolled our yard for free since we help with the cattle without pay that they keep in the barn behind us. The other one brought a couple piglets in and I mentioned I wished he had said something and I would have had him bring me in one also. He mentioned cost and I mentioned I pay for the electric to run the pump for the water the cattle drink...he was shocked...he thought the water pump was on the barn meter he pays LOL.I doubt if he will bring me a piglet though.We lost our internet and home phone service for almost 2 weeks( phone company gave us credit) and the cells stopped working right for a couple days during the same time.I went in the ER (Crohns) and then spent a week pretty much down on the couch.Add in doctor appts, lab work, house hunting for when Hubby retires, Produce auction (nothing we wanted) community yard sale in the pouring rain(prices were slashed half off the first day with the rain that was coming in all weekend) and Hubby going to the retirement meeting to start the process of retiring out. AND a load to the thrift shop as I sort through what we want from what we kept in case we or one of the kids needed.I also took my car to my youngest to use while she tries to find a car she can afford as the one she was suppose to buy needed more work than the seller had mentioned. Probably because she's female thinking she didn't know what a timing chain was and knew what it meant to replace it.We had a nice Passover and Easter (ham was 99¢/lb).We combined errands with chiro,doc appts and lab work. We even combined looking at houses while going over to the produce auction and coming back and when we took my car to the daughter and when we saw our parents (2 trips).We used Wagner pts,Kroger pts and Speedway fuel card to keep the gas cost down while searching for lowest gas using GasbuddyI used my garage sale list for the yard sales I went to and didn't buy the \"pretties\" that I would have.We had a freeze come through again and luckily I saw the forecast for it to be around 40° and left the straw on so we didn't lose anything. We might have lost the strawberries as Hubby put too much straw and too tight on them. I have them uncovered so we will just have to wait and see. The other box is fine and I found some on sale to fill in on sale. I have now removed the straw and put it in the north garden between the straw bale garden on the foot path part.We ate out with friends and used 50% off coupon for the whole table.I picked flowers several times for the house.Spring flowers are pretty much over and my lavender is just starting to bloom.Hubby and I have done some activities that earns us points for our ins.. his ins for next yr is FREE and mine as his spouse is $1.50 a week. (yes we know we are lucky) PLUS his company gave us each $50 Amazon card ...when we max out our pts ( probably in a month) we each will get $100 Amazon cardI cashed in my points from Swagbucks and Pinecone research.I used coupons and mailed in rebates for things we bought this month.We have been graphing my sugar and when I was in the office for follow up from the ER Doc moved my lab work and appt up since my sugar is rebounding and I have proof of it... goes low and then immediately goes high again. He is thinking more of Crohn's instead of the steroids...not what I wanted to hear.BUT at this point it's hard for him to tell since I am on steroids AGAIN for the Crohn's attack I had.IF my A1C is above 6.0 a second time,our ins will pay for test strips for me.If it's down I won't have to test any more.I did the wash in tap water cold,short wash, double spin(cheaper to spin on 110 than dry longer on 220)I used the clothesline...and ended up rewashing the same load 3 times when the wind kept blowing it off even with more pins on each item thankfully the straw bale garden caught them and I didn't have to chase it to the neighbors 1/2 mile away .... so I used the drying rack and sensor on the dryer to dry the clothes. Electric bill dropped $15 this month.Even with using the same amt of electric as last yr. Our landlord checks for lowest prices all the time for electric and propane.I changed the pattern of the afghan I am making my great grandson so I wouldn't have to buy more yarn.Miss Kira still goes on the shock collar when the wind is blowing, rain or storms. Hubby let her out the other day without it while I was at the doctor's office and the landlord's son called me to let me know she was at his parents house  and looking to head beyond that (their property is at the end of the range of our shocker)and I let him know Hubby was home but had no truck to go get her. Texted Hubby and he realized he had let her out without the collar so he couldn't even shock her to get her to stop and come back so he texted the landlord's son who went out and yelled at her to GO HOME and slapped his hands together so she pranced her way across the hay field and got met by one ticked off Daddy I am not sure who he was ticked off more at her for not staying in the perimeter or him for forgetting to put the collar on her. LOLI've kept used coffee grounds for the tomato plants I will be putting in with in the next couple weeks.I've saved my change, $1 and $5s for our savings.I didn't use all the grocery money this month and even with eating out more than we planned I had money left in that acct also so we put it together with some money we got refunded (over paid bill that ins finally paid) and bought a new...brand new push...excuse me...walk behind self propelled electric start lawnmower that mulches, bags or does normal mowing.It's a Toro with a 5 yr warranty. It's also what the guy that routinely fixes our mowers told me to get and it was on sale and he used his discount on top of the sale since his brother owns the store LOL. I used it today and it was great.We will still have to weed eat around things but not like we have and I won't have so much grass blown into my sq ft gardens.We checked out Hubby's dad's old truck that he was going to put up for sale and decided we would buy it, It's a small truck, not full size like we have,so the gas mileage will be better plus Hubby can drive it back and forth to work when he doesn't take the bike or I can drive it instead of my Ford SUV that eats gas also. Our ins guy looked over our policy and thinks it will costs about $20 more after he adjust the other truck as pleasure and takes full coverage off the ford. Hubby's dad took it in to get a full check up and do some repairs and maintenance on it. We will still have our mechanic check it out before we drive it too much.I can guess it's going to need tires as no one can remember when the tires were replaced.Blessed Be"},

Those will be ordered this month.Filter for my vacuum. Hubby uses the air compressor to clean this out for me every other week but it only helps so long. I have a very small vacuum that is bagless. I love it ...I would get another in a heart beat It is a Dirt Devil dynamite plus.Whink rust remover as it is the only thing that will remove the rust in the bathroom even with cleaning it daily we still get rust. Have a whole house filter and softener...pipes need replaced but it's not ours so we can't do that.As long as the water is running the landlord won't do it, not even for his own home because his wife complains of the same thing. LOL. She told me what to use. Odor is very light.Ant traps, as the ant season has started Amish produce auction will start April 21st. I will be able to get my spring plants there for the garden. Looking at possible cauliflower, broccoli, cabbages... not sure of what else until we get there and what the prices are going for.Testing strips for my sugar tester. I know my sugar tester runs about 2 points above what the hospital testing does. With generic test strips it runs 15 points above so I will suck up the price for the brand name test strips. My ins has to have 2 A1C over 6. (6.5 is diabetes I'm at 6.4) before they will pay for the test strips... I found them at Amazon for 1/4th what I would pay at the drug store and 1/2 of what I would pay at Walmart.Groceries....Anything I need for Passover. As I am restricted on certain items that I know send my sugar up I will have to rework my menu for that week and the Seder meal.Ham for Easter (Hubby and I are of different faiths)Asparagus as it's in season and I don't grow it.Milk (if I run out of yogurt I will need more milk)cottage cheesebell peppersApples.thin bagelsEnglish Muffins (coupon for this at local store half off)sausage patties (4 oz patties , coupon for this at local store 1/3 off)frozen hash browns (coupon at local store 1/2 off)orange juice (coupon at local store 1/2 off)hash brown pattiesCarnation High Protein essential drink. I get powdered vanilla. I can drink it and it not send my sugar too far up. I can make it and put it in my small thermos if I am on the go and need to carry a \"meal\" with me. I can't get granola/bfast bars due to my Crohns)Have a blessed Week"},
{"title": "April Goals...Frugal plans", "date": "Sunday, April 2, 2017", "text": "This used to be my Mom's and Pop's (stepdad). It's what they used to save money for Christmas to all the grandkids and great grandkids.They did cash  or wrote a check.Since we have went to cash for groceries, dogs needs, eating out(the only entertainment we do) and other odds and ends. I've actually had change and have filled this up a couple times.We have been doing \"some\" frugal things. Then Hubby decided he was retiring in Jan 2019, 2 yrs sooner than we had planned. I'm not going to tell him he can't for any reason, he works a very hard and active job and he is the oldest in the dept and has over 30 yrs at the plant.. He doesn't want to change jobs at the plant or shifts. Fine with me and it really is fine. We have a 401k and pension.BUT I would like to \"make up\" what isn't going to be earned those 2 yrs as much as possible BEFORE he does retire out on the cash reserves part.I went over to frugalwoods blog and started rereading.Went back over our health ins and the budget. We need to decide where we will take the hit when he retires if we don't make up the missing reserves.We decided to eat from the pantry for the month of April with only a few things to buy.We made a list in Dec of what we wanted to get done this year by mid Aug.I need to work harder at getting it done in the that time frame with the weather getting warmer.I want to have the gardens ready to plant by next weekend.I want to finish changing the closet lights to LED light bulbs.I am scheduling sewing time.I am having sugar issues, borderlining  diabetes so I need to see what my ins will pay if I have to continuing to test.Yard sales will be starting and I am going to make a list of what I am looking for this week.Amish produce auctions start this month and I have a limit of amount I am going to spend.We probably will keep updating this list."},
{"title": "End of March frugal", "date": "Monday, March 27, 2017", "text": "Sunshine peeking through is pretty much how it's been this week.A lot of money was spent this week, still I would say it's a frugal week.We ordered 2 beds from Amazon for our daughter who was going to go to a rental place. NO, pay us the payments and we will order them. She saved over $1000....which means we saved also as I know \"dead season\" at her work place is coming and she wouldn't be able to make the payment and still make the bills and we would have stepped in and helped. This way they will be paid OFF before dead season hits as she is paying us the payments instead. For those wondering...dead season is when a restaurant etc type place goes from good flow of customers to almost nothing or none at all due to seasons, right now we are getting warmer so people will be cooking out or might order pizza.Upscale restaurant  usually loses business. Kind of like construction in Ohio comes to a trickle during winter months.I got new shorts...usually that means I bought shorts at yard sale, thrift shop or got hand me downs from one of the grandsons. I actually bought NEW shorts. Found them at Sam's club a style I like and I know I will wear these for years. I am still wearing the shorts I bought in 2005...fabric is starting to give.SO I figure if I wear these 12 yrs (that puts me at 70 and yes at 70 I would still be okay wearing these) I figure that's $1 a year.While at Sam's club I also got sugar, flour, vinegar, honey mustard, coffee for me ( I drink med, Hubby drinks tar LOL) dogs dental treats which our vet thought was doing good for our dogs. Also got It. dressing, toilet paper, freezer bags(stocking for when the garden starts coming) diapers and wipes for the great grandson, carrots, baby carrots, apples and baking potatoes as I will be eating them for my lunches.Hershey candy bars as Hubby eats them with peanut butter before he goes to work...my dinner at 5 is his bfast... he doesn't get another meal until 4 am so he eats a candybar with peanut butter before work and an apple with peanut butter at first break at 2. Cookie butter...had no clue to what this was but had 1/2 dozen kids ask me for something that had it in it. Since I didn't want to special order the cookies that it's made with I bought this. Hope they like what they asked for when I get make it.We got binoculars at Gander Mt. The old set is over 2 decades old and no longer has clear vision and it helps to see if the coyotes are running the woods that are about 1/2 mile from us before I let my dogs out.Hubby can use them when weather spotting also.I got yarn on sale at Hobby Lobby. Hopefully this is all I need to finish my great grandson's  afghan. I thought I would need 5 but they only had 4 left.We ate out, hit lunch time at one place and early dinner for the other. Ate cheap for eating out.I mended a couple shirts.We ate the majority from the pantry and stayed out of the grocery stores. I still need anchovies and sesame oil but won't go for just that.I did grab milk today at the local small store.We got gas using points from a local grocery.We combine errands with doc appts or when Hubby has meetings for HAM radioI got the electric down by $25.I got my car in the shop due to a problem with moving my seat and asked for the car to be checked out since I was going to lend it to my daughter. Good thing because it had a bad wire that could have caught fire. Now that is fixed and it runs better so better gas mileage...but he is still working on the seat LOL.I have started buying the Christmas gifts when I see them on sale.I have found if I add a 2nd spin on the new washer I  can cut dryer time down by 30 min on heavy loads. I use the sensor in the dryer.My ins requested a A1C as part of my \"points\" to lower the cost of next year's ins for us...not something my doctor usually runs when fasting sugar is below 100... good thing the ins did because my A1C says I am borderline diabetic. I am now testing at home and monitoring it along with lifestyle changes as diabetes runs strong in the family. It's a bit weary to have to test one and two hours after I eat and not be able to drink anything except water ( I drink 72 oz of water a day now) I am a coffee drinker with real milk and real sugar but I can go black and I drink tea unsweetened.Hope you had a frugal week and feel good about your choices you made."},
{"title": "Frugal week with back procedure", "date": "Sunday, March 19, 2017", "text": "My grandson's mother in law to be suggested my snowman after I sent everyone a picture of my pots garden.On Friday I had my back procedure, drove 2 hrs in snow, snow pellets, sleet, freezing rain and then rain...I don't think OHIO knows what season it is....my doctor had already given me my restrictions for the next 2 weeks before the procedure that I am to OBEY until the follow up appt. So we prepared for me to be down...It's not bad procedure, injections etc... I just am more limited than most because the injections flare up my cerebral palsy.We planned to eat at Golden Corral afterwards and was able to eat at lunch time so it was less than we had planned for. I put corned beef (bought on sale and froze), potatoes, carrots and cabbage in the crock pot for dinner that night which we were both thankful because Hubby wasn't really up to cooking since he hadn't slept that day and I was having problems walking.I fixed the rest of the meals from the pantry.I am hoping the weather forecast tonight is good so I can uncover my perennials this week and not continue to have a garden of pots.We got haircuts while on sale and I noted on the calendar the next time they have their sale scheduled.My son went to a coffee house and the one worker told him to rinse his paper coffee filter before putting the grounds in and he would be able to use less grounds. I tried it and have been able to cut about 1/4th to 1/3 rd of grounds in ours.I combined sales and coupons to order the seeds I need to fall planting in late July/Aug.I juiced some limes that were starting to get old and froze the juice. I zested them first.Hubby moved our new washer in, I moved my wringer over to the side for now. I timed the first load that was for the longest wash cycle there is. About the same as what I do in the wringer washer but it took 1/2 the time in the dryer so the electric bill will be coming down. Plus I can toss a load in more often and use the drying rack for smaller loads which wasn't convenient to do with the wringer washer.Did the usual of curtains open and closed, lights and power strips off,washing foil and plastic bags.Hubby darned a couple of his socks. One of the things his grandmother insisted he learn from her.My daughter's  been waiting to get moved into her new place. Her and the kids have stayed with friend as the landlord found busted water pipes and an issue with the furnace that stopped her from moving in. Her stuff is there though. He gutted the pipes and replaced them, fixed the toilet that he found wasn't working right after he fixed the pipes and is now replacing a couple parts on the furnace and making sure there is no carbon issues with it before letting her actually live there.Gave her money off next month rent. So we went to the store and got 2 lbs of spag, 2 jars of sauce, 2 loaves of garlic bread, and 3 lbs of hamburger saving over $16 on the total for the family that is keeping them until she can live in the new place. I also got 2 dozen of eggs at 69¢ a dozen, 3lbs of hamburger for $1.29/lb, tuna for 50¢ a can and bread for 59¢ a loaf along with rolls and some cin. bread and muffins that was marked down 50%. We had the muffins and cin. bread for snacks over the weekend and the rolls stuffed with meatballs pizza style (FB recipe) for dinner last night.We paid on our loans that are against our life ins policies (taken out when Hubby went to 3 days a week working for 2 yrs , thankful his company kept him working those 3 days so we had health ins. and I was out of work). I have been paying more on his as his interest rate is higher than mine.It's the last 2 bills we had from those 2 yrs.I finished inputting my coke caps and donated that money to USO. I am waiting to see what Coke does next for rewards.We are planning to plant more in the gardens but not overwhelm me, which triggers back issues, with the upkeep. I would like an asparagus bed that is raised so that's in the plans also.I have enjoyed the weather we had yesterday, since I was able to walk decent I took the dogs around the perimeter(carried cell phone in case I needed help since Hubby was in house studying for his EMT renewal test). Wasn't sunny but was high 40s so wasn't bad when there wasn't much wind.What did you do?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "3.12.2017 Frugal and gardens", "date": "Sunday, March 12, 2017", "text": "I really wished I was in the gardens because I was planting. Instead I have spent the time covering up plants that had come up due to another winter storm coming this week after our spring like weather.I am actually going to use the aerator spike instead of buying a broadfork for the little space I want to use it in.I might use it to plant to popcorn...we will have to see if that will work.I used straw from the north garden to cover the garlic, fall onions, strawberries and herbs in the south gardens.I used old flower pots to cover the perennial flowers that are up by turning them upside down and making sure no holes in the bottoms would allow snow through.I flipped my son's car back to him when we were already in the area( an hr away) helping move our daughter. Did his taxes and got lunch at his home that we split the price of a pizza and he used his discount.Saved gas and food money.I didn't go to store, Hubby did get milk this morning at the gas station because I forgot to stop yesterday on the way home. Got it for $1.99... decent price for a gas station.I turned the humidifier off even during the week and opened up the house.Did the usual of washing plastic bags, foil etc and reusing. Went through the plastic containers for storage.Open curtains for daylight and close them when getting dark except the day the wind was blowing with gusts up to 60 mph , then I left them shut to help keep the house warm.Shared what I have in the pantry storage with daughter that moved to help her get her pantry back up. She just found a new job and a bigger place. She was proud of me that I didn't go BUY her groceries.We did go out to dinner with friends at the local spot that had fish special so it was a little cheaper than normally it would have been.We combined errands and appts to keep the trips to town down.I turned off the power strip to my coffee maker and the one to my computer.I used the leftovers to make different meals.I saved all the five dollar bills and ones that made $5 from Feb to now  to put in my savings acct. Side benefit of paying cash for the groceries and eating out.I mended a pair of pants and a shirt.It doesn't seem like much LOL"},
{"title": "Frugal  note", "date": "Monday, March 6, 2017", "text": "Eat the food not pitch it in the trash after it's buried in the back of the frig behind the butter and other stuff...SIGH.I cleaned out the frigs...we have decided to focus on eating REAL food and not preservatives as much.  We are already close to 80 % REAL and thought to try to go to 90 %.So I made a menu of 30 fresh salads with REAL food and dressings and then the grocery list... and then decided to check to see what else I needed.... mudroom frig is usually my stable stock up like butters and lard and such ... yogurt and sour cream got shoved behind it and then covered with the butter... WASTE of yogurt and sour cream and now realize I don't have as much butter as I thought.That isn't FRUGAL.I did some mending.I put my coffee maker on a power strip ( garage power strip). I remember to shut it off but not unplug the coffee maker.My son uses our mechanic and needed maintenance and tires so while I was done in his area(an hr away) at a doctor appt I flipped cars with him. I'm hoping it works out to flip again when I am down closer to him at our youngest's house. Saves both of us gas money.Got groceries,between sales and coupons saved 37%.We are combining errands to keep fuel costs down along with wear and tear costs.I used the drying rack for 4 loads of laundry I bought a pizza and tossed salad the other night while coming home from doctor office that is 2 hrs away. Got home at 7 and Hubby had to leave for work at 8:30... the pizza made 3 meals with the salad making 2 .Not the best choice but Hubby didn't wake up until I called him I was on my way home so the roast didn't get started.I would say goals but I have already done the shopping for March.I will have to pick up milk, and a stick of pepperoni. It comes from Italy and our local IGA sells it.I slice it on my meat slicer and bag it in sandwich bags in the amts I use on our pizza. Then I put in it freezer bag and toss in freezer. The end pieces I dice for other meals, freeze it on a cookie sheet then bag and put back in freezer.I spent $337. and saved 37%. The budget is set at $180/month I had about $75 left for Jan and Feb each.The produce should last 4-6 wks. The meat will stretch out what we have in the freezers. I'm $7 over budget. I wouldn't have spent it if I didn't have money set back to cover the rest of this month with the acknowledgement that I have to cut back the next 2 months to make up for it. That should be easy come May with the spring garden coming in.Both of us are wanting spring to come in so I can plant salad stuff and sugar peas. Right now it's mid 50s until Sat then its back down to freezing until the middle of the following week. If I can between the rain storms I'll cover a few spots to try to have it warm enough after this next cold spell.Aldiscorned beef tip (not flat brisket which is bigger) on sale for $1.99. They are small but for the two of us we don't need big. I have one out for tonight to make rubens with.fresh whole chicken for 89¢lb, can't remember when we had a whole roasting chicken (weighs over 8lbs) instead of turkey.potatoes, small potatoes,cabbage(several heads that are now in root cellar) apples, pears, lemons,limes,Romaine lettuce, flat leaf spinach,celery,bell peppers,grape tomatoes,bananas, mangos,cucumbers,kiwi, mushrooms,brussels sprouts,stuffed olives, jar of artichokes,dried figs and dried apricots,IGAFresh chicken breast $1.49lbcube steak that was marked down a 1/3rd of pricetomato soup for 75¢/can (my comfort food when I am sick)sugar snap peasbaby mix spring lettucedark rye breadRazzleberry pie (Hubby's favorite)water chestnuts that was half price so the pantry is now restocked on that.Krogerstoothpaste, on sale and had $1 couponstrawberries 4 lb for $5.

{"title": "Being Frugal during weather whiplash", "date": "Monday, February 27, 2017", "text": "From mid 50s to mid 60s  on some days and down to 20s and 30s on others. Even with my fall garlic and onions covered up they are going to take the hit with their greens up.We tried covering them up with blankets but the winds were over 40 mph with gust higher at times. Pollen went up and took my allergies right with it. They are saying that this year will be a bad year for allergies so I picked up more distilled water for my sinus rinses and got 11% rebate on it. Turned the furnace off a couple times but had to turn the space heater on when the winds got and the furnace couldn't keep the heat up.Filed our taxes with Credit Karma for free. We have to file a 1040 and usually that's a pretty penny.Saved 20¢ a gal off gas buy using GasBuddy to find the cheapest and then it happened to be a Speedway so Hubby used his card for an additional 3¢.Used the Kroger points from our shopping in Jan. Got 60¢ off per gal of gas. Won't get any off gas in March as I didn't shop at Krogers in Feb. Just didn't have any sales that was that good.Hubby had a meeting that was going to run late so he he called me and told me to not fix dinnger good thing he had coupons with him for Wendy's and bought that for us to eat instead of my cooking dinner after he got home. Good thing because I would have only cooked for him (and for his lunch) as I wouldn't have had dinner done until 7. Very late for me to eat and take meds. IF we had knew it was going to run late I would have fixed soup or something that I could have ate and he could have when he got home.Used my Subway card to get subs. I had enough points to pay for one and the other one was $6 on sale.I cooked and dehydrated pumpkins...still have several to do. I turn the dried pumpkin into powder. We won't need pumpkin for about 2 yrs. I might get some wee be littles or jack be littles, some use them for decorations but they are about the right size for baking for a veg for one person.I dehydrated a batch of the fall apples. Have one more batch of them to do . Starting to get mushy to eat but fine for dehydrating.I took the scraps from the pumpkins and apples out to the field to compost as my composter isn't working as it should.Figured out we save $86.50 by going after the washer instead of paying of it to be delivered. We figured milage not just gas.Washed and dried food freezer bags, bread bags and dry food liner bags.Saved more distilled water jugs for mini hot houses and the boxes the jugs(we buy it by the case as it's cheaper that way) for boards for my fabric.Cleared sq ft gardens and added the dirt we already had. I have one more place to clear then I can start filling the pots that I have to plant it.Got 4 reusable bags at home show to replace worn out ones. Using worn out ones to put donations in.Found a great article in Real Simple Magazine( $2 for a year subs.) about HSA which is what our ins is changing to next year.Started walking perimeter (1/3 mile) and stretching to adjust to using the clothes line and planting the garden BEFORE I actually start doing that so I don't end up in the doctor's office again this year.Transferred my balance at Pinecone Research to my savings. I do that once a month. The same with my Swagbucks.We were going to go visit my in law's but it was nice out and they wanted to meet us at a restaurant that was mid way to us so they could get out of the house. We used our tax refund to pay them the loan they had lent us. I used the last of the eat out budget and part of what was left of the grocery budget to pay their dinner so all it cost them was their gas.They are retired now and live on a very strict budget.They weren't planning to retire so soon but their companies sold out and that was the best to do.We did end up eating out 4 times this month even with the pantry challenge. IF we hadn't bought mu in laws meal we would have still been under budget ...even so I still have money left in the grocery budget so we are still in budget. Leftover money was set aside to stock up this fall.I had blood work and found my A1C had went from 5.2 to 6.4 (diabetes is 6.5) in 6 months. Doc thinks it's the steroids that the GI has had me on. SO I am being weaned off them (doesn't make GI happy , she understood though I haven't spent a lifetime doing what I can to NOT be a diabetic , runs strong in both sides of my family to go into it with meds that I don't have to take) as she was wanting me to take them for a year. The company that makes the steroid I am on said it would only work 3 months for my condition and then THEY suggest you come off...a year is for severe Crohn's. My VSL #3 seems to be doing the best for me which is not paid for by ins because my GI will not fill out the paperwork for that. She refused to fill out intermittent family leave for hubby so his company worked it out with the company that deals with that stuff so my primary could fill it out. She did say he needed it , she just doesn't do that unless you are being operated on.I would change doctors again but the others I have interviewed are worse about taking steroids and all said they wouldn't agree to me taking VSL #3 as it's not tradition meds.I will add my GI has my primary run all the blood work as she feels I don't need stuck twice and have 2 bills and I sure don't need to drive to her office to get blood work as she's not connected to the hospital here.We decided to eat from the pantry in March.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Frugal week, quick meals and a sign of spring to come", "date": "Monday, February 20, 2017", "text": "I mended two items.We found an automatic washer close to what my son uses that I do like. It's a little bigger than his so my comforter will fit so no more laundromat ($360 savings/yr) and the washer was on sale so one and half years of NOT going to laundromat will pay for the washer. Top with the fact it will wring out the clothes more than my wringer washer does so the dryer won't run as long. I will still  use the drying rack and clothes line just like always. The washer comes in on Thursday and we decided to pick it up ourselves to not pay the fee for delivery.We tightened the clothesline as it's a decent couple of days and I should be able to use it somewhat with doing laundry this week.I cut some boxes up to use to wrap extra fabric around when I finish putting my sewing room together. Which will not be this week since it's nice I will be outside in the gardens.We went out to eat for our anniversary to our favorite steakhouse. Went during the afternoon to pay the cheaper prices, brought home enough leftovers for 2 meals as neither of us eat that much any more.We went to a home show to see what is happening in that end, getting ideas for when we build and some ideas to pass to our son as he is looking at doing some changes in the home he bought a couple years ago. We ate brunch at Big Boy's using a coupon we still had so didn't need to eat any lunch. We finished some odds and ends in the frig for our dinner and went for ice cream for our dessert for our anniversary.Checked the gardens to see what work was needed done before we started planting and make sure I have all the supplies I need for that.Meal wise...Quick and simple and cheap..Pulled meatloaf from freezer(I always bake a second one and cool overnight and slice and package for freezer) and leftover mashed potatoes I had froze and leftover corn, Cherry pie filling in shortcakes for dessert (10 min total time, basic plate and nuke while putting cherry pie filling on shortcakes)Pulled precooked hamburger from freezer and homemade pasta sauce from pantry for pasta, made cheese and garlic biscuits using Bisquick. Tossed what was left of the roasted winter sq in the sauce. (prep time...5 min, cook time 15 min, not including oven warming up...took less time to cook pasta that( I started with hot water and in a skillet to cut time on cooking pasta ) than it did to deal with the biscuits. Next time I will preheat oven before getting pasta around.Pulled precooked bulk sausage, tossed with potatoes (boiled with skin on, cooled overnight and then skinned and diced) in frying pan and mixed in a couple beaten eggs. Served with toast and combination of leftover fruit.Made soup from odds and ends and ham brothtonight I am using leftovers from steakhouse to make philly steak pizza, pizza crust was from Tightwad gazette and takes about 10 min, I'll prebaked it while nuking the bell peppers,onions and mushrooms I will be adding to the leftover steak I cut up. Prep time 15 min, cook time 20 (I make 2 pizzas) Tropical fruit blend with kiwi added for the dessert. I have a late doctor appt today.I plan on to eat from the frig freezers this week to clear those out.My spring flowers, pretty sure they are my tulips LOL... even though I KNOW winter will be hitting again in a couple of days, it made me smile to see the beginning of spring."},

Hubby doesn't do that sort of thing.I'll be lucky if Hubby remembers what today is when he comes in from work. I bought these for myself last year. Didn't spend the money this year.Decided I wanted hand towels and cloths for the bathroom more than flowers. I prefer to change towels and cloths daily and hadn't replaced the ones that wore out last year...we both have been sicker this year and I think that is part of the issue since I only do laundry once a week. With a wringer washer it's not toss it in and walk away.I did my mid month goal check this morning... we have eaten out 2 times with 3 as the limit I wanted. Last night was a last minute eat out...I went to a doctor appt and it ended up with the doctor removing a spot that was cancer off my nose that hadn't been planned but he didn't feel I should drive another two hours (round trip ) for a 2 min procedure as it wasn't deep. On the negative side I drove myself and I wear glasses right where the spot is/was and it hurt like all get out with the my glasses and I ended up with a migraine by time I got home. I used grocery money to pay for the eating out.SO where am I at.Dogs budget is good, nothing has came out of their budget.I know dog food will come out this week since Menard's has their 11% rebate going on.Our grocery budget is doing really good even with the Taco Bell run last night we have only spend $50. I got milk for $1.58 for a gallon and lg eggs for 59¢ a dozen and portibella mushrooms for 79¢ a lb this week. No limit on the eggs (I got 10 dozen) but was on the mushrooms.We have ate from the pantry. I baked the last ham that was in the freezer. I have ham broth to can today and ham fat to strain and freeze today also along with apples, oranges, pumpkins and all else that needs to be dealt with that was in winter storage that will be getting icky with the coming of Spring. I made note of what we didn't use to compare to what we stored so I don't get as much this coming year.We are doing the programs for our health ins. Have met the min requirement already and are working towards the next level. There are 3 levels and each level helps lower the cost of what we pay next year.I still haven't finished the cookies and candy for the kids...SIGH.I have been getting 50,000 steps a week even without walking the perimeter daily. Weather has either been too cold which makes me hurt or too wet with walking in mud as the perimeter isn't very grassy.I haven't been doing my yoga but have been doing the stretches and PT my therapist told me to do at home.I missed 2 days of shining my sink (not back to back)but caught them up the next day. I missed 2 days of decluttering but since I am down to 94 places to declutter for the year I am not too worried about that.I started my great grandson's afghan yesterday at the doctor's office.One on the sweet potato's that I started for slips isn't doing anything so I tossed it this morning and will start another one this afternoonThe mudroom frig freezer that I am working on emptying got filled back up with leftovers. I think I am going to have a eat from the freezer week next week to bring it back down. I do know we have several ice packs that I am probably going to get rid of a few. I need to make veggie broth also, that will clear out a pretty good spot as I keep that veggies peelings in the freezer.I rolled my coins and put that in my savings this week. We put Hubby's attendance bonus in one week and his overtime in last week. I have the fives I've been saving for this week. We are trying to put something extra each week in the savings.I am still struggling with my Home Blessing routine. I've got the shine the windows,shine the sink and take out the trash down. Dusting, swish and swipe , sweeping,vacuuming and mopping is still not regular...well the swish isn't daily but it's often enough because we have rusty water and it leaves a nasty ring in the toilet if you don't clean if often enough LOL.How are you doing ?"},

{"title": "Frugal week and not shopping", "date": "Sunday, February 12, 2017", "text": "These paperwhites have brought more pleasure than we thought they would especially on today watching the sun shine down on them.I planted them in dirt because I plan to transplant them and hopefully have them again next year.We have kept bread sacks to reuse.We have kept the inserts out of cold cereal boxes/baking mix boxes etc to reuse as wax paper.We kept what few plastic grocery bags we get (we use reusable mostly except for meat) to line the small trash cans in the house.I made a different laundry soap and only made a little of it as I am not sure if it's going to clean as well. If it doesn't I can always use to to wash dishes with or scrub the floors or something. I won't throw it out for sure.I double wrung our laundry here is our washer so you understand what I mean by wrung out .LOLBy doing that it cuts drying time in the dryer by 30 min. I hung some things on hangers after they were dried some in the dryer to finish drying, others went directly to the drying rack. I look forward to warm dry weather so I can use our clothes line.I have been focusing on using my right hand to turn water on at the sinks..why? because I usually use my left and that means I am turning on the hot even when I don't need hot and that runs up the electric bill.I've checked daily for frugal ideas at The Prudent Homemakers site. Picked the wisdom of Brandy and all that post on her site. 😊We ate from the pantry even though there was a couple times we had \"snacky\" foods for meals because of what was going on...like when the furnace went on the blink and I spent most of the day curled in blankets trying to stay warm while the repairman (landlord's nephew) worked on it. We do have a couple space heaters that do an okay job but it was a very windy and cold day so they were struggling to keep the house warm. Even the dogs were curled up with me...or the blankets I should say. At least that isn't a bill I will get. BUT the regular maintenance bill I would get as the landlord doesn't fix what isn't broke. Nephew shows us how to do the regular maintenance so we wouldn't need to  pay someone else (his company only does repairs to what they install) to come do it.We didn't go to the store to get the buy 2 get 3 free... even though I am craving beef and could have go 2 lbs of ground beef (and 3 lbs of ground sausage for free) I had to really look at the freezers and ask if I wanted to fill them back up....NOPE. I did find 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef in the freezer that is suppose to be fruits and veggies and was able to mix it with a 1lb of ground pork and make Swedish meatballs for last night's supper. SO this week I spent $0 on food.This week is really busy for me. I have 2 doctor's appts possible 3 as the 3rd one is for filling out family leave papers for Hubby employer. I have 4 webinars to watch for our health ins. I am still spring/deep cleaning and have started planning/organizing seeds etc for this year's gardens.PLUS Saturday is our anniversary and we have chosen to go to the home show which is an hour from us but is in the area we are thinking of moving to when Hubby retires (some year LOL).Price of tickets is less than the local movie which Hubby wouldn't go to anyways.Today I roasted butternut squash, delicata squash, sweet potatoes and acorn squash and diced them to add to meals through the week. I will also prep carrots,celery, onion, mushrooms and whatever else I find in frig as I prepare dinner tonight.Tentative meal plan for this weekBfast: oatmeal,  whatever dried fruit we want mixed in ,cream of wheat, home made egg Mcmuffin using leftover ham instead of Canadian bacon, muffins, French toast(in freezer) and eggs.Lunch for me  is whatever is leftover or grilled cheese sandwich, Naan bread veggie pizza or crackers, cheese and fruit or cottage cheese and beets. Hubby's lunch is whatever we have leftover from dinner.Sweets: Eggnog refrig pie, oatmeal and dried fruit bars, cookies (that I need to make for the kids anyways). Jello with fruit, orange jello with shredded carrot(Sunshine jello)Dinner: spaghetti squash with leftover Swedish meatballs with pasta sauce and cheddar garlic biscuits/ lasagna noodle with mashed potatoes (Facebook recipe) with salad/ hash with root veggies/ mushroom sloppy joes (instead of tomato base sloppy joes it's made with cream of mushroom soup) either as sandwiches or over noodles to make poor man's stroganoff depending on what breads I bake this week/ big egg or casserole to finish off whatever needs ate up. Saturday we plan on eating out.May you find beauty in your day"},
{"title": "Frugal refresher course instructor ", "date": "Monday, February 6, 2017", "text": "Okay it's my Dad. He will be 90 in May and when I go visit I always pick his brain for wisdom. He has \"slight\" dementia, actually, he thinks his memory is bad because he can't remember sometimes what he was looking for...We do that most days.BUT when it comes to being frugal...there is NO memory problems what so ever  LOL.I told him I had ate from the pantry all week, even made calzones. He asked if I baked my own breads...nope as we bought a lot of bread on sale for cheaper than I can make it and then I got the lecture about preservatives preserving my digestion system.We talked about drinking water between drinking anything else and between bites of food (helps digestive system and him swallow, swallowing can be an issue as we age).We talked about shopping at Aldi's (he gives a list to my niece that does all that type of thing for him as she's there and I'm not) Said his grocery budget went down by $25 a week because she buys nothing that isn't on the list. Even with him paying her, he is saving money so he thinks the clicklist at Kroger's is a good idea, better one if Aldi's was doing it.He( and my niece) has noticed that prices are higher at the beginning of the month and cheaper with more sales at the end of the month. So she does his non food and other items he gets from Walmart at the end of the month. We talked about what I had on my basic grocery list which he removed half  off the list. Said ...I would enjoy my food MORE if I ate in season for fresh produce...except for the mushrooms, he left the mushrooms on the list.Carrots, celery, onions, white potatoes and sweet potatoes(only through late fall and winter for the sweet potatoes) and bananas and apples for the fruit. OH and the mushrooms. Right now cabbage is on his list.He might suck that one up as it's the base of the soup he makes every other week. Then he started about gardening. Not surprising as it's Feb.We talked of planting early potatoes, mid-season potatoes and late potatoes. Late potatoes you can keep some back to replant. Early and mid-season not so much. We talked of heirloom seeds and what he would buy that wasn't heirloom.He still remembers helping his Dad gathering the tomato seeds from the bottom of the bucket for planting the next year. Growing transplants WITHOUT electric.Starting the work in the gardens in early March as early potatoes, onions and turnips were going in Ides of March. Mid-season potatoes was 2 wks later and late season was mid-April.Granddad always was looking for any place he could put a spade in and turn the ground over to plant food.I told him I bought the seeds for the next 2 yrs out of the money I saved from eating from the pantry. He said that's how it should be, anything to do with food including what I use to preserve it should come from the grocery budget. If I'm not growing enough (or buying it cheap enough like at the Amish produce sale) then I need to go without it. I told him I planned to do a covered garden for this coming winter. He said if he wasn't alive then he would be looking down watching me,probably wondering why I wanted to eat greens.I have been getting those statements for over 20 yrs..I decided to not go to the store for perishables, got the milk at Menards when we were getting distilled water for the humidifier even though I paid 50 ¢ more than I would have at Aldi's which was just 1/2 mile away. It kept me away from the cube steak that has been calling my name for a week which I would have spent $10 on and I know that.I bought a few more seeds that were discounted that I will use in the winter gardens only.I started my second sweet potato for slips.I made a list of what I need to plant in the garden and at what time. I need to list when to start transplants through the summer for the fall gardens. I still need to decide where to put what. Dad vetoed where I was putting the potatoes LOL.Hubby uses his gas card to get 3¢ off a gal of gas. I use my Kroger pts.I submitted my coke pts (which is ending in March ;( !  ) I'll probably donate the pts to USO as they no longer have what I always as a reward got available any more.I stopped using plastic bags for things that go in my frig and used containers like the bacon I fried that I got free from Krogers.I open curtains (and inside doors ) to let sun in,I saved the grease from the sausage I fried for calzones and made sausage gravy for our dinner.We turn the lights off when there is enough sun out.Hubby is bad about turning on lights and leaving them on. After 20 yrs he is now turning off the lights and opening the curtains .I forced paper whites and put them in dirt so I can transplant them for next yr.I did the mending.I started cutting cardboard we had saved to use in the craft/sewing room for some of the fabric.I am peeling the \"part\" off that has writing on some of it.We both did required things so our health ins won't cost us as much next year when we switch to the HSA.I decluttered the office supplies and realized we didn't need anything except for printer ink next month.I decluttered the bathroom and realized I was out of some things...completely OUT so that's on the buy list now.Our youngest moved and gave us back some planter pots and a picnic table. The older daughter gave us a swing frame so I just need to get a swing for it instead of the whole thing. Mine broke and it's beyond being fixedHope I do better at being frugal this week"},
{"title": "In the Gardens", "date": "Friday, February 3, 2017", "text": "But with the weather here in Northwest Ohio, it's 19° with winds at 7mph making the wind chill at 11° and I have no low tunnels (plastic over hoops that just cover the plants) so the gardening is in my head. Unless we count the paperwhites and Ameryst I am force blooming and the sweet potato that I have in water hoping for shouts to start slips.I really miss this rhubarb patch...though I am not looking forward to this springs work of separating it out, it needs to be done so it has more room. I have 2-3 people wanting my \"extra\" starts off it. Can there be extra when it comes to rhubarb?I bought half my seed at Menards. They had 2017 Burpee seed at 1/3rd( some was almost half off) off and their 11% rebate. SCORE.I ordered the rest using discounts. I stayed with what I know grows here at least 80% of the time. I gave up starting seeds a few years ago using grow lamps. Didn't get many out of it and the electric bill was just too high. Even though we have cut the bill almost in half on a regular bases, I'm not sure I want to try again right now. BUT I will start growing seeds for late fall and winter planting.I have 68 different seeds (no broccoli, cauliflower,red or green cabbages,kohlrabi, as I get the transplants cheap at the auction...cheap is like anywhere from $3-$10 for a flat of 36-48 plants and that includes bell peppers, hot and mild peppers and tomatoes plants in May). We have decided to do winter gardening this year so I will be ordering a few more seeds to cover the winter. Same types that do will in the spring don't always do well in the fall.I ordered another 10 yesterday and have 2 on the please notify if they come in stock again.Right now the total cost is at $300 ( right on the mark) with a savings of $65. Those seeds will cover 2 years of planting some 3 yrs.  I figure $ $200 a year for seed. That's a lot of money I used the money we saved from eating from the pantry during the month of Jan to pay for it. But really it isn't when you look at that grocery bill and see I spend on average $125 a month on fresh produce. from Oct to April, sometimes May depending on the weather. IF I grow it and do succession plantings (something I haven't been doing) and interplanting like radishes with the beets, green onions around the tomato plants) and do a winter garden that bill should cut down quite a bit. I won't even attempt to grow my mushrooms. I know that in July I will have to prep the winter gardens. I'm adding more work to myself, work days will be longer and more . I also know that I have to sit down NOW and plan what needs to be done at what time because it's not my norm ...when to start seeds for those fall plantings as I will want the plants to be ready to put in those fall gardens for this winter. I need to check the supple of pvc pipes we have and their conditions along with plastic and purchase some good row cover. I used to read MotherofaHubbard blog...she's moved to Four Petal Farm and is on FaceBook if you want to check her out.She's in zone 6A and I'm in 6B so I need to adjust for that. We get colder 2 wks before her and warm up 2 wks after.I am going to start some of my spring seeds in water/milk jugs like this   http://www.agardenforthehouse.com/2011/01/making-a-greenhouse-sowing-seeds-updated/I also pick the brains over at Old World Garden farms blog...they live across Ohio from me but the weather is usually very different, you wouldn't think so looking at a map. But we do get lake affect snow from Lake Michigan at times.What are the goals for this gardening? that I can put fresh veggies on the table year around (which also means eating in season) and not spending money at the store...or money buying gas to run to the store. I know what has been put on the veggies or what sprays have been used (hot pepper spray to kill the bugs that eat the plant anyway, must have thought the spray was a condiment LOL)I wouldn't have to spend $5 for a bunch of Swiss chard in mid winter when the garden seed is $1.99 for 250 seeds.SO ready for spring."},

I actually have a menu of these listed for me to see when I am thinking of eating out.I precook ground beef, ground sausage(bulk) and ground pork when I bring it home. I try to keep 10 lbs of each in the deep freezer already done. I prep my veggies the day I shop or once a week so I am just grabbing veggies and not going: gee I don't feel like dealing with the carrots, onions and celery...we'll just eat out. I boil a few potatoes with skin on and then cool and refrigerate also. Doesn't take much reason to eat out..I will make taco meat and sloppy joes for the freezer alsoMac and cheese.Use small shells and boil in a skillet, less water means it heats faster. Can toss smoked sausage, ground sausage, ground hamb. ground pork or tuna.

I think if I get back to bread baking and make tortilla wraps, sub buns along with calzones and pizzas, he won't care about eating out.We did set an amt of $120 for eating out for the month. That means if we go to Lock 16 we will be eating out twice instead of 3 or more and I set the budget at $180 for dairy and fresh produce The dogs budget is $80...yep they have their own budget and that includes vet and meds for them besides food and treats. I also plan to have the mudroom refrigerator freezer empty ...be eating what is in it by the end of the month . We also have a couple programs connected with our health ins that gives us points (which lowers what we pay) for eating real (no preservatives) and eating fewer processed foods (bake my own bread).I will finish the candy and cookies for the kids/grandkids and get them delivered.I plan to walk 50,000 steps a week (connected to ins also) and start my yoga back up.We are rebuilding our savings...slow but steady. We decided on some changes to the budget but I am not sure if they will work in real life and we are making payments on the last 3 loans we have following the Dave Ramsey Snowball method.I am continuing with shining my sink and adding the habit of decluttering (Flylady)I am continuing with Declutter 365 (Taylor at Home Storage solutions 101) actually I am about halfway through the year because I skipped the ones that will take weeks if not a month to do to work on after I get the \"faster\" ones done.I'll pull a couple recipes off Ree (The Pioneer Woman) site like MM favorite sandwich and onion strings. Smothered pork chops.Caramel apple pie and cinnamon rolls to please Hubby (might help the \"let's eat out once a week\" thing he has going on.Start more sweet potato slips.Plan the garden (I already made planting schedule) and start transplants toward end of month.Finish processing oranges and pumpkins.Continue working on time mgt and weekly home blessing routine.Decide which pattern I am using for Great Grandson's afghan....I've changed my mind about every other day.AND WHY DO I WANT ALL THIS ???Because I want more life..more pleasure, more baking, more crocheting, more sewing, more crafts, more writing and lot more time with family and friends."},
{"title": "Last Week frugal ", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2017", "text": "My fortune out of my fortune cookie. I thought it was a good poke as I found it in the car when we went to town. We went to the local Hong Kong Buffet for Chinese New Year on Saturday. I had coupons and shared them with the others that went with us and the table behind me since they had children under 7 and we don't. Everyone else went shopping , we went home.I grieved for Ree at Thepioneerwoman as they lost their nephew and their oldest dog with in days of each other this past week or so.I made Brandy's Swiss Chard soup from ThePrudentHomemaker. Reread all the posts under last week's frugal post from Brandy. Reread eating from the pantry and saving.Bought the Oliso Iron after reading the review at Steamykitchen by Jaden. Been putting that off because I wanted a heavy iron and wasn't finding any in the stores and really hate ordering something that I can't touch even though I know I can return it. This one does what I want it to the first time.I found a recipe for Kale and Farrow(when I get some of that ) and info on making complete proteins while eating meatless from Terri  at Bluehousejournal.I found a recipe for slow cooker ham and potatoes from Katie at goodlifeeats.The soup recipes will be going into my rotation of soups I am now making at least once a week if not  more often.I put Dave Ramsey Debt Snowball method in effect the beginning of Jan. That is doing  well. I also listed the savings as a bill and set it to automatic. THEN without telling Hubby as he has a the tendency to start shopping when I am trying to save. He used to farm and is very used to always living in debt and living on loans. NOT living that way is a struggle for him. I transfer any money not needed at the end of the month to the savings.My mother in law told me they saved five dollar bills and that's what she used to buy the house when they retired from farming.She saved 20 yrs. When she started she thought it would help make a down payment at the end of each month she deposited the fives. Then after a year she decide any five, whether it was 5 ones of a 5 dollar bill. SO I am doing 5 ones and 5 dollar bills.In my savings.Prepped veggies at the beginning of the week part of the Revive course that I took from Jessica at lifeasmom. OVER prepped so I cooked what was going to end of being pitched if I didn't and split it between the turkey(leftover turkey from another meal) to make 2 burritos for our lunches and the rest of the turkey and some of the veggies went into making last night's turkey and dumplings. I have a container of the veggies to go in the pasta or calzones tonight and the rest of the veggies got dumped into what was left of the mashed potatoes that was leftover that I made mashed potato patties.Had mashed potato mixture left so mixed that the veggies and froze it to reheat as a side or add milk/broth/water to for soup for myself. I can also take a container to Dad and he can reheat it for a side or soup...just thought if I added cheese and some meat it would be loaded mashed potatoes. LUNCH. LOLI had tossed the bag the chicken came into the kitchen trash and the next day Hubby had to take it out because of the smell...felt it was a waste as the bag wasn't really full and the trash goes to the road on Monday mornings. He tossed some of the burn trash (we have open burn here and use a burn barrel. We don't put anything in it we wouldn't put in our gardens as the ashes either go in our gardens or in our landlord's fields). I told him for now on I would either do the chicken on Sunday or put the \"trash\" from it in a bag and in the frig or freezer.Not wasting another kitchen trash bag.How was your week?"},
{"title": "Frugal week and eating from the pantry.", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2017", "text": "The week started good....and then.. DOWN HILL SLIDE .isn't that how it usually goes?Been eating for the pantry (pantry challenge over at Good Cheap Eats) , definitely haven't been eating out like we were.I have been focusing on clearing this freezer to the mudroom frig. Yesterday I pulled things out to see what was left...I have enough to make it to the end of Feb...HUM didn't think I could pack it that full and then  I wonder how many meals is in Monty that is the 27 cubic ft deep freezer. Guess I am going to find out.We went to the store...kind of...Actually we went to Menards to get shelving for the root cellar section of the pantry in the basement. It was on sale and they had their 11 % rebate and we had 3 rebates to apply. Got two metal shelving units for $33 with the tax. COOL. ALSO got half the seeds for the gardens for 40% off and they are FRESH seed not last year's leftovers... add another 11 % taken off that when the rebate comes in...sigh, they had the chips on sale...chips is on the list for Feb,,,, yes I buy chips. Tortilla chips for nachos, taco salad, taco casserole, guac and salsa , cream cheese (Hubby likes it ). Fritos for taco salad, chili, spinach dip (it's the only time Hubby eats cooked spinach), potato chips for the times I am craving carbs, salt and needing potassium.and then I usually get something like puffed popcorn or cheese puffs for those times I crave crunch but can't eat raw veggies (CELERY CELERY CELERY). I got a nice variety and specified they had to last until March AND saved over 50% and I am still UNDER budget for the month.PLUS they will also get the  11% rebate. I hid the chips LOL.We went to Walgreens as I had coupons on my card and a few paper coupons and got our year's supply of vitamins and supplements. I might have to pick up B vitamin depending on the blood work I get for next month. Saved over a 1/3rd. which is better than what I did last year as I only saved 15% last year and it averaged out to be $20 a month. This time it's averaging less than $9.for both us together. I have to take multi vitamin, vit D, Calcium, vit B. I have to float between 3 multi vitamins to keep my stomach from throwing a hissy.Wed was my birthday, we thought we would go to town after Hubby got home from work and I would get my blood work (after fasting), then go get my free breakfast from Perkins and then get the tags and my license renewed then get the shelving and vitamins and some odds and ends at the store....it did NOT happen...Oh yeah I fasted ,,,went without my morning coffee (or tea) and about the time Hubby should have been getting in, he was calling me to come get him because the truck was broke down.The day slid down hill from there. Truck wouldn't be jumped, came home to take the \"box\" we have on the trailer off (we use the box when at auction or this time was moving our daughter) went back and winched the truck on the trailer which took an HOUR and then hauled it to the mechanic at 30 mph back roads.Getting it off the trailer was easy as we parked so the truck would roll backwards without much of a push.Then got the tags and my license and then WENT back to the truck to put the tags on it. I did run through Walmart and get printer paper ( I don't print picture when I print recipes and I usually copy and paste so I can change the font to one that doesn't use as much ink)as I was completely out and some pears and a gal of milk.  I used a gift card and it still has money on it. I got my blood work Friday,Got home and found out that our neighbor's mother that used to be our neighbor had died and her viewing was that night at 4 so Hubby got 3 hrs sleep before he was back up and off we went to the viewing...meantime I had checked my email and found that Hubby's employer is changing health ins to a HSA in 2018.... we don't pay for our ins at all right now but we do pay a deductible and copays....been expecting the change for years so it didn't throw us but I decided to change the budget NOW to reflect that change so we are used to it by Jan of next year. THEN since I didn't get my free bfast Hubby was feeling bad for me so he called in to our favorite local restaurant and ordered me the fried chicken dinner to go. Dropped me off at home and went and got it...didn't think to check the order before he left the restaurant...half my meal wasn't there SIGH. I ended up cooking sides for myself and he called to complain. I went to bed early,I cooked a big batch of bell peppers, onions with 1 lbs of smoked sausage cut in coins and added 2 qrts of home canned tomatoes. 1/3 went into pasta and cheese, another 1/3rd went over rice and the last was strained (juice was left for the rice one) and used in tortilla wraps. Should have saved some for the omelets I made later this week.I cooked 2 soup pots of rice. one for to make fried rice and the other for regular dishes or for bfast with raisins and milk.I made eggroll casserole that made our dinner and then bagged 19 more servings(that way I can use it for my lunch, or Hubby\"s lunch or for eggrolls or potstickers without thawing a lot of it) of it for the freezer. It used the last 2 heads of cabbages we had from last fall.My GI doctor wanted me to read up on Ayurveda so I was able to do so through my Amazon kindle. I downloaded 12 books. I do unlimited, which is good for me as it's 20 miles one way to the nearest library and their selection isn't very good.I read several books at a time, nothing for me to go through a book or even two in a day. I don't watch tv except for the evening news and sometimes morning news for the weather and I limit time of the computer , I do NOT have Facebook on my phone or any other social media. I have started timing my time on Facebook when my youngest texted me and asked why I was still on FB after 30 min (I was reading some bloggers LOL)I read two hours every night and did when the kids were little, I read in bed instead of watching tv.I have started dusting and sweeping more often to cut back on the issues with my allergies. Also using a nasal rinse twice a day and found if I do all of that I am not having to take the allergy meds or the Afrin spray...which is better for my tummy as Crony (what I call my Crohn's) isn't happy with allergy meds. also saves me over $20 a month. My daughter suggested I toss the throw blankets etc out over the clothes line even if it is freezing to help air them out instead of using the dryer.I save all the junk mail envelopes and expired coupons and any piece of paper that can be used for notes etc.I wash freezer bags that wasn't used for meat, foil and bread bags, I researched through the internet (and my Swagbucks)for the best prices for the last of my seeds I wanted to order and then ordered them using discount codes etc I cashed in my Swagbucks to claim my extra points for my birthday. I used what I cashed in for Amazon and then ordered Hubby a new tracker as his was no longer working with his phone and wouldn't connect to our health ins (ins does a point system, you do certain things like walking 50000 steps a week and get points that helps lower the costs of the health ins )Hubby had bought me a new one in Dec when he found them on sale but he didn't like what was on sale so didn't get a new one him self. I found what he liked on Amazon on sale and my Swagbucks paid for over half of it.We decided to use my free bfast coupon this week as it expires. I then found a coupon for Perkins for Hubby to use for his meal when I decluttered area by the calendar. I don't usually keep Perkins coupons as it's not a place we go very often. THEN we decided to go Monday night since I have 2 doc appts to go to. I already have a lunch in the freezer for Hubby to take to work that night. I hope to get produce then also.IF not we will be going without because I'm not making a special trip to get it.I went to The Prudent Homemaker site and read the frugal posts daily. Even if it means to reread, I always seem to find another piece of wisdom to try to keep the week frugal.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "last week's frugalness ", "date": "Monday, January 16, 2017", "text": "I washed my produce before preparing it and put the skins in a bag in the freezer to make veggie broth when the bag is full which should be this week.I canned 8 pints of oranges, dried the zest, added some of the zest to salt for citrus salt, put some of the peels in vinegar for citrus vinegar cleaner and prepped the nicer peels to make candy orange peels today.We ate from the pantry doing the pantry challenge from Good Cheap Eats except for Saturday when Hubby brought a pizza home after working outside in the cold and wet with HAM radio group.I dehydrated some more eggs and powdered them for storage. I noticed the price is starting to creep back up to a dollar a dozen. I would like to get more in storage but if I don't , I'm okay.I put 14 qrts of turkey broth, 7 qrts of beef broth and 14 pints of ham broth.I put 4 meals of ham in the freezer.I canned 12 half pints of butter. I grew up canning butter so it doesn't worry me to do this.It is a personal choice.I bumped a couple of errands and appts to the same days so we are only going to town 2 days this week instead of 4.I baked a peach dump cake and took the extra peaches to add to peach jello.I didn't keep track of what I was doing frugal and I think since I didn't I might not noticed that I could have been frugal or more frugal if I had been writing things down daily.Blessed Be These come from REVIVE course from Jessica Fisher fishmama.com These week's goals.Declutter 365 ( Taylor at Home storage solution 101). We are in the pantry...yesterday I measured all areas of where I store food and non food. We have thought 400 sq ft....NOPE. 700 sq ft. that's bigger than the house my youngest lives in with 3 kids. I took pictures yesterday, noticed clutter that I was \"blanking\" out when I was actually in the room along with some why did I sit that there? issues.  I won't be inventorying it ...HA HA. Nor will I be inventorying the 27 cubic chest deep freezer, 22 cubic chest deep freezer or 7 cubic chest deep freezer. I might the 2 refrigerators freezers. That is a BIG might.I changed my zones from Flylady's zone to match my house better. The zone for this week is the upstairs bedrooms. I will also be focusing on 27 fling boogie 3 times a day out of these 3 rooms.I took pictures of this also. We'll see where I stand in these 3 rooms before I decide which is the project for this weekend.I am doing Revive, using the time budget, time analysis, cleaning schedule  daily. Made a menu for bfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.Doing snowball debt  from Dave Ramsey and focused on rebuilding the emergency fund. In with this I have gotten paperwork for my doctor to fill out to try to get my health ins to agree to pay for a medication not covered by my ins.My ins suggested it, that even if my ins doesn't pay it , I might be able to get my money back through my flex spending acct.I've been reading The Prudent Homemaker daily gleaning the wisdom on the frugal posts but the others also. I just gave away a skirt that I loved but was huge on me that I could have taken in.. I do sew DUH. It took seeing Brandy's daughter in the skirt she took in to make me realize I need to stop with, this don't fit get rid of it and ask if I can redo it to make it fit.I am processing food that will start going bad with spring coming.Have a great week"},
{"title": "Jan 15 to 21 menu ", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2017", "text": "Due to changes in meds (and there will be another one in a couple weeks) I have sat down and wrote out the meds schedule and when I have to eat...because over half my meds need to have food with them but can't be taken close to other meds. I am really focused on serving sizes and getting more walking in as I don't want to gain weight.Bfast menu is French toast with bacon/oatmeal bar with yogurt/apple muffin with yogurt/egg sandwich (bagel,bread or English muffin) cream of wheat with sausage patty/oatmeal with egg (how ever I want to fix it that morning LOL) and omelet.Morning snack. My doctor strongly suggested pureed fruit with my new med which is what I take at this time so that will be what this snack is. I will set up my blender so if I don't have applesauce in the frig like I do right now, I can puree up what ever is on hand.Lunch...SIGH... I am going to try to eat salads....daily.... I like salads, I always eat them when out, I eat a chef salad before I eat my pizza but let's get real...I HATE PREPPING SALADS. I just am not willing to pay that extra money to have it prepped for me LOL.... I have been known to eat what my friend calls salad sandwiches.So Sunday evening I will be prepping salads but in my head I will tell myself I am prepping veggies to use during the week in dinners instead...Sometimes I have to \"mommy\" myself.Salads will have a protein/carb with them due to meds.Afternoon snack.This is around 2 pm when I have my tea, it will be mostly a small carb...biscotti, cookie, cake, fig newton, something small. I've done this for years so it's not a change.Dinner this week...123 pasta (using leftovers up)/Eggroll Bowl (has rice)/ smoked sausage,bell peppers and onion over LO Rice/ham and scalloped potatoes casserole/ red beans and LO rice/Chicken breast (several varieties of precooked in freezer)with winter sq (depending on choice of chicken of which winter sq) and Risotto...probably beef,mushroom and radicchioEvening snack...jello, pudding, custard, yogurt, frozen yogurt or juice, Maybe popcorn ...something very light but still enough I can take the last med that requires food.I might try to ride the exercise bike after the snack instead of riding it in the morning.Though taking a walk around the perimeter in the dark (I have a good flashlight) in the cold might help me sleep longer than 4 hrs."},
{"title": "What I am doing", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2017", "text": "Declutter 365 is going good.I have the upstair hall and staircase (stash dash and wait until I am going up for some other reason since we don't use the upstairs much any more. That's going to change) done and cleaned.I worked on the butler's pantry, another dump until I go down to the basement area as the basement door is right there..which meant I was stepping over things to get to the dry goods that I can't store in the pantry in the basement or things I use daily (I don't store food in the kitchen cabinets, never have).This is what it looked like before I started....there is over 50 cake mixes on that top shelf. My youngest gave me a recipe to use them up making cookies .If I had 50 brownie mixes I would have everyone of my grandkids offering to bake them LOL.I took some stuff and placed in 5 gal food grade buckets with lids and put in basement pantry including 30 of the cake mixes, kept no more than 2 of each kind plus brownie, muffin and cookie mixes I was given. I have a few things that were missing and didn't realize it until I cleaned it so today I will be making a grocery list of those items as right now they are just jotted down on the white out board on the side of the frig that sits at the doorway to this area.I forgot to take a before picture of the pegboard I hang my pots and pans on (idea from Julia Child). To say the least it was a horrible mess since I had bought new pans  and the set had more pans than the set I got rid of (gave to grandson that got his own place) and never dealt with it. Hubby likes the new way because if he hangs it in the wrong spot it's be into another pan and he KNOWS that isn't how it's set up.  I got rid of the rice cooker that I haven't used since the kids left home (hum, 9 yrs?) and put the instant pot in its place so it's off the floor.SO after 3 days of several hours a day this is what I now have.and then I have this...I hang the tablecloths here. We don't use the baseboard heater (shut off at breaker box) so I use it for the cold cereal. I very seldom buy cereal unless it's on sale for less than $2 and I have coupons.AND if I can get a rebate from it it's even better. BUT Hubby likes his cold cereal and at least it's not the kind with tons of sugar. We are stocked for about 6 months if not more.Hubby built this as a bookcase for me in 2005 when I started my business as a personal/private chef.It's purpose has changed several times through the years.I have a step stool that isn't in the picture that usually leans against it. It's being used upstairs at the moment.This is another one Hubby built. We had moved into a very small rental house that had a built in pantry wardrobe and there was this spot next to it that nothing fit in and I didn't have any place for my baking staples so Hubby built it to fit the area. When we moved here it fit in this corner but now it holds the teas, sodas,jello, pudding, and the booze. Just FYI, we don't drink 95 % of it. It's for cooking mostly that I used in my cheffing....I pawned some off on my bartending daughter for her and her coworkers to use coming up with new drinks etc. Still have some I am either going to have to pawn off or find recipes for since I have retired.Got a few from Mom before she passed away and a couple from a friend that brought it back from Italy. I plan to start working on the shelves that are in the staircase to the basement next. Kitchen is just wipe out cabinet and drawers and the top of the cabinets wiped out. I keep the kitchen decluttered mostly. The kitchen table gets a lot on it as it's the only work area and holds the coffee maker,my kitchenaid, tea box, water pitcher, cookie jar LOL ...it's only 24 inches by 40 inches so it's a work horse for it's size."},
{"title": "Pantry challenge  frugal week", "date": "Monday, January 9, 2017", "text": "Hubby said he knows why we don't do menus ...I take the leftovers and keep adding to it to provide one more meal...  this was said after I cooked a combination of veggies to add to our subs and then served them in  4 more ways to provide meals. I put the last of them in enchiladas tonight but we still have enchiladas left for tomorrow so I guess that makes 5..it was 3 bell peppers, 1 jumbo onion and 1 lbs of mushrooms .. that I added 1/2 cup of cooked sausage, 1 cup of leftover cooked shredded beef and tonight I added refried beans to it... We had it this morning with eggs and country style gravy.We had bbq ribs, mashed potatoes and kraut and repeated it the next day. I had poorman stroganoff (hamburger stroganoff with horseradish) over Ramen noodles.  I baked a ham and served it with mac and cheese and green beans. The next day we had ham sandwiches with leftover mac and cheese. I cut of what was left of the ham for 3 casseroles (put that ham in freezer) and simmered the bone to make ham broth for soup that I canned. I roasted a chuck roast and used it to make beef and homemade noodles with a molasses custard baked in wee be little pumpkins (usually used for decorations).I canned beef broth and turkey broth and butter ....yes butter. I grew up with canning butter so I don't worry about doing it now. It's what we used during the summer because it would stay soft in the frig and leaving butter out during the summer was usually not good idea.I mended a shirt for Hubby and 2 dog toys that the dogs got for Christmas.We redid the 2017 budget. Had to increase some areas and decreased others to make it balance and still be able to put some back in savings. We did better financial in 2016 than we had the five years before that even though we lost income. I garden more and we get what I don't grow at the Amish produce auction instead of buying organic at the store.We went to the store even though we are doing the pantry challenge. I matched non food coupons to the sales. Ended up getting 3 lbs of meat for free due to coupons and sales also. Got my dairy and produce that I was out of. Saved over 30 % so I felt better about going to the store. I downloaded the free Friday coupon from Krogers. Matched rebates with Mobisave, checkout51 and Ibotta.I'm decluttering daily and repurposing things so I don't have to buy anything.I started my sweet potato slips.Hope everyone is safe, warm and having a good week"},
{"title": "Jan menu and shopping", "date": "Monday, January 2, 2017", "text": "Since we are on the pantry challenge over at goodcheapeats. I decided we would only buy things that are on the basic weekly grocery list (no stocking up)...then Hubby decided we would only go to the store every 2 weeks...then I decided since we wasn't going to be in town for anything for 3 weeks we would go 3 weeks with picking up milk at the local IGA when he heads home from work in the mornings.THEN I decided to not spend more that $100 for the month on food with the thought of closer to $50 for the month.THEN ..ha ha I got to thinking about what would I be willing to buyApples as Hubby packs these in his lunches and also will eat them with peanut butter. Right now I have a good supply but by the end of the month I can see us need more.Bananas as a requirement of my diet. This might be another pick up at the local IGA as I do NOT see me driving 30 min round trip for 7 bananas.Celery, carrots,bell peppers, fresh mushrooms and dark greens. I have plenty of everything else in the pantry but I don't even have dried celery or dried carrots.Vernor's ginger soda and Sprite...WHY because I am sick  😢and when my Crohn's flares up that's what the doctor's put me on also...especially the ginger soda. I do ginger tea but it can some times be too strong with my Crohn's so I drink the soda FLAT AND WARM.AND the last would  be  milk, heavy cream, half and half and buttermilk. I have enough cottage cheese and cheese (dairy is my protein during Crohn's attacks) for the month. I have enough yogurt that if I need more I could make it if I had the milk to make it. I have the baking supplies for bread, biscuits,bagels, English muffins, flat bread, Naan bread, crescents (even though for some reason I have several store brand crescents ) and tortilla wraps.The menu for the month Bfast we will rotate through pie, fruit muffins and fruit bread, oatmeal and cream of wheat (might do grits) Egg or bfast meat sandwich,  Sunday, Friday and Saturdays when Hubby working will be brunch...pancakes,waffles, French toast,frittatas (Big Egg is what Hubby calls it) or omelets. Not quite the Irish full fry but close.Lunch, Hubby packs leftovers from our dinner or takes a lunch meat (can be meat I sliced off of roasts) wrap or sandwich. He prefers tortilla wraps or flat bread over regular bread most the time.I will have mushroom soup, tomato soup, potato soup or egg drop soup. I will also have PB and honey or grilled cheese sandwiches Egg salad or tuna salad with crackers is an option. Sometimes I just do \"snacks\" for lunch like cheese, crackers and pickles or olivesDinner, I listed the proteins instead of the sides...I do sides based on what I have already eaten and what Vit I still need...like tonight I will need Vit A so I will make sure that what I eat will have that.Dinners...Seafood: mackerel patties, Salmon patties and tuna noodle casserole.Soups and stews: Pasta e Fagioli (first day I don't add the pasta, second round I do) beef bourguignon or beef stew depending on if I want to make pot pie or add dumplings 2nd round. Brunswick stew, and bean soup.Pork meals are roasted pork (LO pulled or Brunswick stew), pork chops, bulk sausage,sausage patties,smoked sausage, and ham (with lots of LO) Roasted beef (LO as stew, potpie or noodles) hamburger, fajitas, subs(mock Philly cheese steak) stroganoff  Enchiladas with any meatGrilled bologna ( from G&R Tavern in Waldo OH)Homemade calzones and pizzapasta , 123 pasta is a go to a lot...1 onion, 2 cups protein and 3 cups or more veggies... I will toss that combination on top of rice also.We will do bfast for dinner also. I do have a list of meals that are stocked that can be prepared with in 15-20 min."},

I have V8 Fusion to balance that.Hubby is eating the last of the leftover ribs, mashed potatoes and kraut for his dinner and packing a lunch meat sandwich(probably a tortilla wrap instead of bread) for his lunch.Today is our trash day so I cleaned the kitchen frig out. Wasn't as bad as it looked and I put some things in that freezer so it's on the full side now.AND this is what it looks nowI seemed to have picked up a lot of crescent rolls for some reason that I am going to have to use up. Salad dressings etc, Mexican items and jelly/fruit butters are back in the storage containers so it's pull one thing out and not a hunt and find. Cottage cheese and yogurt left top next to salad stuff as I toss it with my salads just as often as not.Milk, juices are to the top and right, eggs, bacon and bacon grease to the bottom and right. Hubby's lunch drawer right has his apples, candy bar that he has with peanut butter and the lunch meat for when there is no leftovers for him to pack for lunch. Left drawer is veggies so there is no veggies still sitting on the jars in the doors. Under milk is leftovers and the large container of dark greens I am now suppose to eat regularly. The bottom drawer is CHEESE....lots and lots of cheese and it's not the only cheese in the house. I get cheese on sale and FREEZE it. YEP YEP YEP"},

From Chaos to Clean in 2017 , monthly habits (Jan is shine the sink) and fling boogies etc. She has been there \"for\" me since 2001.Taylor Flanery at Home Storage Solutions 101 for her declutter 365. Ree at The Pioneer Woman...she's my go to for \"man meals\" so Hubby doesn't feel deprived plus I love Charlie.Katie over at goodlifeeats.com for recipes.Jaden at Steamykitchen.com, not only for recipes but for reviews of products she uses.They are who I look to when I have fog brain.This is from Jessica over at GoodCheapEats.com . She does a pantry challenge twice a year that I try to at least do 2 weeks of.This year I plan to do a lot longer...like MONTHS...why? The goal is to clear out and restock after I've defrosted deep freezers and to wipe down and restock the pantry with the FRESH garden stuff that will come in this year.IT is also a goal to pay off the final 3 debts and rebuild the savings account. ALSO I want another dehydrator for this summer and this is a good way to save for that purchase.This is not an easy task for me, I get the shakes when I see empty spots where food was. BUT I know if I don't focus on clearing it out every other year completely I will end up with food being wasted.I went hungry growing up. We lived where if we didn't grow it we didn't have it. When my parents divorced there was no meat on the table because Dad hunted and fished. We didn't buy meat at all.I have rules...can only eat out twice in during the month...that might go to 3 times if we go see our parents as we take them out to eat when we do and that depends on my health and the weather as they live over an hour away and we don't see them every month.I have  a list of meals that is stocked that can be made within 20 min. That is about the time it would take us to drive to the closest fast food drive through and get back. I would like to focus back on eating out a something SPECIAL and being at a sit down restaurant.I can get items needed off the basic weekly grocery list Hubby and I wrote out the other night. Basic vegetables (carrots,celery etc) apples and bananas (requirement of my diet due to health) and dairy and if needed baking supplies.Still we decided to go every 2 wks to the store as he can stop and get milk at the local little store on the way home from work. I chose to wait 3 wks this first time as I just stocked the frigs for the holidays. I do have a monthly basic list but it is mostly staples for baking etc and I stock it usually at Sam's club. I will limit grocery store shopping when I do it to either Aldi's or click list at Krogers (except for a milk run if needed and that will be the local IGA)...that keeps me (and Hubby as he ALWAYS checks clearance and markdowns) from getting the sales. Ads will be tossed before coming in the house. If I don't see it I won't want to get that SALE.Menu MUST provide potassium, magnesium,Vit.D,Vit E,Vit.K,Vit A, B12,zinc,folate,calcium,iron and LOW fiber.  Thank you to a new GI that caught that my Crohn's was not letting me absorb these.SO here is the pictures of the two refrigerators and their freezers...just a start as I have 300 sq ft plus pantry and a butler's pantry and onions in an upstairs bedroom hanging in the closet and produce that needs dealt with under the bed and kitchen table and in crates in the mudroom.ALONG with Monty, 27 cf deep freezer (Montgomery Ward AKA Monty) Newbie (21 cf deep freezer, it's new) in the basement laundry room and Baby the 7 cf deep freezer in the mudroom....please be sitting when you finally see the pictures when I post tomorrow and Monday.This is the mudroom frig and it's freezer. We used to use it for condiments when I was working as a personal chef and then it was beverages and now it is OVER FLOW of what ever I am processing...right now there is turkey broth and beef broth to can and still some baking items that are needed to finish the Christmas candy and cookies that didn't get done due to me being in the hospital right before Christmas. The cookies and candy are to be delivered by end of Jan.This is the kitchen frig and it's freezer. SIGH. I do have containers in this frig that has some of it organized but it is definitely overloaded and stacked up. Be back tomorrow with more pictures and the menu.I loaded Mobisave, Ibotta and Checkout 51 to my phone for rebates. Already have around $20 in rebates.I saved $90 in coupons and sales at Krogers not counting the fuel pts that we will use this coming month.I found a place to get a discount for the supplement my GI doctor has ordered for me to take that is NOT covered by my ins saving over half and it's shipped from the mfg .I transferred my Pinecone pay to cover the journals I ordered for myself.I transferred my Swagbucks to Amazon to pay for our subscribe and save order.I inputted my coke pts and also got a free calendar (had to pay shipping) as a gift from Coke and Shutterfly.I got 4x4 picture magnet from Walgreens for 99¢ to give to my in laws for the frig. Its a \"selfie\" off my cellphone picture of Hubby and me. I will be mailing it to them this week.We found LED Christmas lights to replace the ones we lost this year. We had priced them at $35 a strand before Christmas and paid less than $7 a strand AFTER. Being LED will help keep the electric bill down next year also.I got next year's Christmas cards for 1/4 th the price.I saved the ham fat from the ham. turkey fat from the turkey and beef fat from the prime rib roast. Now in freezer. IF I don't use it for flavoring I will use to for the birdsI \"simmered\" turkey carcass for broth, prime rib bones for broth and bagged the meat off those for meals like noodles or casseroles for the freezer.I froze the leftover strawberries we were given after a party.I dehydrated eggs.I fixed appetizers yesterday since we were home and tired of eating all the \"buffets\" we were invited to. We will have what is left of that today. The ribs I was going to fix is going to be for tomorrow instead which means I now have 2 meals in the freezer that isn't going to be used this week.Not sure if that is good or bad since the freezers are filled to the brim and so is both frigs.Happy New Year's"},

I now have a new GI doctor that is more into doing what works for me than just prescribing meds. She made some requests for changes in what I eat with the understanding I wasn't not to put us in any kind of problem financially or health wise (if it bothers me don't eat it) and keep her updated through email of how it is going. I will eventually have to have surgery. My ilium in too small (birth defect that was just caught) and it causing \"back\" ups when blocked and the pain meds I have taken decades for the back pain pretty much is what triggered the Crohn's. She changed the meds to something that should help more and added a supplement to add good bacteria to my gut...HOPE PRAY AND DANCE IN THE RAIN...Meantime between  coming out of the hospital, dealing with Christmas (still have 1 candy and 6 types of cookies to deliver late Jan) I used Kroger's pts and Wagner pts for fuel (lots of driving long distance since the kids and both sets of parents live over an hr from us and we visited a friend that was in to see her parents , she's from Montana.I used the leftover prime rib to make broth and meat for beef and noodles (and probable a casserole).I used the leftover turkey to make broth and meat for noodles (and a couple casseroles for next month).I saved the wrapping paper of a couple gifts we were given to reuse next year.We got ham for 97¢/lb. I got 2 and then Hubby stopped in a couple days later and got 2 more. We are giving one to his parents.I found bulk food storage containers to replace what finally gave way including new ones for the brown sugar and powdered sugar to keep ants out. This past year has been a battle and I have had to throw sugars out due to ants...went right through the containers I was using that I thought were airtight...NOPE. The containers were on sale and I went through my Swag bucks so that is even better. I got free shipping also.I found good thick work socks at Rural King for Hubby and got free shipping and used a coupon .I ordered the new office supplies going through Swag bucks and got them on sale. I ordered enough I hope to make it to school supply time this summer.We went over our 2017 budget and figured out we have a couple areas too tight due to increase of prices around here so we are figuring out where to shift that from without taking away from the increase in savings. My new meds is one of those costs.I did gag gifts for the 12 days of Christmas for the kids and grandkids. Great grandson got toys and Christmas ornament of him, his dad and his great great grandpa. For the 12 days I did1st= pear fruit cup (Dollar tree)2nd = plastic turtles (Amazon on sale and used Swag bucks to pay for it) along with dove candy from Odd Lots.3rd =feather's from JoAnn fabric black Friday4 th = note that said messages was left and 4 positive messages written out by hand5 th gold rings made from gold pipe cleaners6th 6 tsp of dehydrated eggs7th  7 tsp of Dead sea salt (swans were swimming in the Dead sea LOL)8 m packages of Swiss miss hot cocoa except for my granddaughter that doesn't do any choc and she got shelf stable milk. She put it in her emergency supply since they have their own place.9 lady's dancing needed candy canes that was given to us from a friend that didn't need any more for her own gifts10 lords leaping for joy over 10 brownie cookies11 pipers piping...they were preschoolers that \"pipes\" were made from drinking straws12 drummers drumming...kids got a hoot out of it. I saved ever popcap I could including asking a friend to save hers so I could make \"drums\" out of the caps and hot glued a circle of linen paper on the cap and 2 small match sticks for the drum sticks...kids thought it was funny I used what was my TRASH for their gifts and then got to thinking about how many pops I had to drink to give each of them 12 drums ( over 200 until I admitted I had taken caps from them that they didn't realize what I was doing. I do coke points so that's what they thought I was doing LOLI used paper from my late mother to wrap and only bought tape.I could have done a lot better on the cost of the candy and cookies.... I didn't buy choc like I usually do so paid the price even with it on sale. Didn't make the run to Sam's club like I usually do and the costs showed it. Something I will have to change to handle that outlay this coming year.We have to go visit Hubby's parents yet (tomorrow) and we have a neighborhood party tonight to take something to.THEN it's take down Christmas , rest and start the New Year with new goals ."},

I got eggs at Kroger's for 99¢for 18, 2 lbs of xxx sugar for 99¢ and did that while going to the bank so it wasn't an extra trip.I cooked up the 3 lbs of sausage we got for buying 2 lbs of ground chuck to make 3 meals of sausage gravy and 4 meals of sausage hash with sweet potatoes and 3 bags for pizza or calzones.Amazon let me know my Subscribe and save amt was going to be about 1/3rd off what the sale price was when I ordered.Our health ins offered a free magazine of our choice for a year and then offered up to 5 more for $2.00 for a year of our choice also. I got the Saveur for free (Retired personal chef) and the other 5 was Food and Wine, Real Simple,Kiplinger's Personal Finance,Bloomberg Business and Reader's digest. I will be sharing this with family after I read them.I downloaded the Walgreen's app and Google Fit and connected it to the Veryfit I wear. So not only am I now earning points to keep my health ins costs down and providing info for my doctors. I am earning points at Walgreen's.Hubby and I went over our 2017 goals to make sure we were on the same page and starting it out to have good results.THEN I WAS IN HOSPITAL....I have Crohn's. I've had it all my life just didn't have the name for it. Two years ago with a lot of push from my doctor I went to a GI specialist. I was in remission and had been for 2 yrs but was having kidney stones that due to what the Crohn's was doing.GI doctor puts me on remission meds and I was okay, not better but not worse until this past fall.Since Sept I have been in twice due to blockage. My original doctor left state and I scheduled an appt for the doctor I will be seeing that specialize in women's digestive...but I haven't seen her yet so I got the doctors that was on coverage at the hospital that flipped when they saw the meds I had been on....the meds I am/ was on was for colitis not crohn's....hum. I have a cyst on my liver, not cancer or life threatening and I have hiatal hernia. So now I am taking 18 pills a day to deal with the damage while the entire GI office is talking about my case trying to figure out what to do with me next as I am allergic to 95 % of the drugs that are for crohn's. At least this time I didn't pass a kidney stone or get an kidney infection. I usually do.I have 7 appts between now and Dec 31st so that's more gas money going out. My primary doctor shifted my follow up appt with him to the day he knows we come to town anyways so I'm not making an extra trip then . The GI office it trying to work it out that I use my \"meet my new doctor\" appt for the follow up to save me gas money also.Hubby ate all the leftovers but forgot the pan of tomatoes and a bowl of orange peel so those had to be tossed. Not actually a bad loss considering I went down in the middle of the night.SO today I started bar cookies instead of the others and will do what I can about finishing getting Christmas wrapped up before Friday when we deliver.It's nice to be home for Yule,Advent, Christmas Eve, Christmas and Boxing day.Blessed Be"},

The pan on top is a 9 x 11 cake pan just so you know how big the sheet pan holding the tomatoes is.I still have one pan of this size with partially turned tomatoes and another of mostly green tomatoesThis is the last of the bell peppers that was stored under the bed to turn also. I dehydrated them.I am writing down daily what we are doing to be frugal.It helps keep us focused on saving.I turned in my coke caps and got a reward and then used the coke caps to make \"drums\" for the 12 days of Christmas gifts for the kids and grandkids.I cashed in my swag bucks and my Survey pts to pay for our Subscribe and save at Amazon which saved us $49.33 this month( not including what I cashed in to pay for it) for what is a necessity for the house.I did a pre-order of Nora Roberts Island of Glass and got is for half of the price when it came out.I ordered the prime rib (the only thing Hubby asks for at Christmas, it was a tradition from his grandparents that are no longer living). I found it at a butcher shop for $3.00 less a pound if I pre-ordered it.I returned a glue gun to Walmart that didn't work instead of just tossing it . Yeah,a bad habit I got from Hubby who also has a bad habit of not putting things back and then going and buying more when he can't find it.We are working on that this spring when we clean the garage out.I tape the receipt to what is being returned and put it on my purse.I turn the printer off after using it. Our old one shut itself off after 30 min but this one doesn't. I give my empty ink cartridges to the local school. They use them to get things so they don't have to increase the taxes to cover more stuff.I shut my laptop down after I use it and then shut the power strip down that it is plugged into . I found one I don't sit and waste the day on social media and two the electric bill dropped.We had a few Christmas lights die so we replaced them with LED lights. I also picked up LED light bulbs for the closets we forgot about when we replaced the other bulbs with LEDs.We are using Gasbuddy to find the cheapest gas  instead of just going to the one gas station. We check the area we are going to be in and what is around us at home.We used Speedway card to get 3¢ off a gal.We used Wagner's card to get 19¢ off  a gal.We used Kroger's card to get 70¢ off a gal.I do the survey to get extra points.We moved our daughter in one trip (instead of the 3 we feared) with the help of one of her friends that had a trailer twice as big as ours. She had a couple bookcases and some stuff that would fit in her car left. As it costs about $40 to go down and back that ended up being an $80 savings.We dropped our electric bill another $15 compared to last year.A friend gave us some candy that they won't use so we will add that to the gifts we give the family.If I am using the oven I will put a tea kettle of water on the burner over the exhaust and heat my water for tea that way. Takes a while but a slow roast or a turkey in the oven can keep me in hot water  for the afternoon with no extra cost of the burner or microwave. Even a short amount of time will take the chill off the water as our water is cold due to coming from a well.We are using \"scrap \" paper for notes and what ever that we get from expired coupons, envelopes and back of letters in the mail.We ate home except for 2 meals. One meal Hubby's HAM radio group paid for and the other we got the special for pizza that provided meal all weekend. I think we are tired of pizza.Hubby turned down Directv offer again. Even though it would not cost as any more that what we are spending for the home phone and internet the offer was only good for a year. We have already went through the \" let's make a deal\" more than once. We will just stay with our antenna.Don't really miss anything except Alabama football and his buddy will text him the scores as he lives down there. We are in OH.We went to the grocery stores for sales. We got cake mixes (girls use them for cookies since they don't buy flour...I can't imagine not having flour) to give as gifts since they were under a dollar. We got smoke sausage for $1.59/lb . We got sausage for $1.92/lb and ground chuck for the same price.I got butter for $1.99/lb and lg eggs for 59¢ a doz. I got a turkey for 68¢/lb and pork loin for $1.39/lb.Depending on the freezer space I will pick up another turkey and a couple hams. I will get pork roast at New Year's. I got a rack of ribs the other day for 99¢/lb. One rack is all we need through this time of year.One of us (including the dogs) has an appt every day this week so I plan to cook up some root veggies tomorrow that can be reheated to go with the protein of the day is. Will spend things up.I know I will be having to buy gas for my car at least 4 more times this month. I usually only have to do once a month.That was figured into the holiday budget.I am still working on the 2017 budget as we know there will be a change in health insurance (some of it will save us $180/month) but I figure there will be a down side somewhere.We still have a hospital bill that is outstanding...kind of...the hospital is trying to get the ins to pay MORE because it was a necessity so our bill will be less. I hope we get that bill soon so I can get that done with for this year's taxes.Blessed  Be"},

I got 5 of each as we use 1/3 of the bag per meal and I serve it twice a month. Neither of us like peas all that much. I use the peas and carrots in fried rice and pot pies.I have Chinese food in the freezer I will be pulling out tonight so fix so we have leftovers. I made 123 pasta last night with extra sauce. One I won't be tempted to order out since I am in cookie and candy mode and two, I have my back injections on Friday morning and was warned there would be at least 4 injections and I would have pain due to the inflammation that is there. SO I would probably be down 3-4 days instead of 1-2. BUT then I should be fine until late spring. That is my norm.Saturday, Hubby will be delivering the stuff and helping our one daughter move. SO I will be on my own and need to \"fix \"myself meals...definitely leftovers.I put plastic on the windows in one bedroom. I have all the winter curtains up now. I put a wool lap blanket rolled up at the bottom of the staircase that goes upstairs(not heated).I close the curtains in the evenings and open them when it's daylight. We don't turn on all the Christmas lights until evening. Out door lights are on a timer.I don't have the tree up yet due to stopping to do cookies and candy.We are looking into doing Click list at Krogers (input order online and pick it up in parking lot) or continuing with Aldi's.

{"title": "Frugal Black Friday", "date": "Friday, November 25, 2016", "text": "Last night we had Thanksgiving dinner in a friend's home. Their son and his lady came in late as they had dinner at her parents home. The talk was of shopping on Black Friday. They were getting up and going here and there and the scores they wanted to get and where...when the young lady stated it wasn't a big deal to her if she even went let alone got what she had listed. The silence that followed probably came from shock. Hubby turned to me and asked what I was buying on Black Friday. I calmly looked at him and said NOTHING. Most of my shopping is done, we do gag gifts, homemade cookies and candies (Buckeyes and snickerdoodles are required 🙂) since we have so many. I give the gift on myself.The best gift I (Hubby and I ) can give my family is our time. We live over an hour away from all of the family due to Hubby's work. So if I can go visit, even for an hour it's a memory they have . A lot of the children and grandkids that are now adults live in the same area so I can make the rounds. I just have to time it with their schedules (HA HA) and money for gas. Our parents live in the same area (over an hour from us and closer to hour and half from grandkids) so we make that a trip. I take food to our family, our parents are living on social security and the kids are trying to make ends meets with large families.My parents on the other hand always went shopping Black Friday and on Boxing Day (day after Christmas) They shopped where my mother's sister worked and the store allowed the sister to use her employee discount for my parents as my parents had raised her and her twin. That was a frugal choice that allowed them to give a bit more to my brother and me.I will say today we will be doing some shopping (me with a cane as I have sprained my ankle and now have tendonitis on top of it that has not mixed with my Cerebral palsy) We need a generator. Last couple years we have lost power which means we have no water as we live in the country. When we moved here the landlord had use of his uncle's generator when he bought this house from him until there was a spat between the two of them over not being honest about the condition of the house. After that we have borrowed a couple times from others that wasn't out of power. We found what we were looking for on sale and we have saved up enough to buy it so we will go get it today.I hope we don't have to use it.Blessed be"},
{"title": "Nov Food thoughts after talking to Hubby", "date": "Wednesday, November 9, 2016", "text": "I told Hubby I posted my Nov shopping list and it was mainly for Tday dinner as the pantry was full.He immediately asked if we need another small deep freezer as we have no turkeys in the freezers. Nor do we have pork roasts, pork loin(for roasts and chops) or beef roast after I make Tday beef and noodles.So we talked it over, as I do not think we need another freezer and do not know where we would put one unless it went to the garage which is already full because the garden stuff is there since the landlord put baby calves (just off bottle) in the pig barn where we stored the garden stuff and I haven't had time to clear the farrowing house to move the garden stuff to it so I can get my car in the garage this winter.ANYWAYS... HA HA. Sidetracked there. We decided on three -five hams and 3 turkeys if the price doesn't drop up to 6 turkeys if it drops enough. I will cook all the turkeys except one or two depending on how many we get and what room I can make by shifting things around.Also we decided on 50 lbs of potatoes for Tday and 50 for our storage.We might pick up another 50 in December. Save a Lot here will allow us to order 50 lbs at a reasonable price that is lower per pound than 10 lb bags.I took another look at the pantry. We have over 100 lbs of different rices, We have over 100 lbs of onions,plenty of frozen corn,home canned green beans, a mixture of zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant,broccoli, cauliflower,bell peppers and green and red tomatoes in the freezers along with the home canned tomatoes. We have delicata squash, spaghetti squash, acorn squash, butternut squash and jack be littles pumpkins for our winter squashes. I am okay on pasta over 50 lbs , a couple shapes I would like to have for certain dishes but I won't get them unless they are on sale.We could use about 5-10 lbs more of sweet potatoes. Maybe more if I make sweet potato chips in the dehydrator.I need about 6 bags of peas and carrots mixed. I will get it when they have frozen veggies on sale. I use them in my fried rice.A bag last us two months unless I serve them as a side and then it's one monthI need dried beans. I gave some to one of my kids when they lost their job and haven't replaced them yet.We need canned 3 bean salad. They don't sell canned yellow wax beans around here or I would get that instead and make my own 3 bean salad.We need canned pineapple. Crushed, chunks, rings yep...a case of all 3.We need dried cranberries, they usually go on sale this time of year. Might grab a couple bags of fresh for the freezer because I am the only one that likes them,dried, Hubby will eat them.Butter, I stock up on butter. I found a recipe to can butter that I haven't tried yet but I know we go through at least a pound of butter a month without bakingBlessed be"},

Not that I base my food budget on it but it definitely shows the rise in the cost of food. https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/USDAFoodPlansCostofFoodIt looks so empty now. The flowers are blooming quite well, the white thing is the row cover put over the eggplant.We chose to go get the last of the LED bulbs we needed to replace, we figured we could either spend the money now or the next 3 months when our electric bill is at it's highest.So all of that is done. We have found that we can use the lower wattage and get a brighter light than what we were getting with the CFL so we are not turning on as many lights as we were.We used the Kroger points to get 60¢ off (200 pts for surveys) for gas (truck)We used the Wagner IGA points to get 25¢ off for gas (ford top off)I have dehydrated eggs and cayenne peppers and roasted several eggplants(and put in freezer).We cleared the gardens except for the herbs, lettuce and one lonely eggplant that had 2 eggplants on it that is not quite ripe. I covered them with a row cover to help protect it. If they don't ripen by this weekend I will have to let them go as we get our first hard freeze. I will finish the harvest before that frost is here. I covered the eggplant because I can buy lettuce out of season but I can't buy eggplants.Since I need all the colors of veggies and fruit , eggplant in the freezer helps keep the costs down for filling in that blue/black/purple.I have the green tomatoes on trays under the bed and about half of them sitting to be cut and dehydrated with seasoned salt. I have bell peppers that should turn red or yellow in paper bags also under the bed. I check these every two days so when they are about 1/2 turned I put them in the mudroom in the morning sun.We had the furnace off during the middle of the daycurtains open when it starts getting daylight and closed at duskpower strip turned off to computer.I use the junk mail and envelopes for scratch paper.We went out with friends for dinner , went at lunch time and used a coupon.I changed some of what we will be serving to our Tday dinner to what I already have to keep the costs down.The budget is $800 So far I have less than $10.I am hoping for the price of turkeys to go down because right now we need 108 lbs and that comes to over $150.00 as they are running $1.39/lb. Last year I had four in the freezer but didn't restock those.I really really need space in the deep freezers so I am using some of the older stuff for our Tday.I used the clothes line.We no longer have to mow which saves us 5 gal of gas every 7-10 days. Since there is cattle in the barn here the landlord's sons will be clearing our driveway,not before Hubby gets home from work in the mornings as one is still in highschool and the other works second. So instead of buying a snow blower (unless we find a good used one we can afford) we will be buying a generator something we have been going without. Not good as when I lose power I lose the water since we are on a well.What did you do this week ?Blessed be"},

I will not be buyinggreen tomatoes or onions except green onions LOL as we have finished most of the harvest and pulled plants. I got the plants out to the field (we don't do much compost due to using sq ft gardens and straw bales) before they came through and disk the field for the winter.. Composted the field you could say.As for the dinner we serve the average of 40. Most are big eaters or grazers that end up eating a lot also. We provide most the food. This year it will be at our son's as he bought his house and has the best parking area. I'll be going to his home to do the majority of the cooking there the week before (feel for him as I pack my kitchen stuff into his house LOL) My older daughter is bring ham and sweet potatoes. Another daughter and granddaughter is going to help prep if their schedules allow them to that is,We have deep fried turkeys (4-6 depending on RSVP and sizes) homemade noodles, turkey noodles and beef noodles, 30-50 lbs of mashed potatoes. several vegetables sides, around 40 pies (plus I make a dessert for each person to take home as part of their Christmas gift), mini cheesecakes , homemade bread and rolls and appetizers .

Since I don't need squash and there wasn't much of anything else in the amount I was will to buy I told Hubby I was getting some baked goods and we would get our apples else where. An elderly gentleman offered to sell me some of his apples that he had in the auction.Said it wasn't a problem at all for him. So I got 20 lbs of apples for 45¢/ lb. and baked goods at a good price so I won't be baking this week.I started making the noodles for our Tday dinner (the Sunday before because so many of us work retail,food service, medical) It figured out to be 15¢ per person.I bought a pork roast regularly $1.79/lb for 99¢/lb and ground pork regularly $2.99/lb on sale for 99 and more eggs for 79¢/ dozen. I was told that by the holidays get here eggs will be back up over $1.00/dozen. So I decided to dehydrate the amount I use in the holiday baking.I dehydrated some pears and apples we weren't going to get used before they went bad.We bought LED light bulbs. I've been saving as my son warned me they would cost a pretty penny, especially with the amount of lights we have here at the farm. We decided to replace the CFLs in the lights we use daily and go from there. Main amt of lights was 27. THEN we realized as we were changing them out we had forgot about ceiling lights through the entire house and 3 lights at the doors...that is 15.There is 24 in the out building that need changed. I suggested to Hubby we replace the rest in the house (which are CFL) and use them in the out buildings which is the old incandescent and then replace the outbuildings. That alone should save more money. We did save around 1/3rd the amt on the new bulbs by buying what was on sale (even though it was a less watt than we were using) so I was happy with that. I can take that savings and put it towards the next round of LED's we buy.We got Subway one night we both of us was just too worn out and was thinking of just not eating.  We gave them our Subway card and told them to take what they could off it...we ate free.We were both shocked there was that many points on the card when we very seldom go to Subway unless we can get a special and have to eat out which isn't all that often.With cold coming in, I have been closing the curtains as it's getting dark and waiting until the sun is out before opening them. I turn the furnace off  as long as the house holds at 68° during the time, when it drops to 67 I'll turn it back on.I turned the dehumidifier off in the basement. By next month I will be turning on the humidifier on in the front room.I'll be pricing 50lb bags of potatoes this week as there was none at the auction. I need it for us and some for the family (as early Christmas present) I will also be pricing beets, sweet potatoes and watching turkeys as I need to roast one early for the noodles since our dinner is the 20th."},

Broccoli stems go in a separate bag for when I make broccoli soup.Water I cook potatoes in is saved for making gravies and potato soup. The water is starchy so I need less starch/flour to thicken the gravy. Good for breads also when you need a bit of liquid.I bought 15 lbs of assorted pasta for $14. I still need lasagna (both regular and oven ready), alphabet and couscous and that will give me enough to go the year or more without buying any more.I got large eggs for 94¢ for 2 dozen , so I got 6 dozen. I still have some of the medium eggs I bought last time for 48¢ a dozen in the frig. I will dehydrate some to replace what I have given to family.

I will also make noodles to give as gifts.I have worked out what the budget is going to be for 2017.I do this now as Hubby's employer has you sign up what you want your benefits to be at the first part of Nov.I'll finish working it out this week.I've been closing the curtains before dark to help keep the heat in and reopening when the sun comes up.

I just filled in the \"gap\" when I got home after eating with our friends...we go out with them about every 6 wks. We pick places that have specials or we have coupons.

I used binder clips a friend gave me when they closed down a factory and he cleaned out the offices.because of the decorative woodwork above the sink you can't even see how I hooked the lace to the rod at all.Hubby needed a new winter coat for when we are going some where instead of wearing the work coat or the \"barn\" coat that really looks nasty with stains and worn spots.We found one on sale at the local hardware (only a couple places carry carhart coats which is what is worn in this area). When it was rang up it came out that the tag was wrong ($150 coat was on sale for $99.99 but the tag said $59.99)They honored the tag. Actually they said of course they would honor the tag when we pointed the tag said less than the \"scan\" code did. Still, we would have paid the $99.99 as that was a good sale for that coat because it included the $30 hood that we have always had to buy separate.I finished dehydrating the last of my herbs and gave the herbs their \"winter\" hair cut.I cleared all the sq ft gardens and planted the fall onions and fall garlic. Found more onions so they are now curing. I still have a couple gardens on the south side and the north gardens(straw bales) to clear.Harvested the sweet potatoes and they are curing.Pulled the last of the bell peppers in south gardens. They will be loaded tonight in dehydrator. That way the house is warm from the dehydrator in the morning and I'm not having to turn the furnace on to take the chill off.GI doctor changed my diet, have to eat magnesium,potassium,calcium combination (it's what makes your digestive system work the best) along with 1 serving of fruit/veg from each color ...colors are white/tan/brown , red. orange/yellow, blue/black/purple and green-lt/dark AND I'm to eat at least 1/2 cup of food every 2-3 hrs as NOT eating regular times can cause issues of digestive system shutting down.  I thought this was going to cost us a fortune...until I checked what is in the pantry... pretty much have all of it, might run out of the blue/black/purple but doc was okay with red/purple grape juice or V8 Fusion once a day.The only thing is I have to eat yogurt daily. I had some given to me that will last a couple weeks then I will most likely start making it myself.We have ate from the freezers or pantry most the time, I think we have one time that each of us ate out by ourselves due to NOT being home and missing a meal...both of us spent less than $5.I have started focusing on our Tday dinner...going to have to really go over the menu as the head count has almost doubled with YES WE WILL BE THERE. LOL.Have a frugal week."},
{"title": "Oct 10 Monday morning frugal week", "date": "Monday, October 10, 2016", "text": "This is what I didn't use this week for the laundry. We pulled everything and I mean everything of the warm weather bedding,pillows and curtains and then everything of the cold weather bedding, curtains and clothes and loaded it up in the back of the pick up and hauled it all to the laundromat. Can't wash heavy bedding and curtains in this machine. I love my wringer but that is a big negative of having it. Hubby said he saw no reason to not just do it all when I am still recovering from being in the hospital (better but no where near normal energy wise or other.). I don't allow him to use the wringer washer , too scared he will force the wringer and break it.Three hours later, 16 triple loads, 18 double loads (think about it 19 windows with a set of sheers and then regular curtains EACH, that's 57 curtains (I use the same sheers) to be washed) we were home and I was loading the dryer,drying rack and the 200 ft of clothes line. Took less than 24 hrs to get it all dried thanks to the wind being 15-20 mph as I reloaded the clothes line before going to bed . Hard to get the items on and off the line, well maybe not off as I kept having to go out and repin things to keep them ON. LOLWe had 4 throw pillows that matched our couch and love seat fall apart.Not surprised as they are over 12 yrs old. I used the fillings (after making sure it was dry) to restuff the cushions that are the backs of the couch and love seat. I will need to replace the throw pillows as we use them to support me as need to sit \"forward\" on that furniture because I am short.I reused a couple bed pillows that fell apart also (closer to 7 yrs old) to make one pillow. Going to have to replace a couple of those also, but can make due until I find what we want and on sale.Now my house is \"covered\" in laundry baskets as I sort what needs to be in storage and what is going to be used now.Financially it wasn't cheap on the other hand it made us think about what washer we should be looking. Do we want to continue to use the laundromat twice a year at over $150 each time (no dryers, used just washers) or do we want to put it towards a washer that can handle to bedding and curtains? Already looking at life cycles and limited computer parts as I went back to the wringer because I had 3 washers that the mother boards died.I will not do a front loader again either unless I am in a wheelchair.While doing all of this I started the fall cleaning with Hubby's help. We focused on the bedroom first as we both feel that we do better if we can rest without seeing any messes.Went to town and got caulking as I found air leaks when taking the curtains down. Got dog food on sale while there (almost same amt) that we been getting at Sam's club so that put off the trip until next month plus they had some canning stuff on clearance so I got that also to get off my list.Our grandkids got their first apt so we are taking kitchen stuff down to them that I was getting rid of. Pretty much they will have something from everyone in the family. Surrounded by love is what they called it.We will combine the trip to drop off pumpkins and pick up anything the kids need us to get. Will save a us a second trip down which is a 3 hr round trip.I dehydrated thyme, oregano,flat leaf parsley, curly parsley, garlic chives and chives. I canned 8 pints of pears.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "October shopping plans", "date": "Thursday, October 6, 2016", "text": "Jack Wee be littles from the Amish produce auction.This is what I want to shop for....with acknowledgement that it's going to depend on if there is money to buy it.Since I will go back to baking most of our breads and stuff I need to restock the supplies. I had quit, didn't see the point with just the two of us and neither of us big bread eaters but that was one thing that was put in to my diet by the GI specialist, it just can't be whole grain. I do eat oatmeal without issues so I can make oatmeal bread (cook oatmeal first , Mary at Owlhaven recipe).Hubby eats bagels weekly and both of us eat English muffins. I just need space in the freezer to split it up so it doesn't start going bad (no preservatives so you have to eat it now)go into the dogs mouths as treats. LOLSam's Club: Dog food and carrots. I will walk the whole store to see if there is anything else but I pretty much already picked up the baking supplies. Might get oil for the deep fryers as Hubby deep fries our turkeys ever since the house burnt a month before Thanksgiving . I used the church kitchen to make the rest of the dinner and we had it in a house with the dining room and kitchen torn apart.THANKFUL we were all okay.King Arthur Flour or Amish country store (no shipping and usually better priced): caramel coloring,asorbic acid,citric acid,pretzel salt,non-diastatic and diastatic malt,barley malt,baker's ammonia,Vietnamese cinn, cinn baking chips,vanilla bean paste,lemon juice powder, lime juice powder, orange citrus oil, boiled cider, dried buttermilk ,rye bread improver,easy roll dough improver,pizza dough flavor,special dry milk,deli rye flour, rye flour,pasta blend flour or semolina and durum flour(this is only for Thanksgiving noodles otherwise I use regular all purpose, this blend holds up better to sitting in crock pots through the day),fruit blend (KAF) Hubby prefers this in his granola bars and oatmeal. and sticky bun sugar.Dollar stores etc. Candy that I can use for Christmas goodies along with tape and paper to wrap with odds and ends for presents.Wagner's or Walter's butcher shop for sausage patties(by the case) smoked sausage (by the case) canned pork,canned beef and canned chicken . Both places butcher their own meat and can it so I know what is in it and where the meat is from. I will also buy dried beef in the jar. We use it at Thanksgiving for dried beef pickles and I use it for gravy and cheese balls through the winter and lard.Amazon is been my best price for dog treats, (yeah I know I shouldn't but I do) I always check sales and coupons before I order.Other groceries will be eggs (I'll use 20 dozen at Thanksgiving and another 20 dozen at Christmas) Crisco for sugar cookies and butter for baking. I need crushed pineapple, chunk pineapples and pineapple rings, yellow wax beans ( or 3 bean salad Hubby eats through the winter), yellow and white hominy, kraut, I need a bit more ginger root also. Storage needs sweet potatoes, white potatoes, apples ( citrus is Dec) and I will pick up celery, fresh mushrooms (if on sale and I have coupon) and colored bell peppers (I can't eat the green ones). I might get more beets depending on price as I would like to make beet chutney and beet chips.We'll see how it goes.Blessed beThis corn is now off in the fields around us.Depending on which way I look there are spots I can see 2 miles away. It's also the reminder that it's time to bring the harvest in and it's going to get colder here. I've seen that happen in a matter of days and since I am very limited with activities of anything that uses my core at the moment (okay probably a month or so) I am going to have to work smarter than harder.I am trying to work an hour and then rest 2 hrs. Some days if I have doctor appts etc I can only do 30 mins and I am done for the day. Immunity system is shot along with malnutrition now that I couldn't eat for over a week. I remember it's been worse before and I got through it, I will do the same again with my faith holding me tight.We have started getting the medical bills in from where I was in the hospital (over $22000 so far and I've already made arrangements to get discount and payments on our share of the bill). I know there will be at least 5 more as I was in to the primary doctor yesterday and he ran more tests because I still have the urinary tract infection that didn't get cured while in the hospital for my Crohn's. I am thankful for health ins through Hubby's work, it's really good ins but as we all know ...it doesn't cover everything. PLUS he was off almost 10 days due to him being sick which means the paycheck won't have the extra $ of his shift/position etc , just basic hour wage, which we are grateful for because I have kids that don't even get that. The saving acct took a big hit.SO working smarter.....house has to winterized BEFORE it hits (lesson learned) and the last of the gardens have to be taken care/processed and stored along  with planting the fall garlic and onions.I need to start Thanksgiving prep and Christmas gifts/cookies/candy.I paid the bills, looked at what was left and we decided that we had enough to take everything, clothes,bedding we are using, winter clothes, winter bedding and all the curtains (warm and cold weather) to the laundromat. Thankfully I used vacuum bags to store the winter coats or that would have been another 3 loads. I can use the clothes line and my dryer to dry, though we might use the laundromat to dry the pillows while the other stuff is washing. I will put them in first to make that happen.That will pretty much wipe me out physically for a day or so but it will be done. I can wash/caulk/tape/plastic what ever is needed on the windows as I rehang the curtains in the next couple weeks. Like one set a day or so.We put some corner round in the one upstairs bedroom that needs caulked as I could feel a bit of a breeze today when taking the curtains down. Drafty old farm house LOL.I plan to make the noodles this month and drying them for Thanksgiving dinner.I got medium eggs on sale for 48¢ a dozen. I use large to bake with but medium is fine for egg sandwiches,deviled eggs, noodle making etc.I'll use my Kitchen aid mixer and attachments to make the noodles instead of doing it by hand.We hit the candy sale at the local store and got some of what we needed for Christmas on sale half price.I have a couple more stores I want to check on to see if I can get a few more things.I am making my own tags.We are still changing some of the ideas as we run across things that would be just as cheerful and yet less expensive for us. I need to finish painting the craft room (4 hrs left to finish) and set it up so I can work on this and not having it sprawling across the dining table.I am harvesting/processing something every day. Dehydrator is cranking 24 hrs pretty much. I have finished all the herbs unless I find some basil in the north gardens. I'll check that tonight when this last batch is done.I would like to be able to can in the evenings after dinner but by time that comes around I am pretty wiped back out.I am picking and choosing to what I can sacrifice if I have to let something go. I give it away most times, still there are times it doesn't get taken. It becomes compost in the fields. Feeds the critters that I don't want in my house AKA field mice. And speaking of field mice I will have to put out the bait for them in the basement and crawl spaces. Right now with it being warm and the cattle having corn in the barn and the gardens still producing they won't come in, get a nice cold snap and they will try to move in.Do you prepare for cold weather ?"},
{"title": "Storms in our lives", "date": "Tuesday, October 4, 2016", "text": "I have journaled for years. This happens to be the one I am writing in now.Sept 11-15 I recovered from stomach virus, when you already have Crohn's this is even harder to go through.We had a great day the 16th , even though I was \"weak\" at the Amish produce auction. I got 10-15 lb pumpkins for $1.25 each, pie pumpkins for $1 each and jack be littles for 25¢ each. I also got 10 lbs of Asian pears that were not ripe and 140 lbs of Roma tomatoes.I got Mums for the front porch. AND I was able to eat decent. I was able to stop at Wishing Well Farms and get winter squash (69¢/lb) and 10 lbs of apples (50 ¢ /lb)I worked on some of the tomatoes on the 17th, went to the store and got groceries, stocking up on the fresh veggies and getting some stuff for our family reunion . We had 5 generations there  between my dad 89 yrs old  and my new born great grandson 1 month old.Went home and thought, get up in the morning, and finish the tomatoes....wellHubby caught the stomach virus through the night. By that evening I had it back and it was a down hill slide from there. He miss all week of work (haven't seen that ever in over 20 yrs) and I wasn't getting better myself. Not processing food, didn't want to \"seal\" it in canning and make us sick or sicker later. Neither us was doing much more than sleeping it off.Sept 25th, at 3 am I wake Hubby and ask him to take me to the ER. My Crohn's was starting to kick up and I knew, just knew it was going to be bad.At 5 am Sept 25 I was admitted....I got out the following Thursday Sept 29th in the late afternoon and had to do a pit stop at the Chiro's because I threw out my shoulder in the hospital. Also had to stop at the grocery store because a full liquid diet (mashed and mushed) isn't something I was keeping in my pantry but will for now on.We lost food in the frigs, lost some of the produce and I have lost produce in the gardens. It rained for 3 days starting the day I got out of the hospital.Hubby lost 1 1/2 wks of work. He took vacation to cover it but that doesn't pay his TL , shift etc that makes a difference between just getting by in good times or having let alone being hit with medical bills. We have medical bills that will be coming in, granted most of it will be paid for but there is enough not paid for that is going to crush the budget big time.Hubby is back up on his feet, tires easily , part of that is the stress of watching me fight for my life once again as my entire digestive system shut down (AGAIN). I'm slow at recovering. Has extremely low potassium levels and other stuff that was making the Crohn's even worse. Having your digestive system slowly start up is hard and painful at time. I haven't had a solid night's sleep since the stomach virus started. I do miss my nurse for the middle of the night conversations and laughter to keep me fighting and not just give up.I had a long chat with my brother by text. Our schedules don't come anywhere close to being able to talk of the phone about what I was having to change. He thought that it was a simple change in diet and it would never happen again.....NOPE don't I wish?I then called my Dad. At the age of 89 and already buryed 4 sons out of 6 and me being the only girl, he was heart broken, thought he had lost me this time and wasn't able to get to me to tell me he loved me and with his dementia just kept telling me I was his daughter and he was my daddy....he has been forgetting he has a daughter in the last couple years so it meant a lot to both of us. We talked about lifestyle changes that could help me (eating an apple a day to keep the doctor away is what will bring the doctor my way but he doesn't understand that) and that even with the loss of food,me getting my strength and health back was more important ( I was born with a bad digestive system and my parents were told I would die without surgery which since they had no ins and had just paid for my younger brother to have open heart surgery was out of the question ).Everyday to make a priority of ONE THING that I NEED to get done. And only focus on it. THAT'S very hard when you see losses all around you. He also reminded me of the time he asked why I was canning 4 oz jars of veggies and I told him that was what had came in and I would lose it before more came in . Better a mouth full saved than a mouth full wasted. Might make the difference in that water soup(HA HA) I had more than one time had to make when I was single and on my own.SO better a mouth full saved than a mouth wasted ...as I learn to dance in the rain.Since I am still resting, we decided to go over the Tday dinner menu  and then Christmas gifts,cookies and candies. We do gag gifts  for Christmas and usually only give $10 (in ones) as we buy for about 40 (over half of that is our kids,grandkids and now great-grandson). We came up with the ideas....then over a couple days changed it to fit the budget we are now on.We are not where we thought we would be sitting at this time of year nor is the pantry as full as I really prefer it to be...BUT I have winter sq, pumpkins and some sweet potatoes. I will have a few more tomatoes and from this dining room window I can see a bell pepper that is turning red. Another mouth full to save. We'll pick up potatoes next month and again in Nov. I just got to focus on that ONE THING and that ONE MOUTH FULL.Blessed be, may you be healthy, wealthy with love, and wise."},
{"title": "September frugal ?", "date": "Saturday, September 10, 2016", "text": "In some ways yes...I have mending caught up except for a sheet that the wind ripped the hem out of while drying on the clothes line.I picked eggplantI dehydrated onions that was going to go bad. I now have 1/2 gal of dehydrated onions. I put the dehydrator out side on the front porch table, didn't heat up my house and cause the AC to run more, dogs and I didn't get sick due to the odor coming off them (can harm pets) AND I found it actually cut the time almost by a 1/3rd for what ever reason.I turn off the AC every morning and open the house open. One to air it out and two to save on the electric bill. I don't turn it back on until the older dog (Miss Kira) is starting to pant and she does come to me to let me know she is hot.(about 77-78°)I have lettuce growing in the garden from it reseeding it's self....saved me from having to plant lettuce even though I prefer leaf lettuce and this is romaine. FREE IS FREE.I picked up Pumpkin spice creamer so I won't be going to Speedway to get a cup or have Hubby stop every morning on his way home to bring me a cup.The bottle of creamer cost the same amt of a cup at the gas station and I figure I can get at least 30 cups of coffee out of it. That's over $30 in savings. Yes I could just not buy it at all but life without an extra is hard to deal with.We both have cut our consumption of coffee in half. IF not more for Hubby as I used to make 2 pots a day for him alone and it's down to every other day now. NO we don't throw out \"old\" coffee, we either drink it or use it in cooking.Hubby is now filling his \"16 oz juice glass\" (read mug that was bought for root beer floats ) with ice before adding juice instead of just adding a couple ice cubes to the juice.Juice consumption has went down from a bottle every other day to every 4 days. He is also eating what ever apple is the cheapest to buy instead of his favorite in his lunch. He will eat in season fruit if it is \"solid\" enough to carry in his lunch box. Peaches and such don't do well. I don't buy a lot of canned fruit.We have switched to water instead of unsweetened tea. I have went to not having my mug of hot tea at 2 for a glass of water. I image that will flip back as cooler weather comes in. BUT I have a lot of teas that I can drink(some I raised) so I won't be buying tea unless it is one that my girlfriend and I both have drank for years . Then we drink it once a week  so a box goes a long way and we take turns buying it for each other (unless we see it on sale and have a coupon)even though we are over an hour apart...at the same time. Keep the connection going strong.We are going to plant fall onions with the fall garlic using the onions that are the size of pearl onions from this year's crop. I was told they would do better for us if I planted this fall instead of waiting until spring.I went to the store on Monday (Labor day and it was stocked and not busy) and picked up fresh chicken breast for $1.69/lb I have stuffed it (5 different ways) and precooked it and shoved in freezer. I thawed hamburger I had and made 2 meatloafs , porcupine meatballs, 125 meatballs and meat for lasagna and stuffed shells and manicotti that will be in freezer by Monday. I also put in a Philly steak slider casserole and  4 oz thin slices of chicken for either sandwiches or stir fry. I froze red beans soup. I put scraps of chicken that I cut off the breasts I was stuffing to make broth for soup and chicken to add to jambalaya. I have smoked sausage and shrimp in freezers.Goal was to put 2 meals (correct serving size as we are trying to eat healthy and balanced) in the freezer of each thing. Meatballs we use a lot of in different dishes  I can get 10 meals (2 servings for dinner and one for Hubby's lunch ) out of the meatballs.I canned 8 pints of spicy chili for Hubby and 8 pints of mild for myself and then had 2-12 oz jars on mixed chili for like Cinncy spag or nachos.This will last almost 3 mos and I made it from dried beans instead of ordering the cans of chili beans with sauce we prefer since it's no longer sold around here. Saved over $30 by doing that.Our main problem out here in the boonies LOL, is when I am too tired(thanks to Heart failure) that I am not up to cooking and Hubby isn't always able with getting around for work in the evenings. If I have the entree done, he can handle the sides and dishes before he leaves.At this point we are at $420 for groceries and eating out, 3 times eating out, once with friends who go to the Hong Kong buffet maybe every 6 wks. We had a coupon for 10% off  and then once fast food when we realized we weren't going to make it home in time for eat before Hubby had to go to work and then tonight is pizza from town (a treat) from our favorite place as Hubby is working Home Land Security all day and is already in town and I'm down sick. Nothing serious just enough to having me falling asleep in nothing flat but not staying asleep because I feel like CRAP. Already had the virus that is going around. I thought allergies but now since my allergy meds are not helping I got a feeling its a sinus infection that Doc thought was ending, I think it was just beginning. Our health ins is changing. We are required to do certain preventive care and some activities to get it for free and they let us know it's changing it's policy but NOT what is changing except the preventive care remains the same. We talked about if it goes digital (they use fitbit) We will have to either suck up the cost to buy new cell phones and the bands or suck up the cost of the ins. Neither we can really afford at this time BUT the changes starts in Jan so we have time to save up if needed. Until Jan Hubby's company has set a program that everyone can do, it's eating more colors of fruit and veggies and more servings, drinking water and exercising more (steps to be exact) and weight goal through the holidays. Remaining the same weight counts.If you need to gain weight that counts also...it's not about losing weight but being healthy. Something as a retired personal chef I approve of and need to focus more on in my own life. I did get a list of the veggies and fruit for each color...and printed it off to see what I already had in the pantry and freezers and what I needed to look at getting put up to cover that activity Between what I have and what I normally buy, we are pretty well set except for fruit. .I need to get back out in the gardens and clean them up, I saw blooms on a few plants the other day so I might get a second crop of tomatoes and such.We have the last of the cash needed for Christmas gag gifts (almost 2 months early), and have started searching the internet once a week (otherwise we get sucked into pinterest for hours) for ways to give the cash that is different than what we have done in years past.What have you done?"},
{"title": "Frugal going into Sept", "date": "Tuesday, August 30, 2016", "text": "Corned beef hash bought for 70¢ a can. I did cook 3 cans , one for each of us and one for Hubby's lunch, ended up with leftovers for my bfast (love that) and fried green tomatoes from garden. Batter for tomatoes was Whistle Stop Fried Green Tomato batter ( reheated nice in microwave for Hubby and didn't get soggy)that I had bought some where on clearance. AND now am hunting for it  on sale or clearance because it's the favorite batter for all that we batter fry which isn't very often. I have found it at it's own store but still checking other places for it just to make sure it's the best price especially with shipping.Leftovers have became breakfast and lunch.Appetizers have became dinner when we aren't really hungry for a full meal. We don't eat much soup as it doesn't transport well for Hubby to take to work and he takes leftovers from our dinner for his lunch.We also mixed a lot of leftovers with eggs for meals.I had my back injections which brought processing tomatoes to a halt while I recovered and then got a flu shot which always brings me down a couple days also.I did get some older tomato juice etc cooked down for BBQ sauce and got that canned while recovering since I didn't have to stand on my feet much and Hubby could stir it for me. While down I sorted through 150 lbs of softball size candy onions for storage.I had to peel about 2/3rd of them to recure as they had drew moisture and would have rotted in storage also about 10 lbs wasn't good for storage, I am dehydrating some of them and will use the rest for fresh. Rather peel a layer or two and recure than toss an onion that went bad. At least with hanging them in panty hose with knot between each, the whole bunch doesn't go bad because of one.I'm still picking up a few things that go on sale for our Tday dinner. I'm pretty close to just needing perishables and meat.I am 2 mos ahead of where I usually am for Christmas savings and have started buying stuff for the Christmas candy and baking.I have offered to help stock the kitchen for my grandson and his family when they get their first place. They stayed with parents (floated back and forth) while granddaughter was expecting but since Greatgrandbaby (LOL) is born they are looking to move out on their own once they have some extra savings up.I will help by using what we have in our own pantry.I've not been doing any large shopping...mostly a few needed items that combine coupons and sales or milk. Haven't even bought bread as the last 2 loaves had to be pitched due to mold due to how long they sat there. Maybe when we get our 2nd frig back (son bought one finally, we just need to go get it). I'll bake some and we can store it in the frig.I've started us eating from the pantry mostly....a couple months early for that but decided to go ahead and start it. I need freezer room for hams and turkeys this fall and right now I don't have any room.Our trailer broke when we hauled our son's car to the mechanics (shifter broke and the mechanic said it was from resting his hand on it),. Our neighbor runs a fabrication shop and was willing to take a look to see if he could fix it for less than $500. He called today and it was less than $200 and ready for pick up. Better than the $1500 trailer we would have to buy to replace it and we use it pretty much weekly.Propane is paid in full for the coming season. I still have some caulking and sewing to do to help keep that bill down.Electric hit $120...still last year it was closer to $185. SO not bad with stove heating canners and the dehydrator running daily along with the AC which I usually don't run this much. I do shut it off in the early mornings and open all the windows to air out the house. We are looking forward to this coming weekend as it's suppose to drop almost 20° and we won't be running it at all.I have been doing the laundry when I can use the clothes line.Any thoughts of saving?"},
{"title": "End of August goals", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2016", "text": "It's the darkest corner of the pantry in the basement and the food we use the most. It takes over 500 lbs of tomatoes (prefer Roma or paste tomatoes) to furnish a year's worth of tomato products for the two of us.I now understand why my mother was so \"short tempered\" at this time of the year with green beans, (don't need anything this yr) corn (done and in freezer) and tomatoes coming in at the same time. I remember 1000 qrt jars and 500 pint jars in the cellar and cleaning it every spring when we planted the garden. Even with me being little (under  6 ) I was helping pick the food and prep it for the canner. I'm not sure she got any much sleep since she only had one water bath canner...FYI it takes 40 min to can tomato sauce in qrts and there is 7 to a canner.1500 jars of veggies ( no fruit) lasted from Oct(Nov if the weather held and Dad could limp the crop into it) to March. When March came the cellar was pretty empty and Mom was looking for wild greens to put veggies on the table. We didn't go buy veggies at the store. We didn't grow lettuce but the neighbor did and she bartered the lettuce for potatoes that Grandpa grew that we would give her in the fall.Filling these shelves with the home canned goods of tomato products is my goal this week..Final count should be the following: top left :enchilada sauce 26 pints (have 32) There is some RoTel and a couple cans of diced tomato with jalapeno sitting on top of it.Top right: pizza sauce 26 -1/2 pints( have 29)Second shelf...bought pasta sauce (we ran out of home made and hit the clearance rack with coupons for a good score even though I end up add mustard to counter the sugar in it .) #10 cans of tomato sauce (got on sale in case tomatoes don't do well or can't get them at auction) and a few of homemade pasta sauce that I did early this yr by reusing what I had, like whole tomatoes which I only do when I am tired and needing to get the tomatoes finished before they go bad.Third shelf is some whole tomatoes that I will reprocess to make either BBQ sauce (12 pints as I use 1 a month) or pasta sauce (52 quarts needed besides what is there) I'll put diced tomatoes (need 104 but doubt if I will get that much unless I score Roma tomatoes at auction again) and the BBQ sauce on this shelfBottom shelf is empty...it will have the 52 qrts of pasta sauce.IF and only if I can have enough of everything I might can chili sauce other wise the #10 cans will go to chili.WHICH I need to can also.I am also cleaning all the shelves and inventorying what we have in this pantry.Moved some things around the other day and found stuff I didn't know we had and some things I didn't know we needed. I don't know which upset me more. I am half way through the pantry, even with just being down for back injections (still recovering and trying to not do so much and mess myself up) There is 31 shelves and I am down to 10 left to clean,organize and inventory. I plan to do 2 each day this coming week.I plan to finish the rest of the tomatoes. We still have another good month of tomatoes coming in so I should get closer to the amt I need for the yr for the diced tomatoes.I had 150 lbs of onions I have been sorting. I have 90 lbs left to go through so I figure 20 lbs a day this coming week to finish.Some need cured again due to having to be \"peeled\" because the skins got damp which will rot the onions while hanging( tied in panty hose and hung) in storage, better to lose a couple layers now than the whole onion later.I will dehydrate any that are going to go bad soon but most look good at this point. It's early for storage onions but that's how it is this year. I figure maybe by Dec/Jan I will have to be looking for other onions if I don't dehydrate any.I'm restricted in the gardens (doc knows me so well ) that I can only be out in them with Hubby so I won't get side tracked and try to clean up the gardens in one or two days. We figure maybe 15 min a couple times a day until we see how the back hold, actually it's my neck that is causing the slow down as it's still swollen from the injections (not infection) and causing issues with looking down or up for any length of time.I have cayenne peppers, mints and herbs to dehydrate and some eggs for noodles that I make at TDay. Eggs are still below 90¢ a dozen here.What are your goals this week?"},
{"title": "Staying on Task of being frugal", "date": "Tuesday, August 9, 2016", "text": "BLT's for dinner one night. I went in to Aldi's to get eggs (69¢/dozen) and milk and they had thick sliced bacon on sale for $5.99 for 1 1/2 lbs. I grabbed 2 packages and went out to tell Hubby and he went back in and got 2 more plus more eggs.We haven't had bacon in quite awhile, especially thick sliced. The lettuce and tomatoes came from the gardens.I started baking my bacon awhile back so I could actually sit down and eat with Hubby. I like my bacon crisp and he likes is not crisp (cooked but pliable?) I saved the bacon grease.Last night we had ratatouille( this picture is BEFORE baking) with polenta. Polenta was on clearance at the grocery store awhile back for 25¢ a box. I took all the boxes they had since it was instant and made 4 servings. Most of the veggies came from the gardens.My yellow bell peppers aren't ready yet so that didn't get put in.I refrigerated the last serving of polenta in a flat pan and then cut it into squares to make fried mush from it.I started working on \"making\" my craft/sewing room. I used primer that we had and will be using paint we also had instead of buying new.I found a picture on the internet of what I would love to have, not willing or even able to pay the $2000 to put it together so am looking at what I can find that we already have to set it up that way.I mended a couple shirts for Hubby.I harvest thyme,oregano, chives ,all the mints (again still some more SMILING)I harvested tomatoes,lettuce, bell peppers,red bell peppers, and eggplant for meals.I made rubber chicken (roasted first meal,then chicken and dumplings (which is actually making 2 meals as one meal is in the freezer for this coming Friday after we get home from the produce auction) and then added it to eggs for what we call big egg (frittata), I got some broth left over from it and some chicken fat to use later.We didn't do any shopping except for Aldi's which saved us money even though Miss Kira and Rascal felt deprived as they are used to going for a ride two to three times a week.Which that saved us gas money as it's 15 miles one way to town.Hubby rode the motorcycle all week to work. Not sure if that will happen this week as we have sever storms in the forecast.I did some fall cleaning in what I call our canning area of the basement. It's where I store the canning equipment,baking pans and those items that there isn't room for in the kitchen (old farm house).  I  store the window AC, potatoes,sweet potatoes and winter squash in this area also so usually in Aug it gets a good cleaning before the AC goes back in storage. (we use the window AC for when I don't want to run the central air but Hubby works nights so he sleeps days. Bedroom gets hot). I had some boxes with what I thought was vinyl tablecloths we use at the reunion and Tday and curtains....well...that's what was on top, what was under that was several boxes of sandwich bags, long heavy duty foil and non stick foil.There is a few more boxes down there I need to check through before doing any shopping.We redid our budget...then the landlord gave us the update about propane. Usually he just pays it (gets a discount and passes it along to us since he buys for himself at the same time). We usually own him a couple hundred as I make \"budget\" payments all year....we are paid in full. YEAH!!!! Also, we dropped more than I thought so I can lower what we budgeted for next year. He also let us know he changed electric providers and it dropped our electric bill down about $50 less of where it would have been. Aug is our worst month (hottest and most humid) followed by Dec (baking for Tday and start of Christmas lights and baking) then Jan (Christmas lights and the last of the baking).My youngest and I have been going over the Tday dinner menu, figuring out what wasn't eaten, what is needed, sales etc.She acknowledged that it's pretty much cut as much as possible unless the kids start chipping in more.Right now the ones that can afford to do, we figure what we do is part of their Christmas. She's what we fondly say is the tightest person to do a budget or grocery shop with. I've actually had her argue with me that I didn't need to buy that 3rd can of corn because it was on sale when I needed something else.And don't tell her you have cable and internet when you struggle to pay electric, heat or buy food. She got SNAP for awhile while laid off  and was having to chose between paying rent and buying food and had to attend a class...where she told the instructor they were wasteful for buying rotisserie chicken and canned beans. She took the menu the instructor had, showed what to buy instead and provided recipes and doubled how much food they could get. I had several people tell me about it before she finally admitted the instructor was making her mad for teaching wasteful habits.How was your week?"},
{"title": "August goals ", "date": "Saturday, August 6, 2016", "text": "Sit out on the front porch with my morning coffee (and according to Rascal, play ball).Miss Kira is still staying in the house, needs to cool off about 10° for her to want to be out much. She's over 11 yrs old so we don't fuss at her much about coming out with us.She does go out around the perimeter about 5:30 in the morning. I'm not ready to sit on the porch at that time.I am still struggling adjusting my routine around my health. I am thinking of physical work one morning and then not doing any more physical work until the next day afternoon to give my body time to recover and hopefully get more done than what I am without causing a total break down where I am down for the count for weeks.Keep up with the gardens coming in, tidy the gardens and plant some fall crops, not a lot just some.Clear the flower garden. Maybe get some fall pansys  for the front porch for this fall.Reset the budget. We are coming out of a chapter 13 (Hubby went to 3 days a week for 2 yrs and we pretty much sold everything we could to survive until my medical bills with my heart failure hit and buried us).We know what we have to do to rebuild our credit BUT we also realize that by paying cash for most things we don't build credit that way.Our bank suggested a secure credit card through them that would be half of what we have/will have in savings then if we got hit with another 3 day a week work we would have the money to pay it off and not be in debt (we would pay it off before due EACH month anyways, Hubby learned that lesson) and it would help build the credit. They also suggested since we both have accounts (My son is connected to mine) that we split the savings between us instead of just in Hubby's and that way neither of us pays a fee(my son pays my fee but still).Other than that they felt we were doing really good compared to others customers that went through what we did as almost everyone in this area was affected by that 3 day work week.Hubby is riding the motorcycle back and forth to work, truck takes 1 gal of gas to go to and from work,bike uses 1 gal to go 10 days to and from work. We do have to watch the weather, if storms are forecasted he doesn't ride, we had a friend get hit by lightening while riding to work and died.We caught ourselves running to town 3-4 times a week and stopped that. I figured it was over changing when we went to the store to get double fuel pts and not changing when we ran errands plus we take the dogs to the vets for nail clipping (takes 2 people to hold them down to get them clipped and someone to clip them). So I am working on scheduling things when we will already BE in town.Our youngest is helping me figure out where to cut the budget for the Tday dinner we have. We serve close to 40 people and we provide the most of the meal. I make most of it from scratch. Still through the years we have noticed the old favorites aren't getting ate and even though I don't mind the family taking home leftovers, I don't want to supply all the kids with a week's worth of groceries.Our one daughter has taken on some of the meat so that helps. Continue to save one dollar bills for Christmas gag gifts (almost have enough). THEN it will be save for the gag gift , then the wrapping paper, then the scotch tape.Also instead of both of us getting our eyeglasses the same year, we will rotate which one of us gets them.That dropped the budget $600 a year, I have big issues with my eyes . We already reuse frames unless the ins is paying for the frame. We go where our ins pays for the glasses but we both NEED the extras and the ins only pays for basic. My reading glasses (I wear 3 pairs, down from 4 prs) is my cheapest at $25. Our eye doctor runs my most expensive pair through ins first.Our mechanic (He is a BLESSING) suggested we split getting tires as get 2 tires every 6 months and put the spares in that rotation. He does this for a lot of his senior customers and himself.He is good about checking things out and maintenance. Like telling our son that his tie rod will need replaced so the next oil change that will be done also as you have to remove the oil filter to remove the tie rod.I talked to my 3 doctors, they have changed my medication so I am still being taken care of but keeping the costs down. My left thumb has a scar that peels regularly. They have prescribed different things that help some for awhile. My primary's daughter that is a doctor also that does missionary work told me to use petroleum jelly. They use it for open wounds etc in the missionary work. It has helped the most and for the longest.SO I need to focus on updating my knowledge of natural meds. Both my great grandmothers are probably rolling in their graves with lack of use I do. One was a \"wise\" woman (old Celtic) and the other a medicine woman (Cherokee/Black Foot).I  am focus on keeping the electric bill down to $100 (that's the lowest it goes here and it was running $450 when we moved in, electric heat upstairs and no insulation) and I have already dropped the propane budget down another third from last year. Which is over half from what it was (heats 1st floor only).Landlord replaced the back door( it almost fell off) so that will help. I want to do some caulking on some windows, add batting or old blankets to old curtains to help and plastic the one bedroom window upstairs that is really bad but landlord isn't going to replace it yet.Farm isn't making enough to pay for the repairs.Stock the non-food. For the first time I have a non-food list and I've been stocking it up with sales and coupons.I printed it off, highlighted with orange what was a NEED NOW, highlighted with yellow is going to need soon and highlighted with green with if on sale and have coupon. What isn't highlighted isn't needed. I do need some shelving to organize this. I have some barn doors that are coming apart, I am going to see if I can use them to make shelves.Stock the pantry. SIGH..okay deep breath , first, stock the pantry so I can make cookies and candy for Christmas....When I got eggs for 49¢ a dozen I dehydrated 12 dozen for cookies. That's the amt I need to make them. Now eggs are 79¢ a dozen, I am going to get some to dehydrate to make noodles for Tday. They usually run over $1.29 a dozen. I have been matching coupons and sales for baking items.I know I use over 50 lbs of flour so that's on the list.I updated my pantry list after the last buying session, I printed off only what is needed, if it's not on this list , I don't need to buy it even if it's on sale. My money needs to be stocking what is not already in the pantry at what I consider a \"full\" amt.I highlighted in orange what was needed now, yellow soon, green is coupons and sales BUT blue is buy in season...example is winter squash, potatoes,sweet potatoes and storage onions.Maple syrup and pie fillings at Tday. Pumpkin in Oct and Nov.Honey is starting to go up in price so I need to get it now.I'll be moving some of what I store to other places so they store better. My Dad gave me some milk crates for my potatoes with the advice to hang them from the beams or put up on wood and not on concrete.I plan to finish painting the craft room and set it up so I can do the sewing I want to get down and make the crafts for Christmas without having to keep clearing the dining table."},
{"title": "Frugal stocking of the pantry and my frugal week.", "date": "Monday, August 1, 2016", "text": "The first thing I have ever told my kids when they went out of their own was have a pantry, even if it's just one week more than you shop.Have an emergency stash of food and water for hard times whether due to weather or no job.It's frugal and it can be a life saver.I have a pantry, my kids and grandkids will tell you it's a grocery store. One that on several occasions they have had to ask for help feeding their families and were grateful I had a \"grocery store\" pantry.Yes I stock it like you would see in the store,veggies are together, fruit is together, tomato products together, sweets (pie filling, jams, fruit butters, evaporated and condensed milks etc) are together, in fact the choc chips, caramels, marshmallows are in containers in that area.I need a taller or wider area for tomato products as it takes up more than that one unit.Variety is the key to what makes us happy.IF Hubby walked in and said \"I'm down to 3 days a week\" (paycheck would equal unemployment but his company keeps the people working so they have health ins, WE ARE BLESSED)and he has in the past. I would scrap up the money and buy potatoes, onions, garlic, sweet potatoes and sugar. and that would cover us for several months. We have dog food that would need replaced but I would feed the dogs people food of corn bread mixed with veggies, especially carrots. I would even be able to do the Christmas cookies and candy for the family but not as much of it this year.I have 1400 sq ft in gardens,including veggies, herbs and strawberries. Hubby kept mowing down the other berries.We don't have fruit trees here, something we have already decided on having when we build our own home.I miss my grape harbor I grew up with.I was raised with a pantry, both of my parents had pantries (they divorced over 40 yrs ago) when I was an adult. Dad whom is still living has a small pantry still that he could eat for a month is something happened. Growing up we ate the pantry until it was gone, didn't think about how long it had been in the pantry, both parents are/were as Mother has passed several years ago for eating food that was over 5 yrs old. You live through the Great Depression, you don't throw food out EVER. I focus on eating it within 3 yrs. In their lives if things didn't grow in the gardens, or if not enough grew, you went without until growing season the following year. I, on the hand try to fill in from Amish sellers or local farmers or really cheap prices.Since we are talking of Hubby retiring, us moving and building in 3 years. I want to stock now, and the focus on eating everything so what goes in to the new home in that year while saving all that money to build a pantry in the new home.This past weekend I've been focused on restocking the pantry. Something I realized I had been neglecting and the price is going to be hard. You would think I had learned that lesson already.The white object is the top of a 5 gal food grade bucket of long grain white rice.There is 10 servings of rice (1/2 cup cooked) in a lb. I have over around 10 lbs. We use 4 servings a meal, so I have about 25 meals in that bucket. I have other buckets of rice also. I have over 100 lbs of different dried beans (15 varieties  and yes, we eat them and yes we eat meat).The top shelf is an assortment of  condiments like Asian sauces, syrups etc.I make some of the syrups.I would love to learn to make the teriyaki sauce I like. Still surfing recipes for that. The very bottom shelf is hot salsa that Hubby eats or I put in the chili he eats. My medium and mild salsa is on the shelving unit with the pasta sauce, pizza sauce and tomatoes.Even though that shelving unit is full, I'm short 26 quarts of pasta sauce and 26 half pints of pizza sauce which goes on another shelf.The middle two shelves are green beans...that Hubby doesn't like to eat but it's what is left from what he brought home for me to can.There is enough for 100 meals so we will be having green beans twice a week with one of those times being 3 bean salad which he does like.I have 5 of these shelves plus 2 that are only have as high but twice as long so they are equal to what is pictured here. I just spent the weekend filling in some of the empty spaces, even with coupons and sales combined it was a pretty penny,(savings was around 50%) luckily I had been saving grocery money from the months under budget and a few other spots to cover it.I have a 27 cubic ft, 21 cubic ft and a 7 cubic ft deep freezers along with my French door frig freezer.The freezers are full, in fact I need to focus eating out of it to have room for meat this fall) I used to have a second frig that I used for condiments, beverages and bfast foods but we lent it to our son when he bought his house over a year ago and I don't think it's coming back as he just had a roof leaking along with a drive shaft broken in his car. (But he does have a small pantry like my Dad).BUT still I have 108 items missing...not like 6 cans of hominy, like 6 different things that is 6,12, 24 of each thing. I have over 300 empty spots to fill before November 1st which is when I set my pantry to be stocked except for turkey, ham and prime rib for the freezers and potatoes,sweet potatoes and onions for the root cellar.Out of the 108, 18 things is coming from my gardens for me to make.... the rest is if we have the money, can I get it cheap and of good quality.That's a focus of 9 items to be filled each week.What I did this week?????I rolled coins to help pay for the kids and grandkids Christmas. I keep my change for this reason. Dad told me to do this.I dehydrated herbs and mints again this week and I'm dehydrating eggs that was on sale for 49¢ a dozen right now.I harvested cherry tomatoes, the last zucchini (bugs killed the plants) and another eggplant.I dug up the onions for curing for storage....no where near what I need to get through to next season.Hopefully I will score 100 lbs at the Amish auction this fall.I took my extra grocery money and with sales and coupons stocked up in over 35 areas.I also combined coupons and sales (that wasn't advertised) for paper products that I hadn't planned on buying ( looking for food on the pantry list) but couldn't justify not getting it. I won't need any for several months now.In sharing some info at the stores, I now have 2 other places that are not my normal places to check into for items that is cheaper that I buy (like freezer bags).I shop Family Dollar, Dollar General, Save A  Lot ( ours lets me order 50 lb bag of potatoes in the fall) Aldi, Walmart, Kroger, Wagner's IGA, Anna Market IGA, Winner's Meats (also does frozen case sales of fruit and veggies in July), KAH meats, Walter's Meats and the Scioto Valley (Amish) Produce Auction. Winners,KAH,Walters, and Anna Market do a meat bundle sale in Oct. I used to shop Odd Lots, that became Big Lots but they closed in our area.. I was told to check out Ollies (I get Christmas decorations there but hadn't looked at other stuff) and Foodtown. My son has an Asian market near his work that he is willing to stop and check for stuff for me as he has been buying some of his food there. Teriyaki sauce might be cheaper there along with some other Asian foods I use.I reread some of my old cook books (1937-1943), Tightwad gazette,a couple of them Appalachian and Cherokee along with a couple books with  recipes from the Great Depression, several Amish cookbooks and a couple Italian cookbooks that reflect the cooking that my own Italian grandma (Nonna) cooked....really she was my great uncles wife mother...but she adopted me as her own for better or worse. Gets me back to \"down home cooking\" instead of going out and buying a ton of things we don't really eat much of.My spices are bought at an Amish country store or Anna market. I grow most of my herbs.I have been known to go without when my harvest is low. Basil was one a couple years ago.What can you do to save or stretch what you have?"},
{"title": "Dog Days of Summer", "date": "Tuesday, July 26, 2016", "text": "Heat Index here has hit over 105° on several days, not the norm for where I live. Hot yes, 90's yes but not the index of that. My tiger lilies usually bloom during the Dog Days of Summer ,called such because the dog star Sirius raises with the sun from July 3- Aug 11 ...or something close to that, not because the dogs lay in front of the AC vents and block the cold air from you.I've been out of town off and on the last couple weeks while Hubby kept the home fires ...out , I started to say burning but he was definitely making sure the house,dogs and himself stayed cool even when the Central air broke down and the landlord couldn't get anyone in for a couple days to fix it. Over 20 yrs old but as long as it is maintained it works good, landlord's thoughts are if it's not broke , ignore it ...SIGH.I want to plant some lettuce for fall but as hot as it is right now, it would be wasting seed.Still I was able to harvest some zucchini that the bugs hadn't ate alone with an eggplant, tomatoes, onions ,and a lonely cucumber for fresh eating. IF the bugs isn't killing my plants(probably the only moisture they can find) the heat is even with watering.I dehydrated basil, choc mint, peppermint, apple mint and spearmint. I'm not going to be lacking in mint teas.I updated the pantry list, what is needed not what I have (I keep more than a year's worth of food) and printed off that list. Goal is to have it completely stocked back up by Nov 1.I appealed my denial for my back injections, and got approval.... YEAH. Now the doctor is checking to make sure WHAT exactly was approved so I don't end up with any bill afterwards.SO, it's approved but not scheduled yet.I  mended a full laundry basket of hand mending that was scattered through the house.I shared a carry out Chinese dinner with my son when he got back in town, and I bought extra  to feed Hubby and me for a couple days, I think with the stuff I am adding to it we will get a 2rd day out of it.That's probably good since we are getting a bit tired of it but with what is left we can freeze if needed so it doesn't go to waste.What did you do this week?"},
{"title": "Frugal week", "date": "Tuesday, July 19, 2016", "text": "I have dehydrated apple mint,spearmint, choc mint, peppermint, lemon balm,strawberries,peaches and basil.I have made over 30 jars of peach jelly/jam/butter. I lost count of the strawberry jam. But probably not enough to go a year if I don't make sure Hubby doesn't just eat it.I canned peaches.I canned different syrups, mind just went blank ...I might have canned my mind LOLI made strawberry popsicles .The garden is doing fair considering I am battling tomato horn worms, potato worms and squash bugs (yes I got some zucchini, but the bugs are doing a better job of eating them then we are). Using homemade sprays to deal with it but with the way we are seeing moths (groups) I swear they think my gardens are the maternity ward.Garden pickings: tomatoes, cherry tomatoes. zucchini. cucumber,green onions,lettuce(now going to seed to replant next yr) and a couple strawberries (starting to rebloom but this heat wave coming in will stop that).I fixed 3 afghans with yarn I already have.I sat down and made a list of that \"get this done and off this list\" stuff and then did a time mgt list of it... I doubled the time I thought it would take and a couple things I tripled the time. Reflection of my age and health.I used the grill and microwave on the hot days. Used the all in one pressure cooker for potatoes to make home fries and mashed potatoes.I keep the curtains pulled across the top of the windows (use binder clip that was given to me) to keep the sun out and only have the part where the window is open without curtain. Our curtains are too heavy for a breeze to move much. We run the AC during the hottest part of the day and the fans in the rooms we are in (or the older dog is in) the rest of the time with windows open.I transplanted some popcorn (Hubby said it couldn't be done) that was pulled. Most of it actually is growing. We'll see how that goes.Made pepper spray and some other homemade sprays to fight the infestation of bugs in my garden and regretfully they aren't the good bugs.Used my swagbucks to pay for household item needed from AmazonHad to use the laundromat (had things that wouldn't go through the wringer washer) and hung everything up on the line instead of using the dryers.I wrote a letter to my ins requesting still another appeal, hoping I don't have to do more to get them to approve the shots they have been paying for during the last 2 yrs. I dislike policy changes that don't acknowledge BIRTH DEFECTS.I inventoried my pantry (not freezers) and made a list of what needed to be brought up in supplies .BIG thank you to Brandi (www,theprudenthomemaker.com) for her pantry list, makes it easy for me to double check with.Our landlord had the AC unit fixed, since I warned him before the season it would be time for maintenance this summer, he scheduled itBecause I caulked more windows, used plastic and heavier curtains our heat(propane) bill has come down. We actually didn't use the last tank , warm winter helped there. SO I had a credit, enough to pay for the summer fill and still some. Landlord thinks I might owe him around $50 and that makes the heat bill for this coming winter paid in full unless it's a bad winter and we go over the amt we ordered.Saved 80¢ a gal on fuel with our points card.We did a major shopping once and have been just picking up as we need at the local small grocery store. I think we might end up under budget because of it.Blessed Be..."},
{"title": "Putting on the frugal thinking hat", "date": "Monday, June 27, 2016", "text": "I had to really put on the frugal thinking cap this past week.First I really really screwed up and left two of my computers and rolling brief case in my son's dining room. He lives an hour away....the good part of that is it was left in his dining room and not out on the front curb that I have feared I had done. More frugal to drive to pick them up than to replace them???? Still we had to go get them so I decided we would go ahead and run some other errands that wasn't suppose to be done until next month. SAVE GAS at least.This is the garlic I harvest a week or so ago.It's cured so I can cut the stalks and trim the roots for storage . Then I will pull the next batch that is ready. Nice this year that it's ready a couple weeks apart instead of last year when I have over 100 heads come in at one time.I wasn't set up to cure that many at once and had to scramble to get it done.I harvested and processed lemon balm, spearmint , peppermint, apple mint, choc.mint, basil, thyme, oregano,garlic chives, chives, cilantro, dill, rosemary, green onions, cucumbers, lettuce and the last of the rhubarb and strawberries(unless they bloom again, last year they did).NOTE !!!!! I might have zucchini this year!!!! YES REALLY, it's okay you can laugh because I must be the only person that can't grow zucchini. I might get one or two off the plant and then it dies....BUT this year I planted it in the north garden in the straw bales(experiment garden) and it's got blooms and little, little zucchinis LOL!!!!We have ate out a couple times, but did think about the price and getting the best deal when we did. About 4 times we were gone all day, we do take water with us and usually drink only water at meals eating out.Some places will let us share a meal without charging extra, the ones that don't we automatically ask for a box and immediately put half of the meal in the box to go home.We had one meal I made in to 3 more with the leftovers.Our health ins has decided to no longer pay for the injections I get in my back (birth deformity and I don't take pain meds for several reasons). Our first thought was pay cash (not frugal at all but this was already the last resort for pain relief so I could walk, lay and sit without pain,doctor is willing to accept the same cash payment as our ins was paying.). Then we decided to run with the appeal system. My doctor is already appealing from his side. They say it's not medical problem and then would accept a new MRI but won't approve a new MRI.Seems like every 5 yrs I have this battle. BUT my Dad has told me to adjust that when you get 65 it's a common battle. This will be one that if denied I will have to pay cash for. It's the only thing that keeps me pain free enough to walk,sit and lay.SO we figured it in our \"future budget\" along with increases because we know it will only go up.So the thoughts circled around...how can we afford to build our dream home on our dream land and pay this much out in health issues? What can we do NOW to provide for later? We had already planned $2000 (yes that high) for health based on what we were hearing from others that are retired and have some of the same issues, actually I doubled the amt, figuring on it going up.Which is the main reason Hubby hasn't retired out, No sense retiring out and then coming right back in part time as a temp to the same job to pay for ins.So I started a list of things we can cut now and save more. Nonfood and Food was #1, using car,truck etc #2.Changing from what we use to what we can make do with #3. I would rather make do NOW then when we are in our 70s and 80s like my Mom and Pop was and having to go without.I am my Dad's child instead of Mom's. Dad is frugal, Mom and Pop were spendthrifts.ANOTHER thought was transfer the money we save immediately to the savings and not letting it sit in the checking where it might get piddled away. We are very good at piddling away.Dad gave me a new recipe that he has been cooking once a week for soup (cabbage,beans,corn, tomatoes and some times onion) that I haven't tried yet...I think it's because Nonna used to make bean soup, then add veggies the second day,pasta or rice the third and then serve what ever was left over stale bread the fourth. I ate that a lot during the summers since I pretty much stayed with her if I wasn't working.We have a baby shower for that is for our upcoming great grandbaby  that is due in Aug. We decided to wait until William is born. Our grandkids are okay with that as this will be the first of  5th the generation and they figure they will get over loaded at the shower and at birth. Grandson mentioned diapers and wipes from Sam's club in a couple months, but the Mommy asked for a membership instead along with a breast pump.I was having problems with my nose, still have sutures from surgery that was in March that was supposed to dissolved, could have told the doctor they wouldn't. He did tell me after checking the issue that if I used a saline spray or did a saline rinse at least at night and fluffing my bedding and pillows weekly I would be able cut back on the allergy meds. By doing that I haven't had to take an meds all week, that saved $10.I was already fluffing, sometimes in the dryer with no heat and sometimes just hang it on the clothes line. I like the clothes line better because of the fresh smell.I trI been more diligent in turning off lights and power cords. Second month in a row that our electric bill has been at $100 instead of the usually $150,(landlords was over $200 and has the same size house and everything) EVEN with running the Central Air.I try to run the dehydrator at night as much as possible but sometimes I'm pushing load after load and end up running it through the day. Hubby is riding the motorcycle instead of driving the truck to work. That has saved almost $100 this month.He doesn't ride the bike when there is thunderstorms in the forecast.We went to Sam's club. I wanted to do some pricing while picking up diapers for a friend that is having a baby. Made several notes of what I stock up for holidays and winter and bought POM toilet paper....45 big rolls for $19.98.that's around 0.444¢ per roll when Cottonelle (our favorite) and Charmin (second favorite) is around $1.00 a roll. Hubby said it was like work TP....which means very thin...not sure it will save us any money if we use more but with the thought we can use twice as much and still be saving.We got dog food cheaper at Sam's. Bigger bag and for the same price we pay for a lot smaller bag.We also went to Jungle Jim's International market and I priced condiments and rice there. CHEAPER there even with the price of gas to driving there especially if we go after making a round to the kids. Everyone is an hour away and Jungle Jim's is only 30 min past the kids.I also got some peaches for 79¢ a pound there and now have them dehydrated.Found my favorite tea and got a couple boxes for my girlfriend and myself. It was about half the price I used to pay for it when I could get it locally. I usually buy it as a \"gift\" for myself at Christmas and birthday and haven't been able to find it in over  a year.Hubby did ask, said he was afraid to but thought of it, how long can I go on this pantry (speaking of food and not the non-food)with buying only necessities/perishables...Last time he asked that I stretched a 6 month pantry for a year. I just told him we would find out.We have case sales (frozen food not cans) next month. I need to figure out if I have the room and what I want to fill that up with to place the order in the next couple weeks.Any Frugal thoughts?"},
{"title": "Reading Brandi The Prudent Homemaker Saving Money", "date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2016", "text": "Once a month if not more often I reread through Brandi's site of The Prudent Homemaker.Today I reread Saving Money. Brandi gives 41 suggestions of saving money. We do all but 7.This afternoon I decide to really look at why we don't do that 7 and what do we do instead.We have cell phones, we don't share a plan. Both plans are below $50 each. Hubby is a weather spotter and connected with Homeland security(unpaid both jobs), he needed a better phone than what he had for apps he needed and found a really good phone(made the grandkids green with envy because they paid 3 times as much for the same phone) at a provider and still was below $50 plan unlimited. I stayed with what I had and where I was...I keep a cell phone on me since I had a heart attack driving home to the boonies from the city....AND there was no houses around. I dry swallowed 3 aspirin that I do carry to get myself home to the phone.We have a home phone because we can't have internet without it here AND the local fire dept/squad does home phones with their 911. Cell phones go through another trace. Already takes over 10 mins to get to us , don't need to add more.1 car...we have a SUV, a truck and a motorcycle all paid off and over 10 yrs old(truck will be 20 yrs old next yr) We both can drive the bike. Hubby uses it for work weather permitting, the truck gets driven the most , good old work truck. we limit trips to town to no more than twice a week if that. The SUV is for when I can't walk right and can't climb in the truck or when we go to my Dad's because he no longer has a car and he can't get in the truck any more. We do acknowledge with age we will be giving up all 3 and getting a car that I can drop into.We no longer resole shoes...ONLY because the nearest repair is 1 hr away from us 1 way. Cost is gas is more than the cost of replacing our shoes. When we move at retirement this will go back to being done as there is one within  10 miles of our son.I don't go to the library. It's out of the way and an extra trip. I do borrow books from my one daughter as she is a reader like I am and enjoys the same type of books as me and I don't have to worry about an over due fine. That still saves money.I stopped baking my own bread when it became the two of us...bread will mold faster when it's home made. I am looking at starting this back up since I have found a couple recipes that makes smaller loaves. We just aren't big bread eaters.We don't unplug most appliances. I do unplug my laptop and the tv in the bedroom after Hubby gets out of bed (he goes to sleep watching the weather) ....but Hubby just refuses to work with me on this. I will have to say that our landlord's wife requires he unplug his alarm clock daily but she refuses to open the windows and turn off the AC...I really think this choice is weird LOLWe don't collect water from the shower....one is we turn it on and get in, our hot water tank is right below the shower., wait time is not there, two we don't live in town or I would probably insist on this even without a wait time since we are on a well here and would be paying for water in town. We do turn off the water while brushing teeth and have used rain barrels over the years for the gardens.I have a watering can that sits out also for rain.Soup once a day, I'm lucky if I can get Hubby to eat soup once a month at this point. He does hard manual labor around furnaces that  have him in heat over 100° daily.We have talked about him eating soup instead of cold cereal before he lays down but he isn't willing at this point.I will say he used to farm, pigs and cattle and was raised with meat and potatoes 3 meals a day....he has adjusted a lot since we married to not having that. His favorite meal is what we call 123 pasta with very little meat at all in it.What are your thoughts on saving?When Hubby came home from work the other day and said \"production is running every weekend until Jan.\"We both knew GOD was letting us know we were going to need the extra income.First, we got the refrigerator fixed, it is running fine and the rental one is going back tomorrow. We don't have a FB garage sale in this area nor is most of Craig's list for this area. We are the boonies LOL. I spent $33 including eggs for 69¢ a doz to replace the necessities that we lost in the frig and replaced nothing in the freezer.THEN my back injections have been denied because the problems in a birth defect. Doctor's office is doing the appeals and told me it could take up to 4 months...mean time they advised me to get yoga (already do that at home for free), massage therapy and chiropractic care , neither that ins will pay for any more for me due to birth defect. Made a couple phone calls and found a Chiro that will accept cash payment equal to what he would get from our ins.Hubby's employer has a wellness (gym) center and they have massage therapy there that is about half the price of else where. I was trying to figure out where to rob Peter to pay this Paul when I went to refill my meds and found they are now generic and my doctor always marks that generic can be used so the price was 1/10th of the normal out go and actually the difference will pretty much pay for the chiro and massage.Still appealing to get the other 2 bills paid, was told it might take 3-4 appeals including an outside appeal which is available through Hubby's employer for free.I harvested thyme, oregano,basil, cilantro, garlic chives, chives, rosemary, lemon balm, choc. mint, spearmint, peppermint, apple mint,lavender, rose petals,flat parsley, curly parsley, strawberries, rhubarb, cucumbers, garlic scapes,lettuce and green onions.We are eating from the pantry. Taking stuff we don't want (yard sales were we are at in the country doesn't do well enough to do anything) to our youngest.AND why did I post the two pictures? We know we plan to move closer to the kids, grandkids, greatgrandson when Hubby retires. We plan to retire in 3-5 yrs...we decided after listening to other to start checking out house plans and houses because everyone said they looked of a couple of years.  We feel this is the model we want built. We will do some changes due to me being in a wheelchair before I die (wasn't suppose to ever walk to begin with). This really seemed to fit. We have talked to this builder about 20 yrs ago when we thought about building and they talked us into waiting, 5 kids in their teens, they didn't think we needed the size of house we were planning.SO to stay frugal and stay on track, I took several pictures and a video of the model to look at and remember why we are going the extra mile to be frugal and save save save."},
{"title": "June 9th, frugal week with a refrigerator broke down ", "date": "Thursday, June 9, 2016", "text": "Our first \"meal\" mostly from the garden. A nice salad of home grown lettuce,cucumber, garlic scapes,green onions,and strawberries topped with diced grilled chicken breast. YUMStrawberries are coming in about every 3 days, about 2 cups at a time. Nice amount for the two of us to eat up but not to put any in the freezer.I had a shoe insole come loose, since I wear a size 3 it's hard to find replacement insoles, so I put the insole back in as best as I could and used a hair dryer to heat the insole up , hoping there is enough adhesive to warm up and attached the insole back in.I sewed a button on Hubby's pants.I've dried rose petals for rose petal tea.I've dried lavender for lavender tea.I've dried cilantro,dill,basil,thyme,oregano,flat parsley,curly parsley,garlic chives,and rosemary.I run the dehydrator in the late evening so I don't heat up the house.Our refrigerator went out and we lost over 2/3rd of the perishables (shredded cheese with poof up the bag when it's had too much heat) and  half of what was in the freezer by time we figured out it wasn't going to be fixed right away as the parts were hard to find and we got another (Thank you Rent a Center that allowed us to rent for 2 wks) frig to transfer to which was smaller, a lot smaller than we had.Hard hit as I had to use June's grocery money to fix the frig (repair man warned us to save up because it's going to die probably within a year)and rent the other frig. I plan to limp us until July without robbing Peter to pay Paul.Taking some advice from Brandi over at The Prudent Homemaker, I scrubbed out the frig while it was down while waiting for parts to come in . For what ever reason a nice clean frig even broke down made me feel better than one that was sitting there needing a wipe out and broke down.I called a doctor's billing to find out what was going on, we haven't gotten the bill in 3 months and the office said it was still pending ins and ins said it's paid. Ins didn't pay all of it and the billing office was appealing the lack of payment instead of just charging us and then having us appeal it...NICE .I also had to call another doctor to find out if my procedure was preapproved and the answer was NOT yet....sigh, the ins did say it's in the final round and the hold up is because the procedure is changed from what I've had done the last 4 yrs...last year I didn't have to have preapproval...change in all ins (not just mine) in this procedure.Hope you all have a frugal week."},
{"title": "Frugal time ", "date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2016", "text": "Rambling Rose is what my Dad calls this, I just wished whom ever planted it had not put it right against the corner of the house where the rain down spout is and no way to put a trellis or anything behind it. Still both dogs will walk between it and the bush and past it to walk through my just started perennial flower garden.Miss Kira will lay it the garden.I think she decided that instead of stopping to smell the roses she was stopping to lay in the flower garden on top of my irises. I picked Sweet Williams, irises (that someone smashed with her body) and lavender for flowers for my table. I dried some lavender to tea and sachets.I harvested and dried basil,chives,garlic chives, rosemary, dill,flat parsley, curly parsley and spearmint.I harvested 2 different lettuces,cucumbers,rhubarb and a few strawberries.We have saved enough to no longer pay bank fee so that money goes to the savings now also.We paid off one bill in full so we are down to 6 (not counting possible medical bill if the ins doesn't pay any for my procedure for my back).IF we don't have replace a truck or car we are on task to be debt free before Hubby retires in 3 yrsI have repaired and washed soaker hoses so they are working another year with Rascal's \"help\" which was \"Mom bend over and throw this ball,okay, Mom wash the ball instead of the hoses\" . SMILINGI transferred my earnings from surveys to gift to my grandson and his lady that are graduating.We are running a room AC that my son gave us (newer and bigger than what we had) for the bedroom when Hubby sleeps days (get turned on when he goes to bed and off when he gets out of bed). I leave the windows open, close curtains against the sun and run one fan that is mainly for our 2 black dogs , they hog it even if I had it on for myself. We turned the central air on over the weekend as the landlord wanted to make sure it was running correctly. Dogs loved it. We hated the thought of what it was doing to the electric bill though when the humidity is up I know I will have to use it some.We are using the grill most nights. Yesterday I used the charcoal side as a smoker, have been given lots of wood chips for smoking. Bought a pork butt . Took less time than I thought, glad a friend told me to check temp of meat at 3 hr mark no matter how long it said it would take.  We had it last night and will again for another meal and then the rest will be packaged and froze for those night neither of us wants to fix anything.I have used the clothes line for the last 2 weeks solid.My Dad is slowly clearing out his house so when he dies my brother and I won't have to deal with so much. He gave me a car load of canning jars, a water bath canner that can double as a stock pot, canning rings and lids he bought last year (he didn't even plant his 9 tomato plants this year),a corn jabber (how they planted corn in the old days) and an antique hand cultivator. We go back up this week to get a gas grill he no longer uses for our youngest daughter.We went to Kroger's on the weekend ( I usually shop Thurs.) so we can get double fuel points for what little we do get now days as warm weather is eat from the pantry and garden time.I put the button back on Hubby's pants.We bought a beverage igloo (clearance) and now fill it with ice (we have to buy ice, no room for it in freezer since I \"lent\" the extra frig to son) and the filter pitcher water. Found we are drinking far less of anything else and just drinking the water. It's sitting on the corner of the kitchen table so we pass it when heading to the frig or coffee pot.Have was your week?"},
{"title": "Frugal week....some LOL", "date": "Monday, May 16, 2016", "text": "I planted the last of the sweet potato slips I had raised....only to have them hit by frost the last 2 days. I am hoping that dead leaves is the only thing that died on them. I think the eggplant got nailed also, but if that's all I lost, that's not bad.I picked some rhubarb and added it a casserole we were having as there wasn't enough to really do anything else with.I picked cucumbers and we had them for supper.I repaired our trellises to the gardens with what I already had.I used red yarn I had from my yarn stash to tie the tomato plants to the bamboo poles and trellises.Planted peppers,strawberries, onions, broccoli, cauliflower,basil,cilantro,rosemary, chocolate mint, peppermint, spearmint and more tomatoes in the gardens and pots..We gave 4 flats of different plants to a friend who just had her 7th daughter.We gave 5 flats of different plants to 3 of our kids that are trying  to garden and put fresh food on the table.I went through my seeds and gathered what I want to plant this coming week/weekend.I went through the produce that was in storage in the upstairs and brought it down to the kitchen to focus on using it up and looked up some new recipes for using it. One that will be tried is spaghetti squash as hash browns.I set the big dehydrator up so I can deal with the last 4 pumpkins this week. I'll cut them into pieces , bake and then peel and then puree in the food processor and then dehydrate...THEN grind to powder in the blender and store in mason jars. I use it in powdered form a lot fast that way since it's just us and I don't want to open a pint of pumpkin. Easy to toss powdered into sauces and stews also for a bit more nutrition.We ate from home, though I did buy some things from the deli at the local IGA  for over the weekend as we going to be gone 2 days most the day and I knew our habit to whine \"we'll have to cook\" would cause us to buy out.I chose things that were on sale and then got 5 cents off for bringing my own bags and fuel pts.  Good thing I did as Hubby got sick and I was asleep on my feet when we got back in both nights.Would have costs us 3 times as much to order out or get fast food than what I spent Helped us limp through the weekend into this afternoon (both of us still battling feeling ill) when we finished it for lunch instead of the order of pizza and chef salad we would have went with or fried chicken from the local restaurant.I went to Aldi's for my fruits and vegetables. They have good food a lot cheaper than other stores.I got $3 off 2 different packages of refrigerated ravioli that they will no longer carry. They don't sale well here. I shopped Krogers for the sales and moved our grocery day from Thursday to Friday so we could get double fuel points. I had over $25 in coupons and clearance there.Still about 1/4 under budget, we run mid-month to mid-month. WHICH was good as the printer DIED and that's not something we can go long without and we went to physically see the one I picked out to order on line at a store we were going by anyways between deliveries to the kids and found one like we used to have that was over $200 for $110(about $50 cheaper than the one I had planned to buy). So I paid for it out of the grocery money and STILL am under budget. That money now goes back for meat in the fall.My older daughter gave me some skorts that a co-worker was getting rid of, they were big on my daughter so she knew they would fit me. Means the fabric I just bought can be saved for later or used for something else. A couple of the skorts still had tags on them.I did/do have 2 stress fractures in my feet...I have tape and knew how to deal with that. Will have to get new shoes as these are definitely worn out and no longer supporting my feet. I try not to wait too long because I do get stress fractures easy (bones in ball of feet too close together) and KNOW better.SO buying a new set of every day shoes is on the to do list this week.I'm still dealing with issues of my nose....see the ENT doctor on Friday and hopefully (probably wishful thinking) he can do something about the constant blockage on the left side and the bruising that turns even my right eye lids black and blue. I thought the first round of surgery had dealt with the issues, seems like it just transferred the problem to the other side of my nose even though BOTH sides were fixed. LOL  The BLESSING is I do NOT have nose bleeds any more...probably just jinxed myself.So the expense of tissues is WAY down.I have cut the electric bill down again. Even the landlord was shocked as it's NEVER been this low in over 10 yrs. I think I just walk behind my Hubby and unplug and turn off things.I continue to use the water filter pitcher for our drinking water and coffee makers instead of buying water.I used the empty water jugs to fill for emergency water. Figured I wouldn't be making coffee in the coffee maker if there was no electric to run the pump.I started putting back distilled water for the humidifier for this fall and winter. Figured I could pick up a case (3-1 gal jugs) a couple times a week I should have enough to get a good start this fall. It takes 21 galls a week during Dec - Feb. BUT by keeping the humidity up, we can keep the heat down and we don't have the sinus problems either.Hope everyone is having a great week.Blessed be Which is dry peas, beans, lentils and chickpeas. Check this out for more information of eating Mediterranean.http://oldwayspt.org/community/blog/8-ways-eat-mediterraneanA cook book my son suggested and I love is Italian Country Cooking  The Secrets of Cucina Povera by Loukie Werle. My favorite being Pancetta,red wine and radicchio risotto.My Nonna (actually my great uncle's mother in law, my adopted by heart grandma) was from the old country...Italy...Northern Italy. They raised cattle so beef there and here. Meals are more \"earthy\" in the north than the south that has access to the sea and it's food. More cream and butter in the north with more tomatoes and salads in the south.I loved and felt more at home at Nonna's than any where else. Looking back I know it was the lifestyle and the food that I was comfortable with.My parents grew up eating beans, fried potatoes if they had it, bread....and if they had it,milk gravy and bread or oatmeal for breakfast. My Dad never saw a day that there wasn't something on the table to eat.My Mom wasn't so lucky. There was time neither of them got anything for Christmas or their birthdays but felt lucky because the family was together and could sing together. Other families during the Great Depression didn't have their families together.In that, Mom wasn't much of a cook, Dad actually was better, being the only boy and the middle child he was taught by his sisters(his mom was disabled completely), Mom taught me to read a recipe, Dad taught me to cook without one.Nonna....raised poor, married poor,  and lived a different way.I learned about frugal meals that were flavorful and healthy. How to grow vegetables that my parents had never heard of and how to preserve them.Now that I'm older I understand that the convenience of our food has caused our health more harm than it has ever given with easy it was suppose to be.Check out oldways"},

He will stay with me even during the hottest part of the day so I set my timer to make sure he (and myself) get a break from the sun and get a good drink of water. I can toss his ball that he usually goes no where without into the shade and sometimes he will just lay there with it as long as he can see meVolunteer garlic, ended up being 30 plants I transferred to another garden as we were digging that old one up completely and had moved what herbs were in it to another garden.Makes up for the garlic that didn't grow over the winter. I do better with fall planted garlic so we will see how this goes.Kira, or Miss Kira as our daughter that talked me into going to the no kill shelter that thought it was closing its door to get her due to her being a black lab retriever like our daughter's late dog and being named Kira like her....She is her daddy's girl. IF he is sleeping she is either in the room beside the bed with him or at the bedroom door. She check on me but she prefers to be protecting her daddy. We went to auction and got most of the plants I wanted/needed. What we didn't get we got at an Amish green house (low priced), our local hardware store (had a sale) and Walmart (on Sale). We had to buy potting soil for straw bales and garden dirt for the sq ft gardens that needed redone . Kind of kicked our rears for not buying the garden dirt last fall when it goes on clearance but since we were buying so much the manager discounted it for us.STILL we came in under budget for the gardens compared to the last 3 yrs of about 1/3 rd. I stopped looking at the sales ads from the local grocery stores when they come in. If I don't NEED anything, I'm not going and seeing something on sale triggers the \"might not find it cheaper and have to go without\" even though there is no place for it...Hoarding is NOT good . Pantry and freezers are full.Frig isn't crowded.I am trying to use up some condiments that we don't use often to get them out of the frig and NOT restock them.I did some ordering using coupons, sales, swagbucks... I got some patterns of clothes of the style I prefer to wear that was on clearance, saving 80%. I saved 50% off my order for nonfood pantry items and we saved 50% of getting our lawn mowers fixed and regular maintenance by having one of Hubby's coworkers do it instead of the local shop. Hubby doesn't do that type of thing.We have to buy drinking water here as the well water even ran through a whole house filter system isn't fit to drink or even using in the coffee maker. I found my old water filter pitcher, got new filters for it and ran water through it. After figuring out the price of filters etc we will save about 50% using the filter. Since we don't drink cold water I don't have to deal with it taking up space in the frig.We ate out twice, once with friends and the other while going to auction, both times using coupons and then got ice cream...not with coupon.We didn't throw out any food...nothing. Usually something slips by but not this week.What have you done frugal?Blessed Be"},

Friday we will be going back to the Amish produce auction to hopefully be able to get the last of the vegetables we plant as it is a lot cheaper to buy it there than even the green house.I plan to eat more from the pantry, eat 5 veggies and 3 fruit a day along drinking more water and walking the perimeter more often with the dogs. I plan to start back up on my yoga that I had to quit doing while dealing with the nose issues.I plan to be better organized about our meals. I don't think I can do the cook today, left over tomorrow as our one son does because Hubby takes leftovers for his lunch. I will have to make sure I prep as with the gardens going in and everything else, I won't want to walk in the house at 4 pm and wonder how to get dinner on the table by 5 pm when everything is frozen. I do have an Instantpot that two of my kids rave about their own. They forget to thaw and it seems to save them from eating out. One is single and the other is a family of 7 (or more depending on how many friends are at the table).I plan to continue \"decluttering/down sizing\" what we have and deep cleaning and winterizing as I go.I plan to finish getting stuff to start using the smoker that is attached to our grill and to use BOTH regularly.I plan to create a picnic area close to the grill, an area for the portable fire pit and deal with a couple areas that we step off the front porch that is starting to be a mud spot instead of a grass area.I plan to do my sewing on a regular bases. No sense having the fabric if I'm not going to use it.I plan to start working on some afghans that the family needed mended and crafts for the Christmas gifts and new great grandson that is due in Aug.I plan to paint the room I want to turn into my craft room.I plan to get out of bed earlier as I think I am starting to over sleep...after of years of not sleeping well, the nose surgery side benefit was I can stay asleep.

But I miss the routine of the home.Something I have struggled with since running a home when I turned 13 is getting my own routine of home care that I refer to as Home Blessing.When the kids were little, no problem, when the kids were teens, no problem. When I worked out of state 2 wks out of every month for 8 yrs, no problem. When our grandson lived with us for a year, no problem.Pushing 60, just the two of us and two dogs (four legged kids) BIG PROBLEM .SO if you have the same problem, no matter what your age...you are not alone.

The two red ones are my son's I picked tulips for my kitchen window (in picture) and bathroom counter.Dad let me dig these up in his yard last fall so I planted them.They didn't bloom well due to the weather. If I can get them growing better next year I will share them with my kids so they can have a part of their late grandmother and Dad.My son gave us a pork loin since I had helped him do yard work at his home. He paid for my gas to come down (cheaper than hiring help) and bought me lunch which provided lunch for Hubby to take to work also. I made pork chops twice, a roast and cubed some for casserole. We have had 6 meals from it. Well worth the $8 he paid for the loin. He thought I would get 2 meals from it.We cut the electric by 1/3 compared to the same time as last year.We cut the heat by almost 1/2 of when we first moved in 5 yrs ago. I have 2 more rooms to deal with and it should come down farther.I canned 4 pints of beef broth left over from a roast we had (bought on sale and put in freezer last fall).I cut rhubarb from the garden and used it for a sauce for the pork roast and for dessert. This is the first from the gardens.We went to the Amish produce auction for plants for the garden. Heavy turn out of people, not so much for the plants. The cold snap did a lot of harm in this area. We did get some lettuce, cabbage, bell and hot peppers, tomato plants and candy onion sets. The big tomato plants (3.5-4 inch pot that stood 2- 2.5 ft tall and had blooms cost us $3.50 average but we didn't pay over 25¢ per plant for the rest of them and most of them them was closer to 5¢ a plant, except the onions, that came out to being 1¢ a plant.  Candy onions are a sweet onion that store decent. I usually buy 100 lbs or more in the fall and put them in storage. They usually cost about $50 for 100 lbs. I got enough to grow that plus have green onions for the season and supply my kids (and probably their friends) for less than the cost of the 100 lbs...about half the price if not less than that as I estimated how many sets are in a flat.I transplanted 4 sweet potato slips from the potato slip mother (as I call it) and  I have about 6 more to find places for.I transplanted 2 \"twigs\" off the rose bush that Hubby dug out last fall and tossed in a pot of dirt. One looks good , the other not so much but it might be okay.I transplanted a maple tree twig that I had started last year by seed in my one sq ft garden. It's about 5 -6 inch tall. I really hope it takes off well as it's from the tree the landlord's grandfather started and planted . That tree isn't going to last much longer and I've be trying to get a tree started from it the last 5 yrs.I am to the point I can plant my straw bales, when this next weather system gets by. Tstorms and wind for the next few days.I cleared a couple other sq ft gardens and will finish making the list of what still needs bought. I know I am going to need to get some garden dirt as I had a couple beds needed to be completely cleared due to an ant hill in them. I did that battle last year also.I went to the store and got a few odds and ends, mostly fresh produce that won't be bought this summer. I spent less than $60 which keeps up in the budget of $300 every two weeks. Nonfood is coming down, since I started stocking up when I have coupons and sales instead of waiting until we need it.Blessed be"},
{"title": "Frugal week big time last week", "date": "Thursday, April 21, 2016", "text": "I turned off the furnace during the day and a couple nights.We went to a near by community that was having their yard sales. We were able to get a couple tools we needed to replace, some odds and ends for the kitchen that needed to be down sized since it's just the two of us and I found 3 skirts, 1 skort and 1 pr of cropped jeans for a total of $9. The one skirt is a favorite style so I will make a pattern from it also.We had 2 coffee makers die but with luck we found another on clearance and was within the budget I had set for replacement, actually it was $25 less.I used my coupons and got a shirt from Kohl's so I only had to pay taxes on it.I used my coupon at Jo Ann fabric and got 50% off some sewing items I was out of.There is a small grocery store that we shop at once a month for the sales...last week was a HUGE score. They had buy 2 get 3 free....

{"title": "Nasty weather, my garden and it's affects on my budget", "date": "Saturday, April 9, 2016", "text": "There is snow drifting (not a lot, just enough to see it) down from the sky and it's below freezing outside. Great during the winter, but it's April 9th 2016 and I have plants that were growing and started to bloom before this hit.A couple weeks ago we had 5 tornadoes in 1 day. Last year we had 7 during the season. Makes the local weather people worried about what is coming...me to as Hubby is a weather spotter.Our local weather station has forecasted that we will have a warmer than normal late spring and a strong thought of warmer summer with temps reaching 90-100s and possible drought. I have to change what I plant and where to deal with that possibility. That means it will be doubtful if I can get any fall crops either as they require the cool temps like spring crops to grow.Hubby and I looked at each other and he asked what the battle plan is ....he used to farm and he knows what this type of weather can do to the budget. Due to my health issues I have to EAT my nutrition NOT swallow a pill or drink something that has been processed.The old fear of running out of food before the next season curdled in my stomach.Been here and done that. I know I can carry us at least one full year from today. Yes we would go without some veggies and fruit so I need to focus on those, but over all we would be okay. Can I take us into 2 years.... MAYBE...That is what I have to look at.I'm not thrilled that the 200 plus spring bulb garden even though covered won't be blooming this year even though we covered them (wind blew cover off  repeatedly)...but that's part of spring flowers. Plus I didn't spend much money on them as most was what was some where else and I dug up and moved.My summer wild flowers a 35 ¢ package took the hit hard as they weren't covered. I doubt if the rose bush or the lilac tree blooms much if at all. I don't want to think of the apple trees that have budded at my favorite orchard.My fall planted garlic, my rhubarb and my strawberries are still covered. I won't uncover until the temps stay above freezing. Still I know they won't produce as much or as well.IF I can get the covers off this week.Horseradish was left uncovered. We had planned for this to be the final year of growing it. With Mom gone , there isn't enough of us to eat it to make it worth the garden space it takes.With \"winter\" hitting again, by time it warms up it will be closer to our summer planting in May ...no spring crops means that won't be on the table or in the pantry. I can plant some green onions and lettuce and maybe some radishes in pots and put on the front porch where they will get the morning and early afternoon sun and I can move to the north side of the porch into the shade during the heat of the day.Knowing the forecast for a drought possible...I know meat prices will rise...they need rain to grow the feed for the life stock and for the life stock. Some will sell now to try to get what they can and not take any losses.I have that part of my budget stretched.I don't just grow what we eat fresh, I grow what we eat during the year until the next growing season and sometimes in to the following year. Example 2013 was a bumper year of everything , 2014 was good with beans but not at the norm for root veggies or tomatoes. Last year was even worse and it was everything. I also grow for my own seeds and last year I didn't get a lot of seeds.The Amish produce auction I go to will be limited, I don't know how well they were able to protect the plants they grow and  they only sell their surplus produce AFTER they have canned or dried what they are going to eat as they live from year to year like we do.Farmers that sell their produce or life stock for meat and orchards that I pick my apples from will be limited.That's just the food.That drought means we have to be more careful with how we water the gardens even though we are on a well. We are careful pretty much on how we use our water from years of being in the city ( we lived where it was expensive and I really wished I had been reading The Prudent Homemaker blog at that time). The last thing we need is to run the well dry.With temps 90-100 °  I will have to refocus to make sure the house stays cool (electric is very expensive in this house) to limit the use of the central air which I will need if the house temp goes over 85 °. Hubby will use the window AC during the day while he sleeps (3rd shift worker) along with the ceiling fan, he only sleeps about 5 hrs a day. I don't use the central air often even though it's only for the first floor. I need to get the landlord to have it checked out before the heat hits.I will have to recheck my fans and make sure they are in good shape also.Both of our dogs are pretty much all black fur, I'll put a baby pool (which means I have to replace the one we have had for the last 5 yrs) of water in the garage for them to lay in as that's Rascal's favorite way to cool off and when it's really hot Miss Kira will stand in it. Miss Kira takes to either laying with her face into the fan ( I keep on in the front room) or laying on the vent( when its blowing cool air, Rascal does it when it blows hot) in the front room (until we see her and then she moves like she wasn't doing anything she's been told not to do. He doesn't move until you nudge him).Usually in the warmer months I have sheers and light weight curtains up because we usually have a nice breeze...10-15 mph. with 20 mph gusts. I use window fans in the east windows to blow in and window fans in the west winds to \"blow(suck)\" out to create a wind flow in the rooms we are in and that helps cool the house. I binder clip (friend gave me over 1000, when they shut down a plant and was going to throw everything in the dumpster at $500 a load. By time he was through they didn't even have a full load...negative side of that, he is now in charge of most of the closings they do) the top part of the curtains together so only the bottom half (if that much ) is open to let the air move through the house. Afternoons the south and west side curtains are closed completely until the sun isn't on that side. A couple years ago I put foil up on two of the south windows to keep the heat out.I'll be using the grill more...to keep the heat out of the house including my canning (water bath canner works well on a gas grill).I usually am in the gardens in late morning through the afternoons...with that kind of heat I will have to do the garden in the early mornings...big change to my summer routine.This week I will spend looking at what to plant and what I need to prepare for the worst...and pray for the best.Blessings be"},
{"title": "What did I do this week?", "date": "Friday, April 8, 2016", "text": "Really I look around and wondered.Nose surgery recovery is going very slow but each day is better except when the low pressure triggers me...which is about every 3rd day right now.I got the laundry done here at home in my wringer washer. SO we saved $80 from the laundromat.We went every 2 wks and had 14 loads. Regretfully our weather here in northwestern Ohio isn't being nice and I still can't use the clothes lines. I did dry some on the drying rack to help with running the dryer.I ordered some fabric that was on sale at Joann's fabric. Most the time I prefer to not order online because I prefer be able to touch and see the fabric. BUT my recovery isn't up to driving 30 miles , shopping a couple hours and then driving back. SO I ordered online and found that I saved more than the shipping (or gas) would have cost me.I will be sewing skorts at least from this fabric. I still have aprons to make. I still have to primer and paint my sewing room. Everything is scattered in the other 2 rooms upstairs until I do.I used baking soda to do some cleaning. Not sure if vinegar would trigger any issues yet and not willing to go backwards in recovery.I pulled some of my sweet potato slips off the \"mother\" potato and put them in water to let the roots get bigger before planting them. The \"mother\" potato started growing more slips....GOOD because I had 3 \"mother\" sweet potatoes that didn't do anything but rot. The \"mother\" is from the sweet potatoes I grew last year.Type is unknown, the Amish gentleman that sold them to me didn't know, was what his grandpa (3-4 generations back) had raised.I traded my son my small vacuum(comes apart to make a hand vacuum) that I was getting rid of for his dust mop that wasn't doing will with his grout in his kitchen. The dust mop has a washable head. He's happy also because he can use the hand held to defur his furniture from his cats.We went out to eat with a couple that are close friends that are retired, they are frugal like us. We went to Hong Kong buffet (splurge). I had coupons for us and them to use. Even after tip it was less than a pizza from our local pizza shop. We go every 2-3 months during the cold seasons. During the summer when we are gardening it's more of eating at each other's house instead.I reread Amy Dacyczyn's Tightwad Gazette...I have all 3 books, well really I have 3 copies of all 3 books. Thought my 3 kids could inherit them when I die and doubted if they would be in print when I did die.We have a friend that burns old oil of any type in his shop heater. We gave him what we were holding for hazard disposal (we have to pay for it) from when we deep fried turkeys at Thanksgiving.I have some volunteer flowers that have sprung up that I will dig and move later for either my own gardens or one of my kids. Might just put them in a pot to sit at the door on the front porch for next year.Between sales and coupons I saved 30% at the grocery store, didn't get everything on my list even though I was under budget because of the store changing things around. Still we aren't going without anything. The money I saved is now in a savings account.I wrapped my coins while down and took them to the bank. That money is for Christmas.I started my Christmas shopping.... I started with the dogs since I had coupons and there was a sale on some things they love. Was lower than what I spent last year by half.A friend that is living in Ireland right now , got me a discount on a nutrition class. It was $630 and she got it for me for $35. It's online and not as easy as I thought with the tests. Did you know that craving chocolate could be a sign of low iron? ME either.We did realize that with me down,we don't nickle and dime the budget. AND we checked to see why that was...if I get hungry I have to eat immediately or I go down, if we are out and I say something about getting hungry Hubby immediately thinks buy food...I can't just eat anything with my Crohn's so it makes it harder. We have found since I've been pretty much in the house that I get hungry around 10 and again at 2 (tea time) and still eat dinner at 5. So for now on we know we need me to take something that I can eat (not protein bars)  if we are going to be gone during those hours. PLUS we have found that he will buy things for projects, not use all of it and forget to return it within the time of returns. He is going to bag it now and put it in his truck so he sees it and remembers to return it.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Frugal April LOL", "date": "Sunday, April 3, 2016", "text": "April 1st I went in for my debridgement (nice word for cleaning out my nose HA HA). WELL, that was an experience I wished I didn't have to do again but most likely when I GO BACK in 6 weeks , it will happen again, it's what the doctor warned me of. Just not as bad. I still have 2 stents (thanks for that freaking news) that I didn't know about that wasn't ready to be removed.ON the frugal side. Between our ins and our flex spending acct, the costs are covered. Our ins will go back to paying 100% after about $500 more co pays( we already have this amt saved ) and we will only have to cover prescriptions, eye and dental but nothing MEDICAL.So we'll be checking with the doctor over any Big ticket tests etc that we can get down this year to save us money next yr.That is being frugal.Yesterday we talked about me going back to work outside the home (Hubby's running joke is I do work outside the home because we can't fit 1400 sq ft of gardens IN the home). Bottom line with his income we would lose more than we gain especially if I work some where there is health ins because his company won't pay for me if I have the option for ins some where else.We also figured out that I save us $200/ month on veggies and fruit with my gardening (after expenses) and I was able to cut the budget by $300 a month since I am home and can do somethings instead of paying for it to be done.   That is more than I would bring home part time. I do some surveys that I can increase some of my time for to see it that will do better.We canceled the Directv awhile back and now are going to put that money directly into savings.We are going to take rebates and coupon savings and put that in the savings instead of leaving it in the checking to spend on something else.We will be eating from the pantry to clear out the freezers and clear some shelves in the pantry BEFORE the harvest starts coming in. I need to inventory everything to see what to plant and what needs built up in storage.I will be taking the grocery money for the gardens and processing needs .I already have paid for all my seeds that I didn't save from my own plants last year. April 15th we go to Scioto Valley Amish produce auction to get spring plants for the gardens.Our non-food budget is twice of our food budget. We are still working on cutting that down. I've cut down on printing, can scan and send some things or take picture of and send through my phone or email. That has cut that area almost down to 1/4 of what it was. But still there are areas that could do better.One expense is going to be bug spray. Ortho Home defense is what we use here. It's the only thing that works to battle the spiders and ants we get so bad.I will use what ever is left from last yr on the outside and new on the inside.I noticed inventory on paper goods is running low so I'll watch for coupons and sales for it.I just got some fabric on sale online to make some skorts and shorts for myself. So sewing ...when I can wear my glasses for more than 10 min ( face still swells from surgery) I'll start my sewing and mending.Blessed be"},
{"title": "April Goals", "date": "Tuesday, March 29, 2016", "text": "I hope to be fully recovered from surgery before mid-April but did list things that I can do if I am not up and around much.Daily: Flylady  habits: shine my sink, 15 mins decluttering, Get dressed with jewelry,and make the bed.All of these I do most days anyways.Food:  Each of us eat 2 1/2 cups of veggies and 2 cups of fruit,eat from the pantry. I need toinventory all 3 deep freezers, refrigerator freezer and pantries.I'll know if I need to get any staples in but at this point I don't think so.This will also let me know what we need to grow this year.Gardens: condition straw bales(doing straw bale gardening as an experiment especially for growing potatoes)  refresh square foot gardens and till the in ground garden section. Prepare and plant pots.  Plan gardens based on what we need (which is why I need an updated inventory) for storage and what we are going to eat as fresh only. Armenian cucumbers for sure. Weed flower gardens and check on herb gardens Amish auction where we get most of our plants from is April 15th.I will start picking up canning jar lids and supplies, for my vacuum bag sealer a little bit each time I go to the store.Education: I have a nutrition class twice a week the month of April, taking a class of norm for me but this one has extra homework that I'm not used to so I will have to allow Homework Time also.I have down loaded a couple books on finances I want to read and a couple other \"classes\" that concern gardening and such.I found a pattern for a skort which is what I prefer to wear in warm weather. I will have to get material for it this coming week. I need to catch up the mending I had planned to do while down now that I can wear my glasses so I can see what I am doing.I have an apron I prefer (based on 1940's canning apron) and will be making a pattern of it to sew more.I have worn out the aprons I have even though they aren't what I prefer.My flowers are not coming in much yet, so I might if I find a good sale buy a couple more bouquets before May. We have a local florist that has sales pretty regular and has shown me how to make them last a couple weeks.Last batch I got from her lasted 3 wks. Not something frugal (she charges $15 and uses my vase) unless you count it's cheaper for me to be happy there is flowers on the table than depressed and back in for meds. I have S.A.D. so I save up through the \"sunny\" months to pay for \"sunshine\" items through the dreary ones.I was hoping my daffodils would be blooming before this bouquet died off.I am still working on getting a good routine for the home blessing and garden work and food processing. I think the change is going to be me getting up earlier.We have increased our savings and plan to pay off another bill with in the next 2 wks. Our goals of the last 5 yrs when we lost over 70% of our income for over 2 yrs(and our home) was to rebuild in 5 yrs. We had 28 debts and are down to 5. We decide to not buy a home in this area because when Hubby retires we won't need to live here and can move closer to the kids, grandkids and great grandson (due Aug). We are paying less here on the farm than if we were renting an apt.plus our landlord is okay with my gardening. He usually ends up with some of it anyways.We have maintained the retirement even when we lost everything else. We could have borrowed against is but we wasn't willing. We can work and go without now instead of having to work in our 70s. We increase that amt every Jan.Better off than others our age but not where we want to be.We have decided when we retire to living in about 1400 sq ft.with a 2  1/2 car garage or a 2 car garage with an 8 x 10 shed. SO we have chosen to start clearing this home(we rent 2200 sq ft, 2 1.2 car garage and about 20 x 30 storage) so a yr before we buy we are already living in that amt. We measured here and I know what rooms  have to be cleared.If I stacked what is in the storage up like I would a storage unit I could get by with a 10 x 10. This downsizing part will start be actively worked on  weekly starting the first week of April.Have a blessed week.Why? First the surgery went very well and I didn't end up with the black eyes like I was warned I would have. Second after 2 wks I can wear my glasses. Even though my Doctor made a plastic bridge so I could, my face was too swollen for me to wear it.I can't read, drive or go outside in sunlight without glasses,I wear 4 pairs. I wasn't smiling in this picture because when I smile, my glasses slide down my nose, need to get those adjusted LOL. Recovery has been harder than I was prepared for and I still have the debridgement (final cleaning) for my nose on Friday. I was warned I would probably go backwards in recovery for 7-14 days.On the frugal side, we didn't go anywhere except appts and one trip to the store to get more \"quick\" foods for Hubby to fix while I was down and to get more tissues as I had went through the first 10 boxes. For the month we remained on budget including the extra supplies needed due to the surgery and recovery.We bought take out twice, both times fed us 4 meals for less than $5 a meal and I had actually figured on twice that amt in the food budget while I was down.The car maintenance budget has taken a big hit, my son's car's front bearing is going out, he brought it to us for our mechanic to fix (his mechanic is having surgery) and I gave him my car and took his to our mechanic. The next day we had to call our mechanic and ask if we could drive it because our truck's fuel pump went out. So the mechanic brought us our son's car (can get back and forth to work last night but that's about it) and the fuel pump was ordered and should be in the truck today so we can once again get my son's car the to mechanic. MEANTIME my son calls and starts telling me things he found wasn't working right on MY car.Most of it Hubby can deal with if son doesn't go ahead and do on his own. I haven't been driving much since last fall and the car kind of sits. If Hubby didn't have to have a way to work I'd sell it but since his truck is a 1998 I'm not comfortable with it being the only thing here. Work is a bit too far away for him to be walking, let alone down a highway to get to work and he's the only one working 3rd in this area.Blessed be"},
{"title": "REALITY  sigh", "date": "Saturday, March 12, 2016", "text": "Feb 14th my reality became a sever nose bleeds  2-3 times a day with passing large clots...GROSS.Got into on an emergency appt to primary doctor, who immediately scheduled me for ENT but that was 2 wk wait.SO now it's MarchENT doctor sends me to CT Scan which was a 1 wk wait.Get CT scan and back to ENT doctor on same day and then schedule surgery...First it was suppose to be March 24th (3 wk wait)...then the hospital blocked out that day so it got moved to the 29th ...meantime nose bleeds are starting to last about 30 min a couple times of day. ENT doctor is worrying that I am going to need to go through the ER to get surgery due to the stress it's causing with my heart failure.THEN MIRACLE...someone canceled and I am going in the 17th...Dealing with the bleeds and trying to get things done so I can be in recovery without a total mess on my hands or Hubby's as he get homeblessing and cheffing for 2 wks until I am recovered enough to do it. Has been hard with NO energy due to bleeding and not being able to breath right.Main thing was the ENT doctor took one look and said we are fixing the problem right the first time (YES)...Reduction of turbinates (think filters for you nose) deviated septum straightened and rhinoplasty to fix the nose that has been broken and now turns black and blue when I wear my glasses because of how crooked it is. I wear glasses all the time now days. In fact I have 4 different pairs I have to wear depending on what I am trying to do. Sitting at the computer I can zoom if needed. He will be using a hard plastic bridge on my nose so I can wear my glasses while recovering.MEANTIME trying to stay frugal.....Been eating at home mostly, not a lot as there is no appetite.Did some decluttering so I won't be looking at it when I am down and can't deal with it. Helps with the depression.  Picked up some sour hard candy that is suppose to help with dry mouth and the taste of drainage. Had to buy some foods ...soft foods and medical supplies that was needed. Still we are in budget for the month since we know what we are eating while I am done.Frugal also is the surgery was scheduled (17th) to reflect that Hubby wouldn't have to take off a whole week of work (lower paycheck as it doesn't include his shift pay or his EMT pay or his TL pay).I already cooked a turkey and bagged the meat. Each bag will make 2 meals so it gives us 2 options of what we are eating. Tonight is ham, I will slice and dice leftovers and then but some back to grind for ham salad and scalloped potatoes and scrambled eggs. Bean soup also....I will be roasting a prime rib (in freezer, Christmas gift) for Monday(slice and dice it also) and having pork chops on Wed as that is the last night for 2 wks I can actually chew solid food and it's my favorite. Hubby might have to pick up some odds and ends and we have some friends that are willing to step in and help especially like laundry as I refuse to let him touch my wringer washer except to do maintenance.I am going to gather a few things around that I can do that is sitting (and I don't have to wear glasses for) and I already down loaded books I want to read to my Fire Kindle. I have a list of things to do so when I whine I am bored Hubby can check it and remind me of what I wanted to get done.I will do a good home blessing on Tuesday and Wednesday we will do the laundry and get the last of any groceries we need. Thursday morning I will do our finances (normal routine) and spend some time rubbing nuzzling my dogs as that won't happen for a bit.I'm looking forward to getting this done as this is the 2nd time I've had surgery for my nose (31 yrs ago ) and I remember the pain of the packing, breathing through my mouth dryness and the pain of having the the packing removed...let alone my daughter that was 1 smacking me in the face pain....I am still ready to do this...hope the rest of my body agrees including my Crohns as usually stress triggers it big time and it's already complaining of the drainage with blood...Blessed Be"},

Seeing ENT doctor today with hopefully a solution to the problem. Our humidity is at 45-50% so it's not dry air or blood thinners as I haven't been on them for a year.I am looking forward to answers, I am not looking forward to a very painful exam.So in the last month what I have done to be frugal  is the followingGroceries came in $14.39 over budget.I need to focus on coupons and sales better for non food things. WHICH is pretty well stocked up except for the dogs stuff. I saved the average of 16.11% Goal is to be closer to 25% AND under budget.We needed clothes...I've been hitting the thrift shops but not finding anything in our size or what we would wear. I'm looking at 60 and don't want to look like I am wearing something that belongs to my granddaughters.It's been almost 5 yrs since we bought new clothes beyond underclothes and socks and I wasn't looking forward to doing it. A friend clued me into retailmenot and freeshipping. Pretty much set for the next 3-5 yrs (HA HA) except for pants for Hubby (short legged) and pants/shorts/skorts for me. I got a lead on a pattern for skorts so I might end up making my own unless I take my favorite skort apart for a pattern. End savings for for clothes 76%...yes really I shopped clearances and sales, used discounts  and freeshipping. NOT only that but actually found tanks that I LOVE instead of just taking what I can find at the price I am willing to pay AND they were cheaper than what I usually spend. Kohls and Walmart online were the best I got. IT was even cheaper than the thrift store on some things.I sorted the pantry, have one area yet to go through. Found I had things I needed to use up and some that needed to go on the list to buy when it goes on sale.I saved a repair call , we have a frig that will freeze up a couple times a year, the repairman that is a friend said it's a character fault of the beast. Since I really like my frig and don't want to replace it , he showed me how to deal with it and save a $100 repair bill. While dealing with this I cleaned it very well and reorganized it so I had a place to put a container of fruit, a container of potatoes cooked for home fries and a half sheet with lid for when I make 1 sheet pan meals and want to prep in the morning.I put condiments together in bins also.I decluttered 2 rooms (300 sq ft) and hauled it to the kids that wanted it. The plan is to only be using 1200 sq ft in this house by the end of summer so we can adjust to a smaller home when Hubby retires in 3 yrs.  I didn't have to pay for it to be hauled away AND I got to visit with the kids and grandkids.We decided to try straw bale gardening this yr and give our north garden a rest. Plus with the way my health has been, it should be easier for Hubby to maintain if I go down,again, some more, what ever.Bales were running around $4.25 so after putting it out we were looking for around 36 bales a friend offered to sell what he isn't going to use for $2 a bale.Hope you are having a  Blessed Month"},

Every few months they send out coupons that are good for certain weeks. I try to go on Monday when it starts.  While I was gathering the items with the coupons and checking sales on meat (frozen chicken breast was $2.33, cheapest I've seen in several months and we have been out for quite awhile now PLUS ground beef 80/20 was on sale for $2.88 where it's been running around $5.39)...anyways...Hubby always checks the discount carts...most time this is very good and being frugal...Monday not as much as it should have been as he picked up  11 different breads and 3 different cakes. Neither of us eat a lot of bread let cake. SINCE they were discounted they aren't going to last long and I specified we didn't have freezer room or frig room for much....SIGH. BUT I won't argue with him over such things in the store.Still he saved me several hours of bread making and desserts and has came up with ideas and even a couple recipes to use it up. He saved $48.32 on all of it. We lost one loaf (so it's $46.33) savings. He had sat it on the dining table in the sun light and with being in plastic it produced moisture and then molded by the next afternoon.  Now he understand what I don't let much of any food sit on the dining table.I had moved it back to the kitchen twice and he moved it back.We got gas for his truck using our fuel rewards from the store and saved 50¢ a gal.I did our taxes online instead of going to the local office which saved us over $200. I was a bit  worried even though I used to work for H &R Block of doing it myself with all the new rules and such.I found a cheaper place to get my printer ink (thanks to Jen),inkjetsuperstore.com and to check retailmenot.com  for the coupons first.I made 1 lb of red beans into soup and made it last 3 meals. Soup,fried potatoes and onions and white corn bread. Beans and rice  and then beans and rice burritos for the last part. We ate odd and ends the rest of the week of things that needed used up ...like bacon (SMILE)What did you do this past week to be frugal?Blessed Be"},
{"title": "February goals", "date": "Sunday, January 31, 2016", "text": "To cut the non-food amt spent to 2/3 rds of what it is running now. I don't think we can get it any cheaper than that because of the softener salt and filter we have to buy being out in the boonies. Still I will try.I am looking for a cheaper place to buy printer ink.I will combine sales and coupons which I started this month.We will eat from the pantry. January we ate out 4 times and I bought Chinese from the store (so I count that as eating out). We would like to bring that down to 3 ....as facing  Valentine's day  and our anniversary this month. I know we will eat at least once at the local restaurant for Lent as they have a great fish special on Fridays.I put together a coupon book to keep better track of my coupons.I arranged it in the order of how I shop instead of alphabetical.I downloaded a savings tracker http://thecouponproject.com/downloads/savings-tracker/I am putting together a grocery price data workbook that will include my inventory. Goal is to buy at the cheapest and keep track of the inventory without going down and doing a count every month. Plus if possible (my friend that I call Guru) have place were it will let me know I should buy if on sale or a need now.Hubby would like to retire in 3 yrs. So everything we do know needs to reflect that. Not only financially as in finishing off the last of the debt incurred when he went to 3 days a week for 2 yrs but in the home as of right now we rent a home of 2200 sq ft and use a 1 1/2 car garage, 2 stalls in the pig barn (no animals on the farm any more) and over half the farrowing house which would be 3 10x12 storage units. We want a  2-1/2 car garage and 1400 sq ft with a basement...lots to get rid off.It's still too cold to plant here but I am hoping towards the end of the month I might be able to plant some lettuce and such in containers that I can cover when it's cold.Blessed beLooking back of the past month I see some improvement on being frugal.I fixed a pair of pants.I started 2 more sweet potatoes to make slips to plant this spring. The first two got nasty and had to be pitched. I've never had that happen before so I don't know what caused it.I ordered the last of my seeds using coupons. I want to order candy onion sets from a local green house yet.I will most likely buy my spring plants from the Amish produce auction.I combined sales with coupons to get a year's supply of vitamins and 6 mos supply of other vits that I have to take due to my Crohn's . Crohn's can stop you from getting nutrition from the food you eat.On top of I live in Ohio so my Vit D is low to begin with because we don't get the sunshine to keep it up.I got my doctor to send my prescriptions to a mail order instead of the local pharmacy and saved there.I baked bread so we didn't buy any.I repaired my bread board that we use to cut the bread on.I canned 7 quarts of applesauce and made 5-1/2 pints of apple butter out of the peelings and cores and then mixed the apple \"juice\" with the other juice we had in the frig.We ate mostly from the pantry.Blessed BeWe didn't waste food and very little went to the compost also. We looked back and realized that we went from Dec 24th until today eating mostly from the pantry.KEY WORD....MOSTLY...SIGHOut of 5 weeks we ate out 4 times and I count the time I bought Chinese out of the freezer section as eating out since I normally make my own.That's an average of once a week....We ate once at Bob Evans as I had a coupon from them .Saved $9.47We ate once at Perkins as I had a coupon from them for my bday .Saved $8.56We bought take out at Davis meats (smoked rib lunch) that actually fed us 2 days.We bought Al's pizza with a chef salad (and then I listened to my son lecture me about buying fast food that I can make at home) with the excuse we leaving the grocery store and very hungry and Hubby was going to already be  2 hrs late getting to bed so he could get his sleep in to go to work. That excuse didn't work with son HA HA.I bought the Chinese at of the freezer section at store because I got sick while in the store and knew I wouldn't be cooking and I can eat Chinese when I am sick...Two of the times we wouldn't have ate out if I hadn't had the coupons...We were able to stock the staples back up because I wasn't buying much food beside perishables.PLUS we were able to stock a lot of non-food up since \"Food\" money wasn't being used.I also did a lot of use left overs for second and third round dishes that stretched the pantry...not that my pantry needs to stretch as I maintain a pantry to feed us at least a year if not pushing 18 months.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Being frugal", "date": "Monday, January 25, 2016", "text": "We have been eating from the pantry mostly all this month.I have changed my shopping to focus on using coupons with sales or mark downs. I have now started my routine \"route\" in the store at the clearance rack that is on the far side of the store.I have a friend that is making me a grocery price sheet (he calls it a data base)that will also show me lowest paid and then will allow me to use it to make a running inventory of the pantry etc with a possible buy on sale and need to buy now spot on it for my grocery list. He is getting ready to retire in the next year and is looking at doing this kind of thing for individuals . Works for both of us.I have dehydrated the last of the eggs except for what we will  use in the next month, if needed I will dehydrate more so we don't lose them. I used the dehydrated ones in my baking this week.I've used mostly of what we have at home for fighting this sickies that we have been battling. I know I will have to be checking coupons and sales to replace what we have used up.My doctor wanted me to see a specialist for nutrition other than the one that is local and Free for us, our ins would not pay it and the costs was hundreds. So the FREE nutritionist contacted the one the doctor wanted me to see and they suggested a study course. It usually runs around $500....that was on sale online for 50% off.Another nutritionist just happened to have the catalog with the code for 80% off and then I got additional 20% off the total because I ordered more than one course and it totaled over $100. I ordered courses (not covered by ins) that my two doctors have been wanting me to change my lifestyle to. Works better for me because now I don't have to drive 1 hr each way for the classes AND I have a DVD and book that I can use, not just a 4 week class of twice a week. I used the money we saved from eating from the pantry to pay for it.I ordered the seeds I need for this year using sales and coupons. I have some of the lettuce seeds I gathered last year to replant this year.Blessed BeWe have one more week from today of this challenge. I pretty much can say we will be eating out MAYBE tonight because we have a coupon for a free meal for one at the local restaurant due to my birthday last week and it expires tonight and we are next to nothing on the dog food. I think Rascal's ball is eating also since I find it in the bowl several times a day.Other than that the menu is planned out.Thoughts so far, I bought Chinese out of the grocery store freezer section when I first got sick (still am but getting better every day and I hope I didn't just jinx myself) I counted that the same as eating out because usually I make my own Chinese except egg rolls and pot stickers ...that's on my to learn list. We ate out after going to Sam's club to get baking supplies using a coupon for 50% off one meal , we used it at lunch and got the cheapest meals on the menu since we like everything there it wasn't a hardship at all. Last Friday we got take out after going to the store and running errands and found ourselves struggling to finish the errands...and BOTH of us was horribly sick. The local butcher shop smokes ribs on Friday for their lunch special, we got that and it fed us for 2 days, which we both spent covered up and hacking.Lessons learned so far....when I am busy processing produce , we run for fast food, when I am sick we run for fast food, IF Hubby is sick, I make soup LOL....Taco Bells, Wendy's , Subway and pizza (with chef salad, we eat the salad BEFORE we eat the pizza)is our stand bys, sometimes it's fried chicken from a local restaurant (bets KFC ) though it doesn't beat Mel-O-Dee's in New Carlisle OH.SO to combat that I now have sub buns and lunch meat in the freezer, taco supplies of assortment (Hubby is a crunch wrap and I am tostada,Mexican pizza, hard tacos, soft tacos, etc) Hamburger patties I formed and froze along with those buns. AND I dug out my Tightwad Gazette that has a  5 min pizza crust recipe. I can make the crusts in the morning and prebake( I prebake anyways) and just add the topping later that day.For some reason we usually eat salad when out or ordering pizza but I struggle to put it on the table regularly. I think it's because we don't add the same ingredients to our salads. SO on that line I will be planning an area in the frig for \"salad\" toppings when the lettuce starts coming in a couple months from now.What did I buy this month?Dairy:Milk( on sale bought 2 times as much ), heavy cream( marked down), half and half (marked down), buttermilk (on sale),butter (OUCH), cottage cheese,yogurt,sour cream, some sliced cheese (that was half off for the freezer and frig).Dry goods: tostadas(on sale),assorted sizes of tortilla wraps(coupons), Sub buns (coupon plus 50% off) hamburger buns (marked down, note this is now on my to make my own list).Meat: bacon (coupons and marked down and on sale SCORE,) ground pork (coupon and marked down) bulk sausage( on sale and coupons).Veggies: ice berg lettuce (cheapest), green onions, ( I use both green and white parts) celery, carrots, colored bell peppers (green one trigger my Crohn's)Fruit: Avocados (on sale)Stock up: 25 lbs of all purpose flour, 25 lbs of granulated sugar, 2 lbs of yeast, 13.5 lbs baking soda, 35 oz of corn starch, 60 oz of baking powder36 oz sea salt,2 gals of white vinegar, 1 gal of canola oil, 3 lts of olive oil, 5 lbs of yellow corn meal,25 lbs of parboiled rice, 8- 30.65 oz coffees (on sale and with coupon for each)4-6 lbs 9 oz (#10) cans of tomato sauce (on sale ...possible pasta sauce or pizza sauce), baker's special dry milk and easy roll dough improver.What we saved on food , we spent of stocking up non food I now have enough laundry soap(well , the stuff to make the laundry soap) and dish soap to go a year. I have enough body soap, shampoo and conditioner, lotions, and dental items to go 6 mos.There are things I see I need to be taking care of more (which being sick all winter and worse through this month isn't helping) and some things that just need to go away. I did quit buying Velveeta mac and cheese and Hubby has requested that it be stocked. He uses it like Hamburger helper when I am sick (NOW he tells me).Blessed Be"},

It costs me $20 average for 10 seed potatoes at the nursery. I saved a lot of money by going this way and have Yukon Gold potatoes to eat at the same time.I did the same to get my sweet potato slips (green shoot off sweet potato that you plant to grow more sweet potatoes) Slips cost $19 average(usually about 2 potatoes will make this) I got 10 lbs for $6  so we have sweet potatoes to eat also.I got bananas (another auction item) for 35¢/ lb .Picked up 20 lbs, some to dehydrate, freeze, and eat.I also got at the auction brown organic eggs...I've seen them for $4.36 a dozen at a couple stores locally. I bought 17 dozen at $2 a dozen. Several dozen will be dehydrated so later I can used dehydrated eggs and flour to make pasta and braided egg bread (fingers crossed I get around to the bread LOL)We changed electric supplies and lowered the electric by almost 1 ¢ . Doesn't sound for much but that's about $12 a month.I used Walmart's savings catcher and they found lower prices for the non food I bought so we have that small amt back.Blessed be"},

{"title": "Dehydrating Eggs for powered eggs.", "date": "Wednesday, January 6, 2016", "text": "Every January I have to deal with extra eggs that was bought for the cooking of Christmas and New Year's Eve. Most years I end up with bad eggs because I can't get them used up fast enough or even have to make a special trip to town because I didn't buy enough.This year after reading \"Food Storage: Preserving Meat, Dairy and Eggs\" by Susan Gregersen and David Armstrong I started thinking about dehydrating my eggs and making powdered eggs.Then I read Brandi's post over at www.theprudenthomemaker.com about her ordering powdered eggs and decide to try to make my own.this is 4 eggs beaten and dehydrated at 135° for 8 hrsthen I ground it in my blender until it was powderI then took 1 level tablespoon of powder and mixed it with 1 tablespoon water and stirred until the powder was dissolved and then let it rest for a minute.I nuked it in my microwave for 30 seconds on full power.Looks just like scrambled egg.It tasted like scrambled egg that I had cooked too long in the microwave so next time I'll try 20 seconds or 75% power. Reality is I no longer with be tossing eggs that went bad before I can use them or making special trips to town to buy eggs for baking or scrambling.BETTER is instead of getting this through Walmart (closest store that actually has it) for 56¢ a serving (one egg is a serving) which if you think about it is $6.72 for a dozen eggs, I am getting it for the price of the eggs and my electric which was 67¢ for the 8 hrs.I did use my fruit leather tray for this,but have no desire to buy more so I will use either wax paper or parchment paper as long as I am careful to not fill it so full it over runs the paper.Blessed be"},

I have a 27 cubic, a 20 cubic and a 7 cubic deep freezer along with my French door 26 cubic frig with it's freezer. I have 250 lbs of potatoes, over 300 winter squashes and close to 100 lbs of onions in cool area storages. One being my mud room that we insulated to keep warmer and now have to keep the kitchen door shut as we opened the windows to cool that room down to store produce.(I adjust the windows to keep it at the correct temp) (thankful it got cold before I had Hubby put in the AC in the window)plus I have 12 shelves in the butler's pantry with half of them double stacked and 2 shelves of dried fruit and dried veggies in the dining room china cupboard along with a 5 shelf cupboard  also in the dining room filled with spices and herbs and extra brown and xxx sugars and salts.In total at last inventory I had over a year's worth of meals. GOOD for me, been a time that grocery money was very little for a period of 2 yrs. Thankfully the gardens did well but winter was a time of hunger.This month we started eating from the pantry. I usually do it in late Nov or early Dec but we were actually still eating fresh produce from our gardens and the Amish produce auction we go to regularly. With warmer than usual Dec turnips, radishes and other root veggies were still coming in fresh.It's nice to have some support from other bloggers about eating from the pantry for a period of time.I did buy a calendar (on clearance) to keep track of a menu as I want to look back next year and see how we did....4th day in and I can tell you I haven't fixed one thing that was already on the two week menu I did. Like today was going to be cabbage rolls...but I am playing catch up with the laundry because I was down (kind of still am) with crud and a strained adductor. With a wringer washer it's more hands on than an automatic (but my electric dropped $30 a month) so I decided since I had cooked hamburger I would do pasta and cheesy bread and salad...all things we have in the pantry.I will just write what we eat on the calendar and put a highlighted orange star on it.Are you eating from the pantry?because most of December was making thesesTwenty five of them later with my tears of frustrations on the last 3, you would think by then I would have had it down pat. All filled with packing pellets AKA snowman poop and 10 gag gifts with a small amt of cash. Then after delivery I pulled my groin muscle and that strained my adductor muscle I already have a bad back and struggle with leg pain because of it and then if that wasn't enough I caught the crud...you know the crap between the head cold and chest cold but won't go away but you are thankful you didn't get the stomach crap that was going around ..yeah that crud.So last week I roasted 2 turkeys and froze the meat then made broth and canned it after following old timer's directions of skimming the fat off the broth and froze the fat to use later.I sliced up what was left from the prime rib that I roasted for the holiday and now have some for a couple quick sandwiches and some for soup in the freezer.I found mild sausage and hot sausage on sale so bought that and cooked it and strained the fat in to pint jars. Meat will be for casseroles, omelets , quiches, pizzas and calzones among other things. It went in the freezer in 1 cup servings (sandwich bags work well and then put in a freezer bag). Fat is in the frig.I found hamburger on sale, made some in to patties so I don't have the excuse we can't have hamburgers because I forgot to thaw them, and cooked the rest with some water (trick learned when I cooked in a day care to make the meat less greasy), strained the water off and cooled it and took the fat off it for the freezer also.Milk gravy tastes better if you use a favored fat to make it with.I made a point of not turning the Christmas lights on during the day until Christmas eve and Christmas day."},

I'll be serving it tonight with our chicken fajitas.I also have canned the boiled apple cider,dehydrated and packaged Roma tomatoes, rosemary, thyme,onions, celery and carrots. I have shelled and packaged the following dried beans for soups this winter: pinto and cannellini, KY wonder (also canned for green beans this summer) and Lazy Wife beans (also canned for green beans this summer and shelled some of the green beans that became \"tough\" and froze them for shelly beans) I shelled and packaged the following for replanting next year: KY wonder,Lazy Wife, asparagus beans, red noodle beans,pinto beans, moonlight runner sunset runner and scarlet runner beans, I cut and froze pineapple and apples for apple pie.I rinsed the acorn squash in bleach water. It helps it last longer in the root cellar.I baked a ham and we had sliced ham the first night, ham sandwiches for lunch the next day followed by ham chunks with other small bites for dinner. Had Scalloped potatoes and ham followed by ham, onion, mushroom and cheese omelets for dinner and then tossed 2 more meals of it in the freezer for Thanksgiving weekend we get tired of turkey.I still have some other produce to process for the pantry this week."},

Got mums which I thought we wouldn't be able to get this year with the prices I was seeing. Paid $1.50/$1.75 for mums that are running $6-$20 at the stores.We got more butternut squash, acorn squash,beets,cabbage, pineapple (shipped in), onions that are not in as good as shape so they are what we will use first or I'll dehydrate. A friend bought roma tomatoes and jack little pumpkins that he shared with us(we shared the onion) and I bought a loaf of bread, 3 tart size pies,3 dozen cookies, angel food cake, noodles and fresh cider from the \"bakery\" sellers that were at the auction. All good homemade food.I only have horseradish in the gardens to pull and garlic to plant. The plants I put in died due to lack of water and wind...even though I watered them almost daily. The winds are wicked at this time.We decided to start going to the store every 2 wks so that means we will most likely be combining non-food and food shopping. Our thought it less time in the stores less money spent. PLUS less gas used to go to town since we do live out in the country ...top that will I'll save some hours that I need to do what I have going on the next couple months with National Novel writing month starting Nov 1st (50000 words a month) and Thanksgiving that we hold the Sunday before the actual holiday and then Christmas that I try to have ready BEFORE December 1st.On top of the work I haven't gotten done this summer.We did (with regret) decide to not plant a fall or winter garden. My health has been at the low end and the testing to find out what was going on has exhausted me. SO to try to stay healthy this fall/winter I am not adding anything on the work load and try to focus on my health most the time. Part of the health is staying focused on keeping the food bill down and eating healthy.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "October shopping plans", "date": "Monday, October 5, 2015", "text": "My pantry is pretty full and we are now starting to eat mainly from it. I do have a few things that I will look to buy if the right price during the fall and early winter.I got our winter squash at the Amish produce auction for a $1 per squash,usually around 3 lbs. Pumpkins were $1 per pumpkin that weighed around 30 lbs.I also got 50 lbs of white onions and 30 lbs of red onions. We got potatoes for 20 ¢ lb. I would like to have acorn squash if I find it at the farmer's market for the right price. I hope to be able to order 50 lbs of potatoes from our local store for 20 ¢/ lb this fall. I dehydrate my potatoes raw, after shredding or slicing or dicing I soak them in apple cider or lemon lime soda pop or fruit fresh for about 15 min. They sometimes turn a tan depending on how long it took me to get them in the soaking water I think is that issue. I will cook and puree and then dehydrate the puree of the pumpkins to grind in my blender. Takes a lot less room and last longer for me, plus I can toss a tablespoon or so into anything I am cooking and not wondering what to make with what is left in the container.I need flours for holidays, that usually comes on sale soon so I am on the lookout.I have a couple rices and Kraut I want to add to the pantry.Our local butcher usually has pork on sale during Oct. I will pick up a case of smoked sausage and dinner sausage patties if within our price range.We are finding the garden is producing a few things still that will help with fresh foods.I have some broccoli,kalettes and lettuce plants to put in this week.I am still processing apples and cabbages. I will wrap a few of the cabbages in plastic wrap for short term storage. The pumpkins are usually the last I process.I'm going to have to break down and get some clothes for both of us. Still checking the thrift shops and yard sales."},
{"title": "making room for the pantry", "date": "Saturday, October 3, 2015", "text": "I didn't always have the pantry (17 ft by 22 ft) I have now. I won't have it in the future as we rent an old farm house close to Hubby's work and when he retires it will be closer to the kids or somewhere warmer.I grew up with a root cellar, Dad built shelves, Mom put root veggies on top of wooden crates under the shelves and 1500 canning jars of food on the shelves. We usually ran out around March, sometimes February if there was a lot of company.So there was times we went without vegetables until early spring. They didn't go to the store. Dad hunted and fished, fresh side or bacon was bought weekly for breakfast along with bologna for Dad's lunch. NOT our lunch, our lunch was soup if we had it. Mom wasn't much of a cook but it was her job.I moved to an apartment and used the spare room to be my pantry.Then I moved to another apartment and had a child and then my parents started giving me tips of where to put the pantry like they did when they got married and lived in a 3 room apartment with my brother.Here are the tips:ALWAYS write down what you are putting where and post it in the kitchen. You will forget something.Place dry goods, boxes and bagged food in second containers to protect from the critters that crawl on floorsStore foods in groups...fruit under the front room furniture, veggies under the bed and meat behind the doors or on closet floors, put the shoes on top of it, you can cover the food with wax paper or newspaper if you need to.Mom stacked cases beside the couch and covered them with table cloths for end tables. I made a coffee table like this. I also used cases of food for a twin bed frame for about 6 mos. I took what I needed out of the middle and then kept moving the cases to keep the bed level and stable.I have onions and garlic right now on my staircase.Root veggies such as winter squash are on shelves with my baking pans in the basement and will also go in my china cupboard.I've put boxes of pasta on top of my kitchen cabinets.Anything on top of the frig will get warm so be careful if you store food there. Not a good place to put bread.I've store dry goods in the garage since it doesn't hurt to freeze cereal or flour etc. Put them in rubber maids or cooler to keep the mice out of it. My parents stored theirs in the trunk of their car during the winter, the weight helped when driving in the snow.Think outside the normal pantry...if it bothers you for others to see the stack then cover it with table cloth, beach towel, blankets or a piece of fabric that either blends in or is a focal point."},
{"title": "accomplishments ", "date": "Tuesday, September 29, 2015", "text": "I got tomatoes canned as pasta sauce.I dehydrated onions for onion flakes, celery, celery leaves,diced carrots and diced red bell peppers.I canned bell peppers (sweet pickled) and beets pickled and regular.I froze shredded zucchini, freezer slaw, asparagus beans,red noodle beans and green tomatoes I breaded.I sold a baker's rack and picnic table with 6 chairs.I went to a community yard sale with our son (and walked most the time as it was easier to park and then go get the car if needed which saved on gas). Scored some Christmas decorations to replace the ones that have worn out for next to nothing plus got another strainer (think tomato strainer if you can) to help with straining the apples I will start doing this week.I got some baking dishes to split with my son also. I also bought the baker's rack that I ended up selling to my son.My want vs his need for his new home. Plus he offered me twice of what I paid for it... which was $5. I picked up a blanket for 50¢ for a gift and another one for $1 to line some curtains with for upstairs for this winter.I got started on washing cold weather clothes,bedding and curtains.I gathered some seeds from my wild flowers to share with some others that have asked for seeds.Plus I think I will plant some in another area where we lost some bushes.I saved 25% on my groceries combining coupons,sales and clearance.It's a mindset to get into when you want to make your pantry last, ONE MORE ROUND...what can I do to make this (whatever) go one more round...IN SEASON as much as possible.Google what to do with leftovers , how to make things last.Local store had chuck roast on sale. I haven't seen this price in 3 yrs LOL.Hubby and I talked about whether we should buy some, how much to buy, what we wanted to make with it BEFORE we bought any. SO we bought some....Since I was using our basic grocery money I had to figure out how to stretch the meat as far as it could go. I cut up part of it stews and noodles while the biggest went in the oven.I do this before it hits the freezer BECAUSE one , I don't need a 3 lb piece of meat for my dinner AND I can cut the \"fat\" scraps out to put back for broth later. The count was 10 meals....but I know it will make closer to 20 -30 instead ...WHY? Because just like the roast that we ate that night  and the next night as left overs and then the next night as \"philly cheese steak\" and then the next night as beef and veggies in cream sauce over pasta and then the next night as beef and veggies (and more veggies) over rice with curry spices added and last but not least it's in the freezer waiting have more veggies (not much beef left after the 4th meal) to be served as soup.Look at what is your basic needs are and ask what you can do to extend that....can't think of anything...ask someone in their 80s and 90s and they can tell you what they did especially if they grew up in the Great Depression.Coffee grounds can be reused with just a little fresh ground added to it, even in an automatic coffee maker.Then it can be composted. I don't use as much as the directions say either.One tea bag can make 3 cups of tea if you heat the last cup of water longer or just use a tea kettle to brew the tea to begin with. Then composted and another time I don't use as much as the directions say.Wash those veggies before you peel them including that onion (cut off root first) and save the peelings in a gallon freezer bag or container in the freezer. When full cover with with water (no need to thaw) and simmer 30-60 min to make veggie broth. I keep the broccoli,cauliflower and cabbage (that veggie family) in separate bags as they are strong flavoring but works great when you are making broccoli, cauliflower or cabbage soup. If you are saving water, use that rinse water to water your plants.Bones from meat go in a pot to make broth (I can or freeze or use for soup that night).Potatoes....peel thick and make potato skins, peel thin and boil and make potato water that you can use in bread making, gravies (the starch will help thicken the gravy) and potato soup or any soup you want to thicken. Even with Hubby and myself I go through 100 lbs of potatoes between Oct and March...sometimes I am out in Feb.Sometimes I toss the thin peels in the freezer and make the \"broth\" later.My cinnamon sticks and vanilla beans get reused.( Mom would buy these for me for my Christmas gift,she liked the vanilla extract and vanilla powdered sugar along with mulled cider I would make her). Fruit stones (pits), fruit peels make jellies and jams and sometimes liqueur. I make my own vanilla extract. I zest my own oranges and lemons when I get that fruit in the fall and winter. I zest the citrus fruit, juice it or eat it and then boil what is left to make \"fruit water\".I also peel the citrus fruit and candy them for Christmas gifts.Apples is another, fresh, frozen canned for pie filling or applesauce, Peelings and cores make juice,jelly, fruit leather and apple butter. Pumpkins get cooked down, first as a veggie (it's a squash) then it's pie fillings and pumpkin butter, fruit leather ,and dried and ground for later use to add pumpkin powder to cakes and muffins and pancakes etc.Add a little water to those jars of condiments to make them last a bit more or even better make them yourself if you can cheaper than boughten.Add water to shampoo, conditioner, laundry soap (even if you make your own), fabric softener(or use watered down white vinegar), dish soap...about 1/3rd or 1/2 water to whatever. I took the leftover veggies that didn't amount to a cup and tossed them in eggs to make what we call big egg (frittata).Leftover bread was made into crumbs (or croutons) and bread pudding.Make it go one more round.NEXT...making room for the pantry"},
{"title": "Making it last...side note", "date": "Saturday, September 12, 2015", "text": "When I stayed with my Nonna , for dinner she would cook  (3 lbs of beans)bean soup on Sunday morning before church so it would be ready for lunch when we got home. Bread (not corn bread) was baked on Saturday for Sunday's meals. Sunday night we ate leftover bean soup and more bread. There was 5-6 at the meal. Breakfast was toast with jam and coffee or hot tea. Lunch was sandwiches on homemade bread, somethings just butter on the bread (she had milk cows).Monday she added more water to the bean soup and what ever veggies she had. Might be corn and green beans, might be peas and carrots and Saturday's bread.Tuesday she would add more veggies and more water and Saturday's bread.Wednesday she would add potatoes and more water and Saturday's breadThursday, more water, onions maybe some veggies and rice.Friday was more water some tomatoes fresh or that she canned and pasta broken up and Saturday's bread broke into the bowl with the soup poured on top of it.Saturday was FRESH bread and pasta with tomato sauce and whatever veggie was in the garden or in the pantry she had canned.We all looked forward to Saturday.About the only thing I saw her buy at the store food wise was orange marmalade, the rest of the jellies and jams she made and olive oil otherwise it was lard from the pigs they raised.She knew how to make those beans last and it wasn't until my 20s did I realize she only baked bread once a week because the oven she used was outside and baked close to 50 loaves at a time. Didn't want to waste the wood.SIDE NOTE I bought white vinegar twice a year to use for cleaning that wasn't on the basic list. I used Fels-Naptha soap for dishes, laundry and bathing until Mom started buying us castile for body soap.  Toilet paper was whatever was cheapest and we were careful about how much we used. I didn't use paper towels or paper napkins or kleenex until the oldest was close to 8 when we went to Kleenex.  My kids will still question me if there is paper napkins in my house with paper towels.I use cloth napkins and have the same ones for the last 20 some years.They are stained but clean.One of the first things I have done is separate NON-food items and food items.Starting with the basic foods... whole grains, organic etc wasn't going to happen. I'm putting food on the table...fast food it wasn't happening. Getting up out of the bed at 4 am to bake bread sucks but it's what got bread on the table and warmed the kitchen at the same time.Think protein instead of meat...and make sure you are only feeding each person one correct serving size.When I have a beef roast I serve it the first day as a roast, the second as a casserole and the third day as soup (if it has bones I toss them in pot to make broth)...I keep the fat off it and strain it into ice cube trays to flavor other food or make gravies.I tried to make meatloaf at least every other month, hamburger was stretched with bread crumbs, cracker crumbs or oatmeal even when making patties. Hamburger gravy, or sausage gravy was few and far between.  Casseroles (homemade hamburger helper) or pasta sauce (1lb of hamburger to feed 7-9 of us) was about it a couple times a month.With a turkey or chicken (when the family size got to the point of it taking 3 chickens I started cooking 1 turkey). I serve the first night as a roast, Toss the bones into the pot to make broth ,the second as blue plate special, the third as casserole and the last as soup or noodles or dumplings. Not much meat left on that bird especially a chicken. YES I strain the fat also. (Think Schmaltz of Jewish food).Pork, so few and far between, I would try to have a pork roast on the first day of fall with root veggies and carrot cake...anything to bring a little cheer into a life. We were living in poverty and little things make the difference in the days. Pork  fat is good lard when strained. Blue plate special, BBQ pork sandwiches...now I would add Brunswick stew.Ten large eggs equal around a pound (sometimes it's more than a pound)...keep that one in mind as the price of eggs goes through the roof. You don't mind paying over $5 for a pound of meat...same should go for eggs WHICH will feed you more per person.Think a pot of soup on the stove AT LEAST once a week. We floated between beef and vegetable soup (leftover chuck roast), tomato soup (chicken noodle for the child allergic to tomatoes), potato soup, bean soup (change what beans) and chili soup (heavy on the beans and light on the meat) Once in a great while I would make beef stew (with and without dumplings)Along that line would be chicken and dumplings, chicken and homemade noodles, beef and homemade noodles, tuna noodle casserole, scalloped potato and ham chunks, along with boiled dinners....cabbage,potatoes and carrots boiled together in ham broth, green beans ,potatoes and onions in ham broth (or ham fat),and enchilada casserole (heavy of the beans and light on the meat).Then there was what I called the blue plate specials...beef,chicken, turkey,ham or pork sliced very thin on bread stuffing or slice of bread, with a side of mashed potatoes covered in gravy.If dinner was pasta the next day's lunch might have been left over sauce over bread or rice or leftover pasta with butter and garlic powder.Bean soup got strained to make refried beans with cheese  bean burritos and enchilada casserole. Sometimes made into baked beans.IF there was potato soup left I would add corn for corn chowder and/or chicken for chicken and corn chowder.Dumplings and noodles/pasta stretched many a meal.Bread fills tummies very well...cornbread was served with beans, and then the next day served with brown sugar syrup for breakfast or a snack or a dessert at the meal. I tried to make mush the same night so I could have fried mush the next day...I'm about the only one that will eat it any more. Did the same with leftover oatmeal. I now have a recipe for oatmeal bread from Mary Ostyn over at owlhaven.net that I have used.Next will be ONE MORE ROUND"},
{"title": "Why my pantry is full.", "date": "Saturday, September 5, 2015", "text": "This what I have hanging in my kitchen. I've had it so many years that I can't remember who gave it to me and hadn't thought to write it on the back. It's just on regular printer paper and in a sheet protector. So if you gave it to me...thanks.Waste not, want not.Use it up,wear it out, make it do, or do without.They weren't ready for hard times when the Great Depression hit. A lot of folks weren't living the good life anyways, dirt poor and poverty was already in the home.I didn't live through those times but my parents did. I did live through my parents getting a divorce which meant Dad wasn't there to put the garden in or fish and hunt for meat for the table. Food took the hit and Mom and I went hungry more than once. reminded her of the times she went hungry during the Great Depression as a child. My brother moved back home and my Mom's youngest sister moved in for awhile also. Between the four of us we were able to get the garden planted and food back on the table. None of us fished or hunted...meat became a condiment instead of the main course.Could I feed my family if something happened?At home now there is  Hubby,myself and our 2 dogs. There have been many times I pulled from my pantry for others, including my children and grandchildren. I now share my bounty with my Dad on a regular bases. Not that he can't afford food but being alone and in his late 80s he gets tired of cooking for one and eating his own leftovers. I wouldn't have it any other way and Hubby is fine with it.There was a time Hubby's work went down to 3 days a week after decades of overtime and even years he had to take vacation to not work 7 days a week all the time....we weren't prepared and lost everything. The only thing that was \"okay\" was I had enough food to feed us for 6 mos. My fear was the food would run out before the garden was producing again or worse that the garden wouldn't produce enough like now when I watch over half of the crops rot before they are even ripe.My \"win\" against this nightmare is to keep a good pantry when I was in my 20s and 30s this was this list...All purpose flour (bread flour when I can afford it)corn meal (not box mixes)oats (not instant)baking sodabaking powdersalt and pepper (garlic powder when I can afford it)yeastdried beansriceevaporated milk or dried milk (both when I can afford it)cocoalard, then it was Crisco then it was oiltea (coffee when I could afford it)eggsmilkAmerican cheesecheapest pizza cheese I could findtomato sauce.cheapest pasta I could findpopcornbutter.Veggies were in season or what ever canned was on sale.It took 2 cans to feed us when it was 4 of us. I bought one #10 can of Veg-all (think restaurant size) every other month for veggie soup.Fruit was what ever was in season or very very cheap. I didn't buy canned fruit or frozen fruit...way too expensive.Meat was bought on sale or from the clearance bin....I tried to get a chuck roast, a whole chicken and hamburger....sometimes a pork roast in the fall. I got pepperoni from the local deli because I could ask for a dollar's worth and have it sliced thin and have enough for 4-6 pizzas if I was careful about the amount I put on it.Sometimes I bought bread that was discounted, most times I made my own.Peanut butter and jelly were only when I had extra money.No one went hungry and many times the kids friends were in to eat also...never planned just stopped in to play and ended up eating. I don't remember a time that I ever said they couldn't eat because there wasn't enough...I stretched it or added more bread to the table.Even today, now pushing 60 , with just us and the dogs this is still my main pantry list. I have change a few things...there is always olive oil along with what ever oil I buy. I buy Wondra instant flour for my gravies and sauces.I buy white and yellow corn meal. I like white for corn bread and some breading and yellow for mush and some breading.I use lard,Crisco and oil. There is an assortment of dried beans ( I grow part of them) and rice (which I can't grow)I grow a lot of the herbs I use now including garlic. I grind my own cayenne peppers to mix with red bell peppers I grow for crushed red pepper. We grow popcorn. I make my tomato sauce from the tomatoes I grow. American cheese is few and far between as we use other sliced cheese that is on sale for cheaper now days. I usually buy a colby jack shredded mix for the Mexican dishes or salads or sandwiches along with the cheap pizza cheese.I buy our fruit in case sales from a local butcher that has it once a year in the late summer. I have almost 1400 sq feet of garden that provides a lot of the food we eat for a year. I fill in with food bought from the Amish produce auction and the Amish family that sells their extra produce in town.We buy meat on sale or clearance as Hubby doesn't hunt and drowns plastic worms when he fishes.Still this past two years I have watched the grocery budget spiral out of control...so it's back to the basics and that's the focus from here out.Blessed beNext post...making it last longer"},

He explained his meds and what they are for...he is still having good days, but bad days are really bad especially living alone even with family checking on him repeatedly during the day.The spring gardens didn't do much, weather wasn't good.The summer gardens are getting way too much rain, luckily we did put straw in the north garden so we can get in to harvest and check on the plants and not swim through the mud.The rest of the gardens are either sq ft gardens or a narrow strip that I can reach across.I have ordered most of my fall/winter seeds...didn't have much to order as I ordered extra in the spring. I will be ordering my garlic and shallots(new one for me to grow). I will use some of the garlic I have grown to replant.We have some changes to make with the finances. Looking at retirement in 5 yrs...not what we had thought about doing, thought 7 yrs the soonest but ....decided to look at 5 just in case things change and Hubby has to retire out sooner.Blessed Be"},

So we ordered a hide quarter of beef from the young man that has his cattle in the barn here at the homestead. Then realized we needed another freezer by doing this. Found a great freezer( AKA Newbie,21.7 cubic) on sale (first new chest freezer we have ever bought) and it was delayed in being delivered....crisis...shifted things around, son took some of the beef and everything fit in what we had.THEN the brain storm was we needed to move the other 2 deep freezers around to put the new one in the basement where Monty (27 cubic ..Montgomery and Ward) was and put Monty where Baby (7 cubic) was....SO in my mess of health...I decided I wanted it in the mudroom off the kitchen where we already have the second frig. THEN I decided to paint the room and redo it for how we use it (which is fine with our landlord).What we thought would be a week project is now in to the 3rd week and still going on. I am not thrilled with the shelves, they wobble and I need a new trash can for the dog food to fit in the spot by the shelves plus get the corner round painted and on.The first picture ( because I forgot before pictures this was all that wasn't painted) is the corner of the mudroom...the ceiling,walls and corner round was this dirty beige...the \"brick\" is wallpaper that has been on for decades that was behind a sink that leaked if used. We ripped out the sink, fixed the plumbing so if anyone in the future wants to put a sink back in they only have to remove the paneling .The next two are the finished room...well almost finished. We decided to add corner round to the top of the baseboard and it needs painted red before we do that. I haven't decided on the curtains...red goes well but I use that color in the winter for the holidays...the blue curtain isn't the right shade, I don't want dark colors during the spring and summer...I am thinking of a quilt pattern or even crocheting something...right along with all the other projects I have to do.With trying to figure out what to put in what freezer and leave room for when the produce starts coming in....and trying to figure out where to put the stuff that did not go back in the mudroom .... I imagine April will disappear also.Blessed Be"},

I hope it blew out some of the germs. I should have stock in Kleenex.We got pizza out the other day , spent $20.00 and it has already been used in 4 meals and another is in the freezer from it. I feel that's not bad as I added salad etc as sides with it.I reworked the menu to put in what was not ate last month.Tonight it roasted turkey, mainly because I needed the freezer room for left overs or what is now plan overs for when I am in the gardens next month and April.Sour cream and chive potatoes and a couple other veggies along with pickles, pickled hot cauliflower and beets.Tuesday Fat Tuesday...pancakes for bfast of course  HA HA and Jambalaya for dinner. No King cake, we don't care for it that much but I might add some snicker doodle cookies from the freezer.Wednesday is Ash Wednesday but it's also our anniversary so it's prime rib roast,CA blend veggies and baked sweet potato as that is Hubby's favorite. Brownies as I have a craving for them...might add mini choc chips.Thursday is Chinese New Year....egg rolls, potstickers, fried rice, There is a frozen chicken dish and a frozen beef dish to be reheated.Friday we will be driving Pat to his Dad's so we thought we would swing by the restaurant that we were given a $25 gift card to and use it.

I have decide to try to do a 4 season garden. We miss our green veggies during the winter and they cost an arm and leg and then half the time because I have to buy a \"big\" container, I end up tossing part of it out before we get it ate. We just don't eat the same greens every day. I don't have that problem in the spring through fall as I only cut what I need. SO 4 seasons...that means extra seeds to buy...different varieties as we already know we get bored of the same thing. I don't grow the same green veggies in the fall that I grow in the spring.I have placed the last of my seed orders(maybe HA HA) and in April (April 17th to be exact) the Produce auction will start for plants.Meantime, it's organize organize organize and plan those garden plots.Still recovering....slow and steady, a bit better daily, exhaustion is down to beyond tired  HA HA (NOT really funny).Be safe, be healthy, live well."},

I am hoping I am over the hump.We only bought milk since the Jan 2nd  when we did our meat buying(sales were good). Since I just opened it this morning I figure we will make it through the week. Hubby bought it on the way home from work at the local grocery store, it's only 2 miles out of the way instead of 30 mile round trip and that saved on gas even though the milk was a bit more in price.We both figured we spend less because he just went in and got ONLY milk where in the city we would have been checking out the sales.I roasted a turkey that made 4 meals for the week (stayed on menu mostly)and put 2 more in the freezer including over a gal of broth (in different size containers) for other meals.I mended 3 pants for Pat.I mended a shirt for Hubby and I changed a jacket he had that was damaged to a vest for him that he can wear.I mended a sweater for myself.I made 5 gals of laundry soap. That will last about 3 months or more for us.I wash the bedding and furniture throws quite often since the dogs sleep on my bed and furniture.I made cranberry juice from last year's cranberries that was in the freezer and made cranberry sauce from what was left of the juice.I started a soup container in the deep freezer...funny how we stopped all of a sudden of having a couple bites in containers in the frigs after I did that.I have been making sure the curtains to the south are open on days that it is sunny to help warm the house and closed before it gets dark.I checked the pantry for what we are low in and what needs used up before it's lost....we had water standing in the pantry at Thanksgiving and I got a feel it cost us with some of the root veggies. Next year we are going to change where we store our root veggies to keep them longer and hopefully not have as much waste.I started planning our garden....we are looking at year around gardening....big planning of needing covers and etc to do that so I want to have the \"buy\" list now to have it all way before it's actually needed.I have a daughter getting married and she asked for me to grow her flowers ...or try to grow as much as I can as I am not into growing flowers (yarrow does well for me and that's about it). SO I need to think about what to plant AND where I am going to plant it because if I give veggie garden space up for it then I have to figure out where to put the veggies so we have our needs for the year met.What did you do to save money or your time this week?"},

Will call our local store to see what 50 lbs of potatoes are running. We go through about 30-40 lbs a month.Our one store is offering meat packages...the one is really really good for us as it has roasts for half the price as the big stores. I will be ordering it also in the next couple weeks...after the bills are paid and Christmas is bought.I have half of Christmas bought and wrapped...will finish the rest before the 20th and have the cookies and candy done by then also. LONG days this week.I bought a large calendar for menus only. I use www.flylady.net calendar for everything else but I wanted one for the kitchen and the menu only. I wanted to list the entree, sides and dessert if having one.

{"title": "Sometimes Our Kids Worry", "date": "Thursday, October 23, 2014", "text": "Remember this? Our kids were thankful we found a washer, that we weren't be spending our grocery money at the laundromat but  there was concern of the amount of work it would cause me to do the laundry and the age of the washer. Truthfully I enjoy doing the laundry more and I do it less often and the clothes are coming out cleaner.Wellllll...see this?This is the used freezer we just bought.  We had been looking since the other one died. Saved up a couple hundred knowing that a used freezer was just going to be a stop gap until we could afford a new one. Hubby went to a couple auctions, we checked out the want ads etc...always sold or up right or had sat off for a long time with door shut...not good or was a very small freezer. Just when we thought we would have to buy a new freezer that was really too small, there was another auction close by that had a freezer listed. BUT it had been sitting turned off (the door was open so it didn't stink).As the price went up Hubby decided he wasn't willing to sink that much money in a maybe it will start back up freezer. He turned to walk away and an old friend from work ran into him. They got to talking and the old friend told him another coworker that had retired had a yardsale the other weekend and the deep freezer didn't sell and gave him the phone number. Hubby came home and called...and there it just gets interesting.The freezer was the sister-in-law's that had died and they were clearing the house. They hadn't really put the freezer up for sale...no one was really interested in it because it was old but still working, was on and cleaned so they were going to just let it go with the house.It was the size we wanted and a chest.When we went to get it the store comes out. First it wasn't put up for sale because they used it as the table during the yard sale. A lady had asked about it but since they asked for $50 for it she walked away.The sister-in-law died from cancer. She liked to buy things and then give them away to those that needed them...like my Mother. The co worker's wife's name is exactly the same as my Mother.  The freezer is bigger than we were looking for it, it runs and it's clean AND it's over 40 yrs old. Yep over 40 yrs old...A blessing and I still believe Mother was looking from heaven guiding us to this freezer."},
{"title": "Amish Produce Auction...Frugal Friday...grocery budget", "date": "Monday, October 20, 2014", "text": "We got two of these boxes filled with small pumpkins for a total 54 pumpkins minus the 2 we gave to a friend.We got 80 lbs of winter storage onions.We got 15 lbs of small potatoes the size that is of new potatoes.we bought 14 heads of cabbage. I gave one to an elderly gentleman that reminded me of my Dad and another to a friend.We bought 14 lbs of carrots and gave 2 lbs to the friend. This is after I put them in wood chips/shavings for the root cellar in the basement. I did this also with the 10 lbs of turnips we bought.There is 8 boxes (was 9 , gave 1 to friend) of red tomatoes, 7 boxes of green tomatoes,10 lbs of small green tomatoes, 8 eggplants (gave 8 to friend) 24 butternut squash (gave 8 to friend) sitting on the table waiting to be processed. I wished there had been beets.And 16 -10 inch pots of mums that we got for 25¢ each.We spent a total of $211 for enough veggies to last us for several months.I picked up 6 spaghetti squashes and a 50 lb bag of Chef (baking) potatoes and an apple crumb pie and pumpkin roll for $64 at Hurley's farm market.I had set the Auction budget at $400. So part of what was left was spent on us eating out and going to  the grocery store, picked up a few beets SMILE, celery and a few odds and ends needed.Grocery budget stands at $594.54 out of the $600 budget. Leaving $5.46 for the rest of the month....I know we will go over with the acknowledgement that most of the stuff I bought at the auction and farm is going to lower the amount in the coming months so I can spend the regular grocery money on buying stuff for Tday dinner and Christmas baking.All in all I am happy with the haul for the price."},
{"title": "Scioto Valley Produce Auction", "date": "Friday, October 10, 2014", "text": "We go to the Scioto Valley Produce Auction which is ran by the Amish in the spring to get our plants for the gardens and flowers. Pictures above are just a very little bit of what I have gotten. I've gotten tomato plants for 25¢ each. Bought several trays of 48 tomato plants for $5. Broccoli, cauliflower,onions,cabbages, pepper plants and more for a lot less than I would pay at a green house or the stores.Then middle of July to the beginning of August we go again and starting picking up produce that is raised by the Amish. This was some of what we have bought last year. This year we didn't go because my gardens were running us over as it was.Then my deep freezer died and took it all with it. :(  Can you tell I am still upset over it ?We went last month with some friends, we usually wait until middle of October for fall crops but they wanted to go to the pumpkin auction. I had to leave early before the auction was over so I left Hubby with a list. I wrote 5 b green beans...meaning boxes which was 1/2 bushel each...he got 5 bushels. Granted after canning it the cost worked out to 26¢ a pint, (I can in pints because that is the jars I have) so it ended up a good deal except for Hubby that doesn't like green beans to begin with. He eats them, but doesn't like them. I have over 240 pints and I still have a few coming in from our own plants.He is going to eating green beans every 4 days.Next weekend we go for the fall crops.I really hope onions, winter cabbage, winter squash (besides pumpkins and acorns that I have plenty of) sweet potatoes, white potatoes, and garlic are in abundance. Some of those that sell at the auction sell  what is their over flow from their own gardens. Some have went to growing produce to sell since farm land is limited and they can grow produce on 10 acres of land to support their family instead of 100 acres to raise crops and livestock. Last year was rough with the hard and cold winter we had. Those heating green houses by wood were sleeping in the green houses to keep the fire going where a few were heating with propane watched the cost go through the roof. Putting food on the table is their first priority, selling the rest is second.With talk of another hard winter, not as much is going to the auction as last year.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Frugal Accomplishments", "date": "Tuesday, October 7, 2014", "text": "I have been trying to keep a list of my Frugal Accomplishments. When you are frugal to begin with you don't always acknowledge what you are doing is frugal.I finished canning the green beans that we had bought at the produce auction.The cost without the hours of my time (243 pints of green beans, I had pint jars so I didn't go buy anymore). The cost came out to 26¢ a pint, a lot cheaper than buying green beans at the store.We bought acorn squash and spaghetti squash for 50¢ each that weighed about 2 lbs each.They are running about 79¢ a pound at the farmers' markets which is cheaper than the stores. I haven't been able to grow squash for what ever reason. This is now in the section of the basement that winter squash and potatoes hold well through the winter. I will still pick up butternut, delicata and maybe some kind of hubbard.I am recording humidity levels in other parts of the basement to find another area for \"root cellar\" food.I gave some strawberry starters to our friends so I would have more room in my strawberry bed.I hung my first strand of onions that our friends gave us. I buy the cheapest panty hose or stockings I can find to store my onions in . Tie a knot between each (I cut panty hose in half) and hang from the beams in the basement. Helps keep them during the winter. If one goes bad it doesn't affect the others and I can just cut an onion off the bottom when I need one. We use 7-10 onions a week.A 3 lb bag from the store doesn't last the week. My onions didn't do well this year.Gave us enough for fresh but not for storage.I took the hem out of a couple of Pat's pants.We got the wringer washer set up and usable (I can change water every wash and have hot and cold water to fill with without lugging water)...I timed it yesterday when I used it and I spent an extra hour doing the rinse by hand(Hubby rigged it like a rain barrel so I can drain it without lifting it) and it took the dryer the same amount of time of laundry done at the laundromat which is twice as long as a home washer. I used the clothes line all week except yesterday...was wet here. Since Hubby can actually fix this, no computer YEA!!! I feel the $90 spent on it is well worth the price of my extra hour's time doing laundry comparing to going to the laundromat. AND I got the a lot of fall cleaning done in the basement during loads.Maybe next year I will look for a new washer and deal with computer boards again. Right now I am okay with this.I gathered seeds from my lettuce plant to replant next year.I gathered some of the green beans that I let dry on the vine to plant next year. I grow heirloom most of the time. I make sure I mark what is NOT heirloom so I don't waste my time letting it go to seed and gathering it. I have 5 varieties of beans I plant each year.I made a list of the gag gifts we will be giving for Christmas. We have a large family. The budget has remained the same even as the family quad-tripled. Over half will be made with things we already have on hand. The list helps me keep focused on what I need to keep and do. I try to do 10 gag gifts per person...that's over 400 gifts. Not counting Hubby's guys under him at work we get for.I didn't list anything else...got to focus on that some more.Make sure that I am keeping things as frugal as I can.Blessed Be"},

I might have Hubby cover the zucchini plants as there are blooms on them and they are in an area that we could cover them easily enough.I need to update the budget. This Thursday we make the final payment to a loan that was half the bring home of the month. I don't want to fritter that money away so I need to have where it goes in place besides the savings acct and on the last of the debt from where Hubby was down to 3 days a week for 2 yrs. We are still rebuilding. The only that didn't take the hit was the retirement fund. Better to work 2-3 jobs now while still able than live in poverty when we are in our 70/80's.I have apples a friend gave us yesterday to make applesauce and caramel apple jam.I need to pick the last of the beans to be shelled to plant next year.We need to finish taking the gardens down and prepping for spring. The last 2 yrs things turned bad for us and it didn't get done.Makes spring planting late getting in when we have to finish what should have been done in the fall.I need to clear the foundation garden also.I need to cover the strawberries and fall garlic I planted with straw.The lilac and rose bush needs trimmed.I need to cut some corn stalks down for decorations and grab some of the leaves for gag gifts at Christmas.I need to gather some of the sticks up out of the yard, keep some for gag gifts for Christmas (the grandkids always look forward to and wonder what gag gifts they are getting)I have started working on Christmas. We have a large family..that happens when you have a lot of kids and then they have a lot of kids.We spend $12 per person for gifts...I try to make most of it and give gag gifts with $1 cash.I need to inventory the freezers.

I would like to add an area for a root cellar but I don't think we have enough stuff laying around to wall the area in.As it is, I would be battling the field mice over the food. I might be able to use the outdoor staircase from the basement. I need to keep track of it's temp and humidity this week and see if it is possible.I need to caulk some windows after I get more caulking that is on the buy list for this week.Pat asked for a Lunchable for his field trip on Thursday. Since he has youth group on Wednesday and needs a hair cut (coupon) I thought I would take him to get the hair cut and Lunchable after youth group. Saves a little on gas.I need to go through some clothes my oldest gave me from her youngest to see if any of it fits Pat or can be altered to fit him before I start hitting the thrift shops to find more winter clothes for him.I need to go through Hubby's clothes and make the list of what he needs replaced.I need to go through my own clothes and see what needs replaces. I've lost enough weigh since last winter that my clothes are hanging on me. While doing that I need to find the box that has my winter socks and flannel tights.I need to call the hospital about a bill that was not done correctly on their end. They are trying to get it fixed but I want to stay on top of it as our ins is saying they haven't filed the corrected papers.Have a blessed day"},

{"title": "My new washer", "date": "Wednesday, October 1, 2014", "text": "Oh yeah, Hubby did...for those that are not old enough to recognize this..it's an old wringer washer. Yes, it works. Yes, I will have to stay with the washer to wash the clothes.I won't go in to detail of all that but it's not a turn on and walk away and the load is done 30 minutes later. I would love to have a second one for the rinse but I doubt if we will find another one at $90. You can get brand new ones for $1000 and I have seen used going for up to $500.Hubby set up the old washer hoses so I don't have to lug water and I can change the water every load which in the old days we used one fill of water and started it with hot water and whites was washed first.The pump hose it connected to the old drain hose so that is taken care of also. He bought me a new bright pink water tub (they use for farm animals etc) and put a drain and hose on it so I don't have to dump that water either and the hot and cold water hoses reach the rinse tub.The agitator knob is sticking so he is going to deal with that this week and I will be set to wash clothes at home again and no more $5 a load at the laundromat. which was costing me $75 a week to do all the laundry. I probably will take the comforters,king size blankets and winter coats to the laundromat like my Mother did but that won't be a weekly expense.The up side of this washer...no computer to go out and I can SOAK in the washer instead of a sink. The negative besides the risk of smashing fingers in the wringer is I will be definitely hands on with the washing and rinsing. I figure it might be a side benefit that I can sort boxes and do some cleaning in the basement that keeps getting pushed down the to do list if I am sitting in the basement dealing with the washer. We will see.I figure the money I save from NOT going to the laundromat can go towards a new washer down the road and I can resell this washer for parts to someone else if it quits running on me.Blessed beWe finished the month at $468.92...that's over our $350 budget by $118.92.I don't feel bad about it because $63.00 of that was 4 1/2 bushels of green beans which made 243 pints of green beans.That comes out to be 26¢ per pint (a 15.5 oz can is running $1.69 here) AND we got 12 acorn squash for $5.70 that would have cost us $17.59 at the local farmer's market. The rest of the over budget amount was eating out twice while I was canning the 243 pints and then taking Pat out after his last soccer game which they won.October's budget is $600. I know we will be stocking up on winter squash,onions and potatoes on top of starting to stock up for the holiday baking.I would love to find a used chest freezer before Nov  but that is low on the buy list.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Grocery update", "date": "Sunday, September 21, 2014", "text": "We didn't do so well last week with our grocery budget.  I spent $67.03 at the grocery store and that included some stocking up. That part was good...the bad part was I didn't check the calendar when I made the menu and didn't take in account there would be 2 nights of us not being home until around 7 pm...not a good time to start cooking or even eating when Pat goes to bed at 8 and Hubby goes to work at 8:30.So I spent $21.98 at Taco Bells getting 2 boxes of soft tacos. That fed us with additions of fruit and raw veggies for dinner , Hubby's lunch at work, and the next night's dinner also.The other time was I had been canning all day, knew I would be the day before but still didn't engage the brain and fix something so I wouldn't be trying to deal with all the canning and the dinner.Hubby called in a couple orders for fried chicken (4 pieces and sides each meal that we split 4 ways ) at a tavern (which is known more for it's food) that is only 3 miles away. He spent $20.49...actually we got it for a better deal....the server gave Hubby the wrong meals and he didn't realize it until I opened it up at home so they gave those to us free and he went back and got our chicken. So we had extra veggies that night and Hubby got 2 extra lunches and Pat got to have chili fries with the left over fries.Works for me LOL.This week I really checked the calendar, paid attention to the fact I will have more canning to do this week and several appointments.We are also trying to get more color on our plates which meant more fruits and veggies then I normally get since we lost most of our colorful veggies and fruits when the deep freezer died. Still we have $28.45 left out of the $350 budget and 9 more days of this month.I might splurge and buy some pork chops as they have been out of our budget for a couple months now. I will see...Blessed Be"},
{"title": "The day of rest and the week to come.", "date": "Sunday, September 14, 2014", "text": "I am looking forward to when our trees look like this.I won't have to rake them because they blow away over the fields so I get the pleasure of looking without the work though I image I will have to rake some up or let Pat rake some up for him to jump in. Maybe burn a few since we can do open burn in this area if the winds are not blowing much.Hard to rest today when I look around and see all the work still to do before winter hits. I compromise with myself and spent the day planning for the work load this week.I hope to have most of the harvest done this week and most of the gardens prepped for winter.It would be nice to not start my spring planting with clearing last year's mess.I have started the fall cleaning and weatherization, yes, even though I do Flylady (www.flylady.net) I still do fall cleaning. I just break it down in to steps so I don't over whelm my self...or at least I try to. Yesterday I spent 6 hours in the pantry in the basement and I know I have another 4-5 hrs left of cleaning, reorganizing,inventorying etc left to do in that area (12 x 26 with 8 ft ceilings which the shelves go to the ceiling.... 32 shelves that are 3 x 8). That is the priority of this week as I need to keep the groceries down as low as possible and by not knowing what is in the pantry I end up buying food while what is in the pantry goes to waste.I am not going to get my sewing done like I want until the harvest is done and I can paint my craft room and set up my sewing area again.Blessed be"},

We bought 31 lbs of dog food (will last 2 wks) and 3 bags of softener salt which came to $42.73 of that $62.09. Non-food costs us more than actual food ( this week was only veggies) does most of the time.We haven't eaten out, Hubby and Pat even pushed their lunches back last Saturday until they got to the cookout so they wouldn't be spending any money eating out.I fixed pizza and spag at the beginning of the week and we ate it as left overs the rest of the week until last night. Last night was breaded pork tenderloin for us and grilled cheese for Pat, his lucky sandwich when he has games. It's just Hubby and I this weekend as Pat is going to spend the weekend with his Dad so we will just raid and see what we find to eat.I didn't accomplish much of any thing with my goals. Had a lot of appointments and phone calls to get medical bills paid (GRRRR) that should have just been paid the first time. Hopefully I will be able to get more done this week even though I have some appt or game almost every day to get to.Frugal accomplishments....we didn't waste any food this week...not one thing :) I mended a couple tee shirts for Pat and sewed a button on a shirt for Hubby. I moved laundry day so I could use the clothes line.Be safeBlessed Be"},
{"title": "This week's groceries", "date": "Saturday, September 6, 2014", "text": "Last week I spent $43.36 and it was on non-food only not even a gal of milk. :)This week I spent $54.70 on food. Bought milk, half and half, coffee beans, baking potatoes,apples,2 juices, 4 dozen eggs,and a loaf of sliced white bread.That brings the total so far to $98.06 leaving $251.94 out of the $350. budget I set for this month.I have realized that Hubby and I are not on the same page of what to do with the leftovers or other items that need ate with in a few days.I usually put these type of items in the frig in the kitchen, the one that has the water pitcher and milk so during the day I see them and figure out how to serve them.Hubby put them in the white frig as there was more room...and I didn't notice it or more I didn't pay attention so we lost a couple things :(  I figured out it came to about $5 but still that is the same as pouring 2 gals of milk down the drain.So we talked about figuring out where the items go, and to list them on the menu immediately or put them in the freezer.I am looking at how to organize the frigs better also.Other good news is we didn't eat out at all but boy did I want to with the appts and game during the weekHubby and Pat might today grab a sandwich because they are working the parade in town this morning and I did make sure both had a good breakfast and then going to a HAM radio thing this afternoon. I know they will have hotdogs and brats at the HAM radio thing because our friend told me that he was grilling them for the group but it might be more of a dinner thing than a lunch thing.All week our dinners average $2-$4 per meal (3 ,might as well say adults as Pat eats as much as I do and I am not a small eater, and then we pack Hubby's lunch for workout of dinner)...not per serving. The main part of the meal is out of our garden or friends gardens that was given to us free. Meat has been more of a condiment than the main course but with us eating protein through the day I don't worry about that being low at dinner.I baked bread today using a different recipe. Cheaper 18 ¢ per loaf compared to my 32¢ per loaf recipe. I spent $16.83 a month for the last 4 months to buy just bread. That is way too much on something I can make that is just as good if not better.This coming week is going to be a rough one. We have an appt or a soccer game right at dinner time 4 nights this week. Pat eats early on game nights so he doesn't get tummy cramps during the game.So those nights need to be something he can eat before the game and Hubby and I can eat after the game.I am thinking of the following:Sunday is left over pizza or baked potatoes and corn on the cob. We have a reunion that day and we will pig out there.Monday: spaghetti and meatballs (the \"boys' favorite) salad with lots of veggies, home made bread and mandarin orangesTuesday: Chicken nuggets, sweet potato fries, corn on the cob, carrots and dip and apple slicesWednesday: beef roast with root veggies,home made bread, cobbler or crisp depending on what fruit needs used up.Thursday: beef in homemade noodles, mashed potatoes, coleslaw or veggie salad (depending on what needs used up) and some kind of fruit...depending on what needs used up.Friday is still open...maybe leftovers if there is any or a breakfast for dinner.Saturday will depend on whether my son and his family can come up or not.Blessed be"},
{"title": "What to do?", "date": "Thursday, September 4, 2014", "text": "Which bill do we pay? The rent that the landlord is okay with being late as we do work on the house for lower rent anyways or the medical bill that we save on by paying ahead of time?What necessities have to be bought? Last week was none food, this week is food.What do we do about the child that says one thing to us and another to his teacher and both are lies that could cause someone trouble?What do we do about the mother of the child (our daughter) that isn't doing what she should so she can see him (been a month) let alone have him living with her again?What do we do about both the SUV and the truck needing repairs?Do I work on the house getting it winterized for this winter?ORDo the washing that has the winter bedding and clothes so I can dry them on the line to keep the electric bill down.ORJust focus on the incoming harvest?Trying to do all 3 just put me down for 2 days with my Crohn's. It doesn't like stress...Even my Hubby that never has complained of stress in over 20 yrs. complained of stress yesterday and considering we have dealt with 2 different children being suicidal, kids losing homes, us losing homes, my heart failure, my Crohn's and his work went down to 3 days a week for 2 yrs and mine going away completely causing us into a Chapter 13 bankruptcy (slow pay)etc...it takes a lot for him to acknowledge he is stressing...which, of course, stressed me even more.What to do?Hold on to my faith with both hands.Take a deep breath, release....okay, do it again and again and again.First is, pay the medical bill, landlord is okay with being paid on next Thursday. His running joke is he knows were we live and he can always shop for his groceries in my pantry...true, very true and he knows if we weren't here that the house would sit empty and he would have nothing coming in anyways except the bills of keeping it in good condition. It's the old homestead and he was leery of renting it out anyways and can't rent to family due to tax reasons.Second,I think milk, coffee beans (we use less if we grind our own then if we buy ground coffee, saves us about $10/wk) and possible in season fruit and veggies that we don't have in our garden.Third,Okay, we dumped that on the school counselor and his psychologist. I am dumping mine on my counselor.Fourth, I can't force my daughter to do anything, it's to the point that she threatens to harm us if we are anywhere near her. I leave her in God's hands.THAT IS HARD.Fifth,make a list of repairs needed, price out what is needed and prioritize the repairs. What can we do ourselves and what will have to be hired. We have 2 very good and affordable mechanics.LAST...winter wash, weatherization,harvest...all 3 are very important but nothing gets done when I am down with my Crohn's. I can weatherize when it's raining, I can do the winter wash on good days. Harvest can be done rain or shine...the in ground garden is when its shine and the rest in square foot gardens can be done in the rain. I have been known to put my muck boots on and go in the in ground garden and harvest...horrible and messy but doable.Sometimes I just need to stop and write it out."},

I will start looking at yard sales and thrift shops for these items now and buy new as a last resort.We will eat from the pantry...no fast food this week. Between doctor appointments, counseling sessions, soccer practices,and tests at the hospital we have been eating out a lot.Blessed BeBrandi does frugal accomplishments and weekly goals over attheprudenthomemakerblog.blogspot.com. My frugal accomplishments this past week were:I mended 2 shirts and 2 pairs of shorts.I glued a pair of shoes back together for myself.The dryer died, but we were storing our son's dryer so he is \"lending\" it to us until he decides if he needs it back or not. Hubby tightened the clothes lines so I can hang the wash on good days. I have been trying to float when I do the laundry to days that I can use the line and if we need something that can't wait I hang it on the drying rack in the basement.Hubby has been taking the motorcycle to work instead of driving the truck when weather is good.Tomatoes, green beans, banana peppers and green bell peppers, zucchini and yellow squash has been coming in so they have been canned, froze or dehydrated.Some friends gave us some zucchini, cantaloupe,banana peppers, hot peppers, green bell peppers and cucumbers. They are pretty much to the point of just eating from the garden instead of preserving it..I am trying to use hydroponic with my strawberry runners to get more plants so put else where and to share with the friend that gave me the produce.I gathered some of the seeds from the lettuce plant I allowed to go to seed. It's one of them that we prefer. I have some green beans that I am allowing to dry on the vine to replant next year also.I am thinking of saving a couple other green beans also to have the different varieties.I combined my appointment this with getting the non-food this week and saved $13.10 at the dollar store.I used my coupons and bought fabric on sale for clothes and home items, including a couple Christmas gifts I need to make and saved $76.20 which shocked the register lady along with Hubby. PLUS got another coupon if I go back this week.I used my swagbucks to order a couple books from Amazon for free and am saving up again for a book that is on order for end of Oct. Half way to that amount.We spent Saturday evening with friends and had a cook out.Blessed beof my childhood...this kitchen picture was close to what my Mother's uncle had built in the home we lived in except we had a cabinet under the sink and the top cabinets didn't come all the way down to the counter. The apron was one like my great-uncle's mother-in-law from Italy wore. She insisted I call her Nonna and tell people I was her granddaughter. I didn't have any problem with that at all as I spent as much time as I could with her and my great-aunt and her sister.Even though money was extremely tight, Mother was not frugal in the kitchen. The only casseroles she ever made was tuna noodle and scalloped potatoes and ham. The only soups was bean soup and chili made with hamburger. There was always a piece of meat, (Dad hunted and fished or there was no meat), potatoes, usually fried, two veggies that had been canned from our garden or that someone gave us that Mother canned if the garden wasn't producing. There was store bought bread and real butter, maybe pudding if the farm that my brother worked at gave us milk or jello. Fruit was only in season and what ever was in the neighborhood. Christmas gifts was an orange. I remember the first time Dad bought meat at the local grocery that had a butcher cut the meat right there. It was t-bone steak, one for each of us. My brother had gotten accepted to a private college, received a scholarship for playing football and Dad had just made the payment for his freshman year. We celebrated with that steak on the grill, we had baked potato with sour cream and butter and a tossed salad and corn on the cob. I didn't see that meal on our table again until my brother graduated from college four years later.Why the thought of that time? Because I need to cut the budget to make the bills that have came with taking on a grandson to raise and preparing for a winter that they are forecasting to be just like last year...below zero and lots of snow. I am also dealing with losing the deep freezer and all the food that was in it.So I have accepted Mary's challenge over at www.owlhaven.net/2014/08/29/join-my-spending-challenge. I plan to spend half of what we have been averaging for the months since there is now 3 of us for the month of September. I am hoping for less but the goal is NO MORE than $350 for food and non-food.Have a blessed day"},

I have the blisters inside my mouth that shows I can't control myself with constant eating them or the cherry tomatoes. I finally got myself to at least drink water between them :) . A lot of the plants are starting to die off. That's okay as I have tomatoes that I canned last year still in the pantry. Just filling in the holes so to speak with this years.The zucchini, yellow squash and cucumbers have died. I might get a couple cantaloupe yet, they are small but don't seem to be growing much.The yellow wax beans and the first planting of state green beans are pretty much done. I will pull them this week and plant something for this late fall/winter harvest.The second planting of state green beans and the KY wonder beans are starting to need picked every third day.The Italian beans are just coming on but haven't started filling out.They were mislabeled as bush beans but are viners so I have a bit of mess of them.I have some small heads of cabbage that will be ready in a few days. They are from the heads I cut instead of pulling the root out.I downloaded to my kindle pc \"Winter Harvest Handbook\" By Eliot Coleman. To the dismay on my Hubby I have decided to try my hand again at a winter garden. The second year here I did one 4x4 (Square Foot gardening) and it was decent until Jan when the winds took it out. We have a lot of high winds here so I think I have figured out how to deal with it.We have lots of doctors appointments and testing for Pat this week besides my own is going to be a juggling act to put meals on the table between those appointments, soccer practice (almost forgot that one) and the canning that I will be doing.We will be spending Saturday at our oldest daughter's home to help them finish putting the fence up.I would like to get some bread baking done but that keeps getting shoved to the bottom of the list. Going to have to suck up the heat and the time...maybe Wednesday when I have to keep Pat up later than normal due to the test the next morning . They want him tired...that's find except I don't do well at staying awake that late and then getting up earlier. I wonder which one of us is going to be the grumpy one.I have some mending to do that I need to pull out the sewing machine for. Haven't gotten to that either.Best get back to it, dinner needs to be done so we can get to practice.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "When there is a major loss....", "date": "Wednesday, August 6, 2014", "text": "trauma trauma trauma...what you are looking at is our main deep freezer that died and everything thawed and was very very warm when I found it.I am usually in it every day even if just to check on it since it's in the garage. Monday I wasn't and Tuesday morning I found it a very warm mess.All of the broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, zucchini,berries and melons etc. that I had harvested and preserved this year for this coming winter gone. All of our large roasts that was in the bottom drawer and the last of last year's corn gone.This is a very serious set back for us.First, that just wiped out 60% of our winter side dishes and 100% of the desserts. Second, those 10 large pieces of meat were a month's worth of entrees for lunch and dinner. Third,I won't be able to replace those veggies and fruit as they are not in season now and fourth...we can't afford to replace the freezer until late fall or maybe even next spring. So fifth, I don't have a place for turkeys,hams and prime rib roasts (I get it for Hubby for his Christmas present when it's on sale)come this fall. That is our main meat supply for the rest of the year.We have already priced a new freezer so I know what we need to save.I striped the old freezer of the shelves and drawers. I will use the shelves in the root cellar since I definitely will need to get that done asap so I can at least have some root veggies for fresh veggies this year.My Daddy called because he had me on his mind and probably wished he hadn't after I downloaded my pity party. He reminded me that both him and Mother grew up with less, that Mother even went hungry and they both were fine and healthy. I needed to be thankful for what I do have, focus on what I can do (root cellar like my childhood) and take those steps.I am also planting a fall garden, something we had decided against due to other commitments but now putting food on the table is the priority.I an thankful that it was NOW and not after I loaded it with 6-8 turkeys, 4-6 hams and the prime rib roasts(depends on price and money flow on how many).Blessed be"},

We have adjusted better to our changes in our routines then we thought we would.The last few days I've been laid up from a procedure so I took this time to think about what needed to change to get it all done (yeah right) and smooth things out so I am not running in crisis mode (HEAVENS PLEASE).First I did a Control Journal (www.flylady.net) for him. Broke down morning, afternoon, evening and bed routines as he does better with being able to read it as he doesn't do well trying to remember things even after doing them for the last 4 months. I also broke his room done into zones so he isn't trying to clean it all in one day, wasting his Saturday of play time.We set times as he has problem with time management. We are strict with that Sunday is the Day of Rest and Church. Even with me down today, he immediately asked if Granddad and him were going to church...YES!!!!!Now I am working on my own Control Journal, a menu plan that has covers the entire day and lists the sides and adjusting the grocery budget as it almost doubled with having a person in the house with a sugar issue. Can't just fill that empty pit up with bread or grains when it sends sugar up. Already had to change my nightly glass of milk because he can't drink milk at night or his sugar is through the roof even with exercise....bike riding...for at least 30 min after. :(I started updating my Christmas/winter holiday Control Journal...21 weeks to that as there will be extra \"celebrations\" and  more gifts under that tree including from Santa....another increase in the budget that has to be worked in.I need to let some of it stew in my head of what days to do what with acknowledging soccer practice etc that is now in my life.Blessed be"},

The older ones had a good time as they are diving now. The youngest doesn't like it that he has to put his head in the water, more he has to stop talking or he gets water in his mouth. The kids are learning to be quiet because Hubby sleeps days from 12 to 5. Not a long time but he does take a nap before going to work at night.  Youngest thinks he needs to run everything and everyone...even though he is 7 and we just got custody of him, it's like a newborn that can get into everything and talk the whole time. We thought he would be better since he was in school but found out the teacher he had treated him as teacher's pet and pretty much allowed him to run the show and do what ever he wanted ...sigh...this next year is going to be rough with a different school system that will be expecting more out of him.Tstorms in the forecast today so I am not getting out the sprinkler.

{"title": "Taking a moment", "date": "Saturday, June 7, 2014", "text": "Okay , really it's Saturday morning. I need to figure out what work is the priority for this week off the to do list. I need to make a basic weekly grocery list so I don't miss toilet paper and sour cream again.I need to start working on winter bedding and curtains.I need to start working on preparing the house for winter to keep the costs down.  The upstairs is electric baseboard heat while the down stairs is propane. The first year here we spent almost $500 a month trying to hold those rooms at 68°. Then we figured out the house wasn't insulated like the new landlord was told (bought house from family member) and the windows were not as new as he thought either or caulked. My answer last winter was to just close it off since it was just the two of us and the dogs. Meant I didn't work on many crafts since that room is upstairs....sad but worth the price in saving on heat.But this year we will have to heat it. Patrick is now living with us and his bedroom is upstairs. I grew up in a house that only had a space heater in the front room, with my brother's and my rooms upstairs. My own kids grew up in a house that had no heat upstairs, my oldest raised her kids there for awhile and now lives in a house with no heat upstairs either.                                                                                                             SO why the panic attack?This child is used to having the heat of 68 ° or more in his bedroom, running around in shorts and thin shirt all winter. He had done well at adjusting to culture shock between city living,(going to shop daily, fast food,high speed internet, something to do all with the time not spent on xbox or tv,etc) BUT he is constantly cold.It's summer and yet the house is on the cool side. Great when it's 80 something outside but not so much when it's only 65 ° and breezy.Landlord is going to caulk the outside of the windows. I am making a comforter of old jeans, might have enough for curtains. My oldest daughter passed flannel pj bottoms down but didn't have any warm pj tops so I need to find thermal shirts for him. Might have to use adults found at the thrift shop to make some for him.It's a worry with what all ready we having going on and the budget is getting tighter with Hubby looking at having some days laid off of work through the rest of the year. So this morning I am making a list of the priority of the work week, basic grocery list, winter prep and winter needs for Patrick...the time spent planning and organizing will make it easier to do and less likely chance of me forgetting something important ...like toilet paper ...but hey at least we are not OUT, just lower than I like.How are you doing ?Blessed Be"},

Several things have happened, a cold spring that stopped us from getting the spring gardens in, a backed up drain in our basement that flooded the pantry,emergency custody of our grandson due to his mom (our youngest) having issues with her health complicated with other things and a cold beginning of summer with rain pretty often to screw with getting the summer garden in topped with messing my back up to the point medications don't help and struggle to get up and down. Already had a xray which confirmed my deformed disk in my lumbar and scoliosis (duh, I already knew that and had it from birth) and go for a MRI next...sigh...I can say after using 5 hrs of driving grandson daily to his school so he could finish the year out there....I was so far behind in my spring/summer to do list I didn't think I would ever even get close and the budget was whacked out with paying for the gas to get him to school, of course it went UP instead of DOWN.To keep food on the table and cash for the fuel to get him to school I immediately pulled up The Prudent Pantry(theprudentpantryblog.blogspot.com). and followed Brandy's advice more that I usually do.Hubby came in last night and told me that he ran the rotor tiller in the large in garden and I had lost about 1/3rd of my tomatoes, probably from the family of bunnies that are still running around the house even with 2 large dogs constantly chasing after them. Hubby doesn't hunt or care for wild meat or they would be on the dining table by the weekend.I remind myself daily that GOD is giving me no more than I can handle and the strength to handle what comes my way.Meantime since I have to clean out the pantry I decided to change how it is laid out. Hope my back hangs in there long enough to get it done.Later....Blessed be"},

Physical Therapy was a wash out, my ins won't pay for the chiropractor because I have a deformed lumbar so they don't see any point in me going to the chiro even for pain mgt....that is what pill popping is for which is NOT what my medical doctor wants for me.ANYWAYS...mean time...winter refuses to go away and STAY away so I won't be planting any spring crops.....sigh....I miss my spring crops.But I do have a good start of my summer crops growing...as you can see I have a 3 ft by 6 ft card table covered with healthy squashes and cucumbers plus a few others that are not in the picture. In fact there are a couple tomato plants I brought back for my Dad as he likes Mr. Stripey and has problems finding plants for his garden. I also have a 6 ft counter top covered with \"hot house full of seeds and 2 trays under a 4 ft grow light of seedlings for the gardens.Now if only Mother Nature and my body would get their act together.We have been eating from the pantry until 1 wk ago.I bought bacon. We hadn't had any for over 3 months. I also got a lot of fresh veggies and fruit, the salad disappeared in 2 days. We ate out, smoked ribs that we hadn't had for awhile but still kept well in our $400 budget including non food which is our biggest expenseNow it's back to eating out of the pantry, not only because of the tight budget (we have paid off 3 major bills and gained 2 thanks to my health) but because I will need to clean the deep freezers, frig freezers and pantry for the incoming harvest...if Mother Nature works with me.Meantime my to do list has grown to over 2200 items I want done by the end of May....that includes appts. and other things that are not in my normal day.

I forgot the seed had to soak 24 hrs.I prayed over these little lives as I planted them, prayed my black thumb (up to the elbow) didn't kill them off and if it did it was a quick and painless death. I really need to be able to grow the crops from my own seeds as I am to the point of buying very little veggies from the stores.As for my \"flying\" today as in FLYLADY ( www.flylady.net)I fluttered a little...we had went shopping this morning for some things that I need to make a couple gifts plus I found some material for a skirt that will work all year around. All of it was on sale so it was a good day that way.Still by time we got back, ate lunch, played with the pup who is now 2 yrs old today, walked with the older dog that puts up with all of us and started on the seeds...I didn't get much done beside the laundry.As I was doing laundry I day dreamed of hanging clothes on the clothes line...need to get that fixed.The to do list is longer than my arm...okay longer than my car because I am short LOLBlessed Be"},

He didn't have to work this weekend so we were out of the house most of the time for the last two days. The bedroom didn't get done.So as soon as I woke up I stripped the bed and started washing the bedding and remaking the bed. Surprising what a simple thing can do to cheer you up...a nice clean bed to crawl into.I decide that even though today is the Day of Rest and I really try to stay focused on that otherwise my health goes down from the lack of rest. BUT since the last 2 days I have spent basically not doing anything around the house and visiting with friends. I figure I can do an odd job or two and still rest.Have  Blessed Day"},

When ever I hear it play or see it even though it has lost most the parts of his body I have to smile. When my first grandson was a toddler, this was his. I was driving behind his mom, my daughter , and every time she turned or stop and started I would hear this music coming from her trunk so I pulled up beside her and got her to pull over.\"What?\" she demanded.\"There is music coming from your trunk.\"\"I know, it's the freakin toy that annoys me every time it plays so I am taking it to Goodwill.\"\"Give it to me.\"\"Are you kidding me?\"\"Nope, he can play with it at my house and it won't annoy you.\"So I got the toy...and it annoyed her anyways because instead of him playing with it, I would send it playing when she would walk in the door.Pay back for all  the noise makers she banged on  that my mom got her.Now days the grandkids will send it playing and most of them are in their teens...my daughter laughs right along with me."},
{"title": "February glitch,eating from the pantry , 365 declutter", "date": "Sunday, February 23, 2014", "text": "I am calling it a glitch because with a little effort we can get back on track.We have had a lot of running around, moving furniture for kids etc and appointments in the evening...and slid right in to eating out and not eating healthy. So even though the amount being spent eating out comes out of the grocery money (and we are under budget so far) it's important to get back to eating at home and eating healthy....read fruits and veggies.Update from the eating from the pantry...I have the mudroom frig freezer almost empty. My goal is to stop using using this frig completely.Right now it holds drinks, condiments, and some of the root produce.The freezer gets leftovers and the lunch items. I will take the money I get from the sale of this frig to buy a bigger chest deep freezer. That's my goal anyways. I have 3 whole pantry shelves empty. Each shelf is 17\"wide and 35\" long and usually stacked 2 jars (or cans) high so it usually is holding 100 jars per shelf.So that is around 300 jars of food used up.I had my sewing machine tuned-up :) and purchased new needles so I can get back in to sewing. I am making warm weather curtains for several of the rooms and going back to making most of my clothes. I am short and a lot of time have to buy children's clothes which is fine for jeans and tees but not so much for casual dress or other clothes. I hate paying for styles that I do not like, do not fit me properly and decided I would rather spend the time and make custom fitting clothes (like the rich and famous LOL) and know I will wear it for a long time. It helps when I search fabric.com and our local fabric shop and find fabric I LOVE for sale or clearance.I also am going to start seeds for the garden this week. Pray for the little seeds because my green thumb is a dark brown. Once I get the plants in the garden I can usually get them to survive their existence. Poor things.On the front line of Decluttering.... I have been pitching at least once a day at least one thing...usually more. Yesterday we passed a kitchen corner cabinet that has been floating around our home and our daughters home for over 15 yrs. Our son asked for it for their kitchen. He also asked for a bed Hubby had made for our girls when they were in their teens that has passed around through the grandkids for their oldest son. I also took him his childhood toy box but I will be making another one of those this summer.Have a good dayBlessed Be"},

I don't remember ever eating oatmeal for breakfast, that was Cream of Wheat (ground semolina flour) or CoCo wheat (ground corn grits flavored with cocoa).

{"title": "January grocery budget", "date": "Saturday, February 1, 2014", "text": "After looking at last year's budget and comparing it to what we were actually spending  We were spending $900 or more including eating out. We also realized we were eating out about every 5 days.SO January's budget was $400 and eating from the pantry.How did that go?I can say the first 16 days it went fine. On day 16 we were craving our favorite pizza and chef salad. We compromised by getting it as a take n bake and got 2 chef salads instead of one so it made 4 meals instead of just 2.We eat the salad BEFORE we eat any pizza.On the 18th which was my birthday we were coming back from our kids and Hubby decided to stop at Wendy's so I wouldn't be fixing dinner.On the 30th we went to our favorite local restaurant and got their chicken dinner.It was the special that night so we saved a few bucks.Also at the end of the month I was informed my Vit. D was so low I had the Rickets and my cholesterol was through the roof. I had given up dairy to lower my cholesterol, guess that wasn't what was sending it up to begin with.So armed with list of foods that help raise Vit. D and lower cholesterol  we went to the store and loaded up.You have to be careful as a lot of low fat foods are high sugar and a lot of low sugar foods are high fat.I don't eat a lot of process foods at home so helps.I have added some veggies to grow in the garden this year that I normally don't grow.Being so the wrap of the January costs was$489.92 including the eating out AND I can tell you for fact the 89.92 is exactly what we paid that I had to add to my diet.Blessed Be"},

I made a grocery list adding things I need to be eating regularly to lower the cholesterol and raise the Vit D.We spent $93 on food when we went to the store. A good half of it will last to mid Feb. if not longer. The rest was perishables for the coming week.That is still keeping us in the budget AND I am still cooking from the pantry except for 2 days, one was for my birthday from my son (Wendy's) and the other was a take and bake pizza and chef salad that Hubby brought home the day of my birthday.Got to go, weather is horrible here and the pup wants out.I go out with him and keep an eye on him.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "365 decluttering", "date": "Monday, January 13, 2014", "text": "After talking last night, I figure out that Hubby feels that if he lets go of all the stuff he won't be able to replace it if we need it. We talked about our different faiths and how we each deal with that. I did point out to him that he refused to give a toy he had as a child to a grandson that asked for it to only leave in a dirty box. I asked him if he even knew where that box was...of course not. I do as I had unearthed it looking for something else.We decided TOGETHER, key words there. That I will do the decluttering and if it is something of his, he has to make a decision of what to do with it within a week, if he don't then it's my choice of what to do with it.Also, everything that needs to be burned (yes we have open burning here) gets burned asap (not when we have winds that will blow it to the barns) and not set aside in the garage, like I found 3 boxes.Everything I put in the trash goes to the end of the lane on Tuesday morning for pick up. I will put this sack in a different place because Hubby is tempted to put it aside when he knows there is not bad food in it.Everything that goes to the thrift shop goes on Thursday when we run errands into town. We try very hard to limit our runs to town to save on gas and spending.Okay...being that said...it's one \"item\" each day, I decided that I don't care if it's only one item or 27 items. ONCE a day I will declutter something.I plan to post on Thursdays what I decluttered for the week.Blessed beSaturday Hubby asked for chili, worked for me since I had canned several jars of chili last November.Sunday we have pumpkin soup (I was finishing putting pumpkin in the dehydrator only have another 2 to deal with) and BBQ pulled pork in tortilla wraps.

{"title": "365 items in 365 days", "date": "Sunday, January 12, 2014", "text": "I had to really think about this and I can see a couple of you scratching your heads wondering what is there to think about.I have been trying to declutter for the past 10 years. That is when we moved from the old homestead, in town, of over 2000 sq ft, a full basement and a 2 1/2 car garage that Hubby had packed with so much you had to move things to get in. Every spring I would rent a dumpster and toss the \"trash\" and donate the rest. He would go to auctions and yard sales and dumpster diving and fill it back up by the following spring.In 2004 we moved to the country and an 1200 sq ft house with only a garden shed with a lean to.Hubby got a large storage unit and older daughter kept some of the stuff with her at the old homestead. In 2008 we moved to an 800 sq ft house with a one car garage , Hubby got 3 storage units because older daughter was starting to declutter stuff in the garage.In 2010 we moved here with 2000 sq ft house,2 car garage  and the use of a farrowing house and pig house for storage (no pigs) SO Hubby got rid of the storage units.I THOUGHT I was doing good, we weren't paying out for the storage units any more AND I was sorting through boxes and sacks getting rid of stuff...except what I thought was going to the local thrift shop was actually going out to the farrowing house being put under other things so I wouldn't know they were still there.But hey, guess what, I have a couple kids that decided Hubby and I could store their stuff also and mentioned it at Christmas that they thought they had sent that with him instead of keeping it, would I please look....OH YEAH.... I looked (no, their stuff wasn't there ) but the stuff that was suppose to be gone was.SO with this 365 challenge also has to come with rules.Tuesday is our trash day, so anything needing pitched has to be in the trash can by that morning.Thursday is our errand day, it will now be the day of drop off to the thrift shop.Those two things have been added to my weekly routines.Hubby and I had an open discussion of hoarding and why things need to go. I feel dealing with other family member's hoarding has made him realize he doesn't want our kids to go through what we and the family that had to deal with it has.THEN I had a discussion with the ones that we are storing things for. They have until the end of June to have their stuff removed from here.I don't mind storing furniture that came from us or the family if they don't have a place to use it (4 out of 5 moved this year) until they decide to either move (3 are already talking of moving) or not keep it any more.BUT other than that, they are going to deal with it.SO yeah, I had to think about making this a priority.Blessed BeI mended my socks. That's a biggie for me because even though I will mend anything else, socks is something I don't do but Hubby does.I made apple butter and apple Jelly from the apples given to us from a friend of a friend.Hubby cut up a 65 lb pumpkin for me to roast and then dehydrate, the last of it will be in the dehydrator this evening. AND I have a couple more that is equal to 50 lbs.We have ate from the pantry every day.I ordered heirloom seeds for my garden so I can start saving my own seeds and not spending the money.Not a big list...or I should say not as big as I would like to see. I think the goal of doing one frugal thing a day will help that.Blessed be"},
{"title": "Saturday..in the kitchen ", "date": "Saturday, January 11, 2014", "text": "This is 2/3rds of the 65 lb pumpkin that cost us $1 this past fall.Hubby whacked into pieces for me this morning. The first 3rd is already in the oven roasting. I already roasted the seeds, got about 1 quart, for Hubby to snack on. When the pumpkin comes out of the oven I will put the pulp into the dehydrators and but another section in the oven. I have found that even though it takes more time to do pumpkins this way, I save more room in the pantry, save on the amount of canning jars I have to use and don't waste pumpkin because I had to open a half pint when I only needed a couple tablespoons for something. The last batch of pumpkins was 50 lbs total and I ended up with 1 1/2 quarts of powdered pumpkin when I was done. WHICH is now gone.I have another 50 lbs of pumpkin in the butler's pantry to do also. Another $1 buy that will provide many meals.I finished the last of the apples we had stored from fall, they are now apple butter and apple jelly that I made from the peels and cores of the apples.With the price of food going up and our budget for food going down. I am really going to have to put extra effort in stretching it as far as it can go.Not just focus of using from the pantry but stretching that pantry farther than I originally planned.When I am preserving from our gardens I figure for it to last 2 years, just in case the next year is a bad harvest. Have dealt with that before.After a talk with my Dad, I have decided to focus more on 3 years and using heirloom seeds to gather my own seeds and not have to spend so much money on seeds. I don't do very well on raising plants. Still going to try to do some of the seeds. I don't have a place that is warm and gets a lot of light and can't afford to run the electric bill up to grow seeds. I do have a produce auction that also sells plants through the spring to late summer so I will put money back for that.I ordered seeds for spring planting, checked out all the places I ordered and the best deals and then ordered for the spring planting. I can do the summer seeds order when I get the money up. I listed prices so I know how much I need to save up.I am have selected more of the veggies that was in the Victory Gardens in this area.Last night we had tuna noodle casserole with peas for dinner and homemade rolls.I was going to have baked acorn squash stuffed with sausage but with the pumpkin still taking up the whole oven for a few more hours I am going to pancakes,eggs and bacon and Hubby can take leftovers to work for his lunch.Meantime it's back to the pumpkin as the timer is buzzing to let me know to put the next part in.Blessed be"},

Our dogs loved going for a ride in the truck also.The older one would live in the truck if we would let her.I did mention to Hubby that I was sticking with cash for our groceries while on the pantry challenge (I set the amount at $400 a month) but I was going to buy some things for Operation Thank You to send to our deployed soldiers that would come out of my checking account.Good thing I had that cash because ...DUH.... I forgot the check book and my credit card in my other purse so had to pay for it out of my grocery cash. SIGH....Even for a DUH moment...it worked out okay. I only spent $33.46 on food and $82.70 for non-food so I had more than plenty to spend on OTY. I combined sales with the coupons I had and did very well all the way around. I still have $283.84 left in the grocery budget.Last night I made sweet and sour pork out of leftover pork roast and used up some veggies that were getting ready to go bad and served it over the last of the instant rice that was out of my son's pantry.Tonight I am frying chicken as I am craving the local restaurant's fried chicken (it won't measure up any where close), making mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans,corn, home made bread and apple crisp and vanilla bean ice cream. Maybe the apple crisp will calm the craving...probably not. Another  DUH moment was when I put the chicken for tonight to soak in buttermilk that I should have bought buttermilk. It went on the list for the next time I go to the store which I don't plan on doing for 2 more weeks if not longer.

Glad I have already planned to eat from the pantry this month.We had an early dinner today, Hubby's work for tonight got cancelled (OUCH) so he ran the snow blower in the lane since they are forecasting 4-8 and winds for here this weekend.I know how he would come in, get warm and then pass out( he works graveyard) until 2-3 am so I fixed bacon, eggs, leftover home fries and toast . If either of us gets hungry later we can have leftover pork roast sandwiches or cheese and crackers.Today I processed in the pressure canner 14 pints and 6 quarts of different broths from carcass and bones given to us , 3 pints of apple butter (apples given to us this fall) and 2 pints of homemade BBQ sauce using my own red sauce as the base. I am now out of quart jars and down to 8 pints and 24 1/2 pints (jelly jars) left to can in.Hubby used some Gorilla tape to tape the hole in the top of my barn (rubber) boots, hopefully they will last until late spring.THEN Hubby used the same tape to tape my jacket back together after the pup got his nails caught in to the fabric. It's a very old jacket, was my son's and its cracking in places but I was hoping to make it last through this winter as my other jacket has zipper issues that I haven't been able to fix.Either it doesn't want to zip, or it zips and I can't get back out of it without pulling it over my head.Hubby has finally gotten in the habit of turning off the power strip to the TV and computer after turning them off. Our electrician talked to him about ghost power and batteries that still use power even though the item is off. I marked it on our calendar when I started turning it off (which was every night) and our electric dropped almost $20.We sent in a rebate that Hubby usually just pitches and doesn't bother to give to me. But he realized that even though it wasn't for very much it could add up and with spring coming I would need every little bit of extra money to buy for the gardens. I do collect some of my seeds but haven't done as well as I would like to. I think I have a black thumb to my shoulder :(I need to go watch the local weather on TV even though I am already prepared for bad weather, I like to take the dogs out a bit more before it actually hits so their cabin fever doesn't get so bad.Blessed Be"},

Up around the house with all the barns and buildings around the garage usually is the worse.We ate from the pantry today...actually we ate from my son's pantry, he gave us some of his canned goods when he moved in with his lady;and we ate from my mother's pantry that my brother and I split between us when she died and our own pantry. Hubby had beef and potato soup and grilled lunch meat and cheese sandwich, I had tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich. He took leftovers from last night's meal for his lunch. He usually does take leftovers for his lunch anyways.I wrote out what I want to plant this year. I would like to try for a 4 season garden but trying to keep a hoop house over any of the gardens out here in this wind is hard. I will have to think about it some more. Next I will sort through what seeds I have and figure out what I need to buy.Going to flip a coin to see if I am sleeping in the bed tonight or on the couch, the wind is sucking the heat pretty much out of the bedroom tonight.Good nightBlessed Be"},

I figured out at that time there are times I work (in the home) right up to the time of supper and then don't want to fix what is chosen because of the time it takes to put on the table.So Hubby and I sat down and came up with what we call our fast food menu to keep us from going out or running in to town (wasting gas also) for something. We came up with 12 meals that even he could fix and not be grumpy about doing. He is a fix it in one skillet and eat out of the skillet type of guy.To start off we have decided on $400 a month for food. This does NOT include our non-food.We decided that meat must be below certain costs and listed those prices.We took a good look at what we are eating from the harvest that is in the pantry to know what we need to plant this coming year.I need to go back to bread baking. I try to stay away from preservatives and have gotten lazy about my baking. My health has taken the hit from that lazy time.We found a great sale of meat last week and filled the freezer back up.Last night we had ribs,black eyed peas and raw collard greens (YUCK) but I ate them anyways.Tonight we are having pork roast, kraut and mashed potatoes.I need all the luck and blessings I can get.Blessed be"},

Probably will have it for breakfast or dinner depending on if we eat the 2nd pizza for breakfast or dinner.I plan to pull out the last rib roast from the deep freezer and a box of the pie dough to see if I can make some cookies from it.Got a few recipes from the internet but not sure they would pass with my crew.I decorated the front room tree today. Have the dining room left to clean and decorate tomorrow and then start upstairs on Tuesday.Monday is kitchen day along with laundry. I am working on Christmas presents, Christmas cards and cookies and candy for the kids and grandkids besides decorating the dining room.We talked about our eating from the pantry and buying less at the store. I want to save up some money to buy garden items, seeds and plants this spring which is only a couple months away as I cover a couple of my square foot gardens with hoop houses and plant early.We were trying to decide what amount to spend and on what.I will have to think about that a bit longer, check out some others that have done the same thing also.Everyone stay safe, stay warm and Blessings on you and yours."},

They don't help unload or put away. HA HA. The one on the left is Kira (not our daughter and no, we did not name her , she was five when we got her so felt she should keep her name).She is a black lab retriever.The \"pup\" on the right is Rascal (because he is a rascal).We adopted him when he was six weeks old, he will be two in March and he is an Australian cattle dog(blue heeler)/ Australian shepherd mix. He is my ball player and she is the one I walk the perimeter with. The only thing she plays with besides the chew bones you see between them is empty coke bottles even if she has to empty them herself. We went to pick up the snow blower that had to be fixed, maybe we won't get that bad of a storm that they are forecasting for us since it is fixed so I can start it.Then it was off to the post office, then the bank, the Joann's for yarn to finish some Christmas gifts and then ....The grocery shopping. I shopped for the rest of the month except for meat that will go on sale....stay with me.I bought milk,heavy cream,half and half , buttermilk (yes we use all of them) the season's coffee creamer (my present to myself otherwise Hubby spends a couple bucks once a week to get me a cup at the local gas station and I can spend a couple bucks and have it all month), apples for Hubby's lunch, coffee beans for Hubby, bread (because I have been baking daily for Operation Thank You to send cookies to our deployed soldiers and will start baking for the family) tea for me (Can't drink coffee when my Crohn's is acting up), eggs, salad items,potatoes, sweet potatoes,bananas, pomegranates  and that is basically all I have been picking up for us. I check the non food items and fill in as needed. I try to make those last 2 mos since I do have the space to store it...like under my bed,couch, love seat etc.On the other hand...cookie and candy ingredients were the main items on the grocery list today for the family and friends. AND I am able to buy that much (think 3 coolers full of brown sugar, xxx sugar, choc chips of different kinds, peanut butter and butter etc. I already have over 50 lbs of flour and 25 lbs of sugar in the pantry) because I grew canned, froze and stored the garden, I \"gleaned\" from anyone that had produce to give away and I shop the sales on meat (usually, not always but usually).I vacuum pack anything that goes in the two deep freezers.I boil any meat bones for broth, I boil veggie peelings (I was the veggies before I peel them ) for broth. I render \"lard\" from any of my fats from my meats. I use my leftovers in other dishes or soups.I just mentioned to one of the kids that they needed to get their self a deep freezer. Turkeys and hams are on sale and when else can you get meat for less than a dollar a pound? Pork roasts and pork loins will be coming on sale. I use the loin to cut boneless pork chops from along with lean roasts. I will pay the price (after calling around and shopping for the lowest price) for Rib roast. I order a twelve rib roast. I cut it myself , four ribs for Christmas Eve and then rest as two bones and vacuum seal them for the rest of the year.Tea time...Blessed Be"},

So about ten days out from when we have our meal (the Sunday before Tday) I start a turkey for the turkey noodles. On that day we have turkey and the next day we have turkey noodles for dinner. The following day is beef roast...same routine, beef roast that night , beef and noodles the next. By that time I am baking breads,cakes and stuff that I am no longer cooking dinner. It becomes what ever leftover has been shoved in frig, freezer or soup from the pantry.After our Thanksgiving dinner, I make a list of the leftovers and what I can make from them since I will be making candy and baking cookies for the Deployed troops  and the kids...BUT this year we had Thanksgiving at our oldest daughter and one of the other daughter's had friends that wasn't going to have much of a meal if any...so we didn't bring home many leftovers.In fact I even complained to my daughter because when she took the meat off her turkey carcass she threw it away instead of saving it for me to make broth..no extra noodles for her.In that respect. Hubby wanted a turkey wrapped in bacon for today...Okay, I will let you know how that one goes.I have bought turkey and ham for the freezers. Finding meat for less than a DOLLAR a pound is few and far between and when I do I stuff the freezer.Have a great Thanksgiving .Blessed be"},

Our older dog understand rainy and cold days mean stay in where it's warm and dry.I was suppose to go down to our son's today to help move somethings around for him with Hubby but I have a fever and a cough...again. So stayed here. Didn't think anyone would appreciate me passing to them...again.We are eating from the pantry.Have shared our bounty with 2 of the kids that are out of work.One starts work Monday and the other one is waiting on the Gov't to get it's act together.I went to the store on Thursday, our normal errand day. It felt weird to go into the store, not get a cart or buggy (depending on which state I am in ) and only pick up a gallon of milk and 8 lbs of sugar for jelly and jam making. Hubby asked if we were allowed to only get that much.  I spent the rest of the \"grocery\" money on canning jars which once again I was out of.I fixed pork chops, mashed potatoes,corn, baked apple with maple syrup and had cottage cheese and apple butter on Oct 1st.I reheated the turkey and dumplings on the 2nd.On the 3rd I made mashed potato cakes out of the leftover mashed potatoes, and fried green tomatoes out of the garden and served it with leftover pork chops and the last of the baked apples.On the 4th we had nachos...neither of us was hungry after a big lunch due to fasting for blood work that morning. It was a quick and simple meal to put together and plenty for both of us.Tonight I am thinking pizza.I ran across a recipe for Indian Lentil soup on Mary Ostyn's blog at http://www.owlhaven.net/2013/10/04/pinteresting/I think I will  have the soup tomorrow with homemade bread to go along with the homemade jam I just made.Are you eating from your pantry?Have a Blessed Day"},

Sauteed that for a little bit to soften the veggies. Added broth and milk. Let it get hot again then added frozen peas and the dumpling dough I made from the Bisquick( which I realized I was low on). Served applesauce on the side and called it done. I drew a star on the date on the calendar and thought one down.Tonight is cubed steak. But since there is only 3 small ones and I know that's not enough for our dinner and Hubby's lunch I am slicing it in strips and cooking sliced onions and mushrooms to add to it. I will serve it on what ever bread I have. I will serve with it a tossed salad loaded with veggies and french fries that are in the freezer,cottage cheese that Hubby will eat with apple butter on and I will drink a V8 fusion. I will make a Waldorf salad but use crunchy peanut butter instead of mayo as that it Hubby's preference. Another star on the calendar.I have 4 more trays in the new dehydrator of ripe tomatoes and  4 trays of bell peppers in the old dehydrator. I don't think there is going to be any more bell peppers out of the garden.The square foot gardens are pretty much done and ready to be prepped for winter. That leaves the 2 tomato patches, if I can call a garden that has 120 tomato plants in it a patch, yet to wrap up. Tomatoes are still okay there so I might have to cover them if we get a frost any time soon. That only leaves the horseradish left to dig up after the first frost.Have a Blessed Day.

Then he calls me at lunch time and see how I feel and what I have been doing that day and what else will I be doing and then on his way home he calls to see how it went and what I fixed his dad and me for dinner..for the last couple months the answer has been .I am in the tomatoes and I am canning tomatoes in some form.Tomatoes has been on the table in some way pretty every night.At the beginning of the season I had one of these every day or no later than a day and half.then it was every other day, then every third day. It's been 5 days since the last load. The weather has turned unusually cool for us and this time of year. The tomatoes aren't turning red as fast but I am still pretty well loaded with green tomatoes. Guess fried green tomatoes are going to start being on the table a lot also.On Monday during my son's lunch call he was silent for a few minutes when I told him we had went to the produce auction and then stopped at a farmer's market on the way home. I could tell he hated to ask what we picked up but just couldn't help himself.Probably so he knows what to tell his sisters so they know what food they can ask for later.I got mushrooms (dried and canned them), pluots (dried and canned them),bananas (dried and canned them ),butternut squash (still to do),cabbage ( made jarred kraut for the first time),acorn squash,(still to do)pumpkins (roasted, pureed and then dried), delicata squash (fresh eating), spag squash( fresh eating),winter onions ( hanging in nylons),4 bushels of different types of apples( still to do ) and 50 lbs of potatoes( still to do). Yes I still have tomatoes coming in. I even asked a friend if he had chili peppers that I could have to make more salsa.The freezers are full. The pantry is almost out of shelf space. Will be long before I finish for this season. I have started dehydrating things I normally can such as pumpkin just to have room for other things.I got the chili soup made and canned but not the veggie beef soup.I haven't made my dried noodles either.That's also on the to do list.I have tried to keep the grocery budget at less than $300 but the canning supplies is coming out of the grocery budget like it was a over flowing river breaking through the damn. Hubby has even taken to buying supplies for me out of the overtime he has gotten off and on.We know if things turn bad like they did a couple years back , that the food I put up (ha ha old term ) is money in the bank for us and our adult kids . I am becoming my grandpa more and more each year.If he didn't grow it,hunt it, fish it,barter it or raise it , he didn't eat it. We don't hunt or fish (hubby drowns plastic worms) and I will buy meat and some other things but most in the pantry is home grown.I need to go check the canner and the dehydrator.Blessed be"},

What is coming in from the garden right now is tomatoes...I worry I won't get enough and will have to buy sauces and such again this year and green beans. These seems to be doing good plus I just put in some more for fall.The only thing besides tomatoes that it looks like I am not going to have enough of is cabbage and winter squash. I didn't get much zucchini, what can I say besides I never do and I must be the only person in the world that can't grow zucchini. I am blessed with a friend that does very well with 2 plants so he shared his zucchini and what beets he didn't want to deal with.Still with the garden coming in I have blew the grocery budget through the summer. I was checking the blogs I read and saw where Mary over at www.owlhaven.net is having a grocery challenge of getting back on track and saving some money herself so I joined in. Everything is easier if I am held accountable and have \"friends\" doing the same thing.My goal for food and non-food is $200 for the money. It's usually $350 but the last few months it's crept up to $600 with eating out also. We have a cookout this month with our family that we provide the meat and some of the sides so that is included in that $200.We have 6 debts to finish paying off. Goal is set to be debt free (we rent because we live where hubby works not where our families are so we didn't want to buy since he is close to retirement) by Jan 2017, I would like to cut 2 yrs off that which means I have to stay on budget and I have to roll what I pay on the other debts on to the next debt as they get paid off. Kind of like snowballing.We will have 2 paid off  by the end of this year and 3 paid off by fall of next year.It's going to be interesting to see if I can bring the grocery bill down and put that money towards getting that debt paid off faster.Have a good week.Blessed be"},

I am out of shelf room in the pantry with this last round of canning tomatoes.I will have to start storing canning under the bed, in closets etc. I don't stop putting up just because I am being over ran.

The pantry is cleaned and ready for the new harvest when it starts burying me.Hubby and the kids have decided that if  I am missing that I must be buried alive in the garden and to look for the pup as he is usually with me wanting me to toss the ball for him.Guess they think a large dog jumping up and down would be easier to find than an old woman collapsed in exhaustion.I will add that my Dad told me they planted 200 tomato plants a year and always ran out before the next harvest.That made me feel better about myself. That was part of what was in my mind. I ran out of tomatoes last December and had to buy canned tomatoes. BUT reality is that I got wrapped out in the bidding and it didn't register that a flat wasn't necessarily 12 or 15 but sometimes 48.Now I have to take care of all these wonderful plants that will feed us and most likely our kids and their families.I have started watching Alaska the Last Frontier, it helps with motivation...HA HA.Enjoy and Blessed Be"},

I was able to visualize in my head the shelves in the pantry (now I think just how huge our pantry is) and write out what items was there, should be easier to count them when I get home. I know I missed some things... condiments and spices/herbs...I have over 100 spices and herbs.Got to get started on the spring cleaning, (warm weather for using clothes line YES!!!) and repairing and redoing the outside furniture.Planting flowers,herbs and hundreds of veggies. Yes hundreds because I will have over 100 of various tomato plants besides the other plants. I can my own red sauce,bolognese sauce,red sauce with veggies,and pizza sauce. I might do salsa this year also since we do eat enough of it.Not touching diced tomatoes, diced tomatoes with seasonings, stewed tomatoes. I don't make tomato juice until I have enough of the other tomatoes needed done.I need to really \"clean\" the pantry while inventorying it so I can see how much room and empty jars I have for this year's produce. I most likely will need more jars, I usually do.I am going back to baking, I had stopped after Christmas except for cookies for Operation Thank You but since we decided to rework the budget to get a couple more large debts paid off in the next year. The grocery budget(food, non food, personal items, pets, and office supplies) took the hit.Going to try drying greens this year. Haven't really heard of doing it before last winter, something new. But then I have had a  lot of people that have never heard of leather britches (greasy cut short green bean dried on a string. Will do a post later on it.)including my parents that were upset that they were tossing food they could have been eating,they made shelly beans (like dried beans) out of them and tossed the rest in the compost pile.I reminded them at least they composted it but it's hard to think of that when you know there was times you went hungry. Mother was sad that she had never learned to make broth from meat let alone from vegetable peels like I do.Dad taught me the basics of cooking, the rest I picked up from others as I became an adult. Still learning each day something new in the culinary world which is probably why I enjoy my career as a Personal Chef even after all these years of working in the food industry.Going to go \"play\" with my garden designs...even though I know I will change them when I plant them.Blessed Be"},

So with a look at the finances, the pantry and freezer (which I am still working on inventorying I add to our menu to take us to the end of April. Wrote out the grocery list, gathered coupons, checked the store ads and on Thursday we went to town after he got home from work.Bottom line...I spent $38.48 on the dogs...$100 is in the budget for them as we average out their cost for the year. They will need dog food before I go back to the store but we will tie that in with other errands so it's not a special trip or Hubby will stop at local grocery on his way home from work. Cost of gas to town equals the increase in price at the local store.I spent $63.21 on non-food and medical supplies and over the counter meds. I saved $31. 52 in coupons, discounts and mark downs on this . Basically around 30% savings.I spent $120.28 on groceries and saved $76.68 in coupons, store card,and mark downs. That's around 39%. That included a ham and a turkey that was marked down.I already had the ham for Easter so the first ham was cut up for sandwiches and cubed for casseroles, scraps are for flavoring and the bone is for soup. I took some of it to my son on Saturday since he wasn't going anywhere for Easter because he decided to do his spring cleaning,wished he would come do mine.I baked the ham I already had for Easter. It will be dealt with today the same way as the first one minus the fact son isn't getting more ham.The turkey is thawed so it will be for dinner tonight with me slicing the breast for lunch meat, cubing the rest for turkey salad and casseroles and making broth out of the remains.Hopefully the weather will remain decent and I will be able to get my cool weather crops in the square foot gardens so I won't have to buy as much fresh produce.Hope everyone had a great weekend.Blessed Be Juls"},

I don't usually eat that much of packed food but we are still trying to use up what was Mother's pantry.Tonight I have some leftover shredded chicken so I am going to make chicken enchiladas using the leftover homemade cream of mushroom soup as the sauce. Corn in the freezer, green chilis in the pantry and cheese out of the cheese drawer and tortilla wraps out of the frig. A tossed salad with avocado to go with it . All from the pantry.I caught myself writing out a grocery list and checking coupons...backed myself up as I won't be going to the store until April 11th. When Hubby brought the local grocery store ads in from the mail, I tossed them directly in to the burn can. I have put the list on the computer so when it is time to go to the store I have the list and decide if I really need that.I have found myself substituting just to use something up.Hopefully the ground is going to warm up and I will be able to get some seeds planted so with in a month I will have salad food coming in so I can take that off the list.Everyone have a good day.Blessed Be"},
{"title": "Changing routines and being productive while down with Crohn's", "date": "Wednesday, March 27, 2013", "text": "I have learned to find ways to be productive so I don't get as depressed because nothing is getting done.I sorted through the jewelry from my mother's estate and dealt with that so it's off the to do list.I sorted through a couple boxes every day (Hubby was okay with bringing 2 from upstairs).I read \"Cut Your Grocery Bill in Half\" by Steve and Annette Economides  ( aka America's Cheapest Family)Which lead me to starting to inventory the pantry,freezers and frigs....still working on that .I decided to post what I do each week on the back of the front door (it's right beside my desk so I see the back of it most the time) of what I did to be frugal.This week's frugal choices was to go through the check book and see where there were \"leaks\". I stopped some automatic pays that we no longer use saving $30.00 a month. We found spray paint on sale (patio furniture need painted) and with a rebate.We ate every night except Friday from the pantry. Friday we went over to the Inn Between Tavern and got the all you can eat fish special.I made laundry fabric softener and laundry stain remover.I joined the Money Saving Family (AKA America's Cheapest family). Yes that was spending some money but by using one of their grocery tips I can have that money back in one month.I read \"Brother,Can You spare a Dime\" by Tony Sakkis. It's about feeding yourself on $5 a week. Ramen noodles yes, but a lot of variety that makes it no different than serving spaghetti once a week or substituting pasta instead of the Ramen noodles. I eat Ramen noodles without the seasoning package and broth with butter and powdered garlic when I am sick...of course I also eat a sausage patty with horseradish cream sauce and Swiss cheese on a thin bagel when I am sick. My doc thinks I must be really sick especially when I mention craving Chinese food and Taco Bell.I read \"Once a Month Cooking\" by Mimi Wilson and Mary Beth Lagerborg. I used to do this when Hubby and I first got together and combined our family. It was a mind and time saver when 5 of the kids was in sports and Hubby was also playing ball, coaching and umpiring.I read Michelle Obama's book \"American  Grown\"Made lots of notes and plans for the house and the gardens for when I got well and back on my feet.Now I just have to pace myself so I don't trigger anything which comes to  today's job of reworking my routines.On my bulletin board (actually a lime green foam board cut in half and doubled) I have posted the old work schedule for housewives. Monday wash day, etc.I have also used Flylady's schedule. Neither are working for me at this time. I made some notes on what I saw wasn't getting down and what I needed more or less time for the past month. So today I am going to sit down and rework my routine and try it for a month. Since that's also adding in the gardens ( over 1,000 sq ft when you put in the gardens around the house foundations) and yard work.I hope everyone has a good day.Blessed Be Juls"},
{"title": "Another snow ", "date": "Tuesday, March 26, 2013", "text": "Yep, here we go again... looks just like the other weekend but not as much drifting.So tired of the drastic changes.Still eating from the pantry.Caught myself looking at going to the grocery store after deciding we would only go once a month. I just put that list beside the computer and decided I could add to it, most likely  I will start the garden by then and won't need as much or what I listed to begin with.Besides saving money, eating from the pantry lowers it so I have room to put the garden up when the harvest comes in.I did get one of the square foot gardens covered with plastic to start warming the soil. It can be 32 outside but if there is sun the plastic can heat the soil to 60 or more. I can plant cool weather crops in that temp and put a hoop house over that square.I made a plan of what to plant in that first square foot garden. Plan on Anna snow peas, Philadelphia white box radishes,scallions, red summer crisp Cherokee lettuce, Baby leaf lettuce mix,Cimmaron Romaine, Rouge d'Hiver Romaine, Cabbage,cauliflower,broccoli,beets, peppermint Swiss Chard, salad fresh spinach, Yaya carrots and Quickstar kohlrabi.A 4 by 4 ft square will grow all of that for the spring season.I've been reading \"American Grown\" by Michelle Obama. Good book to read even if you are not into gardening, I love the layout of the White House kitchen garden and the fact they try to grow food all 4 seasons.I already told Hubby he is going to have to figure out how to keep the hot house standing through the winter so I can have my salads because it's up to over $15 a month at Aldi's.Going back to play in the seeds and decide what I can start growing inside.Have a great dayBlessed be"},
{"title": "nasty weather nasty health but got groceries", "date": "Wednesday, March 20, 2013", "text": "Snow, sleet , freezing rain with a few days of warm and sunny teases in between. Yep, Ohio in the Spring.Top it with an acute flair up on my Crohn's which now I am on meds for. Low dosage and 2 out of the 3 are just as needed.Since I was stuck in side and down with Crohn's I decided to figure out if we could cut the grocery bill. It had did a crawl up to twice the amount budgeted. I first thought, high prices of everything, too much impulse buys and I need to eat healthier.(Sorry doc not going Vegan, I am a cheese hound). Did some research on the internet, pulled some things I did when I was a widow raising 3 and feed half the county with their friends and raided the library on a \"I can barely stand but I need out of this house\"cabin fever day.Then I went to the store and got enough groceries for the month (and collapsed the next day but it was done).When the kids were little I did that, when Hubby and I got married I did that, I even did that for a few years after the kids all left home because my youngest did and I went to the store with her.The picture are $327 of groceries (which leaves $23 for milk/bread etc for the rest of the month). That actually puts us almost half of the original budget amount.The only thing not showing is the 12 rolls of toilet paper. The packaged food to the left of the chair is 22 shelf stable microwave meals for Operation Thank You to send to deployed troops that had their chow halls shut down. I spent $27 and saved $32 on them and yes, they came out of the food budget.The stick of deli pepperoni will last about 3 months. The ham is for Easter so it will help through next month.I have a meat slicer so I do my own slicing. I plan to get a meat grinder for my Kitchen Aid mixer and start grinding my own beef.Everything was put prepped and put away with in an hour.Which surprised Hubby but I have a system and I keep my foods in the same place (or do until he moves them) in the frig.The next day after dreams of not running to the store every week and having a good solid base for many meals...I woke up to my Crohn's. So for the past 10 days I've been telling Hubby what there is for him to eat that he doesn't really have to cook, just reheat or I reheated it for him if possible. He didn't have to buy anything out or go to the store and that made him happy.By the beginning of last weekend I was no longer able to eat, by Sunday I was no longer able to hold fluids down. Monday morning Doc with much regret gave me my first meds for Crohn's. Now I am home trying to replace fluids and get my energy back.I am not in full remission but things are down to a low roar, which is not what I can say for the wind I have been listening to for the last 3 days.I have a mountain of things on my to do list but they will have to sit and wait until I have fully recovered. Already learned the lesson of not resting when I should.Blessed Be Juls"},

So sweet for him to do that for her, surprising but sweet.The second one is the drive way. You might not be able to see the drift very clearly but it closed the driveway completely. To the point that Hubby had to park in the yard  when he came in from work this morning and walk to the house.Not far just but then he had to make a couple phone calls to arrange for the driveway and the garage to be plowed out. We got 9 1/2 inches of snow and I think about 3 inches of it has already melted. It's suppose to be gone by Friday.I updated my to do list today and it has doubled since we are getting ready to get in to gardening. I have plastic that I can make hoop hot houses over the square foot gardens and do some early spring planting in a couple weeks after covering the gardens this weekend.We ate from the pantry tonight. Pork chops,baked potatoes, canned corn (Mother's pantry, and we will be glad when that's gone because we don't like canned corn) and French green beans (Mother's pantry) mixed with canned sliced mushrooms and cream cheese melted in it.I had Mother on the mind a lot today because I finished going through her jewelry to get it appraised so we can sell it to help pay of her negative estate. Everyone thought her jewelry was \"worthless costume\" a good half of it was either real or vintage costume jewelry. You just have to take the time and look for maker's marks. Thankfully the local jewelry not only told me what to work for but lent me a jewelry's eye glass to help me see it better.Probably best for her too since she won't have to toss out what is going into the yard sale this spring since I already did that.Now it will be appraised and then I can sell it.I haven't decluttered much the last couple days unless you count tossing junk jewelry and clearing out some folders on the computer. I plan to get back into that tomorrow.Guess I will go get a hot drink and go surf pinterest. Stay safe and stay warm ( or cool if you are some where hot).Blessed Be"},

I feel like I've been running full force and getting nothing done.But I actually have gotten several things done and off the to do list which is why I have collapsed after dinner and went straight to sleep pretty much every night.We have been eating from the pantry except for Friday when Hubby went and got fish dinners at The Inn Between Tavern. Haven't stayed on the menu but still ate from the pantry...that is what counts. I cleaned out the refrigerators last night before Hubby took the trash to the road for pick up this morning...the only thing that got pitched was 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes and some citrus fruit that the pup (who is now 1 yr old) thought was balls and then did a good job of chewing them up thankfully on the kitchen floor and not the carpet. Seems he likes lemons the best. Who would figure?I sorted through more of my Mother's jewelry and am looking at having that done this week.I have been clutter clearing using Stephanie Roberts Book of Clearing Clutter based on Feng Shui.I can do the 27 fling toss from Flylady but when it came to certain things I held on and on and on...you understand. Stephanie really helped me deal with the emotional side of the decluttering and understanding that the feeling poorly is connected and I had to face that first. In doing so I have been able to put things in a box that Hubby stashes for the yard sale that I will be having in the spring. Since he is taking it out he know exactly where it is going. Though he has made several comments about the amount of burn trash and other trash going out the door with it.But after dealing with my parents hoarding he definitely is on the side of dealing with it now. We also agreed that after the yard sale EVERYTHING that didn't sell will go straight to the thrift shop.No putting it back and doing another.I ordered the last of the seeds for the garden. Since we have been eating from the pantry I have been able to save enough to do that along with pay off a couple bills. I have 3 more bills to pay off and hope to be able to get that done in the next 2 months by eating from the pantry.I started baking cookies for Operation Thank You to send to our deployed troops in our area. We were going to make the delivery tomorrow but they are being held in the freezer now since we have 6-8 inches of snow and sleet coming in tonight. So I can bake more cookies to send.I bake from scratch so it's not costing us a small fortune as if could be if I bought premade dough.Have a good dayBlessed Be Juls"},

I took the grocery money 2 weeks ago and bought perishables and non-food items. Last week he asked if we needed anything...bread and eggs was it.Today he handed me the grocery ads that came in the mail and asked about going to the store tomorrow.I took the ads straight to the trash can we put burnables and didn't even look at them. Told him I didn't need to see the sales and think I needed to get them. We would need dog food and dog dental styx for us and the rest of it would be for ingredients for cookies and microwave meals for deployed soldiers that we will be delivering to Operation Thank You first week of March.I think it finally hit I meant it when I said we were going to eat the pantry down. We bought a Little Caesar's pizza a couple weeks ago and got Wendy's the other night. Both times it was because we weren't home and if I had cooked it would be late. My Crohn's has issues with me eating that close to bed time. We will probably go over to the Inn Between Tavern for fish on Friday. We don't go every week though we would love to, I love their fish and their fried chicken.By eating from the pantry I have been able to pay off a couple bills. I still have 3 more to go plus what ever we owe on taxes this year. Second year in a row to owe, we usually have that set pretty close to break even and not owe but not get a refund either. I am not into loaning the gov't my money.We are going to have to replace the microwave (right after Hubby gets a new travel mug so we can make sure it fits in the microwave) and both of us has lost weight and need clothes (most will come from the thrift shops).Hope you have a good day...Blessed be"},
{"title": "Clutter clearing by Stephanie Roberts", "date": "Monday, February 25, 2013", "text": "I have been reading this ebook By Stephanie Roberts. Normally I am not thrilled with reading books on the computer but this is a definite extremely glad I did and will repeatedly do so again.I do Flylady...if you are not familar with her then take a side trip over to www.flylady.net and check her out...and I will include the only other reading resource that Stephanie offers in her book is Flylady.So, here I am , two years in the same place, wasn't sure we would stay in this rental because even though it's close to work, it's over an hour to any of the kids and farther than that to the parents. I would have to say I hope the landlord doesn't ever want us to move or at least not until Hubby retires. We have both owned more than 2 homes, and thought we might want to own instead of rent.We decided against owning until he retires.With Mother dying last November I have been going through some things my brother has cleared from Mother's and Dad's home. Brother stays with Dad in the home but the hoarding was too much for him to handle so it's been a slow process as Dad who has Alzheimer's doesn't want to let anything go.  It made me take a real good look around my house to see what our kids would have to deal with if we died today.They are not going to be very happy after they pull the food from the pantry they want and split up the kitchen ware. Okay they might wait until they go through the linen and bedding. One daughter will be happy to have my clothes as we wear the same size and same classical style. But other than that...it will not be good.Clutter Clearing by Stephanie Roberts came to me at the right moment. I didn't know what I all had or where to start. I was over whelmed even with doing Flylady. It just seemed to grow more and more. I would think we got rid of something only to find it some where else. That was figured out when Hubby finally admitted he thought we should keep it and put it where he knew I wasn't going in to often.No we still haven't used it after 2 yrs, so it goes and he agrees to tell me up front he doesn't want to get rid of something not hide it).I would say after he brought home another truck load from my parents and it sat here in the middle of the dining room until I could get through it (still am working on it but it's off to the side now). He realized what I was trying to do...save our kids from this stress and frustration.I asked him to decide a place to put yard sale items ( I need the cash more than I need the deduction since my normal job out of state is on hold due to daughter needing my car to get to work after being out of work for two years and of course her car died the second week, still trying to find something she can pay cash for).Yard sales are a lot of work, I've supported myself and kids when I was a widow doing just that thing so at least I know what I am into and how to bring in the most money.But where to start???? Stephanie helps you figure that out and if you follow what she writes you won't get over whelmed because you will understand the emotional ties.So I need to get back to doing my homework assignment as my Hubby calls it.Blessed beJuls"},

Ran out of shelf liner so I will finish that part of the project next week but I did finish cleaning and decluttering the bottom cabinets. Probably good since my body let me know I am not in prime condition for spring cleaning.Got the bathroom cabinets done also, no shelf liner going in there.I've been going through 1 box or 1 bag each day for Flylady.I Feng Shui my desk which is actually a kitchen counter top that my hubby put legs on it for me. It'e eggplant purple and we got it in 1998 for $5 along with another counter top that is pale pinkish lavender that was $7. Best money we were spent.We have been continuing to eat from the pantry mostly. We ate out the first Friday after Ash Wednesday at the local tavern that is well known for it's fried chicken and fried fish. I went to the store twice. Did a non-food run which was worse financially than the food run was that I did yesterday. Still came home with no buttermilk or raspberry syrup or yellow ink for the printer. Not going to rush back and get it though I might order the yellow ink on line if I find a better sale than the local price.I haven't did anything with my gardening unless you count the pins I did on Pinterest.I am fixing apple tuna sandwiches (Taste of Home)on oatmeal bread(Mary over at Owlhaven) and slicing bananas and Mandarin oranges and kiwi to look like palm trees in the sand (Pinterest pin) for dinner tonight.

Since I've been a flybaby since 2001 I didn't bat an eye at that but did go count how many boxes we have that I should go through including the ones we just brought here from my deceased Mother's. Total was 444, all neatly stacked in 4 different areas so you don't really realize there is that many. Lots of them are small, the size of a shoe box but still 444????Staying on the menu this week has been easy so far especially with me just starting to finally feel a little better, don't have much energy ...for me that is ... as I had a friend mention I do more in the morning than some people do in a day. Still we can only compare ourselves to ourselves. We are original and there is no copies.

Part of it is I have SAD, not good when you live in a state that has a low level of sunny days. Plus I lost my late husband during this month and I spent Valentine's day at the lawyer's office dealing with his negative estate. I do get excited about ordering the garden seeds and trying to start a few of the tomato plants myself (which usually bomb but I still try). So this time I decided to find something every day to make me smile.Today I went to the grocery store. I love grocery shopping as much as I love cooking (good thing since I am a personal chef, I do not love cleaning up after myself or anyone else). Better I got several good buys. I spent 1/3rd of the month's grocery budget and figure we won't need anything other than milk, bread and eggs. Saved 25% of what I spent with matching coupons with sales and using my digital coupons loaded to my grocery rewards card. SCORE.I bought 2 turkeys and a pork loin that was on sale, 90 % of what I did buy was veggies and fruits, most of it in season with a couple out of season for recipes we decided to try. I did buy 9 boxes of cereal which I don't normally buy cereal, but Hubby asked for some cereal and then asked me to make rice crispy treats but use Cheerios. His coworker brought some in and he liked them. I had coupons and matched the sales so I got all 9 boxes for less than a dollar a piece. I doubt if I will eat any of it for bfast but I will grab a bowl of cereal for a snack mid-afternoon.I put veggies and fruit away in an organized way so what needs used first is in the front and what can wait until a week or so is in the back. Focusing on no more food in the back of the frig for science projects.I decluttered the kitchen frig freezer and restocked it with bfast foods.In doing so, realized that we had more bread than I thought so I  don't plan to buy any more until we have this supply gone.The frigs are organized that I can put together a simple lunch or snack for myself. I've always kept Hubby's lunch items together, apples and such in a drawer, his yogurt above it. Why in the world I thought I wasn't worth the same consideration, I have yet to figure out.Flylady over at www.flylady.net has announced that February's habit is 15 minutes of decluttering each day. So I spent 15 minutes decluttering my canning area in my basement and realized I have no foil in the back up storage. Figures that I would run completely out when I fixed dinner. Guess I will be going back to the store for foil.I am continuing to eat from the pantry, trying to pull at least 1-2 canned goods each day from what was my Mother's pantry. Tonight I used the rice I fixed yesterday to make chicken and rice casserole. Used the chicken I prepped yesterday also and a can of mushroom soup from Mother's pantry. Grabbed a jar of jam from her pantry also to go with the biscuits I baked. Fresh broccoli (bought today) along with cottage cheese( bought today), applesauce and beets from my own pantry. I pulled a can of peaches from Mother's pantry and put them in the frig. Tomorrow for bfast I can have the peaches with the yogurt and granola I have.What makes you smile?Blessed Be Juls"},

I don't think it's running to the stores to shop, playing catch up on the house cleaning and laundry, or slaving away in the kitchen all day.I don't think it's doing all the paperwork that has sat all week either.So what is rest? According to Webster dictionary, part of the definition is the following:Freedom from activity or labor.....Okay that is pretty well clear, couch here I come for napping...Peace of mind or spirit....That's not always clear especially if you are sitting them free from the activity or labor and you see everything that still needs done...This is when I ask myself  \"is it good?\"I did spend some time in the kitchen today, I made a large pot of rice as I am making fried rice for dinner tonight( chicken stir fry, fried rice and pot stickers all from pantry) and a casserole with rice later this week. I had enough left for me to have rice, dried cranberries and warm milk or cream for a snack a couple times.Cook once use for at least 2 meals.After I was done cleaning up after cooking it I thought I should have made it yesterday to  have freedom from activity or labor of the meal today.Some Amish that I grew up with do not cook on this day but serve cold foods or something simple such as soup or popcorn,apples and grape juice.I remember my aunt always serving cold fried chicken, potato salad, cole slaw, applesauce and pickles or pickled beets.I am going to try to start practicing that. Either something cold or something simple such as soup, crock pot meal, or a meal in the oven prepped the night before for Sundays and leave the dishes for Monday morning and treasure GOD's day of rest"},

Sliced up some fresh mushrooms to go with it and called it dinner.Thawed some chicken breast. There was several in the package and they were frozen together. I freeze my separately so I don't have to use the whole package but I don't turn food away.

We had just decided 2 days ago we didn't need to go until Tuesday when we would be already in town.We had sausage that I mixed in with canned potatoes, eggs and canned sausage gravy as a skillet meal. I served toast with it and added apples on the side for fruit. The canned goods came from Mother's pantry and the rest from our own.Today we ate leftovers and canned fruit (again from Mother's pantry). Friday is our piece day if hubby doesn't work the weekend. Good day to use up leftovers.I finished going through my Mother's stuff we had brought home, kept what I would use (which was less than what I wanted to keep) and divided out the rest between my 3 children.Thoughts rolled around as I washed 6...yes 6 Tupperware containers for  veggie trays. She wasn't using them, they were buried where she could no longer get to them.  So here's my thought...it's frugal to take care of what you have,but if you aren't using what you have you are no longer frugal but a spendthrift wasting your time (housekeeping and maintenance) and money (especially if you have to rent a storage unit). As I scrubbed the bottom of her pots and pans, I can remember her lectures of if you don't keep the bottoms of your pots and pans clean, it takes longer for the heat to reach the food and cook it so you are wasting energy. So true but somewhere along the line she stopped caring if she was wasting energy.Still these pans are over 55 yrs old and still in great shape so I will be using them. I already pulled my old ones to pass on to one of my kids.She has have that set already anyways.Have a Blessed Day"},

Lesson learned, I don't stock brown sugar after Christmas baking is done. I need to put back a Cookie fund for the times I bake for OTY. I need to do more baking of our breads. I've gotten lazy in this area even though most of everything else is made from scratch.I need to focus on eating more of our squash.We saved more money than I thought we would and used it in areas that we would have struggled to get the money around.Both of us has been sick and neither of us felt like cooking. I need to prep some meals for those times and keep that in stock.We have decided to do the Pantry Challenge during February to use up what canned goods came from my Mother's pantry. It will be interesting because there is plenty of canned gravy and we don't really eat that much gravy. Probably will have \"blue plate specials\" to use it up. And that statement of \"blue plate specials\" just showed my age. Oh well...SMILEBeen dealing with a horrible migraine for 2 days so calling it a niteBlessed Be"},

Check out her blog for how she has done. I saved 50% of what we normally spend. We ended up adding non-food and eating out into the total also so we really did good. We cut down eating out by 50% also and I can actually say except for the Chinese Buffet I haven't missed it until I got sick. I always crave fast food when I am sick...figures that's when I can eat it anyways. We spent the savings on garden seed and some other odds and ends we would have been scrimping to pay. I even bought some foaming hand soap from Back and Body that Ree over at Pioneer Woman had talked about for myself as a birthday present. Better late than never I thought. As for the Pantry Challenge, Hubby and I have decided to go at least until the end of February. We decided this on the following reasons:    #1, we will save enough money to finish paying for the garden supplies.  #2 we will be able to clean the pantry without moving a lot of food in March/April when I do the spring cleaning. #3 we won't be wasting our resources buy throwing away food that went bad because it wasn't eaten. The last reason really hit home this weekend when my step brother and I cleaned out our parents pantry. By today we counted up the food that had went bad and realized that my kids and their families (total of 21) could have been fed for 2 weeks with what we threw out.That makes me very sad because our parents didn't have money to waste like that. I do understand that they forgot what they had because nothing was organized and it was all shoved in different cabinets  and some was even in boxes and sacks in bedrooms and the hallways. What was still good I have split between my kids and us.So now I have more in my pantry than I did when we started the pantry challenge...Guess that is reason #4.We are going to think about some RULES for ourselves for the Pantry Challenge in February. Tonight is leftovers or smoked sausage and mac and cheese if Hubby decided to cook because I have had a horrible migraine since last night and it isn't going away. Have a good day.Blessed Be"},

We ate bfast on the road, Subway steak,egg and cheese on flat bread , we worked through lunch at my step dad's trailer with my step brother. Since Mom died in Nov I've been doing what I can to help get the trailer around so my stepbrother can live with my step dad who has Alzheimer's. For dinner we ran through a Mc D's drive thru so we could see my brother for a few minutes before he left Dad's. Not a very healthy day for the menu.We did clear out Mother's pantry. The shame of it is we had to throw away enough food that would have fed my daughter's family of 9 for 2 weeks. BUT that's not all. My step brother kept enough groceries to feed him and Pop for 2 months. We brought home enough canned goods to fill the bed of our full size truck. I've sorted out the canned goods and split it between us and the kids. Still our share (which was basically what the kids won't eat, can't figure out why none of them eats beets.) filled 2 shelves in the butler's pantry. We will use that up before going back to use our own.Today was leftover steak,egg and cheese on flat bread, we just snacked for lunch and dinner was the odds and ends of leftovers in the frig."},
{"title": "Day 24 and 25 Pantry Challenge, running low of favorite tea.", "date": "Friday, January 25, 2013", "text": "I side tracked last night after dinner dishes was done to work on a puzzle we are doing as a gift for another family member. We had the meat loaf from the deep freezer, mashed potatoes (potatoes were bought in Nov for Tday dinner) and corn from the deep freezer.Bread, butter and jam rounded out the meal. I pulled a container out of the freezer in the mudroom frig. I could tell it have chicken pieces and carrots and potatoes, other then that I was clueless as to what it was. This morning I checked it, it was thawed enough to transfer to casserole dish. I think it's what was left from chicken and dumplings but I don't know what it has potatoes in it if it is. Oh well, right now it's in a casserole dish to warm for dinner tonight, I will add bread, butter and jam or apple butter to go with it, maybe cottage cheese,applesauce and beets. I might make a fruit crisp to go with it also. Depends on the puzzle. I had a friend ask me what was my point of doing the pantry challenge, I wasn't really going without anything. I am but I just don't acknowledge it because I know how to substitute pretty well in the kitchen. That was knowledge that I had before becoming a personal chef.We ran out of chips and we are low on chocolate bars. Those are hubby's two junk foods. He eats peanut butter on his chocolate bars before going to work.I got him 2 small bags of chips at Aldi's the other day and that's all until next month.I am running out of my favorite flavored tea. I have enough for 2 more tea pots. I've been tossing in some home made teas from my herbs. I have an herb and spice pantry of over 100 different kinds.My apple mint that I also use for tea is real low and my plant died so I am really having to be careful of how often I use it until I get a new plant in and producing. I am out of some types of pasta.I am out of some types of rice.I am out of chuck roast and don't have any roasting chickens.I am out of sub buns, hot dog buns, ciabatta bread and Texas toast garlic bread.Because there is only the two of us I put our breads in the freezer and only pull out what we need as we need it. I do bake, I used to make all of our bread except for one loaf of sliced bread a month. We don't eat bread as much now days.I am out of tomato sauce and fire roasted tomatoes that I make tomato bisque out of. Need to plant more tomato plants this year.I am low on some dried fruits that Hubby favors and he has acknowledged that he is going to have to use the others up. YEP, he asked for them and then hasn't used them. He adds them to his yogurt for his lunch/snack at work.I am out of eggrolls, I use that for lunch a lot of times or snacks. I am almost out of  pot stickers, that hubby likes for snacks when he isn't working.I am out of Italian green beans until the season comes back in. Yes I noted to plant more of that type of bean.There are bare spots in the pantry, in the freezers and in the frigs. That's okay. In fact I changed where I stored a couple things.I used the last of the onions we raised last year. So I will have to buy onions until next fall...so I need to plant more than I did last year.I don't look at the grocery ads. I don't go to the store for milk or bread, hubby does that because he drives past the local small store on his way home from work and he gets just exactly what I say we need. If he sees a good sale and thinks I might be interested he will call and ask...not just buy like I would.I am using things that would have sat longer if not got used at all. I don't want to use up the favorites and then be stuck eating a bunch \"why in the world did I buy this\" type of food.I know we have eaten out or bought take out food 4 times since Jan 1st. I know tomorrow we will eat out also. So my thoughts are on that is 5 times in 31 days (as I know we will eat home the rest of the time). That is half of what we have been eating out. So that money has been saved and we have ate healthier also which helps when we both got the flu and I got 2 different flues.My goal for next month is to do the Pantry challenge again, to drop the eating out down to 2 or 3. I would just say 2 but Valentine's day and our anniversary is in Feb and if I say 2 then I will feel bad if it is 3. Since we didn't eat my birthday dinner and it's in the freezer maybe I will talk Hubby into just eating it instead of us going out.I know I need to make some pizza crusts for the freezer for those times it's \"I want a pizza\".Puzzle calls,Blessed beJuls"},

I checked the grocery budget and realized with eating from the pantry this month that not only was I able to order half of our garden seeds but I could buy ingredients to make cookies for Operation Thank You to send to the deployed soldiers.I don't keep cookie making ingredients on hand, flour yes but that is about it because we don't eat many cookies...well we would but we over do it when we do. I don't buy store bought cookies very often either. We do make over 100 dozen cookies for the kids and grandkids and Operation Thank You at Christmas time.So today while at the store I got our perishables, about $10 worth, some personal items, dogs treats and the cookie dough ingredients. AND still had money left in the food budget.I pulled canned corned beef from the pantry, plopped it in a casserole dish, topped it with what was left of the jar of kraut in the frig to nuke in the microwave for dinner. I will top it with the shredded Swiss cheese I pulled from the freezer and serve it on the deli rye bread that was in the freezer also.  I will serve it with cottage cheese, pickled beets and applesauce. The standard 3 things that is usually on the table, some times it's pickles instead of beets.While out in the garage I pulled a meatloaf out of the deep freezer to thaw for tomorrow.If we hadn't been eating from the pantry this month I wouldn't have had the garden seed like I did and I definitely wouldn't have been able to  buy ingredients to make cookies for our deployed soldiers.

Potato chips, I am craving potato chips.10 more MONTHS of food in the pantry/freezer...but not enough potato chips....I vacuumed bagged shredded pork and ham slices and ham chunks. Which means there are now 8 more meals in the freezer. Have different broths in the frig for the fat to harden for me to de-fat tomorrow and can the broth. I will strain the fat into ice cube trays and freeze it then bag it when it's frozen (and LABEL). That shout was at myself for not labeling another batch. I had to melt a cube and taste it to figure out what it was.Tonight I cooked green beans and diced potato and ham chunks together. As a child this would have been the meal Mother put on the table with corn bread. But hubby grew up on the farm with beef and pork always in the freezer so he isn't satisfied with that type of dish so I grilled ham and cheese sandwiches to go with it. He was happy. Tomorrow I will have the leftover green beans with leftover corn bread for lunch.I can tell you now with the weather we are having right now that we will be having chili that I canned last month for dinner tomorrow. I just looked at our weather gauge (we live on a farm in the boonies) and the wind chill is a minus 25.I will be doing some baking tomorrow.

It was a great feeling because I used the money we saved from the grocery budget and we aren't robbing Peter to pay Paul or waiting for what little tax refund we get. The thought that crossed my mind was if we eat from the pantry the rest of the year I might actually be ahead financially...on the down side of that is I will still have to replace the pantry. Tonight we have left over pasta from the other night so I am adding onions,bell peppers, mushrooms, black olives and pepperoni and some pizza sauce and topping it with pizza cheese for pizza spaghetti as my youngest used to call it. So we are back to eating from the pantry with the goal to be able to order the rest of the garden or at least part of it with in 2 weeks.Enjoy the day.Blessed be Juls"},
{"title": "Day 18 Pantry challenge and life style choices", "date": "Friday, January 18, 2013", "text": "Today is my birthday. Happiness in that I am older,( can't wait to turn 56 so when the kids call me an old crone, I can say YES I AM)the bills are paid, there is a roof over my head, clothes on my back, food in the pantry and GOD in my heart. Even though I am sick with the flu, I am happy that I am HOME and not in the hospital like so many others. I also am still, birthday and sick going to have to do the laundry, pick up the house and make dinner.Today I pulled pasta from the pantry, a can of tomato puree from the pantry, a garlic bulb from the garlic basket and will add some basil leaves from the plant that is struggling to survive in the planter on the dining table.There are mushrooms and broccoli in the frig. I have flat bread in the frig also so I might make a bruschetta just because it is my birthday. There is prosciutto in the freezer that I can top it with along with fresh basil, olive oil, and a little bit of shredded provolone cheese. Even with thinking what to take from the pantry that I acknowledge my kids call Mom's grocery store. I am thinking of how to make what I have last the longest possible time and yet eat well.To me my pantry is not just come canned goods in a cabinet (on in my house on shelving units in the basement or under furniture depending on the house at the time). It's a life style.It's a life style that reflects the importance of putting food on the table for my family (whether they are living with me or not) in good times and bad when there is no money for groceries.That choice comes from growing up without enough food and going hungry after my parents were divorced and Mom didn't handle the finances very well.It's a lifestyle of choosing to buy $20 of groceries that can make a week's worth of food(not always balanced but filled the tummies at the table) or a delivery of pizza or fast food drive thru for one meal.It's a lifestyle of gardening and processing that food for the pantry even when I had no place to grow anything. Containers on the porch and in front of windows during the winter and farmers markets and even the grocery stores when things were in season and cheap.It's making food last and not wasting.It's using the little tiny bits that aren't worth a meal and turning them into casseroles, soups or in pasta or rice dishes. Or as hubby does, in to beans or eggs.My dad who grew up during the Great Depression told me I was too frugal in my kitchen. I would be a match for his grandmother. To me that was high praise as she not only fed herself but her childrens' children and neighbors in the small community they lived in the foothills of the Appalachians in southern Ohio.It's hoarding when you don't eat it and it goes to waste, it's a pantry when you do eat it and it doesn't go to waste.It's making plan overs for the left overs.It takes thought and sometimes more time then you want to give.I would rather sit and figure out how to make the food last then watch a show or movie on tv. I would rather read a cookbook than watch tv also.But think about this..take 40% of your grocery money and throw it directly in to the trash can...think I am crazy? The average family of 4 throws away 40% of the food they buy in a month...SAME THING.Buy 20 lbs of potatoes and toss them in the trash can....WHAT? The average person tosses 20 lbs of food in the trash each month.On the average of a 4 person family, $2,275 a year of food goes in the trash. That is around $189.58 cents a month.I had some families take pictures of food left on the plates after each meal and pictures of what they threw away that went bad in the frig,freezer and pantry. Only one family had less than a plastic grocery bag of waste and it was going to the compost pile. Which means there was no meat, meat by products or oil/fats in it. The others...well lets just say that they now wrap the leftovers on their children's plates for snacks that they always ask for later and soups, casseroles etc are now served a couple times a week. The best news was the one family went from $1000 a month for groceries (no non-food) to $400 a month for groceries and was able to fully stock the freezer they were able to buy with the extra money.If you lost your job TODAY, would you have food to serve your family a month from now WITHOUT government assistance or the local food pantry?When we moved here, my youngest was worried we would go without food because the only thing she saw in my pantry cupboard was pickles and beets. Bills were high due to medical bills and the outlay of moving expenses(moved closer to hubby's work). My son in law that moved us started laughing at her. Informed her that yes the cupboard only had pickles and beets. Under the bed was canned beans and canned meats, under the couch was canned veggies and under the chairs and love seat was canned fruit. There was canned goods in the office closet, canned goods in the tv room closet, home canned soups was in the garage and dried goods stored in the furnace closet. We weren't going to go hungry. She immediately called and asked me if I could give her some canned soup.Dinner time...got to goBlessed Be Juls"},

I like this challenge for several reasons, first because it holds me accountable, second because I focus on using what is in the pantry and not running to the store and last I can clean empty shelves a whole lot easier than shelves crammed full when I do the spring cleaning.I have a pork roast along with the extra bones from the roasts I ground pork from yesterday in the crock pot. I will shred some on flat bread for sandwiches and serve cottage cheese,applesauce,and pickled beets.I need to deal with the ham we had last night. It made some good broth for soups and I can package it down for sandwiches and casseroles for later. I will keep the bone and toss it back in the freezer for bean soup later.I will strain the fat off the broth and put it in ice cube trays and then in the freezer so I can make gravy from it later or use it as \"oil\" when making corn bread or cooking. I can hear those moans people...natural fats doesn't bother hubby or my cholesterol... shelled seafood sends his up through the roof and microwave popcorn (the oil used to pop it) sends mine through the roof. As long as we eat like we did as kids our cholesterol is good.Neither one of us ate processed food much as kids,coffee, tea and water was the beverages usually served. Dad hunted and fished so our protein was wild game or fish while hubby's family farmed so they had cattle and hogs to butcher.

{"title": "Day 15 and Day 16 of Pantry Challenge", "date": "Wednesday, January 16, 2013", "text": "It's official, I've caught the flu that hubby had.I wasn't completely over influenza A so this round with influenza B is just a bigger drain on my system. All I can think is thank heavens I got the flu shot or it would be a lot worse and I would most likely be in the hospital like my daughter's mother in law and niece on her hubby's side.Last night since we were sitting in the doctor's office until 4:30 and then had to wait until 5:30 to pick up my new meds. Hubby insisted we go to the Chinese buffet and eat dinner. He used the argument that I could get soup,food that had ginger cooked in it and Chinese mustard that also includes turmeric. I have taught him well. I didn't argue back at all.Just figured that was another meal that got moved on the calendar.Tonight we are having ham sandwiches. I got a ham from Aldi's for half price and tossed it in the oven to bake tonight for sandwiches.Neither one of us feels like eating so a sandwich with an apple or some raw veggies will be plenty.We did go to the grocery store also to pick up fresh produce,milk and it was suppose to be ground pork...well I am not going to pay $3.89/lb for ground pork when there is a pork roast sitting right by it for $1.29. I needed 4 lbs for the next 2 months so I grabbed 12 lbs of roast. (FYI a 4 lb roast with bone gives you about 2 1/2 lb ground meat)Spent the same amount if I had bought the 4 pounds of ground pork and brought it home to grind myself. I have a food processor and an old fashion meat grinder.Two of the roasts got ground up, their bones got tossed in to the crock pot with the third roast that will cook on low over night to make shredded pork. Balance of grocery budget is 1/4th of what I normally would have spent by now and we have meals on the menu that is in the pantry until March. Enjoy your night.Blessed Be Juls"},
{"title": "Day 14 Pantry challenge", "date": "Monday, January 14, 2013", "text": "Day 14, Hubby has the flu ( he had influ B and  I had influ A)for sure,Doc put him on theraflu and he is home from work. I think that maybe in the last 20 yrs he has stayed home from work maybe 3 times due to being sick. Not something that he does, let alone that he usually doesn't get sick. Just brings it home to me instead. SMILEI had thought of the leftover salad from when we ordered pizza and some soup but realized there was some bell pepper that was going to go bad if we didn't get it used up. So instead I tossed the bell pepper, onion and leftover turkey from deep freezer together in a skillet and then tossed it in flat bread for sandwiches to go with the leftover salad. I also printed off a calendar for Feb. and March. As I find meals in the pantry or buried in deep freezer I am writing it on the calendar. I cross it off when we eat it. Being sick has caused a lot of issues with eating from the pantry. I made hamburger casserole the other night and normally there wouldn't have been anything left and we only ate half of it so that is going in the freezer and on the menu. I have started a grocery list, almost decided to go Thursday (normal grocery day) because I have a coupon for $5 if I buy $25 only to realize I didn't have $25 worth of groceries listed and caught myself thinking what I could add to it to get the $25. Kind of defeats the purpose of eating from the pantry.By eating from the pantry I made a basic grocery list of what we eat and what I needed to make sure was stocked. Then when I sat down with the seed catalogs to start planning the garden I used that same list.That kept me focused on what we actually eat, not what looks really interesting in the catalogs. Then since we expanded the square foot gardens last year I decide to put all the gardens on spreadsheets and input where what was going. That also keeps me reined in because I have been know to have to plant pumpkins around the house because I ran out of room in the gardens. SO that also reins in the pantry next fall. Flu meds time.

He decided he wanted a chef salad and pizza from our local pizza shop. Definitely a splurge because I have been making our pizzas at home. I will put part of the pizza in the freezer to have for later. We will end up making about 3-4 meals total off of it. I think it was his way of compromising since he wasn't up to eating the steak and lobster tail I had planned for my bday dinner He didn't even finish his salad and only at a couple slices of pizza...definitely didn't feel like eating much at all. He works all of next weekend which is actually my bday and we don't eat that big of meal right before he goes to work.Oh well, it will stay in the freezer until another time. Today we are back to eating from the Pantry. I chose hamburger pie since it would free up my casserole dish and hubby was already able to eat sloppy joe which is the base of the pie. I plan to put together baked oatmeal tonight for tomorrow morning. Temps here are suppose to drop from the high 50s of the last couple days to the 20-30s by tomorrow morning with Friday morning to start out at 10 degrees...lovely to be here in Ohio.A hot breakfast before we run our errands will be good. I walked the gardens yesterday while it was still warm and the rain hadn't come in to make notes of what needed down before I started planting. Went to the pantry and looked to see what I didn't need to plant this year.Dill pickles no, bread and butter pickles yes.Straightened up the pantry will looking it over. Now have some empty spots.I also was able to clear off the top of the cabinet in the dining room where I keep food that is in boxes( the pantry in the basement does sometimes gets damp so what I don't transfer to other containers stays in the cabinet in the dining room). So it shows that we are eating from the pantry which helps keeps me on task with it.Pull out some cookbooks from the Great Depression and some recipes and notes off the internet about food during W.W.1, W.W. 2 and the Great Depression.

{"title": "Day 11 of Pantry Challenge and more flu", "date": "Friday, January 11, 2013", "text": "Sorry day 10 was scheduled to post last night but some how I messed that up...I woke up with a fever of 99.1... that is a lot lower than it has been but let me know I still was fighting the flu. Hubby came in from work and after one look I knew he now has it. Ten Bucks says he gives it back to me.Still we are eating from the pantry. We had fruit with our coffee this morning before he curled on couch and went to sleep and I went back to bed. When I woke for lunch I had him take the bed because the pup was dropping toys on him trying to get him to wake up and play with him. I had home made beef broth for lunch.Hubby woke up later and we ate an early dinner of home made sloppy joes and the last of the pears.I make my sloppy joes sauce from scratch, we like it better that way. I already put some of it in the casserole dish for hamburger pie (Sheppard's pie or Chinese pie depending on which of my kids you talk to).It's base is sloppy joes topped by veggie (usually corn for us) and then mashed potatoes. Some times I will top it with cheese. I wrote a menu for Jan and Feb from the pantry. Thought it would be a good guideline more than something that was \"I must cook this tonight\".  It also lets me look at it to see if there is something I can fix fast when it's the \"I don't want to cook tonight\" or the \"I forgot to thaw something\" night. The bonus is it reminds me to soak my dry beans so I can use them. We eat a lot of different dried beans in a lot of different ways, not just bean soup. But like everything else I have gotten out of the habit with everything that went on last year between surgeries, Mother dying and my Crohn's putting me in the hospital.Not sure what we will be eating tomorrow since we are both sick...that kind of sucks since we were suppose to have porterhouse steak and lobster tails for my bday dinner since hubby works next week during my bday and we don't eat that big of a meal right before he leaves for work.Stay safe, stay well...Blessed Be Juls"},

Hubby got in early from work so since I was feeling okay he agreed we could go to the store. I have been tracking what we spend, coupons and sales etc to keep us in budget.After today's buy I am still saving around 25 % (goal is to be over 30% by April) and we are below half the budgeted amount for the month. After I get a cup of hot tea and curl back up on the couch for the day I am going to write out the menu for the rest of the month. Hubby thought that would help him help me with me still recovering from the flu.We did pick up a couple things that we didn't need...steak and wine for this weekend. My bday is next weekend but Hubby has to work all next weekend so we won't be going out or me fixing a big meal when he is working so I decided to do the big meal this weekend instead.Today's meal is chuck roast (from store today but I knew I would be exhausted by dinner and hubby needs a good meal by now and he isn't going to cook it himself, it was good because I saved $2/lb on it AND I can make  at least 3 meals from it. The veggies will come from the pantry along with the fruit for dessert.Blessed Be JulsHubby had the last of his Hot sausage chili with Fritos. He took the last of the pork chop, beef roast and the navy bean soup to work for lunch.I had a fried egg sandwich.We are out of bread, out of dog food, and out of hamburger for meatloaf etc. Still have the flu but the fever is mostly goneBlessed Be Juls"},

It was an okay meal considering neither hubby or I like kale. Since the kale was slightly sauteed instead of steamed until soggy I am going to say it's the method of cooking instead of the kale.Today is going to be oven baked pork chops, scalloped potatoes, green beans, corn and something to use up the pumpkin pie filling that is sitting in the frig.I have kale to use up and creamy cheese polenta to use up also. So I went looking for ideas for those ingredients. Even though Hubby wonders where my mind some times go I wandered off on the internet (had the ickies anyways) and researched menus and recipes from W.W. 1,W.W. 2 and the Great Depression. (it's a recession when your neighbor loses their job, it's a depression when you lose your own.)ANYWAYS....Dad preaches not throwing food away. Mom didn't throw food away either until it molded and then it went to the field for the critters to eat. (Dad lives in the city, Mom and step dad lived in the country).  I have always tried to not throw food away...then Dad suggested instead of tossing food here and there in the trash to put it all on the table and look to see what we are wasting including the skins and peelings of food like potatoes,carrots and such.SO I am back to focusing on not only eating from my pantry but making it last longer that I think it can and not throwing any food in the trash can or the field. I wouldn't throw money there that Hubby has worked hard for to begin with, throwing food there is the same thing.Blessed be Juls"},

I just couldn't talk myself into ignoring what was there and going to the store to buy what I want.On Dec 30th I made home made pizza using up a box pizza that I bought out of memories, I used up cheese from the freezer, a couple sausage patties,onion,mushrooms and banana peppers on one and pepperoni,onion, and mushrooms on the other one. The two of us ate both of them before going to bed.On Dec 31st  I made spinach salad. Soup using the broth I made from the leftover prime rib roast of Christmas eve along with some of the meat from that roast,(rest will show up in noodles later), added some leftover pizza sauce from the night of pizzas and sauteed onions,carrots,celery,mushrooms, and garlic. Added hot bread(from deep freezer) and called it a meal.Today , Jan 1st we have been snacking on odds and ends in the frigs, which I need to clean out tonight for the trash to go to the road for tomorrow's pick up. Dinner will be ribs (deep freezer from July 4th) with BBQ sauce, mashed potatoes, kraut and leftover broccoli,cauliflower, carrots from a veggie tray to make California blend veggies along with what is left of the bread from last night.It was suggested I make a menu of the meals in my freezers and pantry....that would be over 300 and I won't stay with those ideas anyways...the chef in me sees some recipe and pulls the spices and changes what was going on the table about mid morning anyways.Have a safe and Happy New YearBlessed Be Juls"},

No chew, no jump, outside toy(weeds,sticks, steer crap) inside toy (stuffed toys),down, sit, stay (HA HA) etc. He has learned to beg pretty but I think that is because Kira our other dog already did it when we got her and she begs pretty.Right now he is about 20 pounds lighter than her but her size.

He didn't think I was funny.I am starting the hoop jumping for what I hope is the final surgery for YEARS. I have issues with my sinus cavities being broken and not healed correctly that I have put off getting fixed for about 30 yrs. I had part of the surgery done when the youngest was one. She bashed my face the day after surgery with her hand when she was trying to crawl up on me while I laid on the couch recovering and it hurt so bad that I didn't go back and have the rest of the surgery. I know that is a really bad excuse but it's the truth. It's okay, go ahead and laugh, I do.Since it now hurts all the time like a really bad toothache, I figure I can deal with it.In the mist of everything else, I talked hubby into letting me get a puppy with the line our older dog would help potty train it. Rascal was only 6 wks when we got him. His mom was pregnant and abandoned, starving so much she didn't have any milk to feed her 11 babies when they were born. ALL of them are fine now and His Extended Hands Sanctuary in St Paris OH has done a great job.  .Rascal has adjusted better and faster than we thought he would...as long as he sleeps against me. Since he doesn't stay \"dry\" all night, I have taken to sleeping on the front room floor or couch with him. I wake up faster and get him out side (saying the words repeatedly potty outside, business outside, like he understands that)hopefully in time to not have to clean the carpet. I should have stock in carpet cleaning products and steam cleaners.Our older dog, Kira has done very well with him.She's never had a litter and has spent most of her life in a shelter but has shown motherly actions towards him....until he takes her food or chews on her too much or won't let her sleep ...then she takes a FIRM stand. Oh wait that is also being a mother....SMILE. Her and I cuddle together when he finally passes out for a nap and coo over him like we are new parents. LOL.Meantime, the garden needs to be put in (repeatedly as Rascal digs up what ever he sees me plant).There is work to do on the house, walls to paint, woodwork to refinish, more weatherization (have caulk gun, will travel) to bring those heat bills down more.ANDI have decided I waste too much in the kitchen and the grocery budget was up to over $600 (food,non-food, and eating out) and that to me was unacceptable.I think $225 should be good, especially with my pantry and the garden.We will see.Blessed Be"},

Even with ordering my garden supplies and planning this spring's planting.The last year has been a roller coaster and usually that is my favorite ride but for right now I would love the ferris wheel so I can see off into the distance and see what is coming at me.I think the merry go round would remind me too much of my current recovery process.Hubby's work was down, then up and then back down causing all sorts of financial issues.Lesson learned, saving the kids might mean drowning yourself.I had my gallbladder removed. I've had digestion issues since birth only to figure out that 90% of them must have been tied to my gallbladder because they went completely AWAY.My Mom had shingles with a lot of pain.Then Dad had shingles with a lot of pain.AND yes I went and got a shingles shot at the advice of my dad.My step dad's mail order med company that he uses sent the wrong insulin and almost killed him. AND he was driving when the insulin kicked in and he hit several other cars before coming to a stop. Luckily no one else was hurt and his insurance covered it and the mail order company settled out of court.Then my brother had surgery on his knee and if he doesn't continue the therapy for the rest of his life,he will lose the ability to walk.Having knee issues in your 60s is on the normal side but when you have a 12 yr old daughter, you need to keep things in good condition.Then my cerebral palsy and fibromyalgia flared up together mimicking the symptoms of  MS and causing me to struggle to walk.So of to physical therapy that wasn't getting correcting the whole issue so I was sent to a surgeon to see if it was my knee ( both my dad and brother have knee issues)...nope, then they x-rayed my lower back, pelvic, hip and entire leg.Vertebra deformed in lumbar and unknown masses in the bladder area so a CT scan was scheduled to see if I had cancer.I called my dad to tell him I was going for a CT scan to see if I had cancer only for him to tell me he was going in for hernia surgery.SO I kept my mouth shut about my own issues. He has recovered and changed his diet.Considering he has had throat cancer and is a survivor and has been a diabetic for over 20 yrs and has not taken more that 1 pill a day for it and most of that time 1/2 of a pill, walks 5 miles a day (even after knee surgery), rides an indoor bike, lifts weights and eat 3 balanced and healthy meals and over 35 g of fiber into his age of mid 80's...I didn't ask what he changed.He lectures enough on my eating habits and lack of exercise as it is.I called my mom to tell her I was going in for a CT scan only for her to tell me before I told her my news that she had a mass and was going to have a CT scan to see if it was cancer.So I kept my mouth shut again.I did tell my kids and asked that they not tell anyone else until we got mom's results and dad got thru surgery.Yes, my dad, step dad and mom have ripped off my head for keeping my mouth shut when I did tell them.Mom has multiple melanoma, she went in for radiation but no chemo of her own choice. Two months later she is in remission and not taking radiation. The last CT scan couldn't find any cancer. She will be taking meds for another 3 yrs.During that time, step dad had to go on meds for his Alzheimer's caused by agent orange from when he was in Nam.I went in for surgery to remove the masses from my bladder(no cancer) and to sling it. My doctor asked permission to fix anything he found needing repair while there. Works for me...and it really did work for me, first the shock he got was in the 6 weeks from finding the masses by x-ray to the CT scan the masses had went from the size of a pea to the size of a quarter so when surgery was 4 wks after that( I wasn't having surgery during the holidays) he figured it was going to be worse. They were GONE. Though he end up repairing my bowel while in there instead of making me go through another surgery(and more money spent).That surgery turned out a lot better than any of us planned.Still, with a acknowledgement of the miracles that have came our way (several times a day) I struggle to recover my strength. Struggle to shake the depression and emptiness that is with in me.I read the Serenity Prayer (all verses) several times a day (okay, I taped in on the wall across from the throne) to keep myself focus that the hard times including my health are just part of the path not the whole path.Prayers for you and yours, prayers for myself and mine.Blessed Be Juls"},

While wiping down the woodwork I see where there are cracks for air to come through so I caulk. I check window seals when I wash the windows. Dirt will destroy anything if it's on it very long.Wipe off switch plates and outlet covers, check to make sure you have foam insulators behind them, especially if they are on outside walls.Check your attics especially if you have a chimney or attic fan.Not only for air but water leaking in.Check your basement and crawl spaces for air and water leaks, deal with them now before winter or before you have a major expense due to damage.In the winter,on bare floors I add throw rugs or area rugs, layer the curtains/drapes at the windows even if the drapes are insulated or lined.Move furniture to inside walls including the bed.SEE guys, we do move the furniture around for a reason. Add flannel sheets to the bed, layer on the blankets( preferable thermal) and thick comforter.Pull out the flannel or brushed cotton pjs.Use the oven for entire meals to warm the kitchen.Open curtains when the sun is shining( where the sun is shining in) to help warm the house. Program the thermostat. Right now even though it's cool outside and the house drops to mid 60s thru the night.I don't have the furnace on yet.We changed the filter and kicked it on to make sure it worked. I cleaned out the vents while doing the fall cleaning.Covered the central air conditioning unit and took the window AC out. Storm door is back on the front door (we get most of the wind from that direction).I will wait awhile before I remove the back screen door.One because when it's warm the kitchen bakes and two, the dog has a opening in the screen(we put it there when Sammy came to live with us) to let herself in and out in to the mudroom.put on a sweater, long sleeve shirt, long pants etc. instead of running around your home in warm weather clothes and complaining about being cold or cranking the heat up.Yes, daughter of mine I am thinking of you. Put on socks and shoes that are not sandels or crocs or mules and your feet will stay warmer.If you want more ideas, just ask your parents or grandparents (or some one of those age brackets) how they kept warm in the winter.You will most likely get an ear full."},
{"title": "Saving money as a habit", "date": "Sunday, August 7, 2011", "text": "I do it with out much thought for they have became habits through time.Others I am working on.Saving money  is a habit that any one can learn. Takes more practice with some of us than others but still is doable.\r\rIt's late summer right now, the garden is producing ( not as much as I would like but every tomato counts) and the sun is starting to rise a bit later each day and set earlier.Walking the garden daily to make sure the ripe produce is picked and dealt with is a habit that I get into easily enough. Washing the produce...okay I struggle to remember to wash the onions , everything else is automatic, but to use the peelings for veggie broth, you need to wash those onion skins, they turn your veggie broth into a nice golden color.\r\rI have a calendar that has when my bills are due.I move the due date up by 7 days so nothing is paid late thus saving late charges( and your credit score). I also put on the calendar when my library books are due a few days ahead of time, once again saving late charges. I round up in my check book register any bills paid automatically, when I balance my register with the bank, I transfer the difference to my savings.I also have an automatic transfer ever month from my checking to my savings on a certain date. This practice also saves me the cost of the checking account. I don't order my checks from the bank. So far I have found them else where for about half the price.\r\rI only clip coupons for things I use. Not something just because it sounds or looks good. \r\rI go to Dollar General, then Save-A-Lot, then Aldi's, then Walmart, then Kroger's and ONLY after I have looked at fliers, checked the coupons and looked on line. This line up of stores is good also for my gas mileage even though I actually pass by Kroger's and Walmart to get to Aldi's. It's not enough, a parking lot of Walmart, to make enough difference.\r\rDuring the Farmer's markets I shop for veggies and fruit there. Usually cheaper, a lot healthier and keeps my money in my community.\r\rWhen I shop I use a list. Okay I use 2 lists. One for food only and the other is for non-food. It isn't unusual for me to do the shopping on separate days.I only shop for non-food once a month sometimes it's 6 wks or more apart. my big shopping for food is once a month and I fill end then when I am already in town or hubby is once a week or every other week. The less you are in the store, the less you will spend.\r\rI don't cook from boxes ( most the time that is, I do have some for hubby for when I am not there). It's simple to toss cooked ground beef with noodles or rice and a sauce with seasoning instead of hamburger helper with it's high sodium and preservatives. Or even use a can of soup instead of a sauce.Gravy is nothing more than fat ( of any kind except margarine ) and flour,salt and pepper and then water, milk or broth.I skim my fats from my meats when I am cooking and freeze it in ice cube trays I use only for this.Then bag them. One good cube of fat is enough to make 1/2 cup of gravy. If there is only 2 of you like there is of us...this is enough gravy for a meal, unless you LOVE gravy and use mash potatoes for the excuse of having gravy.\r\rSoups and casseroles are easy and can be made out of leftovers. I make a couple soups that you can make the basic soup and then pull out a little of it each day, add a couple things and change what it is.Casseroles can start with a strained soup or can have water,broth or milk to turn into soup.\r\rI don't by name brand because it's name brand nor do I buy cheap because it's cheap. I buy the BEST for my DOLLAR.\r\rI don't keep the house lit up, I turn down the thermostat( use a programmable one) for the furnace and only use a window AC (instead of the central air) in the bedroom during the day when Hubby is sleeping. I use ceiling fans yr around and other fans when I am in the room except the front room, that is where the dog lays a lot when she is in the house so I keep a fan running on low for her.I have computers, stereos and the televisions and all it's gadgets like the cable box, dvd player etc on power strips that I turn OFF when they are not in use.\r\rI checked the insulation, duct work should be insulated, you can lose 10-30 % of your heat or cooling through your duct work. Pipes and water heater should be insulated right along with caulking windows and doors.Before you even think to yourself, I rent and its the landlords problem...yes he should do it and pay for it but it's YOUR MONEY that is being wasted.Would you throw 1/3 rd of your heat bill in cash out the door or window? NO. You can take steps yourself to save YOUR money even when the landlord won't. I am lucky my landlord ( heaven Bless him) cares about his property and about us.\r\rnext ...getting ready for winter and saving yourself money."},

Complete meals,including breakfast, lunch, dinner and 2 snacks for each day. Have some that you can cook and some that needs nothing more than to be opened. Cold cereal can be eaten with or without milk for a meal or a snack.I keep popcorn that I can pop on the stove or over a grill (microwave popcorn is high in triglycerides).I have dried fruit.Some I buy and some I dehydrate myself.I keep assorted nuts in the freezer and we usually have sunflower seeds because I make granola bars for hubby's lunch.I always have eggs,beans,flour,corn meal, yeast,evaporate milk, dried milk,assorted pasta and rice and some cans of meat such as tuna,chicken etc.Potatoes if you eat them regularly is also good. With these items you can make dumplings, noodles, bread,biscuits, gravy, cream sauce for pasta or rice.My parents ate bean soup 2-3 times a day most of their childhoods.Both are in their 80s and can give the MY grandkids a run for their money on being active,I won't mention they put me to shame also.To survive a time without income or the ability to go to the store or fast food joint you first have to have a pantry.Next post....meals from the pantry"},

{"title": "Great Depression II Utilities", "date": "Tuesday, August 2, 2011", "text": "A parents fear is not having enough money to keep the heat on or water. Basic utilities is something a lot of us take for granted. Lack of running water, electric and heat is quite common in other countries.Sometimes even in this country when jobs disappeared and benefits ran out.I've been there, might be there again some day. I can offer this advice only.Keep the roof over your head as long as you can without going under.BEFORE you get to that point, ask for help, moving in with friends, family, even strangers was common during the Great Depression.You don't have to have internet, most libraries now have this service if it's your only way of connecting to family and friends. You can also apply from jobs there if needed.You don't have to have cable(satellite) television.You can go digital or even without completely and just borrow DVDs/videos (yes I just showed my age). I didn't have a television for over a year when my children were young,drove my parents and brother nuts over it , later in years they realized a side effect of this. My children love to read and  they can use their imaginations. If your children need to watch something on television for school(let their teacher know you don't have cable, believe me you are not alone) then ask a schoolmate or friend, family member if they can watch it at their place.You don't have to have a cell phone and you can get a house(or a cell) phone for 911 calls only for very cheap.There are a few cell phone companies now offering limited services for very affordable prices so if you are spend $$$ you should check in to this now.We cut our cell phone bill by 2/3rds and have the same things we were using with the old service.You do have to have water and sewage.You do have to have refuse (trash) hauled away. You do have to have electric (especially if you are in the country and have a well that uses a electric pump).You do have to have heat, not necessarily propane, nature gas or electric...but some kind of heat that is SAFE. Using your oven or toaster oven for heat is NOT SAFE.I will admit I have used the oven...to a point, cook a meal in the oven and leave the door cracked open to cool down in the morning or night or both.I have also cooked on top of a kerosene heater (with a window cracked at all times).One of the running jokes (which regretfully did happen) in our family is there is no sense paying the cable/internet or the heat bill if you don't pay the electric to run the items( like the computer,television or furnace in the winter) to begin with. There is no sense planning on flushing the toilet or taking a shower if you don't pay the water bill. Try cooking without water for a couple days and you will understand.Want to understand better what I am talking about, turn your main breaker off and go a few hours.I have done this once every season to make sure I am prepared for outages or storms that can wipe the basic utilities out.Next..what is there left to do?"},

I will offer suggestionsMeat patties using canned salmon or mackerel or tuna or mashed beans( toss in a tortilla wrap and you have a burrito)Corned beef hash (you can put an egg in the middle of it) and serve it with bread ( I prefer toast)I've made hamburger hash and added carrots and celery to the mix.I also use canned corn beef topped with 1,000 salad dressing, kraut and Swiss cheese in my crock pot for a good casserole (it can be nuked instead) that the left overs is served the next day on sub buns with more Swiss cheese.Couscous, risotto, paella,pastas,fried rice.Beans over rice, beans and pasta( pasta e fagioli) or as my Nonna did, beans( a pound of beans for each person) soup on Monday.Add mixed veggies on Tuesday and more water.Add small pasta on Wed and more water. Add stale bread or serve over the stale bread on Thursday and more water. Friday bake bread and have fried bread instead of the soup and be grateful. Saturday was pizza night and Sunday was always pasta and some kind of roast most times it was a chicken.Dried beef (Or any canned meat) and milk gravy over bread/biscuits( remember that flour and yeast I mentioned...okay go ahead and get the bisquick ALSO)Cornmeal can make porridge, polenta(when you add cheese) fried mush(which is porridge that has cooled)corn bread and tamales.Hand me a can of green beans and a can of potatoes and I will toss it together for a one pot meal.Add corn bread or other bread to fill you up and you have a meal.Cabbage, potatoes and some bacon or ham (or just their grease...sorry but it doesn't raise our cholesterol)I usually have some squashes and cabbages in my basement during the late fall, winter into early spring. Usually some apples also. Crisps are good keepers if you keep them dry and cool. Cook them together add pasta, rice or bread and you will fill those tummy's upToss canned meat with your pasta or rice and make a white sauce with your evaporated milk . Or serve rice with red sauce(commonly called spaghetti sauce)Casseroles are forgiving and easy. You can even nuke them and make them quickly.I have tossed stale bread, odds and ends of cheese and diced up veggies together with an egg or even just milk and baked for a casserole.Sometimes I will serve it with gravy I make from the leftover meat grease I keep when cooking meat and freeze it.Stuffing or dressing combined with meat and or with veggies is easy also.Whether you start with fresh bread or boxed mixes.Go look in your cabinets and pull out what you could make your next 2 meals from. You might even get carried away and find out you have more meals than you think you do shoved in those cabinets.Next: saving money as a habitI can sew. I can take a pattern, cut material and sew it on my machine...or by hand.More...I can make a pattern either from laying another item down and tracing it or the person I am sewing for on paper and make the pattern.I can mend,alter and remake old clothes.I haven't had to spin my own thread or weave my own fabric.It's time consuming and hard work but I could do it.I keep buttons,snaps and zippers off of clothes that are to the point of being used for rags.I have used old clothes for patches of clothes still being worn and my girls have all had jean purses made from jeans their own children couldn't wear and was no longer \"worth\" passing down.I've made dresses, night gowns, shirts etc from cotton sheets. Towels, old blankets etc have gone into quilts instead of buying batting. I have had shoes repaired, repaired them myself (glue, sew, are duct tape)or stuffed card board in them to keep them going.Add it on, take it off,turn it inside out, tear it apart and put it back together. Anything to keep clothes on the body, keep warm( or in this hot weather cool) and still look good.Next Utilities"},

I then spent over 30 min telling them why I thought I could. I started with food because in reality, we will go with out the cable,phones, and internet but we have to eat even when we have no income.First is I have a pantry, a huge pantry that I slowly built over time. I will shove can goods under couches, love seats, beds, behind doors, in the closets and even make a end table out of them and cover them with a cloth.I have enough food right now to go at least 6 months,I usually keep a year's supply of food basics.I'm low because the garden isn't doing so well and I am waiting for the crops to come in.Second, we are not picky eaters. We don't have to have meat every night, we like vegetables and having what most consider breakfast food for our evening meal isn't a big deal.It's not like people don't eat steak or pork chops for breakfast...duh.Third, I know how to and do most times cook from scratch. Not out of a box, freezer bag, or can. I can make condensed soup from dried milk(Thank you Amy Dacyczyn Tightwad Gazette 1) I can make catsup, mayo, salad dressing and a lot of things we automatically buy without thought.Fourth, I make food from scraps...I wash my vegetables before I clean them and throw the peelings in to a pot of water to make vegetable stock. Bones, skin and fat from meat and poultry go in a pot of water to make broth. I don't do so much with seafood because it's not affordable in my area and my hubby doesn't fish (he drowns plastic worms).I make new dishes from old foods.This seems to be my best talent in the kitchen.When my children first left home and went out on their own calling and saying telling me they had nothing left to eat happened more than once. I would play 20 questions of what is left in the cabinets, what is left in the freezer, and what is left in the refrigerator and most times come up with several more meals. Might not be balanced but it would fill their bellies.During the Great Depression, it wasn't about eating healthy and eating balanced. It was about having something to put in your stomach and not going hungry.Picking greens out of the yard was good, and if you don't use pesticides and such items you still could.Growing lettuce on a window sill was common.Coming next  CLOTHES"},

Food wise the amount is less than $150 a month but still there is more than plenty going in the trash. Definitely need to up the left over night and more plan over meals.It's the attitude of \"hubby will take it for lunch to work or I will eat it for lunch or a snack\" that is causing things to get dumped in the trash can instead.If nothing else, it needs to be packaged for the freezer especially with garden season coming in.Non-food is killing the budget.I've tried several cleaning products always on the look out for something that eases the cleaning and makes the house smell good at the same time.So I spent some time looking back through my notes of interviews with elders and came up with the following list.Olive oil,safflower oil,baking soda,white vinegar,apple cider vinegar, and lemon juice. Not only are these food products but they are usable to clean your home and yourself( clean and skin care) and can be use to medical also.Castor oil (can stain material), mineral oil,vaseline,rubbing alcohol,and witch hazel can help clean and are medical itemsCastile soap, naptha soap, washing soda,borax and glycerine will clean the home and yourself along with skin care.examples of the above could make: furniture polish, window cleaner, toilet cleaner, all purpose cleaner, oven cleaner, scouring powder, dish soap,laundry soap, laundry stain remover,laundry fabric softener, shampoo, conditioner, liquid body soap,skin moisturizer,lotion to ease body aches, insommia,sleeplessness,reduce inflammation, laxative, stomach issues,fungal infections,acne, ringworm and etc.Instead of me joining the throw away society I can spend a few minutes and make my own cleaners out of \"greener\" products that I either already have or can easily get and spend less money, be healthier and reuse containers. Now if I could just get them to clean the house on their own Lol.Just when I thought I was getting back to my feet...my gallbladder kicked them out from under me. Not used to sitting around and resting, I thought of tons of things I needed to get done once I uncurled from the fetal position. Anyone that has had gallbladder issues can tell you recover just isn't that fast.So out of boredom...I made a list of 25 meals from the pantry that can be put together and on the table in 30 minutes.I made a master grocery list reflecting the new way I have to eat.I made a list of homemade cleaning products and their recipes so I can quit having asthma attackes from my cleaning products and cut the non-food portion of the grocery bill down. We spend twice the amount on non-food that we do on food.I made a list of homemade personal care products.I made a list of my garden stuff needed to be bought, started and etc. I made a new budget for the financesI made a list of the projects that need to lower heat bill to be done before winter hits.I know it will take me all summer to get them done.I bounced doctor appointments and tests( last one tomorrow crossing my fingers. At least the second medication is working.Now with sunshine, warmer weather and taking care of myself I should be able to be back to feet and be organize...if I don't lose the lists.

Pretty much any thing involving the internet doesn't get done when I am on overload with life.Cleaning gets a kiss and a promise,laundry does get kept up because I only have a couple pairs of warm pjs and it's still cold here and hubby works out daily and only has 3 outfits for that. Cooking is a stuggle if I don't have a good pantry and precooked entrees in the freezer. I don't use much box stuff as I have a low sodium diet due to my heart failure.Things that have hit in the last month... I was south for a few weeks, had some job interviews that went no where(or least didn't for right now). I came back to flooding and water in the basement...which caused my root veggies to start going bad.I had some family issues that was dealt with. AND I haven't even touched starting my seeds for this spring's crops.Let alone finish unpacking from our move here at Christmas.Mean time I wiped out the precooked items in the freezer and it's started \"I wished we lived in town so we could do fast food\" feelings I knew it was time to restock the freezers.Luckily hamburger was on sale so I stocked up, now I just have to deal with it.I precook and rinse several pounds for casseroles and sauces,taco meat(homemade seasoning), homemade sloppy joes meat(for sloppy joe,sheppards pie etc)pasta sauce,meatballs,meatloaf and some patties with seasoning mixed in so they aren't just frozen beef. I think this time I will also make some salisbury steak as I have found myself wanting to buy this in the frozen food section at the store and ignore the sodium level.Granted it is a lot of work and it's on top of having to deal with several squashes and 4-30 lbs pumpkins that need dealt with because of the moisture in the basement before I lose them. It can be overwhelming if you think about it.How to get it done??? I have hamburger simmering in my large soup pot with water mixed it(helps remove the grease) while I check my emails, this blog,do the finances and do the laundry. I have a timer to tell me when to stir it. I drain it in the large colendar and rinse with hot water. While it drains I start the next batch. I prefer to only do 3 lbs at a time but did 5 lbs at a time when all the kids were home. I mixed the meatloaf first since I wasn't cooking it then did the meatballs as this was a lot of hands on time. When they were precooked(not done all the way or they will be dry when you do reheat them), I shoved them in the freezer on a cookie sheet and started on the rest.

Or dumb in to eggs and bake,fry, scramble.My Nonna used to make bean soup on Monday, Tuesday she would add water and mixed veggies(what ever was on hand or in the pantry), Wed she would add rice or small pasta or broken up spaghetti and on Thursday everything was served over stale bread or cube the bread and toss in the soup (bread she had baked the Friday before). It doesn't sound the most exciting meal there was but it was different each week as she changed the type of beans, veggies and whether it was with pasta or rice.The staleness of the bread wasn't noticable with it being in the soup.You could always toast them and make them into croutons for the soup."},
{"title": "planning and habits", "date": "Tuesday, February 8, 2011", "text": "The main thing is you have to PLAN for the thin times, no money to buy food, no way to get to the store due to weather etc. and you have make it a habit.It takes a bit of time to plan and about 30 days to make it a habit of doing it constantly. It also takes time to actually do the work. If you plan it, use a crock pot, your oven, the refrig and freezer, a pressure cooker if you have one, things can be simplified for you and take less hands on time.When I first started making vegetable broth we had Thanksgiving dinner.I had shared some of the broth with my youngest daughter and we were talking about it while preparing the big dinner. AFTER we were done prepping the vegetables we both realized we had just peeled everything directly in to the trash can. Needless to say a few mentioned to us that we were giving that trash can strange looks and they were wondering why. We figured we had just tossed 7-8 qrts of broth into the trash.We didn't dig them back out as one grandkid asked if we were going to but it was a definite lesson on where we peeled the veggies from then on. I have a pantry, I have a hugh pantry for only two people but it's nothing for the kids to call and need help with groceries or for me to provide meals to others in need.I didn't always have a hugh pantry.It has been years in the making with a lot of planning that let it come about. My son in law still teases me for having can goods under the bed, under the couch, love seat and in bedroom closets.He found them as he was helping us move.I did the same when I lived in a two bedroom trailer with all the kids.Now I have a hugh basement for my pantry like I did when the kids were younger.Things keep better in a cool spot and I have a better veiw of what needs used up first.I always have kept the staples which is the list I already posted.Might not have paid the cable or phone bill so I could but food and a roof over your head comes first. I am in a place where my landlord has blessed me with his okay to plant as big as garden as I want.I have did container gardening when I didn't have a place to plant anything or I hit the farmers markets, the pick your own farms, and the sales at the stores (Aldi's and Save-A-Lot along with the rest). My groceries are bought on sale and I try to buy in season. Before I buy any meat I check the marked down meat and base my menu on it. I keep a running inventory of my pantry especially the freezer. I thought I needed ham and ground beef this week but I don't when I checked the inventory. I do need ground pork,pork chops,sausage, bacon and ground veal. I finally put the inventory on an excel sheet that helps a lot with updating once a day after I pull what I am fixing for our meals.The fat of any meat(pork,poultry,beef, sausage,bacon etc) goes into ice cube tray and is frozen then put in a freezer bag. Shells of seafood into the freezer to make fish stock. This is usually around the holidays when my mother brings shrimp and cocktail sauce.Wash the veggies before peeling them and toss the peelings into a gallon freezer bag to make veggie broth. Include onion peelings, garlic and mushroom stems. I keep the broccoli and cauliflower separate as they are strong. I also keep the broccoli,sweet potato and white potato separate if those soups is coming up on the menu. Leftover vegetables, toss into a container in the freezer or frig for soups, stews or casseroles or in this family a \"big egg\" which is actually a frittata,omelette or a crustless quiche.leftover meat, you can either toss each separately into a container or toss them together put in the freezer or frig for soups, stews or casseroles or in this family a \"big egg\" which is actually a frittata,omelette or a crustless quiche.Keep bread on the table at all times. Whole grain is better for your health but white will fill you up when you are low on food. You can spend a small fortune on buying bread for a large family or a small family of big eaters. Learn to make bread etc. Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day By Jeff Hertzberg and Zoe Francois is a great book if you don't have a lot of time or just don't want to spend a lot of time on bread. Borrow it from a library and check it out. You will be buying the book in the end anyways.Another thing...have the family drink water at all meals and during the day. Save the juice for morning only and only let them have a serving which is 1/2 cup ( 4 oz not 16). Give only an 8 oz glass of milk once a day and serve the other 2 servings of dairy as cheese,cottage cheese, sour cream or yogurt etc. Let the sodas before for special occasions.I once asked my kids what was their favorite meal growing up was.Beef and homemade noodles, homemade bread fresh from the oven and homemade (mock) KFC coleslaw. Poultry noodles ran second. Beef and veggies soup with homemade bread came in third. It amazed me. It wasn't the Tday dinners or the pot roast but the very meals that I made when scraping the bottom of the barrel for food.Homemade bread was common. I made several loaves at a time using an Amish recipe.I'd put it together around 5 AM and it would be ready to bake by 7-7:30 so I could have it done and cooling before I went to work at 8:30.If I was really with it I would make some on Saturday and Sunday afternoon to ease the work load for the week.Noodles was a way to fill the tummies with very little. Some flour, salt and egg mixed together, rested, rolled, rested and cut.You can make enough noodles for a family of four with a couple cups of flour and a couple eggs. I would cooked them in beef broth(made from the scraps of bones or roast)or poultry broth (made from the carcus of the bird) or just water flavored with beef or poultry fat. Yes I said FAT. When you are poor you waste nothing. I would cool the broth,skim the hardened fat and freeze it. We didn't eat a lot of fat to begin with and a tablespoon or so in a dish that served a large family wasn't going to do damage.Now days I would also include vegetable broth made from the peelings of veggies that I use. A big thanks to Gayle over at www.grocerycartchallenge.blogspot.com. Just make sure the broth or water tastes like sea water(yes, that salty) BEFORE you add the the noodles. I have 2 kids that will make homemade noodles now.Vegetable soup was made from a couple cups of beef broth that came from a pot roast along with any of the meat and veggies that didn't get ate from the last few days. I would toss a couple cans of mixed vegetables or what ever I had on hand, a can of tomato soup and a large can of tomato juice. Sometimes I added more tomato juice if we had a large crowd with the kids friends. I will do this now days with poultry also especially for hubby and myself as I will over load us with poultry broth if I'm not careful."},

Squeezing an extra meal out of meat is a miracle to being with.\r\rI tried to get a roast of some sort every week. Preferrable chicken or beef. It took four chickens or one good size turkey, (I have a daughter that still cringes when she sees turkey on the table besides at the holidays) to feed us one meal.I would then simmer the carcuss in the stock pot and pick the rest of the meat off the bones. This would be split between broth and meat for homemade noodles(flour,salt,eggs),chicken (or turkey) dumplings and if I was lucky a pot of soup with what ever veggies was in the crisper along with either some rice(not instant) or pasta.If there was enough meat to make a stir fry I would go that way.\r\rA beef roast started with root veggies.Second time was either with noodles(the kids preference) or beef vegetable soup.Sometimes there was enough for stew instead of soup. I would add dumplings to make the stew stretch or put the \"stew\" in a pie shell and make pot pie instead.\r\rPork roast was with root veggies, then shredded and tossed with BBQ sauce.Now days I would save some back to make Brunswick stew.\r\rIf we got a ham, I roasted it and we had that the first round, then sliced and diced it up for ham steaks, ham sandwiches, ham salad, diced ham for eggs, salads and the bone for bean soups. I can make a lot of meals out of ham.\r\rHamburger went to meatloaves that followed was sliced cold for sandwiches later and what ever was left went into red sauce for pasta.\r\rI tried to cook ten pounds of hamburger for sloppy joes made from scratch and taco meat made from scratch. It let me keep the sodium and sugar levels down.Sloppy joes also made sheppards pie while taco meat ranged from tacos to enchilidas, burritos,taco casserole and added to cheese to make dips.\r\rI made chili from hamburger(hubby does from sausage), it would make chili soup, then walking tacos, the Cinncy chili over pasta, then taco salad, or even nachos or a casserole with chili with corn bread baked on top, kind of like a tamale pie?\r\rPork chops,pork steaks, beef steaks etc wasn't on the table much. Couldn't afford the price with how much we needed to put on the table."},

They hold hands all the time.I just finished setting up the pantry in the basement in this house. Great to see what I don't have and need because I use all the time...and bad to see what I have an over abundance of and don't hardly use at all. So we started wondering if I bought stuff not knowing I had it because I didn't have a written inventory or because it was hidden in the small house under the bed,couch, love seat etc. More likely as we found out this weekend, it was given to us because we do eat it, we just don't eat as much as we are given.I know the kids will pass to us things that are considered healthy because they don't eat it and know we do.SO where does that leave me??? I have a wonderful and extremely varied pantry including over 100 herbs and spices. I have a good amount of meat even though it is low or out of chuck roast, pork butt roast,and Once again,I live out in the \"boonies\" according to my kids, love it love it love it. BUT you can't run thru the drive thrus of fast food(after reading they douce my hamburger with ammonia I don't think I want to anyways) and you can't have fast food or pizza deliveried. You have to cook or you beg your hubby to make popcorn in lard,bacon grease and drown it in real butter. That only works on the weekend when he isn't trying to pack his lunch from the leftovers of dinner.I also am looking at eating healthier foods. I eat natural foods mostly so will be planting a garden this spring (Square Foot Gardening is the way to go).My plan so far it is to use the pantry up so when the garden comes in there are empty shelves to put it on as I process it. AND to eat more whole grains, more veggies and fruit AND spend less money on food and non food."},

HA HAWe hold our dinner the Sunday before that way we don't conflict with non-custodial visitation,in laws or those in food service wanting to work the weekend after Thanksgiving Day.Why am I tell you this...because I have disappeared into the land of painting right before cooking dinner this coming Sunday. I call it remodeling because when ever I paint the old homestead it becomes a remodeling due to the repairs that have to be done before I can paint it.The kids voted last year and decided to move the dinner back to the old homestead( Sorry to my eldest and I wonder if she will do it again next yr) with the condition I get the house ready for the dinner, cook certain dishes and clean back up. NO biggie been there and had done that several years...what I didn't factor in was painting and installing new flooring and ceiling in the foyer that is 8 ft by 17 ft. A foyer that has an open curving staircase with a wall that goes up 20 ft. I have found that even years after a fire your house will still develop issues due to the fire. I have found by experience that I can put together our standard Tday dinner of over 100 dishes in 3 days. This year is only 61 dishes, 48 of them are mine to do and then the pies which last count was over 20 not touching other desserts and cakes. Can you tell we like to eat?

They didn't keep leftovers as it would spoil before morning in warm weather and when it cooled enough to keep it outside the critters would help themselves.Trash cans,or things we take for granted were not there.The only vegetables and fruit they ate was what they could grow and cold pack(waterbath) or find growing wild.When they moved to the last place there was room for several gardens, a chicken coop( an egg at breakfast was a daily celebration right along with the noodles they could make), 4 rooms and 2 coal stoves. A well on the place instead of going 100 yards(estimate he said) to get a couple buckets of water for what ever it was needed for.The only saddness that touched them when they moved was his mother( my grandmother) had just died in her 40's.They buried her on his 16th birthday, with his youngest sister only a couple yrs old.It was a extremely hard life that got harder when the Great Depression came.As I watched his face as he walked through those memories, saw the wisdom gathered and stored to get him through these times of stock market turning down and wiping out his retirement pretty good.Knowing that he is okay financially due to living that hard life.Seeing the food he has stocked up on to feed himself including the apples he was making into pies and dumplings for this winter...I understand even more that my attachment to the old ways and old days aren't just a whim or passing fancy but a tribute to those that went before me and survived an existence that none of us of this generation can really understand and some just can't comprehend.so this is for Dad and all those that walked in his shoes...Bless you for showing we can also survive if we use the wisdom that was gained before us.Blessed be"},

It wouldn't be unusually to end up with 4 meals if I make chicken and dumplings or chicken soup with the carcass.For around $5 per chicken that is around $1.66 per MEAL if I only make 3 meals out of one and $1.25 per MEAL  if I make 4.The other two smaller ones I cut up. I don't do a pretty job when I cut up a chicken but the pieces are recognizable.I ended up with 4 thighs which is 1 meal, 4 legs which will be a second meal,4 breasts which will be another 2 meals and I cut the wings in 3rds so the 2 larger parts will be wings for appetizer night( we eat them as a meal in a restaurant might as well at home) and the tips went in the dutch oven with the fat and backs along with an onion, 2 regular carrots and 2 stalks of celery and water.Popped in the oven to do it's thing to make broth which will convert to soup or dumplings.

The jumbo onion cost me $1, the 2 regular carrots costs me 20 cents total and the 2 stalks of celery costs me 30 cents total( yes I actually counted how many stalks and how many carrost there was and divided the cost out).SO for $1.50 I have the beginnings of another 2 meals.I make my own noodles but I know for around a dollar or so you can buy a bag of noodles..okay it might be $2 now days. Dumplings can be made with a can of biscuits( cheap and cut in fourths) for around $1.20 last time I bought biscuits.Figuring that as an estimate...for $1.75( or $2.75 for chicken and noodles and $1.95 for chicken dumplings for a meal ...that's a good deal.storm is rolling in so I must go...Blessed be"},

GOD took a day of rest so why do I think I have to work more than he did?As I write this it runs through my head I need to clean out the 3 refrigerators to make sure there is nothing that needs to go in the trash as it goes to the curb tonight.If I was being a good steward of my food there wouldn't be food going in the trash to begin with. I didn't do any baking yesterday so I need to make the granola bars for Hubby's lunch box today since he works tonight(his Monday.Monday wash day is my favorite especially when I can hang clothes on the line.Though tomorrow will be a late start as I have to go to the doctor's for a check up since I've been down sick to the point of pneumonia.Tuesday ironing day...been there done that.The best thing I can say now days if I absolutely must iron something it is going to be sprinkled with water and frozen for at least 20 min before I iron...makes it easier.Spent many years doing ironing for a living out of my home.Wednesday sewing day...hummmm...you mean you aren't suppose to wait until the laundry basket,box or trash bag you have it stored in doesn't explode all over the place before doing it?Thursday odd job day.I think Thursday has over ran ALL the other days of the week as this seems to be what side tracks me from doing what I should be doing instead...except laundry on Mondays.Friday cleaning day...sigh...I really liked it when I cleaned on Monday but that no longer works because of Hubby working 3rd without overtime so he is here by 7 am( Sunday night is his Monday) and wants to go to sleep.Midget house is too small for me to move around much without waking him up so Fridays is better I guess since he doesn't work Friday nights.Still I side track a lot with Thursday odd jobs.Saturday baking and bath day. The bath part is understandable LOL.Those that don't know, in the old days you carted water by bucket, heated it on the stove that was fired with wood(corn cobs, coal etc) and then dumped it in a metal tub that was what would be about the size of a good size round trash can cut in half.Took your bath (cleanest to dirtiest in same water) then dumped it out.Not something you cared to do every day.They did daily take what is fondly called sponge baths or sink baths...in other words \"WASHED UP\" using a pan of water( still heated on the stove) instead of the full bath. Baking was done on this day for the week. When the kids were little we went through a loaf of bread each meal.Take it back in time and I would have had to bake at least 21 loaves of bread a week if not more due to working more manual labor then we do now. Along with cakes, pies and cookies on Saturday.This would not be throwing a mix together or thawing out dough but making it and letting it rise( sometimes twice) before baking.It wasn't unusual when I was baking bread to bake 3 loaves with a sheet cake under them at the same time.Have a Blessed day"},

I have now placed it on my to do list for the first of next week when I get back into OH.so speaking of my pantry....I inventoried all of the drygoods...not refrig( never will as it changes way too often)and freezers are still on the to do list. BUT everything else is done. I put it on an excell( yes I broke down and figured out how to do it) and then broke down the categories to each \"sheet\" in the \"workbook\" NOW as long as I input what I buy and use daily ( or put what I use daily on a note to do on desk day) I won't ever have to wonder if I have something or need something and actually go look. I even did a need to buy sheet so I can stock up on what is missing with sales BUT NOT BUY what I already have.Each sheet says what the item is, wheither it is box,can good,jar or other container and where it is in the house or garage. THe reason I spent a week of several hours doing this..to use up what we have instead of buying more and then pitching something down the line because it's too old to eat.So I can actually find where I put that spare bottle of ketchup at LOL. So I NOT buying what we already have and not getting what we actually need AND FINALLY not having to buy anything except basic so the grocery money can actually go to pay on some bills that have popped up that we don't have enough in the budget to cover.LIKE...a bridge for my teeth because after 50 some yrs of having great teeth, I broke a molar into 4 pieces and had to have it pulled and now need a bridge that the ins will not cover completely.I am gratfeul they will cover part of it but really wonder if I didn't have ins if I could find a cheaper way to get the bridge.We won't mention that Christmas is a little more than 17 wks away.Have a great day.Blessed be"},

Store in an airtight container for up to two monthsBring meat to room temp. Lightly coat meat with a light oil (I use safflower or grape seed oil but canola would be fine) then rub dry rub in to meat. Allow at least 30 min for rub to set before cooking.Poultry Dry Rub (covers 3 Cornish Hens or 1 chicken, double for a turkey)By Chef Julia L Owings Personal Chef1/2 teaspoon sea salt2 tablespoons chili powder (I add a pinch or so of Ancho chili powder if I want a healthy kick)1 tablespoon sugar1 tablespoon ground cinnamon Place all ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine.If using on the grill or broiler WATCH like a hawk due to sugar burning and turning black."},

Steaks,beef or pork roasts,chops, poultry, possible lamb.We don't eat much lamb but I would try it in a heart beat. Marinate it or just dump it on  say about 30 min before you go to cook it. Seafood I would only marinate it 10 min the longest as the vinegar in it will \"cook\" it and you could end up with mush.Meat will absorb flavors better if you allow the meat to be room temp BEFORE applying the rub or marinade.I do more dry rubs and marinades in the late fall,winter,early spring.I want the kick of spices to get me thru the dreariness of the weather.In the summer time it is all about wet sauce or BBQ sauce. We like Bobby Flay's Chipotle-Molasses BBQ sauce.If I don't have any made up then we use what ever BBQ sauce I have in the pantry(depends on coupons and sales). I mix it one bottle of BBQ sauce with one bottle of dark beer or one bottle of BBQ sauce with 1/2 cup of Jack Daniels single barrel whiskey.( if I want a strong whiskey taste I use old #7).My mom made a great BBQ sauce and I plan to get it off her so we can try it in a week or so when I am back from babysitting kittie kitties.Enjoy the daythis is a wet Eagle. I got his pic thru an email forward from a friend.Today this is what I feel like. Just soaring along, doing what needs to be done and trying to keep food on the table and wham, it's a battle and I end up totally soaked, worn out and exhausted.Like the Eagle there is no vacation in sight. It's a fight everyday to survive.Someone needs to lend me their GPS so I can find a very tall tree to sun myself and dry off safely.I am sure though if my kids don't find me, my mother will and she will most likely tell me to quit hogging the limb."},

Still wake up in the middle of the night crying for her, over her, missing her bulk and warmth against me.She was my cuddler.I look inside my heart and know I placed hers above my own with letting her go.Each day the memories are a little( okay, very little but I was a widow so I understand the cycles of grief) easier to handle.Cookie our other dog was really struggling.She has always been part of the \"pack\" and being alone wasn't working for her.SOOOI went to the shelter and found Sam .He is 4-6 yrs old and a sheltie.He has a bum leg/shoulder but that is okay with us. I have CP and hubby has issues walking too, so he fits right in since Cookie has seizures.In some areas he slide right in, (didn't take long to remember where the treat cabinet is or when treats are given LOL).Other hand, he doesn't want to go out, I have to either carry him or take him by his collar even though we can tell he was an inside dog. Food is not safe left sitting anywhere he can get in including when I am carrying in the groceries( my other dogs never messed with the groceries)Lost steak this week.MY lesson learned.He is a couch potato or a recliner guy take your pick. He is friendly but not a cuddler and prefers the couch to sleep on.Hope everyone is having a good weekendBlessed Be"},

I watched her for 2 hrs crawl thru the house from the bedroom to the kitchen door to go out.Hubby carried her back in when he got home from work this morning.Her health had been deteratting as it was, potty accidents, ear infections one after another etc.We had already talked of letting her go the last time her legs gave out on her but she recovered with a limp but she did recover.This time she couldn't even stand after several hours. Those that know me, know Tashy (along with Cookie) are more like my four legged children than just a dog. Tashy spent a lot of time helping me get up when I could not stand, lent a shoulder for me to weep on, put up with me cuddling her even when she really wanted to be left alone to sleep.I get thru this day with memories along with the heart break. Of our last night together with her sleeping beside me with her head on my shoulder.Not something she usually did, that would have been her using my feet as a pillow and not tolerating me tossing and turning \"her Pillow\"Cookie who will be 10 on April 15th has seizures so we also know our time is limited and precious with her.I can picture Tashy now in heaven , and for the first time being able to run and jump like she could never do , not even as a puppy, in this life..Ten bucks says she still won't retrieve or fetch.Blessed Be Tashy I love you I always will love you and miss you"},

I ate 6( maybe more) before I got them in the sauce and then 5 more on my plate and then 3 more while ridding up the table and kitchen even after hubby took my plate away because I was making myself sick BUT made myself sick sick sick anyways and it was worth every bite.Reminded of the commerical of \"the best _______ I ever ate\" and Neely says he ate and he ate and he ate...yeah that was me. I snuck two out of freezer the next day and nuked them YUMMMMMM.Monday I had a procedure so I bought a fried chicken from Wal Mart for my lunch to go with the apple and unsweet tea I had. Good thing because the Hawaiian pulled pork in the crock pot was not done after 8 hrs like the recipe said it would be so we had the chicken for dinner also. Took the pork 11 hrs, made that note on the recipe because it was good pulled pork. I fixed it  this morning for sandwiches for my bfast and hubby's dinner ( he works 3rd so bfast is actually his dinner)cleaned up the kitchen, packages leftovers for the freezer, caught the laundry up, now it's time to loom until I leave for the doctor's to find out what is going on with this nasty cough I've had for 6 wks that comes and goes.I would like to take a deep breath WITHOUT hacking up the lungs when I do.until the next timeBlessed Be"},

{"title": "on deadline and still have to cook", "date": "Monday, February 8, 2010", "text": "I am on deadline on a revision of a fiction novel I wrote back in Nov. Now deadline is April 1st but I know me.Worse I know revision is 10 times harder than the first draft. I am also over due on finishing the afghans I made for Christmas last yr.The grandkids got theirs but I am still working on the adults. SO I am hauling butt trying to do that while working in GA.My group here in GA have gotten together to work out a program to help people adjust to having less money for groceries than they normally have.I went to Krogers and Walmart( as when you are broke you have to pretty much do one stop shopping) and priced out a weeks worth ( 7 bfast, 7 lunches and 7 dinners) for one person with only $20 for groceries for that week( paper goods and cleaning products not included).Krogers had better sales ( reality is you have to use the sales to do this) than Walmart and they also had a better choice of smaller items.( something I noticed between here and Sidney/Urbana OH area ).I came in at $19.58.Yes you have to cook and you have to plan ahead. You have to not waste, those veggies need washed before you peel them because you are going to make veggie broth with those peelings for a meal on down the line and that chicken carcuss( or just bones) are going to make broth also. That pinto bean soup is 3 meals so you have to portion it out so you don't eat 2 meals in one.I did compromise and buy Bisquick. You can make pancakes, biscuits , dumplings and pie crust .I would have bought flour, yeast,baking powder, baking soda, corn starch and cream of tartar instead to make bread and noodles etc but it wouldnt' fit in the $20.Still with everything I have going on, even though I am giving a \"food\" allowence while here in Ga. I cook in my motel room. Electric skillet and crock pot does just fine. I use my steel bowl for washing dishes etc. As I sit here I know that I have a pot of soup (canned broth from home, chicken from leftover rotissere chicken, diced carrot and celery , sliced mushrooms, a can of Italian flavored diced tomatoes and a can of black beans in the crock pot. A \"sandwich\" of Italian slipper bread( also made at home and brought) spread with pesto, sliced left over chicken, roasted red bellpeppers, provolone cheese and lettuce is waiting to be cut and ate.I also know the leftover soup will have rice added to half of it for the next round of soup. the other half will get ramen noodles broke up in it.so until the next timehave a great day,blessed be"},

{"title": "eating from the pantry", "date": "Thursday, January 28, 2010", "text": "I am worried...we ate mostly from the pantry.Did eat out a few times, examples like when son re-enlisted, my bday ..more of a celebration than \"oh I don't want to cook thing.\"I do have empty spots in the pantry and freezers. The two refrigerators are full but that is because the 3rd refrigerator died and I had to quickly shove condiments in to the other two.I guess I should first say that my groceries is food, non food( dog items, paper products, meds etc) and eating out including that cup of coffee at the gas station ...STILL we spent $786.02.That was AFTER the savings of $102.52.Hubby just shrugged and said \"you saved over 10 % and your goal was 5%...I'm more like \"have I lost my every loving mind!!!!\" Granted my fool proof savings plan was not in affect.Namely my youngest that can make you justify spending money on better t paper than the cheap stuff didn't go with me.I kept the receipts for the whole month to see what I bought and where I can cut because that is just way over the budget.Twice I bought non-food for a total of $488.67. Except for toilet paper we are set for the coming month. I make my own laundry soap for my HE washer.Have for over a yr and I use white vinegar for fabirc softener. Still buy cheap dryer sheets for when I use the dryer. Part of the reason I love 50 degree and warmer weather is I can use the clothes line.Give me a Monday morning that is decent and I am happy with hanging out the laundry...I side track. I made a list of what I bought and then removed what was really not needed and wouldn't affect our lives.Namely I elimated some of the dog treats...they get carrots now instead of a certain treat and I break biscuits, dentals etc in half so everything will last twice as long should cut that bill in half. I also have started using purple rags from http://www.flylady.net/ really thought I was going back wards there. I use one for windows and mirrors,one for bathroom and one for the kitchen cleaning , throwed them in the wash with throw rugs.I have noticed the paper towels that used to not last a week are now still hanging around for 3 wks or more. There is no lint on the mirrors and windows and I am a wash the windows weekly freak.In the old house I washed the windows inside and out every week since they tilt in. Eating out was $125.72 that included feeding our son.That is about double with our normal eating out.I have already planned a nice meal for Valentines day and our anniversary.  Foodwise was on budget..$293.15.I planned for $300 for the month.NOW add this in to that amt.I bought meat for Feb because it was on sale and it was just too good of a price to ignore. ( I did get it with youngest's blessing) That meat cost $111.65 OF the $293.15.Meaning I spent $181.50 for food for this month alone not including the eating out amt. non-food is definately on the radar to be cut down  best get back to the pasta sauce making and I roasted a turkey last night for dinner so I need to debone it and make broth from the carcuss .

Really.Even though she is my baby ( who is an adult that has worked full time, been laid off and buried one of her own children) she is my baby.We started going to the store together when she totaled her car. Funny how you learn things about your kids. Coupons are required and if you don't have any you get the lecture.If it's not on the list you don't buy it.You have to give her your list unless you have proven you can stay to the list...and on budget.( she prefers you to bring cash or a debit card)If you list buy 2 then you better have a really really good reason for buying 3 and just being on sale is NOT enough.name brand does NOT go in the cart unless there is NO store brand of that item.I told her that her dad didn't want the store brand fritos because they were greasy.She called him and told him to put them on paper towels, nuke in microwave for about 10 sec and then blot with another paper towel.Now if I am going to the store with her( she does have a car again) he will stop and do the \"chip shopping\" .LOLI drink coke classic in a plastic or glass bottle.Any soda pop in a can( or any Pepsi) will trigger my acid reflux and I prefer coke classic.Her answer was to not buy ANY. Hubby gets it with the chip run along with his Vernors ginger soda.It's not like we drink a 12 pk a week...maybe a 12 pk a month if that.Don't think of buying water unless she's tasted your water and agrees it is nasty.She doesn't buy paper plates( she is 25 yrs old with a family of 6), she washes dishes after every meal( no dishwasher).She doesn't buy paper napkins.( face cloths stand in line of napkins)She doesn't buy paper towels( will use them if given to her) has rags for that.She doesn't buy tissues,cheap toilet paper will do. If I hadn't been there ( hee hee) when she was born I would swear she wasn't mineHer brother ( okay he is my son SMILE) is single, not married and has not lived with anyone beyond barricks. He doesn't buy paper plates( I thought it was required of single guys),he doesn't buy paper napkins( uses cloth ones like his mom), doesn't buy paper towels often( when he has none he lays his cooked bacon on a cooling rack and lets the grease drip into a meat platter, then scraps the grease into a bowl for using to fry his eggs or potatoes in later), doesn't buy tissues BUT does buy a really good toilet paper because he doesn't want to blow his nose on cardboard.  I wonder where their habits came from. I used cloth napkins when they were growing up instead of paper napkins. Still do that most the time unless I get given paper napkins.I am still using up the paper napkins that someone gave me for Tday dinner. My kids blame my mother for me having paper napkins and paper towels.Yes I grew up with that right along with the box of tissues so I guess they blame her for that one also.BUT I make my own laundry soap, fabric softener, shower cleaner, use windshield fluid for window cleaner, baking soda for scouring powder, vinegar,baking soda, and boiling water to keep drains cleared,a damp rag to dust with ( furniture oil once a month)laundry soap to scrub the carpets and I have been known to take the bottom off the empty box of tissues and put a roll of good toilet paper in it with the cardboard tube removed beside my bed.I've also been known to add a scoop of coffee grounds to the old batch to make a second pot of coffee.BUT hey, I'm not as bad as Grandpa and do it until half the pot is actually grounds instead of coffee.Have a blessed day"},

{"title": "what I do in the kitchen", "date": "Wednesday, January 20, 2010", "text": "at one time or another I will hear about some comment my kids and grandkids will say about me....good, bad and the ugly.the kitchen ones usually make me laugh...best  dinner meals they had as kids...beef and veggie soup with home made bread.Beef and noodles over mashed potatoes and home made bread.Chicken( sometimes it was turkey) and noodles over mashed potatoes and home made bread.Home made chicken( sometimes turkey) noodle soup and home made bread.Pancakes or waffles for dinner. Let me tell you I wished I had a camara to take the picture of their faces when I told them these were the meals where I was scrapping the barrel to feed them and any of the half of dozen kids that was their friends that sat down to the table. I was a widow, worked for myself doing odd jobs so I could be home when the kids went to school and got home.I didn't get any kind of assistance.If I could get a turkey for the price of two whole chickens or less.I got the turkey. Beef for noodles and soup was from the beef roast I tried to have once every 4-6 wks when it would come on sale( still will do this if you watch the prices of it) Flour...noodles, home made bread,pancakes and waffles. Biggest lecture the kids will get is not keeping basic food in the house for this reason.If you have to chose between soda pop and flour and eggs, the flour and eggs had better win.I don't throw veggie or fruit peelings away( wash all fruits and veggies first including the skin of your onions) I put them in a gal. freezer bag and freeze them until I have a full bag and make broth with them.I home can my broths or freeze them, mostly can them since it keeps me from having to think about thawing it to begin with.I keep around 1 cup of potato water from boiling potatoes in the frig ( sometimes 2 if I know I am making gravy a couple times that week) for gravies.Helps thicken it.Bread and gravy will keep hunger awayI don't throw away bones of any kind until they have been simmered to remove any last bit of meat falls off and I have a decent broth. I've even had my kids ( including my son in law that tried to snatch his mother's turkey carcuss at Tday) give me poultry carcusses to make broth with. I usually give back half of what ever I get off it.Easy enough for me to deal with, throw it in the roaster, cover it with cold water and bring to a simmer.Let simmer until the meat falls off bone.Cool, remove bones, separate meat and then strain broth.Rumor is I'll have a heart attack if I see you throw your carcuss away... I usually stop that from happening before it gets to the trash can.I throw odds and ends of bread in freezer to make bread crumbs.I gather cracker curmbs,chip crumbs, cereal crumbs and stale tortilla chips also. We don't eat enough cookies but when the kids were little I kept those also to sprinkle over yogurt for snacksOdds and ends of pasta, rice etc goes into casseroles or soups.I'll make soup from anything, hobo soup( different cans of food), crisper drawer soup, leftover soup, there is nothing left in the house to eat soup LOL.I get meat marked down, cut it into the size I am going to use, trim it( trimmings go into broth making) and I try to get enough to pieces for stir fries since it doesn't take much meat for that.if the cupboards are bare, call mom is the motto I think my kids have.I've even had one ex son in law's girlfriend call me and ask what to fix with what was left in the cupboards that she thought was bare.He gave her my number. Funny how they seem to think the cupboard is bare when it's isn't yet there. No , they might not want to eat what is there but let's get with reality.Think Great Depression or pioneer days where what ever they had had to make it until the garden came on or they were able to get enough money to go to town that was 5 days away one way.Even with all this there are still times food will get away from me and I have to pitch it. I lecture myself worse than I lecture the kids.They think this is funny...that's okay, the grandkids will be up there in a couple years and start having their own families and I'll hear the very same words out of MY kids' mouths.Nothing like hearing your mother come out of your mouth SMILEBlessed be"},

For dinner we had left over potato soup that I added a can of corn to to make it into \"corn chowder\".We went to see our one son re-enlist, he's working on being a lifer, (that's 20 yrs military talk) and he is working on being a civilan working for the military for life also ( 30 yrs).We took him out to eat for lunch at the local chinese buffet.Costs us $35 with tip. I took it out of the $40 left from the grocery budget.Usually I would take it out of the entertainment budget  but there is ZERO in that budget this month.

Yesterday since I was sick, Hubby after working the night shift, got to take the youngest to get her wisdom teeth cut out( her hubby couldn't take her due to work), by time they drove 3 hrs to get there, spent 2 hrs getting them out and drove 3 hrs back, then hubby had to \"sit \" with her until her hubby got home from work.She bought us subs to eat when he got home.We lost the refrigerator in the garage the other day.Luckliy I caught it and got the stuff out of the freezer into the old deep freezer that is suppose to be going to my oldest daughter.I still have stuff in the refrigerator part but am focused on getting what is in the house used up so we can bring it in.Loading everything up with veggies so we don't lose them.Now if I can figure out what to do with all the cream cheese and sour cream.Have a blessed day."},

Just this month I covered all those expenses and I've only went once to the store.I shop for non-food once a month and major food shopping once a month also.ALSO what works for me is the calendar that Marla sells over at  www.flylady.net. I have used this several years now and my eldest is also using it for her family of 9.Since we are expecting 3-6 inches of snow tomorrow I am going to go look at the menu and make sure that food is in the house and not out in the garage freezer or frig.What works for you??Blessed Be"},

Everything from the pantry again.Just going to find a recipe for ginger sauce to use with it.I have chosen to NOT shove any leftovers in to the freezers. I think we could eat a month on those that have been shoved in the freezers right now.Meantime while fighting my own ear/sinus issues. Our older dog,Tashy, had to have a bruise drained on her ear and get ear drops due to her ear infection. Been nice if she would have been scratching or had stinky ears so I would have known she had an ear infection. She thinked her ear on something and the bruise didn't dissolve on it's own so the vet drained it.She goes back in a week to get stitches removed.we still don't have Hubby's truck back, been at mechanics since Oct 9th>hubby's 51st bday gift from his truck was the transmisson going out and having a area of rust( that wasn't seen without removing the bed or going under the truck) that was about to let his bed fall off. Sigh.Right now I am going back to making veggie broth from my peelings I've been saving in the freezer ( recipe from Gayle over at http://www.grocerycartchallenge.blogspot.com/) and checking what is next on my to do list.

She's good about making sure I stay on track with my groceries. They did buy us a frozen dinner for last night's supper since I was late getting back because we had to wait 2 hrs to get a prescrition for their daughter.Everything else came from the pantry. It did mess up the menu I made but I can redo that today.I did buy for most the month of produce.Most of that was root veggies and squash that will hold pretty much for the month when stored correctly.( I miss the root cellar)Meantime I am now on meds for the ear and sinus issue which is making me blurry eyed and sleepy.SO I am trying to get computer work done real fast LOL Blessed Be"},
{"title": "3rd pantry and stretching it", "date": "Sunday, January 3, 2010", "text": "This is the pantry cabinet or wardrobe depending on whom is talking . I store mostly oils and vinegars and extra drinks in the top and most of my home canned goods in the bottom. I can remember at one time having 1000 qrts and 500 pints of home canned food in my pantry besides anything else.Something I plan to get back to even if I have to buy it from the local farmers' market  This afternoon for lunch we had some Savorings mini bread bowl appetizers that was in the freezer, cheese stuffed mini sweet peppers and I made pot stickers. I sliced the torn wrappers to fry later to drop in soups. Used the extra filling from the peppers and the extra filling from the pot stickers to fill more wrappers to freeze for other meals. Probably got one meal if I don't serve anything else. I thought it's not just about eating out of the pantry. Even though we have plenty and aren't about to go hungry. It's about making the pantry last. my heritage showed that with making the garden feed the family until the garden produced enough to feed the family again. It's about not wasting the blessing of food ( YES BREN I DO LISTEN) when others go hungry or just simple starve to death. My way of thinking has people calling or emailing me asking what they can fix to eat when they \"think\" they have nothing right along with my kids doing it. Even though they tease me about stocking up, when times are hard they know we can put food on their tables in needed. OR better yet tell them how to take that flour and 2 eggs and make noodles to go with the potatoes they do have. Soup out of what ever veggies are in the frig or freezer along with some broth .  Now if I can get them in the habit of NOT throwing away their poultry carcuss, beef bones and veggie peelings so they can make broth  ...sigh... Blessed be"},
{"title": "Eat From the Pantry Challenge Day 2", "date": "Saturday, January 2, 2010", "text": "Day 2 of Eat From the Pantry challenge.We had leftovers from the pork tenderloin and roasted fresh pineapple so I diced it up to put in a stir fry later this week. We also had leftovers from the krat and pork so I shreddedthe pork into the bottom of my crock pot , layered the  krat over it, mixed up some homemade 1,000 Island dressing ( we don't use it so I mix it as needed) and  layered it over the krat and shoved it in the refrigerator for today's dinner. Today I will reheat that casserole in the crock and then layer swiss cheese over it.Haven't decided if we will put it over the left over mashed potatoes or on sub buns that are in the refrigerator.Bfast was on our own.lunch will be pot stickers and some other appetizers that in the freezers.Another day of eating from the pantry !!!!Next set of pictures of my pantry.This is the hall closet that is really meant to hold the bathroom towels and such. I turned it into my spice and herb closet. I have over 100 spices and herbs.Yes I use them. I used them BEFORE I became a Personal Chef.I have to organize this closet about every 2 wks otherwise it looks like these pictures. My house ins company just \"loved\" me when our house burnt( we are living in a small rental right now) and they had to replace each and every one of them. I will warn you to NOT store spice and herbs around heat sources, it's like a bomb when they catch fire( good example throw a bit( less than 1/2 tsp) of black pepper on your stove burner and watch it dance)"},

I grew up with stocking for the yr since most the food came from the garden we raised.I have pretty much kept this up most of my life.Only now days it's mostly boughten goods instead of my own canned food( dreaming of being back in country with full garden) I've not adjusted to the fact I can be at a grocery store in 10 min. I do buy most of everything when it is one sale. Canned veggies and canned fruit go down in price when it's their peak season. I only buy apples and bananas thru the winter and use the canned and frozen in off season times.This a first for me ...so my financial goals for this year are# 1 pay all bills on time( no late fees saves money and builds credit score)#2 increase my income. Hubby is holding at 40 hrs and that covers the household bills but leaves nothing for gas,food, meds, etc .Mine this last yr has been very low.#3 pay off at least 1/4th of the back debt.We didn't get in this mess over night, we can't get out of it over night either.I want to be debt free in 4 yrs and have the rental sold within 2 ( our tenants are going to try to buy it this yr)#4 rebuild savings.#5 Hold retirement fund steady.Happy New Year's Day. Day 1 of Eat From the Pantry Challenge bfast: eggs, bacon, home fries, toast, OJ lunch: grilled cheese with baby bell peppers, Italian wedding soup, water dinner: Krat with pork, Pork Tenderloin, and mashed potatoes.Ice Cream between snickerdoodle cookies, milk for me and coffee for hubby"},

Followed a couple blogs and decided this was my ticket for the new year.Check these sites out and read all about it.At Thanksgiving my kids were thunking me over how big my pantry is in this very small house, that I could feed them and their kids( not hardly as it would be 22 of them) and us for a year.Even though I got my \"stock- up\"( a nice way of saying pack rat of food) ways from my parents, they mentioned I should use up what is available. I grew up where the garden was the main source of veggies thru the year.So a years worth of food is what I am use to seeing and having. In these times , going to the store is now a habit I am trying to break and eat from my pantry.What didn't help was I told my oldest daughter I would give her my old freezer since it would be empty by Thanksgiving since I got a new one.I reloaded the freezer . Okay it was filled with veggie broth using the recipe Gayle Bryant published over at http://www.grocerycartchallenge.blogspot.com/ and turkey broth from all the turkeys we deep fried and roasted including the carcuss that was my older daughter's and the 2 hams I was given for Christmas from friends.I didn't have room for any of it in the new deep freezer or the freezers to the 3 refrigerators. I did say pack rat correct????SO my goals for Jan. is to#1 to not throw food away due to being too old, not ate or what ever reason I can make up#2 Only buy dairy and fresh produce for the month#3 only shop twice for food items#4 to clear out the old freezer to give to my daughter as promised# 5 to shop once for non food items( our biggest costs so far)I will start putting pics up of my pantry.Remember pack ratIf you are going to take this challenge go over to http://www.moneysavingmom.com/money_saving_mom/2009/12/eat-from-the-pantry-challenge-my-goals-and-plans-and-come-link-up-yours-too.htmland read all about it and link up with her.Blessed be"},

{"title": "thinking about being frugal", "date": "Tuesday, December 8, 2009", "text": "The winter holidays are upon us. Most of us are running around like we are chickens with no heads....sighOld man winter is giving us our first taste of the season here in OH.I can tell you this old body isn't ready at all BUT food wise I am ready.I did go to the store yesterday for fresh veggies which are all nice and cozy in my refrigerator after being cleaned and cut with the peelings in to a gal freezer bag that went into the freezer to make veggie broth later when I am baking cookies for the kids and grandkids later this week.I was asked what the hardest part of being frugal was...I would say that it would be time. Being frugal takes time. Our pioneers didn't have the time a lot of us think they did.If you think about what a woman did during the normal day of milking cows, churning butter, preparing 3 meals along with the bread, cookies,pies and cakes. cleaning without a vacuum. Dishes washed after every meal because they were the only ones. Fire for the fireplace and stove. grinding coffee beans by hand, dealing with the kids, schooling the kids, medical issues as they came about.Not talking of washing the laundry,by hand and drying it on a line outside or across furniture in teh house during the bad weather,making ALL the clothes etc....I could go on and on. Their dutch ovens was the forerunners of our crock pots.I still use my dutch oven when times get pushed. Frugal meals come out of it easily, a tough roast with root veggies. a soup or stew with or without dumplings. My kids,including the sons use the crock pot for the same things.some thing to think about as we run around this holidayBlessed be"},

{"title": "stocking up", "date": "Tuesday, November 17, 2009", "text": "stocking up, putting up, putting by....words that you are hearing quite often in this time.words I grew up with.I try to stock for the year. Yes I live with in driving distance to the store. Hubby can even stop on his way home from work if needed.I do it for several reasons.First, it's in my blood right along with gardening. I now live in the city, rent from a wonderful young lady who would not be happy to find me plowing her yard up. So I have already planned to do raised beds following the square foot gardening plan ( which I used in the country and would tell any one and every one to follow this plan). I always have something to process with a gardenI do home canning, dehydrating, oven slow roasting and freezing.Second reason... I get a sense of security from seeing the food on the shelves. I won't go hungry and I could feed my grown children and their children if needed. Not for the year I try to plan for for us but I could take us all a good few months.Third reason, if I am not in the store, I am not spending. Most of us go to the store for milk and bread and come back with a lot more items and a lot less money. When you are struggling to pay the basic necessities the groceries is where you can take the hit and still have a good meal to sit down to.Fourth reason, my kids and grandkids love getting home made food for Christmas or any time during the year.It is a gift of myself.enjoy your day...until next timeBlessed be"},

Also keeps the \"we spent last yr with your parents\" arguements down.If that wasn't enough, we bake 120 dozen( yes you read that correctly) cookies for the kids, not including candy, buckeyes etc. AND our one son volunteered us for 60 dozen cookies for Operation Thank You to send to the troops.
