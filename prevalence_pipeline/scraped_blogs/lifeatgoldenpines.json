And after more than a week of eating too much of all the wrong things, and sleeping a little later than usual, I'm feeling recharged, and okay, not so grouchy too. Back to work on Tuesday. ~Max~Speaking of eating. We celebrated Ree's 7th birthday on Christmas Eve. She was sent a package from \"Maria,\" her first owner and the person who loved her first (and still does). ~Birthday girl, Ree~Ree thought it was better than the half-box of baking soda she ate the week before.  I want to say thank you to each and every one of you who has visited my blog and taken the time to read, and comment on my posts. ~Lily~My continuing goal is to be a better blogger next year than I was this year. There is a lot of room for improvement!!~Marley~That includes finishing the posts that I start writing that never get published to my blog. ~Iva~And so, I’m looking forward to a lot of things hopefully improving next year. ~Daisy~And I wish you all a very Happy New Year and I hope that your 2024 will be a fantastic year for you and your families who are two and 4 legged!!"},

{"title": "An Unexpected Diagnosis", "date": "Sunday, December 17, 2023", "text": "A couple of weeks ago, I was off to the vet with Marley and Lily. Marley was just a simple recheck of an ugly ear infection that is mostly cleared up now. Lily has been with us for six months now, and so she was due for a 6 month senior-wellness visit. I'll confess to putting off this vet visit for Lily because she's a little high-strung, and because she was extremely nervous and anxious at her last visit in March. Which is why I thought it may help to have a calm companion like Marley along to reassure her. And it did - When Marley was taken out of the room, Lily's anxiety really showed until he returned. Poor Lily....With that, I have to say that I never expected anything else to come from this visit to the vet. Unfortunately, I was wrong.  The bloodwork was returned and Lily has been diagnosed with cancer, specifically leukemia. This was totally unexpected, and we are sad and heartbroken by this diagnosis. There is treatment that Lily could receive for leukemia. But her general health, and her age (she's 13 years old) and any treatment if it were totally effective, would only prolong Lily's life by about a year. Since Lily is a 'foster dog' the Medical Coordinator and I talked through all the options and her vet's recommendations. And the Board of the Rescue discussed it as well and voted on Lily's care going forward. It has been decided that Lily will not receive chemotherapy, but rather palliative care, including seeing the holistic vet to keep her comfortable for as long as possible. ~Lily left and Marley off to the vet~Of course who would provide Lily's care was never a question. I am grateful for the trust that the rescue has in us to continue to care for Lily, and make this last chapter of her life one full of love, good care, and fun too. \"Comfort\" is of course also a big part of this last chapter for Lily. Lily being comfortable while she's resting has been changing the last month or so. This is because Lily has several very large lipomas. So, thanks to \"Jean B\" I bought Lily a new bed that better supports those key pressure points that the lipomas are pressing on.   **lipomas are benign (noncancerous) tumors of fat that can grow anywhere on the dog's body, even inside their abdomen.** ~Lily totally comfy on her new dog bed~Lily seems much more comfortable on her new bed. And we are of course thankful for that and are hoping for many good days of grace with our high spirited and fun, flaky girl. ❤On a different note about Iva:Thank you all for cheering Iva on as our search continues for her forever home. And I'm going to add a huge and very big thank you to \"Gemma's person, Beth\" who commented on my last post that she'd love to be considered for Iva -- Unfortunately, as you thought, the Golden Retriever Rescue that we foster for does not allow for adoptions out of the service area that centers on the Baltimore and DC beltways and surrounding areas of Virginia and Maryland. Beth, I'm so thankful and grateful for your interest and willingness to open your heart and home to Iva. ❤❤"},
{"title": "Full Speed Ahead! ", "date": "Sunday, December 10, 2023", "text": "Here we are in December.... Already. Another busy week is in our history book. As I mentioned in my last post, there has been a lot of focus on Iva lately. She remains available for adoption via the rescue. But  there hasn't been a lot of interest in her. One reason is probably her age. Another is that her needs are specific. But after all these years, I know that sometimes the home that doesn't look perfect from the outside, is perfect on the inside. ~Iva in late October~Keeping that in mind, I'd gotten a call from a couple living in \"King George\" Virginia, just over 2 hours from me. I liked them, and even though some things in their home visit report made them not a fit for Iva, I was willing to meet them. And I thought that Iva's best chance would be to take her to them, to see if they were a fit after all.  Okay, so you may be wondering, why they were not a fit on paper... It was that they have steps - Iva's broken shoulder before she came into the rescue means that she has limited range of motion and she has difficulty going up stairs, and can't control her speed coming down them. Thinking ahead, her size also makes going up and down stairs difficult if she were to reinjure her shoulder again. ~Road trip for me and Iva~So we were off on Sunday for a road-trip. I've never been to King George Virginia, and many people here in northern Virginia, have never heard of it. It is a quiet rural town east of Fredericksburg (Virginia) and let me tell you, it's way the heck out there. ~Way the heck out there in King George VAWe found our way with only a few wrong turns. \"King George Couple\" were nice and welcoming. They are two people with big hearts and really do want to make a difference for senior dogs. And they are totally devoted to the 2 very senior Labs that they have. But as their home visit report said, they had very slippery laminate floors that Iva kept slipping on and the inside stairs were steep and Iva slid down them both times we had her do them. And then their 2 Labs were both not the fun and active companions that Iva really needs. There were a few other things that I won't mention because it'll seem a bit trivial and maybe I was being too critical and unfair... But I knew leaving their home, they were not a match for Iva. However, I decided to think about it for a few days, thinking that maybe the cosmos would tell me something different when the dust settled on a 4 hour road trip. Well, it didn't. The memory of her sliding down their steps and my having to practically catch her before she ran into the wall stayed fresh in my mind. So, I let them know. And onward the search goes for Iva and for King George couple too."},
{"title": "Abridged Version of Happenings ", "date": "Saturday, November 25, 2023", "text": "Hello Blogging Friends! Thank you to those who checked in on us to make sure we're 'okay.' In short, I will tell you that we are. From family, to work and my volunteer role with both the rescues and of course the dogs, I'm just being pulled in a lot of different directions right now with very little time to myself. ~Milo~But now that I can check Thanksgiving off my list, not forgetting that there is so much to be grateful for, I'm onto the next thing I need to do. And among a couple of other things, at the top of my list is catching my blog up and catching up with your blogs and news too.  I do have to admit, that these past few days, I have been trying to write a post - The words are coming, but I'm afraid that as always, it is a bit too wordy for what you may have time to read, and for what I know will probably bore you to death. So, I'll TRY TRY TRY to do an abridged version to get caught up. Marley .....  He's much better. His arthritis has been bothering him. He's had a couple of visits to the vet for both his achy joints, and his infected ears. He came to us with double ear infections that had been superficially treated, and both needed more attention -- More attention than the first vet that saw him was willing to provide. But Marley saw a new vet that I liked very much because she listened to my concerns, and treated Marley like more than just an 'old foster dog.' ~Marley~Lily ..... You'll remember that she's a howler when she's left. But her howling seemed to have gone up a notch or two, sounding almost painful. She tagged along with Marley back to the vet for a 6-month check up. The same vet that sees Marley is now treating Lily too. We have a good plan for her going forward, and she's also on a daily anti-inflammatory medication which has helped, and we're seeing a much happier and even more engaging Lily. ~Lily (front) and Marley her date for the vet~Iva ..... There has been a lot of attention on her. One morning Iva was in obvious pain and was whining and hiding in a corner, and didn't want to get up onto her feet. I 'triaged' her, and found that the pain she was feeling was in her shoulder - The one she'd dislocated prior to coming into the rescue. I'm not sure what or how it happened. It was early, so I didn't call the vet, but just got her into my van and took her there. They admitted her, and I was off to work - What a morning! Before lunch, a vet called and said it was a soft tissue injury and he thought that with some rest and medications, she'd be fine, and she has been. ~Iva~In other news ..... Todd ..... He's reached a bit of a milestone of 250 days since he last had an allergy attack. Knock, knock, knock on wood - He coughed a few times last evening, so I'm hoping it was just because he was outside most of the day. Work ..... I'm responsible again for our office holiday party. We are an office of about 10 people, so I enjoy planning it, and I have for the last 5 or 6 years - I'll add here that I do it because no one else wants to. I worked a recent Friday for a co-worker who was traveling to Kaaba in Saudi Arabia. I arrived at the office before everyone else. That never happens! ~Work on a Friday - Where is everyone?~Me .... It actually hasn't been all work, stress, dogs and no play. One Saturday my friends that I went to the beach with did a 'scooter tour,' in Lancaster Pennsylvania. It was a fun 4 hour trip on Vespa type scooters on a beautiful day on the backroads seeing Amish farms and a few other sights. My friends had all gone before, and were comfortable on a scooter going about 40 MPH -- as for me, well, it took me a couple of hours, but it was great fun!Oh, and as for the rest of the gang, they're all in good spirits as the holidays rush right at us! Milo in the video below seems totally relaxed about it. I need to follow his example! 🥰THANK YOU again for stopping by and checking in on us while I was away. You all are the best and I've missed my blogging friends!!"},
{"title": "A Girls Beach Weekend ", "date": "Friday, October 13, 2023", "text": "Yes, I have really been missing in action. A week ago today, I was starting my day watching the sunrise over the ocean. Seeing the day begin made me even more grateful for a kind friend who invited 7 of us for a *girls weekend* at her beautiful beach house in the Outer Banks of North Carolina.The house (with its 8 bedrooms and 7 baths) is rented throughout the summer, but our friend and her husband make it their home from September to about May. So many homes like this are solely rental properties. So, how nice for them that they get to enjoy this beautiful and comfortable home with its ocean views, and how nice that we got to enjoy it too.We were treated to the best of weather, and a trip to nearby Cape Hatteras to see the lighthouse that was given its famous black and white stripe daymark pattern in 1873. The Lighthouse Board assigned each lighthouse a distinctive paint pattern (daymark) and light sequence (nightmark) to allow mariners to recognize it from all others during the day and night as they sailed along the coast. (Who knew?) On another day we went to Rodanthe Pier to enjoy yet another ocean view. The weather was calling for clouds and rain, that certainly was not what we had. `Honestly, I just couldn't get enough of the ocean views. I took so many pictures with both my phone and camera.  The weekend was truly a whirlwind of fun. There was plenty of great food, great conversations and being spent with friends, it could not have been any better, even if it had rained. But I'm glad that it didn't! **Photo below is our last night - dinner and a show watching the kite-surfers at sunset on Pamlico Sound. Finally .... Leaving Hatteras Island. This is why in a hurricane the island gets cut off, because the ocean is on the other side of the dunes. You can even see in one photo where a wave or two came over the top. The dogs were all in good spirits when I got home. But I was so tired and was glad that I took an extra couple of days vacation to rest up from this little vacation."},
{"title": "The Weekends ", "date": "Sunday, October 1, 2023", "text": "Last weekend, Ophelia, a tropical depression impacted parts of the mid-Atlantic after its landfall early Saturday with heavy rain, strong winds and even some flooding. It put a bit of a damper on the annual Oktoberfest that the town that I live in has every year. Ophelia delivered about 3 inches of rain for us. The clouds stayed around through the week, but we didn't get much more rain and we're still in a drought and short about 10 inches of rain. I was off to the vet again with Iva to have her ears rechecked. The infection has cleared up pretty well, but not enough for the vet. So, Iva's ears were cleaned and 'reinfused' again with an antibiotic. Another recheck in 3 more weeks. We did get some good news, in that Iva has lost about 6 pounds since her last vet visit. Her diet of canned pumpkin, green beans, and a little bit of dry food is doing the trick. The vet was very happy with that, although I can't help but joke and hope that she didn't have a foot off the scale. 😊I've not mentioned Todd much because I'll admit to being a little bit superstitious and I don't want to jinx anything. But he's had a couple of bumpy days this past week because he's been spending more time outside and he has loved every minute of it. However, I should have known better than to let him stay outdoors for hours at a time, because its triggered his allergies a bit, and he's had short bouts of sneezing and coughing - But thankfully it has been nothing like it was in the spring with his having a totally clogged up nose -- knock, knock, knock on wood that it stays that way."},
{"title": "The Three Fosters ", "date": "Sunday, September 17, 2023", "text": "Two vet visits were on the schedule this past week. The first one was for Iva for a thyroid recheck. I'll admit to being a bit nervous about this because this appointment would also involve her being weighed. I was feeling pretty guilty because I had kind of fallen off the weight-loss wagon with Iva this summer and now it was time to face the scale.  The news wasn't too bad, Iva has lost 2 pounds over the summer. And now I've gotten a renewed focus and determination to get her back on her journey to lose weight. ~Iva~The second visit was to the ophthalmologist with Marley. The drive there takes just more than an hour, and just as we did the first time, we got there in plenty of time, even though I left a little later.Its easy for me to see that Marley's eyes are not nearly as red or 'goopy' as they were initially. But it's good to have the Vet look at them to agree and make it official. Thanks to the medication, he's producing some tears in both eyes - His left more than the right. It's slow progress, KCS or dry eye didn't happen all at once, it's a chronic issue - But Marley will have another recheck in 3 months, that I'm hopeful will be even better news for him. ~Marley waiting for the ophthalmologist~Since we have 3 foster dogs for the rescue, it didn't seem right to not somehow included Lily in the weeks events. That was actually easy - I was reminded that Lily had a birthday. She was turning 12, so at the end of the week, we got to celebrate.  ~Birthday girl, Lily - now 12 years old! ~I bought a cookie that was of course shared with the other dogs. Lily, being Lily didn't mind sharing.~Lily: Is that for me?!~It's an honor to have gotten to know Lily these past 5 months and celebrate her 12th birthday. Her sweet, gentle nature and so many more things remind me every day how lucky we are to have the chance to share our lives with Lily. ❤"},
{"title": "Keeping the Routine ", "date": "Thursday, September 7, 2023", "text": "While Carl is visiting family in Wisconsin, I've been playing the role of single-dog-cat parent for the last week. Its gone pretty well. Everyone is present and accounted for, which is a good thing! As I mentioned in a previous post, the dogs always expect a game of ball every evening. I decided that with Carl gone, I would try and keep the routine the best I could. So, on the first night we played a game of ball. Here's a couple of photos of that first night ....~Todd, wondering why am I playing ball with them?~Below Ree and Milo are looking at a ball on the other side of the fence trying to solve the problem of getting it on the side we were on.  I'll add that it was a pretty good throw using the \"Chuckit\" ball launcher from the back porch -- It went over the fence, hit the barn, and landed on the fence rail. I couldn't do that again if I tried! ~Milo and Ree - the ball is there, how do we get it over here?~Then yet another photo where I chucked another ball over the fence and it was gone completely. But I know they'll find it when we take a walk. They always do, especially Milo. ~Iva - Where'd the ball go?~With the heat, of course I didn't let the game go on for too long. Out of the 7 tennis balls we started with, we ended with 5. Do you think that included the 3 balls Jack had?  ~Jack never has been good at sharing 🙂~Thanks for stopping by - I hope you're having a good week, and staying cool!"},
{"title": "Summer's Last Hurrah ", "date": "Tuesday, September 5, 2023", "text": "Labor Day Weekend has now passed-- Summer's unofficial end. It has been a busy summer, and we end it in a pretty good place.Todd has had a pretty good summer. The issues with his sinus appears to be well managed with Zyrtec and the Chinese herbs. That was certainly not the case last summer.  So as we cruise into the fall, all paws are crossed that he doesn't have any flare-ups as the blooms of summer fade and the dust mites that he's supposedly allergic to get stirred into the fall air. And since I mentioned summer blooms, we made a trip to Pennsylvania to see the sunflowers.  This field in Chambersburg is absolutely huge, spanning a vast number of acres and filling the field for nearly as far as you can see. I’ve visited several sunflower fields and this is far and away the largest I’ve personally seen. Wow!! Most of the fields don't allow you to bring your dogs, but this one did, and so we took Milo with us. He didn't really care about the sunflowers, but he really loved all the smells and the people he got to meet.It was a really hot morning, but despite the sweltering heat, there is no place like a field of sunflowers."},
{"title": "Me, Iva and the Cosmos ", "date": "Saturday, September 2, 2023", "text": "Weekends have been busy for us. A recent Saturday was spent taking Iva to meet a perspective family that had applied specifically to adopt her. The rescue that I foster for requires home visits, and their home visit didn't exactly paint a glowing picture of them for several reasons. With that, and their living more than a 2 hours drive from us, it left me reluctant to even consider them. But I decided to give them a chance. With my brother in tow, we met halfway in the town of Culpeper Virginia. Family of Four, was a retired Dad who is home most of the time, Mom was still working, and they have a 10 year old and college age daughters - And a Golden Retriever named Pockets that like Iva, was about 8 years old. We had several things in common and being a big believer in cosmic forces, I thought maybe the cosmos was bringing us together. I found myself liking them for those reasons and as we chatted, in my mind I was putting together just how this could maybe work. The visit wasn't exactly perfect. Working Mom was a little critical of a few things about Iva - which made me a little critical of them - And when Working Mom kept examining Iva's coat, specifically around her tail and neck - I knew what she was looking for, and I blurted out that \"Iva doesn't have fleas.\" Working Mom seemed a bit embarrassed, and stopped what she was doing. ~Iva~Despite that and a few other things, as you can probably tell, I wasn't sure about them. But I was really trying to hang onto what the cosmos must have been trying to tell me; that they were the family for Iva -- It helped that Iva seemed to like School Age Girl, and I thought that she seemed okay with Retired Dad and their dog Pockets. Family of Four pushed me on making my decision right then, but I promised them I'd get back to them in a few days - School Age Girl told me that after our visit they were going to go buy toys for Iva. ~The Wind in Iva's Face, on our way home ~On our way home, I tormented my brother with all my thoughts and I just hoped that I'd have some clarity on the whole thing. And sure enough, it came from Retired Dad in a text message BEFORE we even got home. It said:Hello Kim,  Iva is a real sweetheart.  We enjoyed meeting her.But we think she may not fit into our family.  We are concerned about her age and longevity.  We couldn't handle losing a family member like her for a long time. Thank you for introducing her to us, I'm sorry it didn't work out.ChrisWhat??!! Well, okay, whatever, and thank-you cosmos for giving me the answer I needed. But can I add what a ridiculous reason this was? Only because Iva's age is of course mentioned in her write up, so it was and is no secret that she's 8 years old. And anyone who makes an issue about not wanting to adopt a dog because of their age, never scores any 'points' with me. But it doesn't end there. I missed a call from Working Mom whose voicemail said that they'd changed their minds, and were again interested in adopting Iva. If age was an issue, Iva was then 3 days older, so what changed? I'll never know, because I didn't call them back. And I'm not going to. A friend said that things in the cosmos can sometimes backfire. I think that's what it did this time. But I'm still a believer in those cosmic forces. And what could be a better reminder of that than this weeks last super blue moon until 2037. ~The Super Blue Moon over our house~"},

He never moves from that spot, and that hopeful look of anticipation on his face never changes. He's now about 14 years old, and arthritis has really slowed him down. Except when it comes to games of ball, Jack still wants to play like he's a puppy again. Of course we don't let him play like one, but he doesn't care, he just loves the game, however long it lasts. That's what it's all about.  How I love that Lab heart and spirit!! That's what's happening on the outside. Inside, on the other side of the door, there's something else going on. It's Todd, waiting by the door for his turn to be let outside to play ball too. Who knew that a Scottish Terrier could be so patient? I think it's about the only time he is."},
{"title": "Marley - Part of the Pack", "date": "Wednesday, August 16, 2023", "text": "It has been a bit of a whirlwind since Marley arrived at Golden Pines. Since Marley had not seen a vet in at least 5 years, our time with him began with a needed vet appointment that included updating his vaccines, all senior bloodwork, aspirates from several large lumps, and a few other tests in between. The results were a bit of a mixed bag. The good news, was that Marley was negative for heartworm and other tests had pretty good results too. Unfortunately he did test positive for lyme disease and anaplasmosis -- Both are tick borne illnesses. Marley is now on an antibiotic for a month. Another concern I had from the very start were Marley's eyes that were really goopy and very red. The vet records that came with Marley mentioned this as a chronic issue that was never treated. A test showed that he's not producing any tears, meaning his eyes are very dry. The vet gave me a lubricant for them, but unfortunately it didn't really help. I was also pretty sure in watching Marley that couldn't see that well. So, on Monday we were off to the ophthalmologist. Marley's chronic dry eyes has caused a lot of scar tissue that has damaged his eyes, and unfortunately it limits his eyesight. So, we've started a prescription eye medication that he will have to be on for the rest of his life. The good news is that it will help his eyes to feel better, and may in time, restore some of his lost vision. ~A tired Marley on the way home from the Ophthalmologist~Despite that Marley probably doesn't feel all that well, he is the quintessential Golden Retriever! He is easy going, and has let us know that he thinks that treats and mealtime are the best part of the day -- And I think best of all is that he gets along really well with his new packmates.  Always a relief!  ~On the front porch~We're grateful that Marley found his way to the rescue and onto us. He quickly found a place in our hearts and we love having him as part of our life! ~Milo and Marley~And I'm also grateful that he's getting the medical care that he needs because I know it will make a difference for him."},
{"title": "A Rescue Story ", "date": "Sunday, July 30, 2023", "text": "You may recall that on Thursday's I take the calls for Lab Rescue, from the 'owner give up line.' A few weeks ago I got a call from a Realtor who had come upon 2 Labs being kept outside in a 5 x 8 pen. He described the conditions as deplorable, and used similar words to describe their owner. With the heat, Mr. Realtor felt that it was a dire situation for the pair, and he asked the owner to give the two dogs, named Gunnar and Lucy to him. Of course he wouldn't. Money talks. Mr. Realtor ended up buying the pair from him - For how much, I've no idea. ~Lucy~Mr. Realtor immediately took them to his vet, and they were given check ups, bathed, nails trimmed, and appropriate vaccines were given ... It was also discovered that Lucy was expecting puppies in a couple of weeks. Not sure of what to do next, Mr. Realtor called Lab Rescue - And I returned his call. ~Gunnar~**I will add here that my role in answering 'the owner give up line,' is return all calls and to decide if Lab Rescue is right for a particular dog -- I get photos and ask about 2 pages worth of questions covering everything from favorite treats to last vet visit. All that information is put into a report that I send to a coordinator who gathers any vet records, and arranges boarding with vets offices and other coordinators for the dogs to come in to the rescue. I tell the owners it may take 4-6 weeks. Dogs in shelters have priority over dogs being given up from owners. ~Gunnar, left and Lucy on the right~But, back to my story .... I explained to Mr. Realtor what my volunteer role was. I told him that my coordinator was out of town, and a weekend was coming up, and even though I knew boarding space was a premium, I would do my best and add an 'urgent' to my report. Which I did do - I sent everything to the medical and foster home coordinators that typically don't work on the weekends. Meanwhile,  Mr. Realtor assured me that he could manage having Gunnar and Lucy at his home, where he has a cattle dog, a geriatric German Shepherd, and a Lab mix. At first, Mr. Realtor seemed to have everything under control. The text messages were positive, and I was optimistic that time was on our side. Mr. Realtor even sent me a video of the pair. But unfortunately Mr. Realtor quickly realized he was in over his head because his dogs were not accepting of Gunnar and Lucy. He told me he thought he could keep them all separated and safe. I'm still not sure if or how he did it. All I know is that I got the below text on Sunday afternoon. I'll admit I had a moment of panic thinking about 2 dogs coming to our house - And one of them expecting puppies - It sent this whole situation to a whole other level. I was able to talk Mr. Realtor through everything and calm his worries and concerns because I knew behind the scenes it was already being worked on. Thankfully on Monday, the coordinator was able to arrange for Gunnar to be both boarded and neutered, and she found a foster home for him too. The Foster Home Coordinator also found a foster home for Lucy - one that specifically takes expectant Mom's and their puppies. The pieces truly all came together. I could not have been happier or more relieved. And it was just in time. Lucy arrived at her foster home on Tuesday and on Friday she gave birth to 9 puppies. It was a very rough labor for Lucy and three pups were stillborn - she finished having her little ones at vets office because she was having such a hard time. We are all sad that 3 little ones were lost. But the thought of Lucy giving birth outside in the heat, and needing vet care during the delivery would have probably meant more would not have survived. Perhaps not even Lucy.  But thankfully and gratefully, Lucy has six healthy puppies and I'm told that she is being a great mom!  And Gunnar has already found a new forever home too.  Eight lives have been saved. ❤"},
{"title": "Marley Arrives at Golden Pines ", "date": "Sunday, July 16, 2023", "text": "Another busy weekend as today we welcomed a nearly 12 year old boy, named Marley to Golden Pines. Marley comes to us via the Golden Retriever Rescue. Marley belonged to a grown son, but unfortunately after returning home (which, I'm told is a story in itself) a younger brother found himself allergic to Marley. Sometimes, as sad as it may be for a family to surrender their dog, their coming into a rescue can be a good thing for the dog. Marley's future was uncertain. For 5 years, he'd not seen a vet. And, as sad as I'm told it was for the son to say good bye to Marley, this last part of his life can and will be one where he's able to have the care and comfort that he should have at his respectable age. ~Exploring the yard~Marley has met most of his new packmates easily. ~Sharing a moment with Iva~Intros to Todd and to Jack will come later. Marley only gets one chance to meet them both, and when it goes smoothly that usually guarantees that there won't be any problems between them. So, I always take it very, very slow - Probably too slow, but it's just how I do things. -Welcome Marley - We're glad that you're here!And we look forward to the chance to get to know you and love you too!**A postscript to Carol (aka Coppa's Girl) -- I'm so sorry to read that you had return Amber to the rescue, and perhaps a 2nd one as well.

But that's all okay. The dogs are in good spirits. ~Milo with Lily in the background~Todd returned to Wholistic Vet for a follow up visit last week. He has had a few 'attacks' where breathing seemed a bit difficult for him -- But unlike it has been previously where his sinus is clogged and breathing is difficult for hours, any snorting, sneezing or coughing has lasted only for moments and is maybe occurring once or twice during the week. knock, knock, knock on wood that it stays that way.~Waiting for Wholistic Vet~But this makes me and Wholistic Vet really optimistic and so we'll continue both the tincture and the Chinese herbs as I note that it was almost exactly a year ago the problems with Todd's sinus began. ~On the way home - A good once-over wears a Scottie out!~Our foster girl Iva is now available for adoption via the Golden Retriever Rescue. We've had a few calls, but no one that I think is a fit for her. Some of Iva's needs are specific, and I think are important for her to have. One is her having a fun companion like Milo, to play with. And Iva requires a home with very few steps. Iva had a broken shoulder previously to coming into the rescue, and this old injury has left her with limited range of motion. She can manage a few stairs, but looses momentum on bigger flights. We'll see where all this takes this fun and energetic girl that we are very fond of. ❤Finally, I'll also add these collages I did of Iva for the rescue - Seeing her every day, it can be hard to really notice her changes, until I put photos of her now, next to older ones. What a difference! ~Iva - On the left, the day we met her in November  - On the right, taken June 30th ~Below, Iva in June and early March"},
{"title": "One Thing I Did ", "date": "Sunday, June 18, 2023", "text": "Todd has certainly been in the spotlight at our house lately, and I remain optimistic and hopeful about the direction and treatment I've chosen for him. Unfortunately we won't know if the Chinese herb and tincture is working until it doesn't. Time will tell. In between vet visits and work, I carved out time to do a few other things. One thing I did in May was to go to Lancaster Pennsylvania. My long time friend, Sid lives there, and I've not seen her since before the pandemic. We became instant friends years ago when she was also a president of the neighboring Golden Retriever Rescue. She's now housebound and unable to drive, so it was good to spend the day with my friend. I stayed in Lancaster for a couple of days and since I can't stay with  my friend, I stayed in the nearby town of Intercourse (yes, that it's real name) in a popular spot called Kitchen Kettle Village. It's a walkable village of local crafts, quilters, and all other kinds of shops. My favorites are always the 'foodie shops.' Can you tell why? 😊But I stayed in one of the Inn's in the Kitchen Kettle Village, that was above one of the shops. With no elevator access to my room, the steps helped to ease any guilt I may have felt when I indulged  in the local fare. While there, I made time to go to a favorite local nursery for this year's bedding plants and a few vegetables too. Black Creek Greenhouse is truly one of the best in the area. I ended my trip to Lancaster with another longtime friend at an all women's conference in downtown Lancaster. ~Roof-top parking gives a great view~It was a much needed break for me. ~Daisy~But no matter what, it's always good to get home!~Ree, Jack and Milo~"},
{"title": "Wholistic Vet ", "date": "Saturday, June 10, 2023", "text": "Well, with Todd now having seen an Internist for a rhinoscopy, and an Allergist, for allergy testing and our vet who has been a big help managing Todd's symptoms, it was time to try one more thing. And that was to see our holistic vet. I called on Monday, and they happened to have an opening on Thursday. It has been a couple of years since I have taken one of my dogs to see \"Wholistic Vet\" and I'm reminded why I think she and her husband (who runs the office) are among the best -- They are both kind, caring and compassionate and so many other things. They've always taken great care of  our dogs and me too. ~An anxious Todd waiting for Wholistic Vet~Wholistic Vet asked a lot of questions, and she thought that Todd seeing the specialists was needed because having those results helps to know what the health of his sinuses are, and what he's sensitive to. Wholistic Vet is right of course - and by the way, she agreed about not putting Todd on Apoquel. After nearly an hour discussion and a thorough exam (more time than I spent with the Internist or Allergist)  Wholistic Vet is recommending one Chinese herb and a special tincture that she made for Todd. She told me that allergies can be hard to treat sometimes, but she has a few other things for us to try if the herb and tincture don't work. But we'll start with these two things first and see where it takes us. We have a follow up appointment in July. For the first time, I feel like my concerns, thoughts and questions have been heard and answered. Even if the herbs and holistic treatment doesn't work for Todd, I'm grateful that we have the chance to find out if it will or not. ~Home and relaxing on the porch~"},
{"title": "The Results Are In", "date": "Friday, June 9, 2023", "text": "Todd's allergy test results came last Friday via e-mail .... Drumroll please ..... Out of the 80+ things that the Heska test, tests for, Todd is allergic to only two -- Dust-mites and Ragweed..... Below are the results - click on the photo to see what the test tests for. And there you have it. The Allergist is recommending that Todd continues taking Apoquel. So, where does that take us?  To start, thank you all for sharing your experiences and thoughts about Apoquel -- I could not agree with you more. But I feel like Apoquel has its place and there are dogs that despite its side effects, definitely benefit from its use because it's the one thing that improves their quality of life. Quality of life is what it's all about.But Apoquel is not an antihistamine, and given that Todd's issue is with his sinus, I think that Todd needs an antihistamine and something a bit stronger than the Zyrtec that he takes daily. When I (again) mentioned to the Allergist my thoughts and concerns about giving Todd Apoquel, I could feel the eye rolls in my questioning the treatment plan and asking for another medication. After a couple of e-mail exchanges, the Allergist suggested more tests or return to the Internist who sent me to them in the first place. In the end, it left me feeling discouraged and with no plan or direction. But when I got over feeling defeated, I made one more call to another specialist. I'll tell you about that in my next post. Suffice it to say, I am feeling hopeful. ❤***On a totally different topic, CONGRATULATIONS to Carol (aka Coppa's Girl) on the newest addition to her family, named Amber. I hope it's all going well as you get to know one another, and she settles into a new life that I know will be filled with nothing but the best days, making the best new memories! ❤❤"},
{"title": "The Appointment ", "date": "Monday, May 29, 2023", "text": "After waiting more than 2 months, Friday, May 26th finally got here. It was the day of Todd's long awaited appointment with the Allergist. I don't venture much towards the craziness of I-95, especially on a holiday weekend, but that's where I had to go for Todd's appointment, so we did. It was over an hours drive to get there, and somehow I managed to get there early and with a few minutes to spare. Yay us! For whatever reason, Todd didn't seem nervous. Even when I got him out for a little break before his appointment he was happy and relaxed. I was happy about that.~Do you think Todd snuck a sip of my drink when I wasn't looking?~What I wasn't happy about was that the dermatology department (still) isn't allowing owners to come inside with their pets. So, I had to wait outside in my van while Todd was taken inside. After waiting about 30 minutes, the specialist called and gave a preliminary diagnosis of \"Allergic Rhinitis\" which is a build-up of histamines in the sinus, that can be caused by damage to the nasal membranes - I approved doing what is called a HESKA blood test that will hopefully tell us what Todd is allergic to. Todd will be on Apoquel until we get the test results and will have a follow up appointment in about 6 weeks. I'll just add that I'm not supportive of his being put on this particular medication, it suppresses the immune system and it isn't really an antihistamine ~ I questioned it being prescribed, but the Vet felt he should be on it, even though I really feel strongly that what Todd needs is a 'stronger' antihistamine than the Zyrtec that I've been giving him daily. But what do I know, right? Todd was happy to be back with me, and we were both happy when we got home. So now, we wait for 10 or so days for the results, and hope he doesn't have any 'flare ups' before then. ~Todd after his appointment~"},
{"title": "A Snow Day in May! ", "date": "Tuesday, May 16, 2023", "text": "On the way home from work yesterday, I found out that I was unexpectedly going to be off work today.  The Doctor I work for was going to be part of a funeral for a childhood friend. I am sorry that he lost his friend. But today, I've had 'found time' that I didn't expect to have. I decided that it was kind of like having a snow-day. The Urban Dictionary defines a snow day this way:\"An unexpected day when you are supposed to go to school but it is canceled. An unexpected break. An unexpected escape from it all. A day to relax, not a day to catch up on work.\"It may be May and there's no snow, but I totally agree with this definition, and I totally embraced it today.  Our snow-day got off to a pretty good start for Todd. At around 10 o'clock, I went to check on him outside and found him out of breath, his face was all wet and he had green smear on the side of his neck. He was one happy Scottie - But I made him come inside, something he didn't want to do - I washed off the green smear, something else he didn't want me to do and I gave him a treat - The one thing he agreed with.  It goes without saying that no snow-day is complete without eating the wrong food. So, I went and picked up lunch for myself. Yes, of course there were fries with that burger. Ree's snow-day food included chewing up some papers that I had left on the counter. I've no doubt she would have preferred what I was having, or she thought that's what she was going to get.Then it was everyone outside for a midday break. ~Front to back - Jack, Daisy and Iva~Then I looked over and remembered that I really need to get these flowers and vegetables planted. I'll get to that later. Or Saturday. I hope.... I watched a movie .... Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks - Have you seen it? Then we took a nap. ~Milo~I'm sure there was something else in there, but I don't remember what. I just know that it was 5:30 before I knew it. All in all, it was a pretty good snow day in May. Back to work on Wednesday. ~Foster Girl Lily~Thanks for stopping by today. We are doing okay, and I'm okay too. We have been busy of course, and I'll update on our 'adventures' in my next post. And I was afraid to ask 'White Boy' what kind adventure he was having! 😊"},
{"title": "Todd - The Birthday Boy ", "date": "Sunday, April 16, 2023", "text": "We had what I consider a milestone birthday this past week. Todd turned 12 years old. Twelve. I can't believe it. How can my puppy be 12 years old? At 12 years old, Todd still takes life seriously. Age hasn't changed him too much, he's just as proud, brave, independent and opinionated as he's always been. He is after all, a Scottish Terrier. However, being a Scottie, Todd is by nature, reserved, and a bit aloof towards strangers. But he has gotten better over the last few years - The last month he's mostly accepted the new dog walker who has followed the advice to win him over with lots of treats. ~Notes left by our dogwalker~But that aside, Todd is still active and playful and loves a fun game of ball. And I have to think he'd not approve of my telling you that in our one on one moments, he is gentle and affectionate, and he really loves a good massage. He will (sometimes) tolerate my affection, of 'allowing' a kiss on his head - He clearly objected to that even 2 years ago. Something so 'un-Scottie' Todd also wouldn't want told is that the age of 12 has mellowed him a tiny bit. For example in the mornings he's not always in a rush to jump off the bed and get the day started. He's sleeping more when outside in his favorite spot, but still enjoys sitting and watching the world go by.It's thought by some that 12 years old for a Golden Retriever is a milestone birthday. By their reaching that age, it's an indication that there is a likelihood that they'll live to be 14. For Scotties, it's said to be the same thing. But I'm trying not think about me and Todd having more days behind us than in front. However, I am worried and concerned about the continuing issue we're having with his clogged sinuses. We've invested in air-purifiers for our house, and we have an appointment with an allergist at the end of May - their soonest appointment. So, we'll just take each day as it comes, and hope we'll be able to figure it all out so there are plenty to enjoy with Todd, our most unique and high spirited character at Golden Pines. Happy 12th Birthday Todd!**This is where I add that I take the same photo of Todd every year - With the same hat, a cookie, in a chair at the table. At some point, I'll make a collage of all of them. ❤"},

Spring is showing up more and more every day.

A video of that is below - Lily is in the other room, and that's Daisy in the video. We're not sure why she's crying, when she must know that we're nearby, and she's free to come and be with us. It happens at random times during the night or day, and we're not sure what the trigger may be. Any thoughts? However, the good news is, is that the more time that has passed, Lily is not crying as much as she was at first. But she has days when she does cry, and all we can do is call or go to her and reassure her, which seems to help. Lily is a really sweet girl, she is always eager for and loves attention, and she's right up front for treats and her meal too, and of course she'll do what we ask her to do. Lily really loves joining the crew outside for the daily game of ball  -- That's her on the right. and then she enjoys relaxing in the cool grass afterwards.

{"title": "An Addition", "date": "Wednesday, March 22, 2023", "text": "My last post talked about a subtraction in our household. Thank you all for cheering Jaycee on as she starts the next chapter of her life. But this post is about an addition. You'll remember that the lovely Daisy joined our household in late June 2022. ~Daisy June 2022~Daisy was given to the rescue by her family because she was \"having accidents\" in their home. And, because they were renovating their house, they didn't want those \"accidents\" to occur in their remodeled home. It took several months for us to sort everything out medically for Daisy. And I'll add that no expense was spared for those answers, and in the end, what was really a simple but tenacious infection was cleared up with antibiotics - With very, very few \"accidents\" in our house in the meantime.  All that made Daisy available for adoption. She would fit into most any household. Daisy gets along with everyone and everything, because she's so easy going. She knows all her manners, having been to advanced obedience, or \"finishing school\" as I call it, she always does what she's asked. I really could go on and on about Daisy's good qualities, but you get the idea. The thought of Daisy leaving kept making me a bit choked up. This was because I or we, including the dogs, have loved Daisy since the day we met her in June - When I got her home that rainy day in June, she was wet and it was a little crazy and chaotic, and all she did was sit there and smile at me ...  I took her picture (below) and at that moment she stole my heart. ~First photo - The day we met Daisy~I just couldn't let Daisy go, and I felt so selfish in considering keeping her. But in a conversation with a longtime friend, who is also the rescue's foster-home coordinator, I realized it really wasn't. The heart knows what it wants, and how some things are meant to be. So, we pulled the proverbial trigger and adopted Daisy. She is here to stay. Daisy is truly a gift for all of us in our household. And one I am beyond grateful for. Welcome to Daisy as a permanent member of the Golden Pines Gang"},
{"title": "A Subtraction", "date": "Sunday, March 19, 2023", "text": "For nearly a week we kept a secret at our house. And it was that Jaycee, our foster girl for Lab Rescue, that we had for just over one year, left us last Sunday for a 'trial adoption.' We decided on a \"trial adoption,\" because of some of the insecurities that Jaycee has that didn't and don't make her a fit for some homes. Added to her not always liking some people, for reasons that only she knows, made a \"trial adoption\" a good option. It gave the family an \"out\" if it didn't work - and of course, Jaycee would be returned to us. With so much on the line, I just didn't want to jinx anything out there in the cosmos, so we silently kept  all fingers, toes crossed and paws crossed, and hoped it would be a match for Jaycee.It was a cold and snowy day last Sunday when \"Semi-Retired-Couple\" and their Lab Ian, made the more than 2 hour drive from Annapolis Maryland to our corner of Virginia. They spent nearly an hour alone with Jaycee, walking her around our property, and just getting to know her, while I watched from the inside. \"Semi-Retired-Couple\" decided that they and their boy Ian wanted to take Jaycee home. So, I took their photo together....and with a kiss on top of Jaycee's head, she was put into the back of their car and I said good-bye and they were off. It didn't take as long as I thought it might for \"Semi-Retired-Couple\" to decide that they wanted to adopt Jaycee. I will confess that I tried to get them to hold off for a few more days, but their hearts knew that they wanted Jaycee to stay with them - With their saying more than once, how much they already loved Jaycee, and how well it was going, I knew it was time for me to let her go.  ~Jaycee now at home~\"Semi-Retired-Couple\" could not be any more perfect for Jaycee. I liked them right away. They are previous adopters from Lab Rescue, and with no children, being home most of the time, not too many comings or goings and being no strangers to dogs like Jaycee, who as a retired breeder girl, can be shy and unsure of herself, they really are perfect for her. It was and is bittersweet, and we miss Jaycee. But those hard and discouraging days where I felt like her family would never come, are now replaced with the joy I feel at knowing Jaycee is where she should be.  ~On our way home - A first photo of Jaycee, when we met in March 2022~**And I know that some of you may be wondering why we didn't adopt Jaycee. It goes without saying that we loved and adore Jaycee. But she just wasn't a fit for our home. As hard as my brother and our dog walker tried to be friends with Jaycee, for reasons only known to her, she just didn't like them, and was afraid of them both. Unfortunately they both stopped trying to be her friend, something I wasn't happy about it, and I tried to understand. And with that, I felt strongly that Jaycee should be in a home where everyone loved her, and she loved everyone. All dogs deserve that. ❤ **"},
{"title": "Lily Arrives at Golden Pines", "date": "Saturday, March 11, 2023", "text": "If there’s anything else you should know about me, it’s that I’m actually awful at managing my free time. I think it's because I chase the clock from the moment I get up in the morning and all day at work. So when I get home, it's gotten to the point where all bets are off as far as me really rushing to get anything done. I think it's happening partly because I am easily distracted, usually by the dogs and I am simply losing track of time. Which is easy to do sometimes.~Ree and I enjoyed a warm sunny day a couple weeks ago~And as disappointed as I am in myself, because I'm not keeping up on some things, like my blog, I am determined to just keep going. With that, I'll skip over some of the smaller things that have been happening including the 2 vet visits that I had this week with Iva, who had an abscess, that also blew up into a really ugly hotspot. Thankfully she's finally feeling better, and that's what matters most. ~Iva, worn out from her vet visits this week~Lets get to the bigger news, and that's that a week ago today, we welcomed a new arrival named Lily to Golden Pines. Lily comes to us via the Golden Retriever Rescue. ~On our way home~Her previous owner is a single mom, balancing kids, and a busy schedule. Part of her e-mail to the rescue is below.Hello, I am inquiring about giving up my golden retriever. This is really hard to even inquire about as I don’t want to give her up, but she is being neglected from love and care that I know she deserves. She is 11 years old. She can barely go up the 3 steps to outside.....  She was my world for about 5 years, then I had kids. Now I’m divorced and a single mother. I don’t have money to take her to the vet, for medications, even to have her groomed. I am too busy to brush her, to love her, to care for her. I am too busy. I barely have enough time to see my kids as I work full time. When I am home, I don’t want to see the dog I want to see my kids. I feel so badly for her. She has arthritis so she needs medication probably, that I can’t afford. She is disheveled, overweight, and never taken on walks. I am so guilty about all of this. She does deserve better.Needless to say, when I read the e-mail, my heart went out to the Mom, and Lily too and so of course I said I'd take her. How could I not? Lily is a lovely senior girl, and she is getting along really well with her new packmates. She is however, a pretty nervous girl, and more than once during the night this past week, she starts howling. We aren't quite sure why she's doing this - She has the company of another dog or two - So we are thinking it may have to do with her not being able to be with us, despite that she can come into our room if she'd like. However, since it's only been a week, we really think and hope that maybe with a little bit of time she will relax and feel right at home.Welcome Lily!"},
{"title": "It's About Balance", "date": "Saturday, February 11, 2023", "text": "Yet another vet visit this week and this time it was Ree's turn. Let me just start this by saying that she's a terrible traveling companion. Even though she happily gets into the car, she'll sit directly in back of me and barks at everything that she sees. She also likes to have the window down so she can stick her nose out to sniff the air. Lesson learned to remember to use a crate next time. We've had Ree for over a year now, but she'd never met our vet. So, it was time that she did. Ree was really good, and we're waiting on the bloodwork results to be returned. So, after being the defender and protector of my van yesterday, today Ree's job was laying around and doing nothing. I think that there are days when I'm just like Ree. Some days all I do is bark at everybody, and some days I just want to lay on the floor and do nothing.  I think Ree has got it right. It's all about balance. ❤~The snowdrops are blooming!~"},
{"title": "Jaycee - Color Dilution Alopecia", "date": "Sunday, February 5, 2023", "text": "Our February began with just a little bit of snow, that practically disappeared if you blinked. It was the bitter cold that was hard to miss. But it was easier to take knowing it wasn't going to hang around for long. By Sunday afternoon milder and warmer air arrived and is in the forecast for the week ahead.Lately, my days off have been spent at the vets office. This past week was no different and this time, it was Jaycee's turn. I am both sad and worried for Jaycee. We've had her for almost a year now and there has been some interest from hopeful adopters, but no matches. And I have to confess to being brought to tears when it's not a match with someone that I thought may be perfect and when other dogs who've not been available for adoption that long, find their new family. I'm trying to remain hopeful. But it's not always easy.But Jaycee's vet visit was an uneventful one because it was just a yearly exam to make sure she's current on everything for when the day does come, she'll be ready for adoption. A health concern I have with Jaycee, is that she has alopecia on her sides, and on top of her head. ~The top of Jaycee's head~I've always thought she would regrow hair in these areas, but she hasn't. The vet explained that she has \"color dilution alopecia\" (CDA) which is a genetic-recessive-inherited condition that causes patches of hair thinning or loss. Interesting, at least to me, it's also this same diluted gene that gives Jaycee her silvery color, and her dappled ear.I had no idea, and because everything on the internet is true, I looked it up and read about it. You really can learn something new every day. Even on the internet. 🙂~The beautiful Daisy~"},
{"title": "The 2023 Re-Start of Life at Golden Pines", "date": "Sunday, January 29, 2023", "text": "Welcome Back Readers!I know, its been a while, too long of a while since I posted.  I have all kinds of things I want to share, making it hard to decide where to start. But there's time for all of that, so I'm just going to make this post the official restart of my blog in 2023.  I'll just start by saying that life got a little crazy. I won't bore you with all of that and say that for the past few months I've known I needed to readjust my priorities and decide my own direction for this year. Starting of course with the dogs. I had the chance to give a home to 7 year old Golden Retriever. It was a bit of a knee-jerk reaction saying I would take this girl, who was being given away by her owner. At first I was excited about the idea of welcoming her. But when the dust settled I realized that it was not what I wanted. My heart belongs to the senior dogs, and I really want to be able to continue to give a home to the most senior and hospice Goldens and Labs that need a place to go. If we accepted this new and younger girl, with the dogs we have now, it would make doing that very difficult. A younger dog adds a level of energy and even stress and pressure on us and our dogs that I just don't want. So, she is not coming to us. The dogs are of course oblivious to all of this and are doing pretty well for the most part. I've been doing some \"light reading\" during lunch at work. I am finding that it has helped to refocus my mind off the hectic days we've had at the office where I work. Iva, our newest addition is feeling much, much better these days. She has quite the fun personality under all that hair, that we're working on getting rid of. Below is a photo of that first brushing session. Iva returned to the vet this past Friday for a weigh in, and to recheck her thyroid levels. We've had her on thyroid medication for over a month now, and we'll see if an adjustment needs to be made. The good news is that Iva has lost 8 pounds and as I said, she's feeling great and is much more active and loves to play with Milo and the other dogs too. And speaking of Milo, he's met our vet for the first time. With no medical records from his first life, we had to start all over with him. I'm hoping the reports will come back just fine, even though he is getting over a really (!!) ugly staph infection. Despite that, he remains in good spirits. Then of course there's Todd. The star of our household is doing pretty well.  He's still having bouts of snorting/sneezing. With spring coming I know I need to decide what the next step is going to be with him because I do think it's allergy related - So, should he see an allergist, or holistic vet?  A decision to be made in the coming weeks. With that, I'll end this re-start of my blog in 2023. Thank you for stopping by. I'm grateful for your continued friendship, support and cheering us on! It really does mean a lot to me. ❤"},

I hope this time of year finds you with family and friends and making the best new memories. I hope the holidays haven't been to crazy and chaotic for you. Todd (below) just wanted me to take the crazy hat off. 🙂In the time I've been gone, I pulled off planning and putting together my office holiday party at a favorite restaurant. We were back at the vet with our newest arrival, Iva. It was just for more blood work, and a little longer wait for all test results to be returned. When we finally heard from the vet, it was to tell us that all the reports came back with good news, except for her thyroid, which we expected. Iva's back on thyroid medication and all of the usual supplements. I think in a few months, she'll be a whole new dog. Right now, we're working on removing mats and tangles, and using a pin-brush to buff away the loose hair from her coat. When that task is done, it'll be time for a good bath and blow-dry, that we'll of course do ourselves.~Same photo of Iva, different day waiting at the vet~Taking the spotlight off of Iva was Jack. One morning just as I was leaving for work (running my usual late of course) he found a dead mouse that he wanted to bring inside. I quickly grabbed treats and kept dropping them until he decided to give it up. It took 5 treats. I thought that was a real bargain because I would have given him the whole handful just so I wouldn't have to get it out of his mouth. ~Jack~Ree also had a birthday. She turned 6 years old. At six, Ree is of course the youngest in our household, and hands down the most mischievous dog we have had in a very long time. She was probably disappointed that she did not get a purse, but a cookie was always a fun treat too!In between all that, there was work, and even an ice storm. And and this past Friday, high winds ushered in plummeting single-digit temperatures and a power outage that lasted about 13 hours for us. What a relief it was to have lights and heat again!With the power restored, we cruised right into and through Christmas. At the moment, it's a quiet time at our house and I took the last of my yearly vacation from work. It was only one extra day off, but it was good to be home. ~Milo~"},
{"title": "Iva Arrives at Golden Pines", "date": "Sunday, December 11, 2022", "text": "When our dogwalker said to me that, \"we are growing our pack again\" I laughed because it was funny and she was right, because I was telling her about a new foster girl that arrived a week ago.~On our way home - Iva's new chapter~Eight year old Iva (pronounced eye-vah) now takes the top spot as the newest and the biggest Golden Retriever we have fostered in more than 20 years. She comes to us from a family that has given her up for reasons from a family members allergies to a thyroid problem that was diagnosed two years ago and she was never put on or kept on the needed medication. There's also a whole backstory of her having a shoulder injury that has limited her ability to get around as well as she used to. Whatever the reasons may have been, I'm grateful that the owner contacted the rescue, and Iva has made her way to us. Iva's new chapter began with a busy week. It was easy to see that she was a bit confused about her whole life being turned upside down, especially when she refused treats, and didn't want to eat anything. She would barely even look at us. But Iva met her new packmates with no problem, and has fit in easily. ~Milo, is glad he's not the newbie anymore~Iva's first week included a trip to the vet where she weighed in at 120 pounds. But with the help of the vet, we've got what I hope will be a good solid plan going forward for her, which will of course include a weight loss program -- However, we are confident that once she's back on her thyroid medication it will help with that. It was an exhausting visit and she was so tired once we got home. So, as we begin our second week with Iva, she's coming out of her shell and we're getting to know her. She is there in the crowd to greet us when we come home and anyone that comes to visit. She loves her treats, she easily learned where her spot is at mealtime, and she's following me around the house. And outside I got her to engage in a little game of ball and inside she's playing with a few toys. Yes, Iva is a bit of a \"project,\" inside and out, but she is going to be just fine. We're glad that she's here. ❤~Waiting at the vet - Look at that smile!~"},
{"title": "In Other News", "date": "Saturday, December 10, 2022", "text": "My last post was about Ree and an unfortunate culinary choice that she made out of one of my handbags. I'm happy and very grateful to report that she has recovered fully. Todd is doing just \"okay.\" He'd hardly been coughing/sneezing at all, but this past Saturday, it started again. By the third day when it seemed to be getting worse, I put him back on an antibiotic and Carprophen (generic rimadyl) for any inflammation. Two days later, he's not coughing at all. Again, it makes me think that all this could be allergy related because Carl had put some timothy hay down, and I wonder if that was the trigger? We raked it all back up again just in case. Then there's our almost newest addition, Milo. I can't believe he's been with us just over a month now. He easily settled in to his new life and routine with us. Milo's small size (about 50 pounds) and color is reminiscent of  the original Field-bred Golden Retrievers bred back in 1800s Scotland. In appearance only he is unlike our beautiful foster girl, Daisy who was bred more for looks and is bigger, stockier, and “big-boned.” ~Milo and Daisy waiting for their treats!~Field bred Golden Retrievers are natural athletes. They’re smaller and slimmer, and have body types that make it easy for them run, jump and even swim all day. This totally describes Milo who is a fun, active, agile and playful boy that is always wagging his tail and 'woo-woo-woo-ing'  telling us that he's totally ready for the next fun thing to happen. Even our other Black Lab Jack, who in the past hasn't been so welcoming to 'the boys,' doesn't mind Milo either - Another testament to Milo's carefree personality that has made him an easy dog to love. We feel so lucky to have him as part of our lives and household. And did you catch that I said that, Milo was our almost newest addition? Well, guess what ..... 🙂"},
{"title": "Ree's Culinary Adventure ", "date": "Saturday, November 26, 2022", "text": "As if the uncertainty of Todd's diagnosis wasn't enough on the week of November 14th, something happened that totally took the focus off of him. ~Todd says if it's not about him, he's taking a nap~It was late afternoon on Thursday the 17th - I remember hearing 'a noise' but instead of going to see what it was, I decided to ignore it. Big mistake. Huge mistake!  Because when Carl got home not long after that, he found that one of my leather hand-bags had been chewed up and eaten - Whatever you call it, I didn't have to try and decide which dog had done it, because this had Ree written all over it. I frantically looked for any pieces that may have not been eaten, and found none, but I was at least able to account for most of the brass-hardware that belonged to it. ~What's left of my bag~--- And this is where I'll add that the 'crossbody-bag,' a gift from a good friend a few years ago, has always hung in that same place in the spare bedroom when it's not being used -- Ree had to jump up to get it off its hook, which is the noise I heard-- Whatever possessed her to do it remains a total mystery, other than she's a Lab, and that's what they do. ---So, back to my story.... With no signs of the about 6-foot handle/strap and the full leather flap gone from the bag, and fearing an intestinal blockage because leather of course doesn't breakdown, Ree and I were off to the emergency vet. Thankfully the closest emergency vet could see her -- We didn't have to wait long before they took Ree to the back to induce vomiting and take x-rays - which was done twice. After almost 3 hours, Emergency Vet came out and told me that she thought what was left in Ree's stomach, even a couple of the small brass rivets would 'pass normally.' With that news, I was able to breathe a little bit easier, but Ree wasn't totally out of the woods, and I was told to watch her closely, because a blockage was still a real possibility. So, for the next week, we watched Ree's every move, inside and outside. I'll spare you the graphic details, and just say that despite it all, we did see pieces of my chewed up bag again and I'll add that Ree was totally unaffected by it all and was totally herself. And as for me, I was totally exhausted. It's now 9 days since Ree's culinary adventure, and she still appears to be no worse for wear. I'm told that there's still a chance that an intestinal blockage could still occur. Of course I'm hoping, hoping, hoping that it won't, as I hope for a new Dooney and Bourke handbag for Christmas. I wonder what Ree is hoping for?"},
{"title": "Todd's Diagnosis ", "date": "Thursday, November 24, 2022", "text": "It's Thanksgiving day and I'm looking back at the hurdles we've had to get over just to get to this day. I'm not even sure where to start because its not been the best few weeks for us. On the morning of the 14th, I dropped off a very nervous Todd for his rhinoscopy. The Internist called afterwards and said that his sinuses looked healthy and clear, and there was no evidence of anything lodged there,  no masses or polyps or inflammation. Biopsies were taken, and the wait began for those results.After work I picked up a very \"stoned and spaced out\" Todd who wanted nothing to do with me, which was okay and understandable. And so we went home for him to sleep off the anesthetic. I'll add here that the vet said that as he woke up from the anesthetic, he was very feisty and chewed through his IV. The biopsy reports were returned a week later, and I spoke to the Vet yesterday about them. It was mixed news as there was nothing obvious such as cancer, (thankfully!!) or an infection. The diagnosis is \"Idiopathic Rhinitis\" which simply means that there's no specific cause for his coughing, snorting, sneezing, etc. It could be triggered by something environmentally or an allergic response to something airborne inside the house. The vet wants to put him on a very heavy dose of steroids', to see if that helps -- But I am reluctant to do that because of the dose, and the long-term side effects that will come with it. If I decide to do this treatment, Todd needs to do a \"wash out\" of the anti inflammatory medication he is currently on, (rimadyl) so I have about 5 days on my side to consider it. It has been 'crushing' that there have been a 2-3 episodes of sneezing and coughing. But Todd seems happy and in good spirits and he is continuing to defend his turf from all the gangs of marauding deer and that's what's most important.  And finally for those of you celebrating Thanksgiving today - I'd like to take this day to tell you how much I appreciate your stopping by my blog, leaving your thoughts and how thankful I am for your cheering us on through our highs and lows. I hope that your Thanksgiving day is filled with the best new memories! ❤Photo above is Jack - It was two years ago yesterday that we met he and sweet Shelby. After what can only be described as a period of his mourning her loss, he is back to wanting to retrieve tennis balls again and be with us."},

A friend had seen Milo posted online in September, and so I contacted the owner, and the rest is history. I'm grateful to her for giving us Milo and trusting us to give him a good home and be his new family too. ~Milo's online profile-photo~The intros to Milo's new packmates has gone really well. Usually we limit the dogs interactions with the newcomer just to give everyone time to get to know the new-kid and for them to get used to the vibe of their new home and not be overwhelmed. We didn't have to do that with Milo because he has fit right in and all of the dogs like him. And when I woke up and found Milo sleeping on our bed last night, I'd say he feels right at home. ~Daisy showing Milo what to do and where to wait for treats~Milo is really a nice boy, and has a fun playful side that you cannot help but smile at. We are enjoying getting to know him, and for the chance to be part of the next chapter of his life. Welcome Milo!"},

You'd mentioned her in many of your comments, and I felt like I knew your beautiful Lab through you. I know that Inca had a wonderful and full life, and your beautiful companion left this life knowing she was loved, adored and treasured -- And all that and so much more are what Inca took with her as she left this life for the next, and is and will always be a part of you both. It is that love and so much more that will always keep you connected to one another. I know your house feels empty without Inca. And so I hope that when the time is right, you'll once again consider opening your heart and home to a dog that needs someone like you to love and adore them, just as you did your beloved Inca, who's loss, I am truly sorry about. ❤~A \"Rainbow Cloud\" from a storm we had not that long ago~"},
{"title": "At The Specialist ", "date": "Saturday, November 5, 2022", "text": "The start of another week is on the horizon and it's bringing an extra day off work. I have plans on how I'm going to fill my Tuesday, but we'll see what it turns out to be. Not that I ever have to worry about the use of spare time. This past week ended with Todd finally seeing the specialty Internal Medicine Vet. I made the appointment nearly six weeks ago, so it was highly anticipated. Todd has been feeling pretty well for the most part. He's had days where he didn't cough/snort/sneeze at all, and other times where it could be heard throughout the day and he couldn't breathe through his nose at all. This past week was a particularly difficult one for Todd, so I put him back on an antibiotic, and that seemed to have again knocked down what appears to be a reoccurring infection.At the specialist, Todd was a pretty nervous boy. Unfortunately, we didn't get a 'confirmed' diagnosis as I hoped we would, and as they initially thought they'd be able to provide. The Internist really thinks Todd has some kind of an 'infection' that there's no real cure for, and so she wants to do a rhinoscopy-- so we've scheduled that for the 14th of November. Given that this whole thing with Todd's blocked sinus began suddenly, I am holding onto something being lodged in his big Scottie nose even though the specialist says this is very rare, and not likely. But Todd has no real symptoms of this infection she mentioned - no nasal discharge, swelling or tenderness - so we'll see who is right, and who is wrong. It was a really busy day - Todd and I were exhausted afterwards. We came home and took a nap."},
{"title": "Today is About Jaycee", "date": "Sunday, October 30, 2022", "text": "Jaycee is still available for adoption via Lab Rescue. We've had a few inquiries, but so far, after 230 days with us, there's been no one that's a real match for her. Someone interested in adopting Jaycee came yesterday to meet her. I liked them very much, and Jaycee seemed to like them too. Unfortunately, their timing isn't right. They have two trips planned that are for more than two weeks before the end of November - Along with that, they didn't feel that 'love connection' for Jaycee, only sympathy for the life she's led.~Perspective adopter walking Jaycee~Yes, Jaycee is a dog that knew nothing about 'real-life,' except for giving birth to puppies before she came to us. And yes, she has had a lot to learn and has learned a lot since she's been with us. She has a bit of a quirky personality, and can be a little reactive with people that she should know she can trust - like our dog-walker, and my brother - We've tried to figure it out, but not being there when she reacts by barking and growling makes that impossible because when we are here and they're around, she's fine. I think it has to do with her not feeling safe and secure because with me and Carl, she couldn't any more affectionate, relaxed and happy too. ~Ree and Jaycee, my kitchen helpers~Jaycee is great with the other dogs and cats and is good in the house. Her 'safe place' is a moveable wire ex-pen to stay in when we're not home and to sleep in at night. She prefers to not sleep on a dog bed, and so we've put in a rug, a sheet, and she also has a dog-bed cover to curl up on. I have had to grin at her more than once because she appears to have a favorite cover and will drag it into the ex-pen with her if I try to change it.We even did a little test after it was washed. We laid out two covers, same fabric, just different colors. The one on the left is the one that Jaycee prefers. It didn't take long before Jaycee pulled the cover into the ex-pen with her. She is clearly a dog that knows what she wants. ❤THANK YOU  for stopping by today - I know I am so far behind on posting and reading blogs and I will post more of our news in the next day or so. **Happy Halloween from Daisy, who says she's a Princess, and doesn't want to be a pirate in a hand-me-down costume for Halloween!**  😊However if you give her a ball to go with it. . ."},

By about 5 o'clock in the morning, the lights are on as we get ready for a workday. However on the weekends and with the colder mornings it's so nice to sleep in a little longer. Most of the dogs let us do that - All except one... Ree. In the past couple of months, by 5 AM, Ree is awake and she starts to get antsy, whining, scratching, pacing from up and down on my side of the bed. Even if I don't open my eyes and pretend I am asleep she keeps making noise. Of course I thought that she needed to be let outside. So, I'd get up, and of course I'd be followed by one or two of the other dogs who were happy to be let out - I'll note here that Todd is usually sleeping in. But in getting the dogs out, feeding the cats, I don't go back to bed, I stay up and get the day started. And so I'm not sure when I finally noticed that Ree doesn't want to be let outside. What Ree wants is my place in bed. ~On the bed - Ree's favorite place anytime of the day~That affectionate, un-co-operative, playful, independent, never-shy, life of the party, laid back girl is pretty sneaky.  And I fell for that sneakiness. ❤"},

I found myself enveloped in a sadness that is overwhelming. Even now, in these quiet moments, it's hard to not let it consume me. I just keep going. I have and had to. A few days after our good-bye to George, Carl left to visit family, leaving me alone with the dogs, who remind me every day that they are still here, and they still need me. Life somehow goes on. To keep me focused and dialed into reality, I've worked on a couple of my days off because my counterpart at work and another co-worker are not feeling well. They are both back to work, Carl has returned and I'm feeling optimistic that my life will return to its regular programming this week.~Daisy makes every day better~One thing that has kept me focused off myself is Todd. He's had problems breathing through his nose and has been having bouts of 'reverse sneezing.' It began at his last vet visit, when he was put into a crate in my van that had been stored in the barn. Carl had rinsed it off, but I did notice that there was still some 'barn debris' left on it. The sneezing started that day. ~The day the sneezing started, with Jake & Daisy~Concerned of course, I read that the sneezing typically resolves itself, so I didn't get too worried. Especially when it wasn't happening every day. But that sneeze turned into a cough and started to affect his breathing, and so we were back at the vet last week.One of Todd's sinuses is blocked, so the vet prescribed antibiotics and he is breathing easier. But my vet and I agree that there is a slight infection that is probably caused by something lodged in his sinus. So, I've made an appointment for him with a veterinarian specializing in Internal Medicine to have his sinus 'scoped.' Given how and when it started, I'm hoping that if it is something that he inhaled into that big Scottie nose of his, that it will maybe dislodge before his appointment next month. Paws crossed."},

With my counterpart at work still out sick, I've worked a 'double booked schedule' at my office every day. I'm mentally exhausted. Thankfully it appears that my co-worker will be returning to work on Monday. In more ways than one, I'm grateful that *she* is feeling better. At home, the dogs all seem to understand and have patiently waited for their dinner that has come a bit late on a few nights. But for the 3rd time in about 2 months, what could not wait or be postponed any longer, was our saying goodbye to our beloved boy, George on Friday. George has been declining physically over the last few months, but despite that, his spark and spirited determination were as strong as ever. In allowing his will and determination to continue and to help make his life easier, thanks to a kind supporting friend, we purchased a garden-wagon with removable sides that helped us to get George outside, and saved his needed strength and ours too. With one of the sides removed, and an added rug for comfort, it was perfect inside and outside. Despite George's perseverance and I'll add courage, he became unable to stand on his own, and sitting up became difficult too. We knew it was time to make the hardest decision a pet owner has to make, and that was to let him go .....  George was always nervous at the vet and so I wanted that goodbye to take place here at home.~George and Shelby~Yesterday afternoon was warm and sunny on our front porch and as the sun was beginning to set at the end of the day, we sat with George, giving him lots of treats and said those things to him that come in these tender quiet moments -- And, with one last final bark, another reminder of George's strong spirit, he bid this world goodbye and began his journey to the next life, leaving behind a silence that has filled the air as much as his bark did. How I already miss him. ❤George & Abe's Story:George came to us in the fall of 2019 along with his brother Abe, via Lab Rescue. The two together, very quickly and appropriately were given the name of  \"The Barkalot Brothers,\" because well, they continually and endlessly barked a lot. A whole lot. It was something we were never able to stop them from doing. But we somehow kind of got used to it. ~George, left and Abe Barkalot~In mid-December of  2019 the health of their original owner, Paul had improved and so he asked if the rescue would return them to him. We all agreed, and by January, the two were back home. ~The day George and Abe returned to Paul~I kept in touch with Paul and in the spring I received a text-message asking me if we would take George back. Abe had passed away a month before and Paul's health was again declining, and he was no longer able to care for George. We of course welcomed him back, and we officially became George's new-forever family. Even with that bark that never seemed to stop, we never for a moment regretted it. We dearly and completely loved our Barkalot boy. ~In the car with us, the day George came back to us~I've felt for a very long time that George was truly among the biggest-hearted and soulful of dogs that I've shared my life with, second only to without a doubt, the biggest barker we've ever had - Next to Todd, that's really something - And so I cannot I cannot help but think that as George was met on the other side by his brother Abe, that the Rainbow Bridge has become a bit of a noisier place. I will look forward to the day when I see them both again, and find this out for sure. ❤❤Video above, \"The Best of the Barkalots\""},

Whether you’ve traveled or stayed put, or have laid low, I hope you've had a good weekend. Its been pretty quiet around here. I did work at the end of last week to give my counterpart at the office needed time off. We don't get much company to our house, but we have had two visitors the last few days.~Flowers from our second Visitor~The first one, yesterday. Perched in a tree is what I think may be a juvenile Bald Eagle. I'm not sure. It was being chased by a crow, which I understand is not that unusual. I think it just needed a rest from being harassed.  **Does anyone know for sure if it's a young Eagle?The other visitor came to see Ree. You'll recall it was a rule-breaking cosmos moment that brought her to us via a 3rd party. But her first owner, Marie, and I have become friends, and she has really wanted to see Ree again. Marie was traveling through our area, and so it worked out for her to stop by. I didn't take any photos. It was an emotional reunion and Marie cried as Ree stayed by her the entire visit -- and I don't think it was just because she brought treats. ~Ree and Daisy waiting for a gifted-treat from Marie~Ree, formally named ReeRee is Marie's childhood name and how she's known to family and so it's how our Ree, got her name. The love that Marie has for Ree is obvious. But the changes in her life, having to sell her home because of an invalid husband, along with other changes in circumstances are heartbreaking, and life-changing. It all made it impossible for her to keep Ree. However Marie is persevering and hopeful for her life ahead.  We had a nice visit getting to know one another, and my getting to hear fun stories about Ree as a puppy and growing up. As our visit was ending, I told Marie that she was welcome to come anytime to see Ree. I felt some sadness and doubt in her response about our meeting again. And as I watched Marie kiss Ree and whisper something to her, I had a feeling that they will not see one another again. I think that Marie wanted to make sure Ree was okay, and I think that she wanted to say good-bye. ~Down our driveway after Marie left~Afterwards, I couldn't help but feel sad for them both. ❤"},
{"title": "Shelby's Counterpart - Jack ", "date": "Monday, August 29, 2022", "text": "Long time readers will recall that the Golden Retriever Rescue back in November of 2020, originally asked us to foster Shelby. However, it was later learned that she had a companion, a Black Lab named Jacket, that she'd come into the shelter with. Lab Rescue had been contacted about Jack, but had not responded. Since we happen to foster for both rescues, and not wanting to split up a pair, the Golden Retriever Rescue took them both.  We always thought that we'd find someone who loved both breeds, and would happily agree to adopt both Jack and Shelby - We even had them 'cross-posted' on Lab Rescue's website, and there was a lowered adoption fee. But aside from the one failed placement in the spring of 2021, nothing ever came from it. A concern I have always had in the back of my mind was 'what if something happened to Shelby?' Jack and Shelby were not so much a bonded pair, as they were companions. I'd thought that Shelby is/was the only other dog that Jack loved unconditionally. Jack is a good and well mannered boy. However, he can be what a friend on the board of the rescue described as 'prickly.' It's a perfect word for Jack who can sometimes be moody and prickly around other dogs - Remember Jack's bossiness is why Todd's ear is now wonky. ~Jack and White Boy taking a nap, an un-prickly moment~All of that aside, if Shelby was the love of Jack's canine life, as far as people that Jack loves, hands down, his heart belongs to Carl. Now, don't misunderstand, Jack doesn't totally exclude me, he's happy to see me when I come home, and he always does what I ask of him. But when Carl comes home, it's happiness and joy overload x's 10. Jack also knows that when he sees Carl, it's time for another favorite thing, ball. Jack is hands down, the best retriever of tennis balls that we've ever had. It all starts by his going outside and sitting by the steps waiting for Carl. When the game starts, he brings the balls back and sets them down for the fun to continue. ~Jack and Carl the day they met in November 2020. The start of their friendship~Now that you know a little more about Jack, it takes me back to my concerns about his future without Shelby. And because Jack was still a foster dog, the Rescue, who owned him, had things they needed to decide.The first question was: Should Jack be turned over to Lab Rescue for them to find a new home?  The answer to this was 'no' for reasons that I won't go into. The Foster-home-coordinator and I agreed on that issue.The next question was: Should Jack be made available for adoption via the Golden Retriever Rescue? The answer to this was also 'no.' I really felt that the chances of Jack finding a home via the Golden Retriever Rescue, was probably not going to happen. The questions that were yes: How we feel about Jack. Of course we love and adore him. And, even though Jack is not particularly connected to me, he is to Carl and we both want what's best for him; that's for him to be loved, safe and cared for which goes without saying. So, what was the best answer for Jack? It didn't really require a lengthy discussion.The board of the Golden Retriever Rescue generously voted to waive Jack's adoption fee. And so after 645 days as a foster dog with us, minus the week he and Shelby spent 'adopted' before being returned to us, Jack officially becomes ours. His adoption contract is signed and goes into the mail today. It's a bit of a bittersweet moment. ~Shelby & Jack's adoption contracts, one now signed~But I know with all certainty that it's how it should be, and given everything, it's how it was meant to be. ❤"},
{"title": "Shelby's Final Chapter", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2022", "text": "Below is the account of Shelby's last weekend with us. Before those details fade, I just wanted to have a record of her last days. I understand if you don't want to read it, but for me, it's important to have that part of her story told. And as always, thank-you for letting me share Shelby with all of you, and for sharing her loss with us. Shelby is greatly missed. But at what I'm guessing is more than 14 years old, she had a long life. And because of her gentle and easy going nature, and despite the circumstances that led to her and Jack being taken to a shelter, I have to think and hope that she knew she was wanted and was loved, especially by us. Shelby's last chapter began the morning I left for my weekend away to Smith Mountain Lake. I noticed swelling on Shelby's back left-hock. Knowing what I do about this kind of thing, I worried that it was bone cancer. Even though our regular vet was out of town, I was able to get an appointment to have it looked at by another vet when I returned. Shelby was in good spirits, up and around almost as much as she always was, and had a good appetite, so I tried not to worry ....  too much. By Friday, the day of her appointment, I was holding onto that little bit of hope that maybe I was wrong. ~At the vet, posing for an x-ray on her leg~Sadly, I was not. It was bone cancer. ~The x-ray and the diagnosis~Shelby was really tired from the appointment, but she ate her dinner and slept soundly in the hallway overnight not moving from her spot. Saturday morning we helped her to get up and outside, and fed her breakfast. Afterwards, she came into the office and laid down on the floor. It would be the last time that Shelby would get up at all.By Sunday afternoon, we'd tried several times to get Shelby onto her feet, but she kept collapsing and wouldn't stand and we were unable to get her to relieve herself. I increased her pain medication in hopes it would help. It didn't. I was again feeling that ache in my heart left by Jake, but I tried to remain hopeful. On my way to work on Monday, the calls to a vet began. My vet was still out of town, but I held onto hope that maybe \"Fill-in-vet\" could see her, but she couldn't. I called 5 different offices before calling an emergency vet who had room to see her. ~A tile at the vets office, taken as we waited to be seen~When we were given Shelby's diagnosis of bone cancer, I'd said several times, and I still believe that Shelby was keeping that secret, as well as one about the amount of pain she was in - And when we officially found out that last Friday that she had bone cancer, and we knew her secret, she put it all out there, and it all fell apart. Those precious days of grace that I so hoped for, that I always hope for, were not to be. So, we said good-bye to Shelby on August 15th.It's only been 12 days since Shelby left us. I am still missing her. She had a cute little 'old lady' personality. She become silly and playful, when we'd trim her nails, or just when I'd scratch her back or give her tired muscles a massage. True to her golden retriever breed, she loved her meals. I'd say to her, 'it's time to eat,' and it always made me smile watching her eager and happy little gallop down the hallway towards the kitchen. She always knew she had to go outside afterwards, and before going out, she always looked at me with a total understanding because I'd always say to her, \"I'll help you up the ramp to come back inside when you're ready.\" And she'd always be there, waiting for me by the ramp to help her walk up it and get inside. I still look for her at those times. Shelby truly was a gift. And I am beyond grateful for the time we got to know Shelby and love her for the last chapters of her life. ❤"},
{"title": "Last Trip of the Summer", "date": "Wednesday, August 24, 2022", "text": "Because of my time off work this past spring, it kept me from making my annual pilgrimage to Tennessee. So, instead I decided to do a couple of weekend trips. The first as you know was to see good friends in Smith Mountain Lake. The second, was this past weekend to see 'retired Navy brother' and his family in Chesapeake Virginia. It was a fun visit and so good to see everyone and catch up. ~Retired Navy brother's cats, Petey and Bubba~ Because we were so close to the ocean, we decided to end our trip with a little splurge of an overnight stay at Virginia Beach. ~The famed King Neptune statue on the boardwalk~Normally, I'm not a beach person. It had been about 5 years since I was at the beach but I was reminded that like Tennessee, it's peaceful in its own ways. The overcast skies and the threat of rain cut down on the amount of people that were on the beach. I think that made it a bit more relaxing to not have the crowds that are there this time of year.But for this non-beach lover, I have to say that I really did enjoy the sounds of the waves, the smell of the salty sea air, the feel the warm ocean and smooth sand beneath my feet as we walked along the shore. And I enjoyed watching the sea-birds too. We took a little time to sit and people-watch on the boardwalk, which in the short time we were there we realized it offers an eye-full of things to observe, and that's all I'll say about that. 😎~View from our room of the boardwalk~We also really loved the view from our hotel room, and seeing fishing boats and cargo ships off in the distance as night fell. Weekend trips have a way of ending much too quickly. But it's always good to be home, because I always miss the dogs when I go away."},
{"title": "A Sad Good-Bye to Shelby ", "date": "Tuesday, August 16, 2022", "text": "They say that the worst part about owning a dog or a cat is having to say goodbye, because that goodbye always feels like it comes far too soon. I can say without a doubt, that it does. And when it comes just a month after you've said good-bye to another beloved dog or cat, it stings that much more. On Monday, we said a sad and a bit unexpected good-bye to Shelby. Just as I did with Jake, I'll post the story of what led to her loss in a few days. But I will tell you that it was bone cancer that took this sweet girl from us. Shelby and Jack came to us in November of 2020 from a rural shelter. Though not a bonded pair, they were companions to one another - I'd said for a long time that Shelby was the only other dog that Jack loved more than himself and it always showed. Shelby was the opposite of Jack. Easy going, friendly with people, dogs and cats. She was well-mannered, eager to please and she loved attention and was always smiling. Beautiful inside and out at about 14 years old, she had a silly and playful side that shined through right until the very end. And given what I saw from her the last few days with us, I'd have to add brave, stoic, and courageous too. This sweet girl leaves a big empty place in our home and hearts - Not just with us, but with Jack too. Our candle has been lit since yesterday to help Shelby find her way to the Rainbow Bridge. And, I hold onto that hope and belief of Shelby's restored health and someday, a reunion with her and all those who have gone before her."},

My visit that included delicious homemade meals using their garden and a sight seeing and fun boat ride, could not have been more restful and enjoyable with them, and their 3 dogs. And would you believe I only only took one photo from the guest room - How was that for being unplugged? But does it count that I took this photo on my way home to show Carl just how inexpensive gas was in that corner of Virginia?  (nearly .50 cents cheaper)Speaking of Carl, he of course took great care of the crew while I was away. At least that's what Daisy (below) told me. But before I skipped town for the weekend, Todd was finally taken to the groomer and is sporting a much cooler look. Bleary eyed Max is too. He was really worn out afterwards. So, onward through August we go. We have one more weekend trip lined up before the end of summer, so I'm hoping the nice and sunny weather will continue.I hope you are having nice and sunny weather too!"},
{"title": "Not Convinced", "date": "Friday, July 29, 2022", "text": "We've had our girl Ree for nearly a year now. It has been quite a year as we've gotten used to the energy and the antics of an active 5 year old dog in our midst.  Along with mastering total pillow domination, and the art of morphing to the exact dimensions of a king-sized bed, Ree always finds something to get into when she's left unattended - I honestly think she keeps a list of things to get into when we're not around because she's eaten rolls of toilet paper, bars of soap, boxes of cards, magazines - You get the idea. Yesterday, I left the house in a bit of a rush, and forgot to put Ree in her crate. When I got home about 2 hours later, I was surprised when she happily greeted me at the door. But everything was as I'd left it, nothing was torn up, and there were no accidents. It was so unlike Ree. I was so proud of her, relieved, and I gave her lots of praise and extra treats. But now, a day later, I'm still not convinced that I won't find something that she got into. ❤"},

{"title": "Jake's Last Day ", "date": "Thursday, July 21, 2022", "text": "Dear Friends, Thank you all for sharing the loss of Jake with us. It's a reminder of something that I've known for a very long time, and that's that the blogging community is one of kindness, compassion and friendship. Your comments on Jake's loss really made a difference in the sad days of the past week. A couple of months ago I read something that really stuck with me about the \"responsibility of being a witness\" to the passing of our beloved pets, just as we've been one to the lives they lived. It was a very powerful article, written by a professional and long time death doula, who shares her experiences and thoughts on death on a Facebook page (and blog) that I follow. But I'd never thought of myself as a \"witness\" to our dogs lives, but I guess I am. I am a 'witness' to the last chapter of their lives and what's written below is my 'witness' of Jake's last day with us. I know that it's a bit wordy, and with time being a premium, I totally understand if you don't have time to read it. So I will end this part of the post by saying again how much it means to me to have your support and for always being there to cheer us on, in both the good times, and the not so good times. You all are the best! ❤   July 13th started out as a normal day.  I'd gotten Jake outside, he ate his breakfast, drank water and was even wagging his stubby tail when I gave him treats. Off to work I went. Knowing how concerned I was about Jake, a few weeks ago our dog walker started texting me updates when she came midday so I wouldn't worry (too much) about how he was doing.  She said she'd also gotten Jake out and made sure he had water, and gave him treats and even noted that he was in good spirits.Carl got home around 5 o'clock, and he also got Jake outside and there was no indication of anything wrong - I got home from work, Jake was fine, he was sitting up and seemed happy to see me and I spent a few minutes with him before getting dinner ready for the dogs. Jake's first seizure was at about 6:30, it lasted just over a minute, and he seemed to recover in just in few minutes. It had been over a week since he'd had a seizure, so I wasn't overly worried because he seemed okay. So, I went ahead and fed the other dogs, and I could tell that he wanted something to eat, so I gave him his meal, which he ate. We decided to move him into the bedroom because it was quieter. I didn't want him to be alone, and so I sat with him. Shortly after 9 PM, Jake would have a 2nd seizure. I texted the medical coordinator for the rescue to let her know. Jake seemed to again recover from the second seizure, and was alert. By this time I'd talked to the coordinator for the rescue about what to do. We decided to take him in to the animal emergency - The first one I called, was 'full to capacity' and wouldn't see him. So, I called another about 45+ minutes from us to ask them about seeing Jake. They said they were also having a busy night, and it would be at least a 4-5 hour wait or possibly longer if Jake was stable. I'll add that I seem to recall a possible 12 hour wait in my conversation with the receptionist. Jake did seem 'stable' so I called the coordinator back, and we decided to wait through the night, and call the vet first thing in the morning and take him into the ER if he had another seizure. Unfortunately he did shortly after we talked. It was worse than the other 2 had been, and I became more than worried that Jake may not make the nearly one hour drive to the ER, especially when he had another seizure barely a minute or two later. I drove as fast as I dared to, given that I kept seeing deer (and even a fox) crossing and grazing along the side of the road and it was a little rainy, making it pitch dark. Jake was whining a little, and I didn't and don't know why. I'd not heard him whine before, and it's something that still bothers me. But Carl sitting next to him, he settled down and he was alert for most of the 40+ minute drive. Unfortunately Jake had another seizure when we were about 5 minutes away. It was about 11:30 PM when I pulled up to the ER. I opened the door of the van and he was barely breathing and his (gum) color wasn't good. I knew we were going to lose him. I ran inside to find the one and only receptionist listening to someone talk about his dog who had been scratching his ear all day - I stood silently as long as I could, and I finally interrupted. Fast forward to the staff getting Jake onto a stretcher, and they rushed him to the back. By the time I parked and was back inside, they were coming out to tell us that Jake was gone. Being told news that I already knew just caused all the emotions I'd been ignoring all evening to surface and my heart to break. I asked the vet to to bring Jake to us so we could say our goodbye's. I kissed his head knowing that it would be the last time I would ever kiss him, and I noticed how soft and warm his fur was, and I wanted to remember what he felt like, because I knew I would never feel his soft fluffy coat again. I tried to memorize every detail, knowing it would be the last time I’d ever see the face of a dog I dearly love and I whispered into his ear those things that come from the heart at those moments . . . . . . . . . we said good-bye to Jake. I know in time the sadness and emotions last Tuesday will soften, but what will remain is what always does, the gratitude in my heart for having the chance to know Jake and to love him, and have him as part of our lives for 317 days."},
{"title": "Farewell Tribute to Our Boy Jake", "date": "Saturday, July 16, 2022", "text": "I've waited a couple of days to write this post because I wanted to find the right words to let you all know that we lost our boy Jake on Tuesday. I have the post already written of the events leading up to our suddenly losing him, that I will post after this. I want this post to be a tribute to a dog that I came to love very much. ~Jake, the first day we met~It was exactly 317 days ago that I'd met Jake. His first life was spent with someone who'd served in the military, and when there was a divorce, Jake was given to his parents. When the parents no longer had time for Jake, they felt that he'd be happier in another home. We became Jake's second foster home when it was realized that he was unable to do flights of steps. He settled in easily and nicely and got along with our crew and found his spot within the pack. Proving an old dog actually can and does adjust to a new life, Jake spent his time with us enjoying all the smells of the country and all the other joys of being canine. He mastered the art of the assistant chef in the kitchen and all things food related. You couldn't help but  notice that Jake was a big boy, and we tried to help him on his weight-loss journey. But it didn't help that he appointed himself the official dog-bowl-cleaner, making sure all leftover morsels did not go to waste. We tried .....  Jake didn't know any tricks like shake, speak, or roll over . . . But he did know sit . . . And he had a smile that truly warmed my heart. His affection and trust for everyone he met was as intense as his love for finding a cool place to sleep and living life how he wanted. Something we happily let him do.Jake is survived by a pack that misses him, and by two people who are heartbroken and wish they could have given him a few more hugs and a few more of those new treats he was really enjoying. In lieu of flowers, as Jake's foster home, we are requesting that you spend this week giving your dogs or cats extra treats, and extra hugs - the same goes for people too. And most importantly, consider giving second chances to senior dogs like Jake. Because two-legged or four, everyone deserves to be loved to their fullest potential.And allowed to be who they are . . . ❤❤❤God speed Jake. Thank-you for being part of our lives and thank-you to GRREAT, the rescue that was there for him when he needed a place to go. I know in time the ache of your loss will soften. But that gratitude in my heart for having the chance to know you and love you, will not."},
{"title": "Happy 4th of July! ", "date": "Monday, July 4, 2022", "text": "We round the corner to today, July 4th. July is my favorite time of summer. I love all the light and waking up and looking out my window and seeing the hydrangeas blooming. Everyone loves summer. Don't you think that people are so much happier when summer comes around? I think because it's so much more laid back and you can get away with things you may not be able to during the colder months when we're sometimes a bit grouchier.I think the dogs are in a better mood too. Jake, Daisy and Todd didn't seem to mind the trip to the vet last week. With the 3 of them in my van, it was a reminder that my van fits our needs perfectly. I'd been thinking we could/should downsize what I'm driving, but this vet trip was a reminder that I really cannot. Todd had mostly a good report. He was diagnosed this year with lyme disease, which is not unusual for the area we live. He'll go on a round of antibiotics (doxycycline) and he should be just fine. What's not fine is me, as trivial as it is, I'm still feeling that guilt over his ear that will never stand up straight again. The report for Jake has us making an appointment for acupuncture and cold laser to see if that will help with his being more mobile. At some point very soon, I'll share more about how he's doing. The vet report was as good as it could be, considering his age of 13-14 years old, and being such a big boy. But x-rays of his chest showed us that his heart looked good, no signs of fluid or tumors. However, my worries escalated when Jake had a seizure on Friday morning. I'm grateful I could be home for a long weekend to keep a close eye on him. Each day since Friday has been a better one for him, no more seizures (knock, knock, knock on wood!!) and his appetite is back.  ~A very tired and worn out Jake on Saturday~Finally there was our newest arrival, Daisy. She got a good report from the vet. We're doing a round of antibiotics to clear up an infection that we hope will help with those inside-accidents her previous owners reported that she was having. My report is that Daisy hasn't had any accidents in the house in a week and all of our dogs, even Jack, who can be moody around the other dogs even likes her. How can you not with that smile that has won everyone over. ❤"},
{"title": "Daisy Arrives at Golden Pines", "date": "Sunday, June 19, 2022", "text": "To start, I am going to spare you the saga of some drama that came from changing our internet provider. I am pretty sure it's all worked out now, and we are officially divorced from *them.*And I also won't make a big deal about how our outdoor kitty White Boy has become friends with a member of the marauding gang of deer on our property.  Traitor? 😊But White Boy remains good friends with our Siamese cat, Tiggy. I'll also not brag about a really nice birthday celebration I had a couple of weeks ago. My \"bestie\" at work, Chris made this very delicious pie, it was a Texas Trash Pie, and the recipe can be found here. But I WILL brag to you about our newest arrival via the Golden Retriever Rescue, a 7 year old girl named Daisy. ~My first photo of Daisy~Yes, you are right, she is younger than what typically comes to us - And there are two reasons for this.The first one happened a couple of years ago. Daisy was in boarding and somehow injured her back, right hock. No one is quite sure how it happened. It was a clean-cut to her leg and at first it was thought it would heal on its own and she would be fine and recover. But the injury didn't heal. That was because the injury got infected. And when Daisy was not putting any weight on her leg it was discovered that her achilleas-tendon had been severed. That started her on a journey that involved surgery and physical therapy. In the end, it has left Daisy able to walk just fine, but she is unable to do a flight of stairs. However, she is easily able to do a few steps like we have on our back porch. We were asked to foster Daisy because our house is all on one level. ~My second photo of Daisy, wet from the rain~Daisy's injury was not why she was given up by her family. Daisy has been given-up to the rescue because her well to do family are renovating their home. They are currently living in a rental, and Daisy started having \"accidents.\" in the house. And they did not want the \"distress\"(their word) if it continued when they move back into their newly renovated home ..... You cannot make this up - The coordinator for the rescue knows that a dog having \"accidents\" in our house isn't an issue for us whatsoever, so we were more than happy to welcome the very lovely Daisy on Thursday.Daisy's intros to her new packmates and spending time with them has gone really well. ~All the girls in the kitchen helping with dinner~All the dogs and the cats seem to like Daisy just fine. Daisy is friendly, easy going and never stops smiling or wagging that beautiful tail of hers. I think it goes without saying that we are going to enjoy having her as part of our household. ~Daisy and Max watching those marauding deer~Welcome Daisy!"},

So, that's what I'm doing and so lets see where this post goes. To start, I really want to thank everyone who have stopped by leaving comments and sending messages asking how I'm doing, and how our gang is doing too. I so appreciate your friendship, your concern and your letting me know that you were thinking of us - It really meant a lot; you all are truly the best! ❤I returned to work exactly a month post-surgery.~Sitting in commuter-traffic--- grrrrr .... My least favorite thing to do~After my first post-op appointment, my doctor had recommended that I take another week or two off work, but I didn't listen to her or friends that were telling me the same thing. I know now, I should have, because I was exhausted and yes, also grouchy and irritable. The good thing is, is that the doctor and all that I read were right, it did get easier and better. This past week or so, I finally feel like my energy is back to where it was, and I'm finally feeling like myself again. *And as a post note, I'll add that the biopsies have all come back \"clear.\" ~Max~The report on the dogs has been a bit of a mix bag. A few of our crew are a tad-bit worse for wear, but as always, they're in pretty good spirits and great company.~Ree~Todd did have a small scuffle with Jack, that Jack started because he didn't like Todd barking at people he could see walking around the adjoining property. Todd hurt his neck, and there was an injury behind his ear that was made a little bit complicated by a prior ear infection that turned into an aural-hematoma. As a result of that, Todd has an ear that may never stand up straight again. I feel terrible and guilty about it. On a much lighter note, going back to April, we did celebrate Todd's 11th birthday - Can you believe that Todd is 11 years old? As always, I'm continuing to ask that ongoing question, \" just where the heck does time go?\"Wherever times disappears to, I'll keep this short for now and just say, that I'm so glad you stopped by, and I really am looking forward to catching up on all that I've missed!"},

There have already been a couple of calls, but neither were a good fit from her. She is a really nice dog, and has a gentle and easy going personality. She's nervous meeting new people, but if someone is with her that she knows, she's fine. ~ I love Jaycee's smile in this photo~Her house-manners are a work in progress, as we expected them to be. She's gaining more confidence when it comes to exploring the yard and the house on her own. One thing that you can't help but notice, is that Jaycee highly food motivated (such a Lab thing!) she's very sensitive and is a pleaser. She is very curious about everything and wants to do as she's asked, she just needs someone to show her the way. It's not that Jaycee doesn't have any one to help her do that. There are plenty of mentors in our house, and she's great at following the crowd. But in hopes of helping her find her \"inner-Lab\" we are teaching her about retrieving. Jaycee chases after the ball, but her bringing it back needs just a little bit of work. In the video below, you can see that she runs right past us every time, and every time she makes us laugh. I'm sure that eventually Jaycee will get the hang of it.And finally, here's another bit of advice I've picked up by watching Julia Child this past week. **Remember to time your vegetables perfectly with your meal, so they don't get cold or get overcooked.**  At our house timing is everything at mealtime. And when I forget to steam the veggies beforehand .... well, it gets noisy and crowded with too many cooks in the kitchen!"},
{"title": "Me and Julia Child and The Dogs", "date": "Sunday, April 3, 2022", "text": "My first week at home was a bit of a blur, the second week, was kind of a repeat of that. I've gotten a lot of rest. And I have to mention that I've been the recipient of some very thoughtful friends who've brought amazing and delicious meals, sent cards, texted, took me to lunch, and last week a good friend and I went to the movies one afternoon. Each new day brings a little more healing – for which I am beyond grateful.While at home by myself, there's really not a lot going on. The dogs have the routine that they are used to, and I'm trying to continue with that. This routine is mostly sleeping, and wanting to go outside midday, when our dog-walker typically comes. ~Max~The quiet moments in between, when I'm not napping, I have been spent reading, cruising Facebook, and watching cooking shows, which is a favorite way that I love to pass time - Even though I am not a fancy cook and I am certainly not a home-chef. Nevertheless, it doesn't keep me (or anyone) from learning about and loving food and of course going out and trying new restaurants because, well, I love to eat.💓But back to the cooking shows. I've been watching Julia Child's cooking show from the 1960's.  For those of you who don't know or remember who Julia Child is, you may remember the 2009 movie about her, Julie and Julia - And if you didn't see the movie, I'll tell you that she is a famous chef, author, and television personality, who made French cuisine accessible to American audiences. She was one of the first women to host her own cooking show on television, providing tips and lessons on how to prepare French food simply and easily.~Foster Girl, Jaycee~I've really enjoyed watching \"The French Chef\" a couple of  mornings a week, and I am even learning a few things along the way. In these old episodes, I've been taking Julia's simple advice and for fun, I've been posting her advice on Facebook and adding my thoughts to a specific day that I'm home recovering. So, I'll share a couple of my favorites with you. **On DAY THREE of my at home recovery, Julia Child's advice for the day was:**If you're alone in the kitchen and you drop the lamb, you can always just pick it up. Who's going to know?** This is really true, who would know, right? However in my world, it will only work if you can beat that 2 or 3 second dog who always sees whatever you drop at that moment it's dropped. (photo below is Jake and Ree).   **On DAY NINE of my home recovery and Julia Child's advice for the day was: *to not be afraid of eggs.* I've never met an egg I was afraid of, and our girl Ree, on the left, certainly isn't afraid of them, and I've no doubt that very, very soon, Jaycee won't be leery of eggs and will love to eat them as much as we all do. And finally,  **on DAY TWELVE of my home recovery and Julia Child's advice for the day was to **BE FEARLESS and have fun.** Todd is of course the most fearless in our house, not even afraid of his shadow, and I think he has fun too! I hope you've had a fun weekend - Onto my 3rd week at home."},

When we put him into his crate, to be fed, etc., he has started to whine and bark. Could it be that at almost 11 years old, he's outgrown being crated? What do you think?"},

", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2022", "text": "Many thanks for your kind and supportive comments on my last post and for cheering me on as I heal from my recent surgery. You all are the best!💓I know I'm going to have to get into some kind of routine while I'm home for about a month. But I'm still feeling pretty tired, so napping is at the top of my list. ~Throwback Thursday for National Puppy Day - Todd as a brand-new puppy~A few weeks ago, a friend of mine, who also owns one of Todd's siblings said that the white fur on their side are \"angel wings.\" I'd never thought of them that way. But I've been giving this some thought and I'm wondering if that's true. Right now, while I am putting this post together, Todd is lying at my feet, sleeping; and whenever I get up for something, he wakes up and follows me wherever I go. He never goes to bed until I do, and sleeps next to me until I get up. So, maybe they are wings and Todd is my guardian angel who keeps watch and makes sure I am okay. What do you think?  Can a Scottish Terrier who has so much spark, is full of fun and mischief be an angel?"},
{"title": "At Home for Now", "date": "Tuesday, March 22, 2022", "text": "This post has nothing to do with our dogs. It's about me. So, please forgive me from veering away from the usual topic.  But I've decided to share a little bit about a personal \"journey\" I've been on the last year. It was about this time last year I started having signs of something being wrong that at first, I just ignored. When the symptoms didn't go away, I knew I had to see a doctor. I also knew I could not do as my Mother had done when she had those same things happening to her, when her Mother had them, when my Aunt had them and my cousins too. So, fast forward thru waiting for appointments, tests and consoles. None of the test results were 100% conclusive, because they only showed precancerous changes - But with my family history, and my symptoms, I felt strongly in my mind and heart that I couldn't follow the path that other family members had, including my own Mother and wait and see if things worsened or just do nothing, and then, it may be too late to do anything curative.So, I did something; last Friday I had a \"preventative\" surgery to remove any chances of cancer occurring. It was a difficult and very personal decision - So personal, that it's not easy for me to talk about, but I feel like I should. But I struggled and prayed about the decision to have surgery for months. I tried to have faith in what I knew to be the right thing to do. But in those quiet moments, the doubts would always find a way to creep in. ~My lonely hospital room~Even after the surgery, I still had doubts that *maybe* I'd made the wrong choice. But on Sunday morning, I noticed that blooming in my weedy flower bed, is a single daffodil. I know it's not unusual to see daffodils blooming in March. But it's unusual because I've never planted any daffodils, or had any in my yard in the more than 12 years we've lived here.Daffodils blooming are said to signify new life and resilience because they are survivors who have weathered the winter storms -- And this one being a bit worse for wear, I feel like is a reminder, just for me, that everything is okay. And that maybe I'm like this single daffodil, a \"weathered, resilient, survivor\" and I'm going to be okay and continue to bloom too.  So, I'm home and off work until at least until mid-April. I'm feeling pretty well, and I am up around. Friends have provided meals, and so we are very well fed, and I am so very grateful and thankful for their kind thoughtfulness. Let the healing begin. ~Gerbera Daises from a friend~"},

You understand all about having a dog like Jaycee --  A great reminder of why I love the blogging community! Its been a pretty good week for Jaycee. We are working on her housetraining, and getting her used to having a routine. It's slow progress, we take a few steps forward, only to go back one or two. But we're only about a week into this, and we're not in a hurry. I know it'll come together for her. One step Jaycee took as she begins her new life was to be spayed on Friday. She did well, but was nauseous when she woke up from her surgery, so we decided to let her spend the night at the vet's office. ~Waking up from surgery~I picked her up this morning. But I was second guessing not picking up Jaycee last evening. A winter storm that produced snow from the Plains into a powerful \"bomb cyclone\" was blasting the East Coast with heavy snow and high winds at the same time I was trying to get to the vet's office before they closed for the day. There were total white-outs along the way, making the drive pretty dicey. Thankfully I got there and back without too much trouble. I was so glad to be home. And I think Jaycee is too! Even if she's not happy about wearing the dreaded \"cone of shame\" that she shouldn't feel \"shame\" about wearing. It's all about her starting the next chapters of her life. ❤"},
{"title": "Jaycee Arrives at Golden Pines", "date": "Sunday, March 6, 2022", "text": "Just over a week ago, from a farm in Pennsylvania, 8-year-old Jaycee arrived at Golden Pines. Used for breeding her entire life, she's now learning all about another kind of life that includes living inside and one that will not involve puppies.Understandably Jaycee is tentative and nervous but is proving to be a quick study, quickly learning about treats and different kinds of food - She doesn't (yet) like carrots, green beans or other vegetables - But she does like cheese, bread and loved crunching on ice cubes yesterday. She is also not shy about asking for attention, and giving you her big paw to hold. ❤For the most part, Jaycee is healthy. She is a big girl, over 100 pounds, and needs to be spayed after she loses a few pounds. And as you maybe can see by the below photo, she is missing a lot of her chocolate-colored coat. Intros to our group have been very slow, and aside from Jack having a bit of an attitude towards her, (not unusual) she's getting along with the other dogs just fine and learning about cats. Our girl Ree really wants to play with her. ~Ree hoping Jaycee will come back and play with her~Jaycee may have quickly learned to trust us, but she's not trusting everyone she's met. If I have any concerns it's that for some reason Jaycee doesn't like my brother. We were pretty sure that it had something to do with his having a beard; probably resembling the Amish who are part of her past. Without my asking, my brother shaved off his beard. I thought that was a very kind gesture because he's had that beard for a very long time! The other person that Jaycee seems to be afraid of is our dog-walker. \"Lydia\" thinks that it has to do with Jaycee being alone and confined when she comes. Jaycee did much better the second day she came by giving her lots of treats which is encouraging. I'm hopeful that both my brother and Lydia will win Jaycee over in no time! ~Jaycee, all smiles one week later~ Welcome to Jaycee and onto next week!And as a postscript, I'll add that I practically NEVER know who previous owners were or exactly where my foster dogs come from with Lab Rescue - But this time, I accidentally found out and out of curiosity I looked the owner up online where I found that he'd been fined a couple of times for keeping his dogs in too small cages. Despite that, I'm grateful that Jaycee was given to the rescue, and has the chance at the life all dogs deserve. Sadly not all dogs like Jaycee get that chance.  ***Know where your cute puppies are coming from.***"},

Not this year. ~A snowy morning 2 weeks ago~But you can feel it in the air that the warmer days are coming. Todd and Max went yesterday for their spring haircuts. Max missed being groomed in September because he'd hurt his knee and had become what can only be called a \"hot mess.\" ~Hot-Mess-Max~Now transformed, and all that shagginess-insulation gone, Max is (of course) cold, and after I put a coat on him, he slept the day away under a warmed towel. At nearly 12 years old, spa days are starting to wear him out. Nothing wears Todd out though, at least not that I can see. He's always ready for what may happen next, whatever that may be. As is our girl Ree. Speaking of the next happening at our house, it is the arrival of a new girl, named Jaycee this past week. I'll tell you all about her in my next post.

You may remember from my last post that I wasn't feeling well and stayed home from work on a Monday. I was feeling better, and went to work on Tuesday. ~No more staying home for me?~However my van had other plans, and I became a roadside casualty, in one of the worst places. Thankfully, thanks to a county sheriff, and a quick arriving tow-truck driver within a couple of hours my van and I were safely at the repair shop, and a friend brought me home to wait for the diagnosis on my van. That news wouldn't come until the next day.  What didn't wait was the diagnosis that my brother tested positive for covid. He'd come home from work not feeling well 3-4 days earlier, and I'd told him in my best sister-voice to \"stay away from me.\" I guess it didn't work - Because without my even taking a test, we decided that despite my few symptoms, I'd probably had covid as well - thanks to my brother. Although I was feeling much better, our office protocol meant that I needed stay home. So I didn't return to work until this past Monday, 12 days later. Maybe my van breaking down at that same time was a blessing in disguise, I don't know. But I do know that other than a little cough, I'm fine, no temperature or lasting symptoms. My brother has tested negative and my van has also recovered.  However we find ourselves having to consider a new vehicle for me. With all the driving I do, I need reliable transportation, and my van keeps letting me down. The dogs of course don't care about any of that. And Todd didn't care about keeping his coat on in the single digit temperatures - He just wanted a cookie! And Tiggy the cat, Todd and Jack didn't care that I'd just made up the bed.But a kind friend did care that I was having a bad week, and sent a me a little bit of summer in the middle of winter. I'm reminded to be grateful for my kind and thoughtful friends. ❤"},

He's relying on us to help him get to his feet. Once he's up, he gets around with not too many problems, but an appointment with the vet is on list of things to schedule. I'm not quite sure what the \"disconnect\" is with his needing so much help. But I'm thinking acupuncture or cold laser therapy (or both) may be in his future and that will hopefully help him.~George ❤~Our outdoor kitty \"White Boy\" wasn't exactly in a good place last week, when he found himself stuck on the roof after our last snowfall. I heard White Boy crying and I thought he was trapped in our woods somewhere and Carl was looking for him there, and couldn't find him - But when he turned around to come back towards the house, Carl spotted him on our roof. Cats! As to how White Boy got up on the roof, there is an arborvitae pine tree in front of our garage, that almost reaches the gutter, and even though it has small bendy-branches, he must've found some way to climb it and get on the roof.  Why he climbed the tree and got on the roof is anyone's guess, but there was no way he was going to be able to get down on his own. When Carl handed down him to me, he started purring. I'm sure he was happy for that adventure to end.It goes without saying Todd of course prefers to keep his feet on the ground -- A little tidbit about Todd, is that even though he only weighs about 25 pounds, (about 11 kg) he doesn't like to be picked up. He's a Scottie after all, and not a cat -- We're both glad about that. 🙂Or snow from last week has all melted, and according to the weathermen, we're on track for a winter-storm tomorrow that will bring snow, ice and end with rain.  We'll see if they get it right. The weathermen also noted that as of today, it's 64 days until Spring! ~Shaggy Max!~"},

You have made a difference for me. ~A Very Shaggy Max~Our holidays were really nice. As stress free as they could be despite working and the rush to get to the finish line to get everything done. We did keep a pair of foster dogs that were also with us this past fall for a few days. Ginger and Charlie returned just before Christmas, and left New Year's Day. The two were fun and the perfect houseguests. Ginger is a toy-burier-extraordinaire, and we had to keep an eye on her when she had toys, because she was so good at it!~The lovely Ginger~~The Handsome Charlie~Our dogs like them, and aside from a few growls from Ginger, everyone got along. As we were saying good-bye, I'd wished that I'd taken some new photos of them - The ones above were taken in the fall.And since we're on the subject of pairs of dogs - Below is an update on Hansel and Gretel that came the day after Christmas and was posted on Facebook. I could not have been happier to read \"MC's\" fun post and that this very special pair that I adore has found the best forever home! I honestly felt like I'd been given a Christmas gift! So, we begin the year on a good note. I took Monday off work, and snow is expected for us in the morning. I cannot wait.

{"title": "A Christmas Tradition", "date": "Tuesday, December 14, 2021", "text": "Every single year I make an annual pilgrimage to a German grocery store, named Aldi's and buy a German Christmas stollen. I'll confess, that I'm not a huge fan of them. But for more years than I can remember, my Mom always bought them and sent me a couple for the holidays. She really loved stollen and even kept a few in her freezer to have through the year, enjoying a piece with a cup of tea. So I do the same. I buy a loaf from Aldi's of the marzipan stollen, and have a piece with a cup of tea and remember her. It's a Christmas tradition. Do you have any Christmas traditions like this? I hope your week is off to a good start! **For those who don't know what stollen is, here's a bit of it's story.Stollen is a cake like yeast bread that usually has dried or candied fruit, orange and lemon zest, spice and cardamom spices for flavoring.  It is coated with powdered sugar or icing sugar and often containing marzipan. It was also called Striezel or Christstollen. Striezel is a word for loaf, and the shape of the bread along with being dusted with powdered sugar was a symbolic shape of the baby Jesus in swaddling clothes so it was also called Christstollen.Dresden Stollen is said by some historians to have originated in 1329 as a result of a contest offered by the Bishop of Nauruburg. Bakers in the region produced a wonderful bread baked with the finest butter, sugar, raisins, citron and other specialty ingredients. The Bishop enjoyed the stollen so much that he ordered a quantity of grain saved for stollen only.Stollen is mentioned for the first time in 1474 in the accounts of the Christian Hospital of St. Bartholomew in Dresden where it is referred to as a cake for the fasting period, consisting of only flour, oats and water as required by Church dogma.Stollen became such a part of Dresdeners' lives that it was cut and served with special, stollen only utensils. It was also tradition that the first piece of stollen was set aside and kept to ensure the family would be able to afford a stollen the following year and the last piece saved to ensure the family had enough food for the year.~Jake, hoping for a bite of stollen ❤~"},

Well, at least that was the plan. That's not what happened. There was a small \"complication\" and the doctor thought it best to stay overnight. I was never, ever expecting that, and I was totally unprepared. I didn't even have a phone charger. Thankfully there were no complications overnight and I was feeling better and on my way home early Tuesday afternoon. I will add that the nurses were so nice, and did a wonderful job taking care of me, even if they did come in every 3 hours and woke me up to take my temperature and blood-pressure. ~Settled in my boring hospital room~I don't even have to say that it totally threw me off. I went back to work on Wednesday, exhausted and my sleep-cycle totally out of synch. I did my best, but by Wednesday night and into Thursday morning, I was having a hard time keeping it all together and at home alone, I was barely hanging on. I had so much to do, and it needed to get done. The needed respite came mid-morning when Lab Rescue contacted me and said that the kennel had boarding space for Hansel and Gretel. I was so sad to have to take them back to boarding. ~Gretel~I have really grown to love those two. And even though it was not what I wanted, it was what was needed. We tried to get them used to being around the cats, but that urge to chase and bark at them just couldn't be contained or controlled. We all really miss them. Especially Ree, who loved playing with them too. Jack and Shelby also had a yearly vet appointment, and by late afternoon, I was crying again as I dropped off Hansel and Gretel for boarding. I just kept going. I had to. My office holiday party at a local restaurant was Friday afternoon, and I was the sole planner and organizer for our office of 11 people. I somehow managed to get the last minute preparations all done and it was a nice party. I'm usually one of the last to leave any event like this. But not this time. I was the first to leave. I came home got the dogs fed, and I was in bed by 8:30. ~A very shaggy-Max~Today has been a day of napping and getting caught up. I still have one more day before I get to do the week all over again.

In her 140-ish days with us, she found endless bowls of food, soft dog beds and our bed to sleep on, and whatever medications were needed to relieve her aches, pains, and her tummy troubles. While with us Sheeba forged canine and feline friendships, and the two of us formed what I can only describe as a true bond.💔. I will miss her sticking her head in the shower and barking for me to hurry up and get her breakfast - the same bark I'd hear while fixing her dinner, and telling us it was time for bed, and the one telling me to ask one of the dogs to move so she could come and lay at my feet. More than anything I'll miss Sheeba always being underfoot, and following me every where, and waiting patiently and sometimes impatiently by the door for my return. ~First photo of Sheeba in July~Our time with her, was of course way too short.

Gretel had been found with another Black Lab, that the shelter named Hansel (below) Both are estimated to be about 12 years old. And what their relationship is to one another is anyone's guess. But there is definitely a relationship and a bond between the two.Gretel's photo on the website got a lot of attention. There were more than 3,000 shares of her photo, and many offers from people willing to go the shelter and adopt her.  Hansel's photo didn't garner that much attention, just over 500 shares, and very few offers from people wanting to meet him. I am quite sure it's because his shelter-photo (above) didn't grab your heart like Gretel's had. I let Lab Rescue know about this pair, as did many others. Fast forward through the evaluation from the Rescue, and soon transport from North Carolina to Virginia was being arranged for them.I followed all of that. Something about this lost-boy and lost-girl, that I just couldn't forget about. And I really wanted to meet that girl that had stolen my heart. And when I found out that they were at a nearby vet, I sheepishly made an offer to foster them. So, Hansel and Gretel arrived a week ago Thursday. This friendly and energetic duo were constant motion those first few days. They were a blur as they ran and happily played together in our yard. The end of the first day they were wide-eyed and totally exhausted. They have met and get along with our crew. They are really a nice and fun pair! They do have a few issues regarding their health, but we're working through them. And at some point in time, Gretel who shows all the outward signs of having had puppies, will need to be spayed. But there's been one problem. Our cats. They are way more reactive to them than I'm comfortable with. They bark at and chase them, and I'm quite sure the cats have each used at least one or two of their 9 lives being just barely a whisker faster than they are. So, unfortunately, I've had to ask for them to be moved to another foster home. And until that happens, the cats are being kept safe, and we get to have fun getting to know and enjoy Hansel and Gretel. At this moment, of course, I don't know what their entire story will be, or where they will end up.  But I do know, that Hansel and Gretel will live happily-ever-after. ❤HanselGretel"},

{"title": "Managing ", "date": "Sunday, October 24, 2021", "text": "One of the things that has been bothering me for months about our dogs, is that they couldn't all be together at once. When you have different personalities, sometimes, it's just not possible. So, to keep  everyone safe, we \"manage\" those dogs, keeping one dog separated from the another. The dog that we are \"managing\" the most, is none other, than you guessed it, Todd. Knowing that our foster boy Jack, doesn't like the boys as much, we kept he and Todd away from each other. If one was outside, the other was free in the house. If Todd was inside, Jack was outside. In the evenings, Todd stayed locked in his crate, and Jack was allowed with the other dogs, and at bedtime, Todd was let out, and Jack was crated overnight.~The Very Handsome Jack~It was working. But I was feeling guilty about it because I was really feeling like this wasn't fair to either of them.It became even more complicated when Ree entered the picture. At 4 years old, I thought she was way too energetic and playful for Todd and Jack too. So, we kept Ree away from both of them. Now we were \"managing\" three dogs that we thought couldn't be together. ~Ree~When Carl went out of town, I was left to care for all the dogs. I decided I'd had enough of all that \"managing.\" So, I decided I was going to try putting the three dogs together outside and see what would happen.  And you know what happened? I'll tell you what happened, nothing happened. There was no growling. There was no snapping.. There was no fight. The three all went about their own business, and were and are all fine together. Okay, Ree didn't and doesn't exactly mind her own business, she loves the two boys, but the bottom line is, the three all get along. ~Mealtime!!~Finally, I love that all the dogs can be together! I'm not having to \"manage\" where at any given moment they might be. I don't have to worry about where Ree is (probably on the bed), where Jack is, (usually in the office on his bed,) and where Todd is, (almost always in his now-open door-crate snoozing, or outside watching the world go by). I know the three of them are much happier. Actually, we are all happier and relaxed. And I'll add that none of the dogs are crated at night. ~Jack and Gerry~But I am however wondering, just what the heck was I worried about?"},
{"title": "Drumroll please…..We're back!!!!", "date": "Friday, October 22, 2021", "text": "Well, hello blogging friends! It has been nearly a month. I have missed you. Thank-you to those of you who messaged asking if we were okay. It was so thoughtful of you to think of us. To answer that question about how we are, I can tell you that we all are just fine. Yes, we are just fine, with the exception of a bit of writers block, and that ole familiar feeling of guilt because behind the scenes for a while, I was having problems keeping up and catching up. We all know that the reality is that catching up never ends. There will always something that needs tending to. And I'm always going to feel guilty about something. It's just who I am.But it was all getting harder and harder and I was losing my focus. I knew I had to stop that kind of madness. I found I needed to call a truce. I am a real news and political-junkie so I took a break from the news and politics. I turned off the TV and I even went outside, and sat on my front porch. I also took a break of sorts from social media. I love and want so much to keep up with family and friends on social media. I know that I don't have to read everything that is posted. And I know very well that I need to get over my F.O.M.O. -- That's my fear of missing out. But for whatever reason, I was feeling like I needed to watch every video, read every email, tweet, and Facebook update. Even though the chances were pretty good that if I did miss something, it was going to be repeated. I had to end that endless game. It honestly was making me irritable and cranky and hard to live with and be around. I needed to make a change and reconnect in a more meaningful way, and make that phone call to my oldest brother and others who aren't on social media, that I've been missing, but felt I just didn't have time for. With all that, things in my daily life have started to come back into balance for me. I know I need to stop dwelling and being irritated by the news, by what's happening at work, and what didn't get done yesterday or what needs to get done tomorrow, and focus on what’s going on right now. So, with the month long break, I'm back with the goal of starting fresh and being more mindful of the need to have and keep that balance, and not let the news and other things consume me like they had been. It's not easy to end what has become a habit. It's also not easy to stop being so critical of yourself when you feel you've fallen short in so many way. But I know it's worth it to try. It really does feel good to get this post written and to be back. Thank-you for stopping by. I hope you'll come back, I have so much I want to tell you.❤"},

I think that made it worse.Monday - Off to work. Traffic is getting back to having pre-pandemic delays as people return to their offices and kids are back at school.Tuesday - hornets, or yellow jackets, I don't know which, have eaten the few pears we have on our tree. We knocked the pears off the tree to try and get rid of them. It's a total loss of the fruit.Wednesday evening - How I feel when my work week is over. 😊 Thursday - Deer watching and just being outside. It was a gorgeous day.Friday - A really busy day. I left the house at 8:30 to get to the groomers by 9:45 with Todd and Jake. Max was on the list to be groomed too, but we decided that his hurt knee still needs a few more weeks. Jake has been totally transformed. Irina (our groomer) took more off of his coat than I wanted. But we talked about it, and she thought it was best. I totally trust her judgement. Jake's coat was so thick and so heavy and I know he will feel better, and not be so hot, even though the weather has suddenly turned cooler. 46° this morning.~All the hair that was removed from Jake~A very tired Todd afterwards.Saturday - Our day is just beginning.

So grab a snack, get comfy and I'll tell you what we've been up to.Carl went to see family out of state, leaving me to be the single-dog-mom, which as you can figure, took a lot of time.~Our very handsome foster boy, Jack~I did what I could to wear the dogs out, which involved walks and playing ball. Todd with his Scottie sized mouth, can fit two tennis balls in his mouth at once. I've made the trek more than once to Mobile Vets office. First was our newest arrival, Jake. This big boy weighed in at a smidge over 100 pounds. He was really good at the vet, and all tests that were returned show that he's a healthy 13 year old boy. At home he's settled in really nicely. His pal appears to be Todd. They spend time outside together, barking at the deer, or whatever the two think needs to be barked at. I think Jake is having a good time.Our boy Max, who had two knee surgeries almost exactly 5 years ago, somehow hurt his knee. So, he's on limited activity. Bringing up the rear for vet appoints was Todd. His was just for his yearly exam, rabies vaccine and bloodwork. At 10 years old, it was a first for him to have senior blood work.  ~Todd got a bandage from the vet, and I got the bill~Our hospice foster girl Sheeba is doing well. Sadly, the cancer shehas is taking its toll on her appearance, and she's painfully thin, even though she eats enough for 2-3 dogs every day. She always barks at me when I am in bed, and then she stands there and stares at me. It occurred to me that she may want onto the bed, so I put her up on the bed with me. It didn't take long for her to fall asleep and start snoring. I guess it's what she's always wanted. Now she wants to be on the bed every night. ❤Shedding season has also started, and it was Shelby's turn for a bath and an overdue brushing out. In the meantime, Ree ate a bar of soap....And George is the one that ended up with a bad upset stomach. Go figure.Our mailbox disappeared.... I think it got knocked off by a passing truck or something like that.And my longtime and very dreaded nemesis, the dreaded Brown Marmorated Stinkbug has reappeared.  I have to say, they are one thing I could do without. Whatever you're having to put up with or without, I hope all is well in your corner of the world.

I've spoken with a coordinator at Lab Rescue and of course the rescue will accept her, I just need to sign my ownership of her over to them. I'm very grateful to have that option for Ree. But I'm finding that I'm not quite ready. A couple of people have networked her within their circle of friends, and there has been some interest. But so far, nothing has really come from it. Todd enjoying his time outside on these hot sunny days lets me do the worrying about everything - And he remained unfazed as a week ago today, we welcomed a new arrival, named Jake. Jake originally belonged to someone who had gotten divorced, and was serving in the military. The Mom and Dad took Jake, but they are and now retired, and are busy babysitting their grandchildren and are hardly ever home. They felt that Jake was lonely and they wanted him to be in a home where he would get a lot of attention. Jake at 11 or 12 years old, already has the claim to fame of being the biggest Golden we have ever fostered. I don't know what he weighs, but I have no doubt he tips the scales at over 100 pounds. He is a big boy. At first Jake was a bit overwhelmed by everything and for a day or so he stayed turned away from us. I was so sad for him, and of course I tried to reassure him. But then he realized that he was going to be okay, and the tail wags and smiling started. He's a nice boy that is getting along with everyone. He really does like attention, and is getting into the routine of his new life. Welcome to Jake. We look forward to getting to know him, and being part of his story."},

They drove from where they live Connecticut -- Allentown was about 4 hours away, around half-way for both of us. We went into this knowing that Jodi and her husband may not be a match. But I'd really hoped that by staying overnight in a hotel, they'd meet Ree, get to spend some time with her, fall in love, and do whatever they could to make it work, and live happily ever after. At least that was my plan. ~Ree did well at the hotel, she loved the bed!~Jodi is struggling with back issues, and is sometimes not so steady on her feet. So, unfortunately for that reason, and Ree being a big girl, and a bit bouncy (sometimes jumping up) they were not a match. It goes without saying that I understand and totally respect those reasons. I know Jodi is also really disappointed. But I hoped .... We both had really hoped.  Of course I am really, really sad and depressed about it. I think Jodi and her husband would have been a wonderful home and I really wanted them to be a match. So when I get over the disappointment that I'm feeling, I'll regroup and decide what to do next.I know the cosmos is responsible for bringing Ree to us, and I hope you'll send some vibes back into the cosmos as we continue the journey to help Ree find her new forever home."},
{"title": "Ree Arrives at Golden Pines", "date": "Saturday, August 14, 2021", "text": "I've been holding off posting this for several reasons - Because a week ago Thursday, we welcomed a four-year-old girl into our household, named Ree. Ree comes to us **not** via Lab Rescue, but rather through a series of crazy events that only the cosmos can take credit for. At some point, when the dust settles I will tell you Ree's story, that unfortunately involved people who lied and saw Ree as a way to make money. However, I will tell you that Ree's original owner could not keep her because her husband was going into long term care, and to be able to provide for his care, she needed to sell her home. This part of Ree's story is the part that the cosmos arranged, reminding me of what a small world it is, and how connected the dog-community is too; because last year at about this time, I became acquainted with Ree's original owner -- And that's all I can/will say right now. But I will add that I have full ownership of Ree, no strings attached. Ree is of course totally oblivious to what is going on around her, and what brought her to us. She's a fun girl, that is getting along pretty well with our crew. The cats however, are a different story. Ree thinks they are great fun to chase, so we're working on curbing that. Aside from cat chasing, and not wanting to instead chase a ball, she has pretty good house manners and is eager for adventure and loves attention. ~Ree wishing there was no fence between her and Gerry, our outdoor kitty~At 4 years old, Ree is a bit young for our crowd. And I am looking towards finding a forever home for her on my own, or Lab Rescue if needed. Next weekend, Ree is meeting a long time blogging friend, Jodi from Heart Like a Dog, to see if they are a match. Jodi thinks that Ree may be too young and energetic for her. She's been looking and hoping for a smaller Lab that is a bit older. I totally understand that Ree doesn't match any of that, given that she will be 5 in December, and is a big girl at nearly 90 pounds. But Jodi has agreed to at least meet Ree, and consider her. So, I'm hoping that the cosmos will continue to do their magic, and make them a match!"},
{"title": "A Forever Home for Cooper! ", "date": "Sunday, August 8, 2021", "text": "Just as I hoped, Cooper found his forever home on Thursday. I loved the couple, John and Mari, both retired professors, who cannot be more kind, gracious, and perfect for Cooper.  Someone said, and I agree that given his separation anxiety, this is Cooper's best chance at a new forever home. Updates have so far,  all been positive ones. Cooper is settling in and they are thrilled and so happy to have him as part of their lives! By the looks in the photo below, he is comfortable and feeling right at home!I do have to add a little caveat to this story. Lab Rescue asks foster homes to post information about our foster dogs along with photos on their Facebook page every week, just to give them some visibility and maybe get someone to notice them. With over 80 dogs available right now for adoption, and adoptions at an all time low, it's needed, especially now. And I'm not creative by any stretch, but I decided to do something different and add a little something to Cooper's photo two weeks ago. No one commented on it, and I'd pretty much forgotten about it. But when Mari and Jeff came to meet Cooper the other day, I couldn't help but notice, that Mari, who is an artist, had printed out that photo, and made a little notebook out of it. She said that was what made her notice Cooper. So, I guess a little flair can sometimes go a long way. Even if you're like me and not creative!"},
{"title": "Welcome August!!", "date": "Sunday, August 1, 2021", "text": "Goodbye July . . . Welcome August!!I know I always complain about time passing me by. But this time, I'm changing my tune and am saying that it feels like July lasted forever! With my counterpart on vacation for a week, and then out sick for two weeks, and our 'back up girl' out of town because of family, it left me to filling in at work on my days off. However, I did manage a quick trip with Max to see the sunflowers in Maryland.At home the arrival of Sheeba and the loss of Sunny of course added to the pressure I was already feeling. But through it all, I was grateful for my vacation in June; because even though I was really tired and worn out, after a good nights sleep, I felt like the next day I had the energy to keep going. Our newest arrival Sheeba hasn't come without her own challenges. I've been really worried about her. She wasn't eating, and was having problems breathing. She spent an entire day at the vet where they took an x-ray and kept an eye on her. They found nothing, which made my heart break even more for her.  And because Sheeba is considered a \"hospice dog\" there isn't much that Lab Rescue will do for her, other than provide palliative and supportive care. I feel like it has been left to me to try and find a way to keep her going.  But that's my job as her caretaker. And so it has taken 2 weeks, and knock, knock, knock on wood, she is finally eating pretty close to an entire meal again (albeit canned food). But I am so happy and relived that she seems to have an appetite for something. I'm giving her whatever she wants and as much as she wants to eat. And she now seems happy and much more comfortable. The short video below was her 2 weeks ago when she felt so crummy. If it doesn't show below, here's a link ....All that aside, Sheeba is a really nice and lovely dog, and our crew like her very much. Looking ahead, I'm looking forward to getting back into the routine of a 3 day work week. And wish us luck, because on Thursday I am meeting a retired couple from Annapolis, who called today and are interested in adopting our foster boy Cooper. They seem perfect for him, and I'm hopeful. So, onto August we go. It's easy to see that the days are getting a little shorter, the leaves rustle a little different in the wind. I also noticed the other day that the stores are filled with school supplies for the upcoming school year. Fall will be here before we all know it."},
{"title": "Good-Bye to Our Sunny-Sunshine", "date": "Saturday, July 17, 2021", "text": "Thursday was a sad day for us as we said good-bye to who I called our \"problem child,\" Sunny. ~A last and favorite photo of Sunny~Sunny was a bit of a stubborn soul, with a sometimes short fuse and he would snap when you grabbed his collar or when he didn't want to do something or be fooled with.  Longtime readers of this blog may remember that because of how reactive Sunny could be, the rescue knew that he could not be safely placed in another home -- and at the time, I didn't want to keep him. So, a decision was made by the rescue to euthanize him. It was a decision that I respected, understood and supported. But in the end, to put it simply, my heart took over and I couldn't go through with it. I felt that there was a lot of good in Sunny, and that he deserved a chance. A chance to live his life.  And so, Sunny became ours. We knew Sunny's limits.  And we respected him and those limits. Because we knew that with some space and a moment for him to decide, he would always agree to do what we asked of him. I know he would do it because he trusted and respected us. And if it was something he didn't want to do, like have his nails trimmed, or see the vet, we always found a way to keep him and everyone safe. Sunny loved meeting the newcomers, and he got along well with them and his packmates, especially Max. Being independent and a bit of a lone dog by nature, he stayed mostly in the background, not liking his picture taken, or being the center of attention, or part of a lot of activity - Sunny loved one-on-one attention, and our best moments together were just the two of us, not asking for anything from the other. And so, at about the age of 15, and for exactly 8 years + one day, Sunny lived his life with us totally on his terms; and when we kept him, we agreed to those terms. I would have lived no other way with him. God speed to our boy, Sunny Sunshine, who like the others before him, is missed and I will look forward to seeing again one day. ❤❤~Sunny on the day we met in July 15, 2013~"},
{"title": "Sheeba Arrives at Golden Pines! ", "date": "Tuesday, July 6, 2021", "text": "In the early months of coronavirus lockdowns, a lot of people found themselves with extra time at home -- leading many to finally welcome a dog or cat into their family. But unfortunately, with lockdown restrictions lifting, many are now surrendering and rehoming their “pandemic pets.” We're hearing on the news that some animal shelters are reporting increased rates of people surrendering their dogs and cats. Whether that's true or not, what I do know is that Lab Rescue the past several weeks has been bombarded with Labs in shelters that need a place to go.  Despite all of that, and a shortage of foster homes, I'd thought because we have Cooper, Jack and Shelby that we wouldn't be asked to take another dog.  But we were. On Saturday, we welcomed 14+ year old Sheeba. Her family lost their home, and surrendered her to a local shelter. She was being cared for by another foster home, but a busy summer schedule left them unable to continue to care for her -- Unfortunately while Sheeba was with them, she had to have surgery to remove a mass that was found to be malignant. The vets have given her a prognosis of 6-12 months .... So, she is a \"hospice foster\" and will be with us for the remainder of her life. On the bright side, Sheeba is an easy going and nice girl, that has easily fit in with our crew. After 3 days, she's still trying to get into her new routine - Which is really important because for the past two nights at about 2:30 in the morning, I woke up to find her standing by the bedside, looking at me and wagging her tail. When she sees that I am awake, she starts barking at me. I'm not sure what she was trying to tell me. Is she having bad dreams, is she lonely, are the cats causing some mischief?  Whatever it is, she doesn't want to go outside, but she is happy to get a treat and some attention. I'm hoping that this doesn't become a nightly routine. I'm hopeful we'll get it all figured out.Welcome to Golden Pines, Sheeba. We're glad you're here, and we look forward to getting to know you....

I swear it feels like last week that I was talking about Memorial Day! Can we push a giant pause button, because as I always say, the time keeps going by way too fast. I've been back from Tennessee for a couple of weeks now, and I am still “getting back” into the routine. My time there could not have been any better, unless it was for a few more days. A longtime friend that dated one of my brothers in 1975 spent a couple of days with me. We ate too much of all the wrong things, and stayed up too late. All the things needed to recharge your batteries. Back at home, for the most part, things have settled back into a routine. We had a bit of a setback with Cooper and his separation anxiety that unfortunately caused a bit of damage to the house. Thankfully Cooper was uninjured. We could only think it was because of the change to his routine. So, the next day instead of leaving him at home alone while we were at work, the rescue arranged for me to take him to a doggie-daycare for the day -- I think the photo below says what Cooper thought of it all!He had a great time and he got a good report too!I decided that instead of leaving Cooper at home alone on the days when no one can be with him, my peace of mind is worth the price for him to go to daycare. So, I'm going to ask the rescue to let him go at least one or two days a week while we are at work. Summer really is flying by all of a sudden and I hope we can all take full advantage of every day that we can. ❤"},

But these are different.

Maybe it's because it's taking place all around us, and because there are so many, we can't ignore them. And since their parents lived here before we did, and the ones that we are seeing did too, we are doing our best to not mow them, weed-whack them or step on them. Or let the dogs eat them, which is what some dogs in the area have been doing. Ours thankfully are not. Cicadas don’t bite or sting, or eat anything and so for the next several weeks, our yard, is their yard too!I think there's enough room for all of us."},
{"title": "The Phone Call", "date": "Sunday, May 16, 2021", "text": "I had a little bit of a surprise this week - While I was at work, Judy's son, *A* called me and asked me to return his call.  You will of course remember that he wanted to euthanize both Tiggy and Sophie when Judy went to live in a nursing home. For a couple of reasons, I was a bit leery about calling him - Because I will admit that I had a bit of a grudge against him for what I viewed as being callused and heartless towards Sophie and Tiggy. ~Tiggy~But I will say, that those feelings had lessoned over the last several months because *A* had paid all or part of the vet bill for Sophie when she'd seen her vet, *Dr S* in October. Of course at the time I said I would pay the bill, just as I said several times that I would do for Sophie's final vet visit. But I was told each time by Dr. S to not be concerned about it, that her vet bills would all be taken care of. Despite being told that, I still wondered if what prompted*A's* call to me, had to do with money and Sophie's final expenses, because I'd asked for her ashes to be returned to me - Which is an expense outside of vet care.The lesson here is, to not judge and remember that everything is not always about money. Because Sophie's vet bills were not the reason for *A's* call. Well, at least not all of it. He wanted to thank me for taking care of Sophie and Tiggy and giving them a home together. He also wanted to apologize for not reaching out sooner. He then went on to explain to me about the pressure he was under at the time with his Mother and moving her into a care facility, etc. *A* felt that he had no choices with Sophie and Tiggy, because he could not keep them. In listening to him, I could tell it was a difficult time for him. *A* really didn't know what to do other than euthanize them.... Thankfully Dr. S and Irina (our groomer who gave me Sophie) were there to help him with them both.  We had a good conversation. *A* talked about the longtime friendship he and his Mom (Judy) have had with both Dr. S, and his memories of Dr. Howard (the previous practice owner) who owned Sophie's Mother. And he told me that Tiggy had been a present from him to his Mom, about 7 years ago. We both laughed about the things that make Tiggy such an unusual character - because he is after all, a Siamese cat -- And as we shared the loss of Sophie,  he told me several times how much she meant to his Mom. We ended our nearly 1 hour conversation with *A* offering to pay for any future vet expenses that Tiggy has - I thanked him for that while reminding him that cats can live about 20 years.🙂  I don't know that I'll take him up on that generous and kind offer. But I think it was nice of him to put it out there. And I think it was nice of him to reach out and to call. Finally, I have to say, that after the experience with Buddy and his family, I did not want to have any connection to the previous owners of dogs or cats in our care. But this time, it is one of those instances where it's okay. I have not felt judged or under a microscope for a moment. Instead, from Dr. S, (his photo is below) and Judy's son, and even from Irina (our groomer), I have felt nothing but friendship, kindness and support for the care and the home I gave Sophie, and the life that Tiggy has with us. That trust is humbling and it has meant and still means a lot to me. *Dr. S*"},

It was a big day where Cooper was to be alone for most of it, crated, because no one could be home with him. Our dog-walker was going to come at about noon, so I'd get an update at work on how he was doing. I'd given him his anxiety medication, and I was just praying it would work.  It was about 5:30 and Carl had just left for work, when Sophie came into the office, and peed on the floor. Very unusual for her and I scolded her just a little and I got her moving towards the backdoor and outside. We made it as far as the kitchen when she collapsed onto the floor, losing control of her bowels. A flurry of my trying to revive her, when she suddenly let out this big sound, as she began breathing again as her color returned. We sat there for several minutes and it was a huge relief when she finally put her head up and looked at me, and even wagging her tail when I talked to her. ~Sophie on the day we met in September 2019~I knew of course that Sophie would need to be seen by a vet. But I felt a car ride at that moment may not be a good idea, because I thought she needed to recover a bit more before I tried taking her anywhere. Thankfully she seemed stable because she was able to walk, she was wagging her tail, and even wanted breakfast -- I gave her a little that I'd ground up in the food processor -- She quickly ate it all and just looked at me, like \"where's the rest?\" Labs..... I was lucky that Sophie's vet clinic had an opening with another vet that I already knew at 10 AM. Once there, I waited outside, trying to have some hope and optimism. A call several minutes later that Sophie's cancer had returned and was now metastasized in her lungs - I'll add here that in the last couple of weeks, Sophie's breathing was changing, and I'd really thought that it was the warmer weather causing her symptoms of laryngeal paralysis to worsen -  There were no other options, the kind thing to do would be to let Sophie go. The heartbreaking and unexpected diagnosis was confirmed by Sophie's vet, Dr. S, who is semi-retired and so I did not expect him to be there. But I am grateful that he was because at that moment, and even now, there are no words to express my gratitude for his kindness, compassion, empathy and warmth. You may recall that he has been Sophie's vet her entire life. He was truly the connection to Sophie's life before she came to us. Dr. S told me this was because Sophie's mother and her littermates belonged to the previous practice owner, named Dr. Howard, and everyone there at the time, including Dr. S of course, had a hand in helping with the puppies, because Sophie's mom, wasn't exactly the best Mom.... But Sophie's owner, Judy, had been a longtime client and friend to Dr. Howard, and she and Dr. S were/are also personal friends. I had no idea and this was the part of Sophie's story that I'd wondered about. But Dr. S and I both agreed that his being there that day for Sophie was truly a life coming full circle. And finding out later that it was Judy's 92nd birthday yesterday, also said it was. ~We celebrated Sophie's 14th birthday in January~Dr. S and I sat there on the floor with Sophie and chatted as if we were old friends. Him telling me stories of Sophie and Judy, and me telling him what her life had been with us. Time stood still in those moments as we both said good-bye to the beautiful Sophie as I continued to silently give thanks for her long life and this good and kind man, that cared for Sophie for her entire life of more than 14 years.As I left the clinic and walked back to my van, in the spring breeze, the winged seeds (helicopters) produced by maple trees blew past me in the air and I watched them so free in the breeze and I thought of how \"free\" Sophie now was. And as I drove away, a Barry Manilow song played on the radio. It was one I've never, ever heard before, and now I can't get it out of my head. It's called \"When the Good Time Come Again.\" Its words, provided comfort at a moment of sadness.\"I'll see you thenWhen the good times come againWhen you and I have made it backFrom the people and the places we have been...The door that we go out ofIs door that we come in ......Sometimes we have to holdTo all the good that's beenSo I'll see you thenWhen the good times come again...\"God-speed to our \"only girl,\" Sophie, known to us as Sophia, Sopapilla... I'll miss the wag of your tail, your running into the kitchen for your meal, because as a girl, you were always fed first ~ your sleeping next to the bed, your playing with Todd and even Max, your watchful eye over all that was happening in our house, your canine independence, your friendship, I'll just miss you.  But I hope I'll see you then, when the good times come again. Finally, as is our tradition, Sophie's color of the rainbow. I've given her yellow. The color yellow is around everywhere right now, and yellow is the color of friendship.In the 601 days that Sophie was with us, she was truly a friend to all the dogs, who all loved her, and of course we did too.~Charlie and Sophie last summer~"},

And now, Brood X, one of the world’s largest swarms of giant fly-like bugs called cicadas, is ready to rise. As our ground starts to warm, they've stopped gnawing on tree roots and have started their journey to the surface by the hundreds of billions. ~Todd, at the moment is totally oblivious as to what's underground~After tunneling their way out of the ground near tree trunks, they’ll crawl up trees, or things they mistake for trees, and shed a thin shell from which they emerge as technicolor animals with big orange eyes and wings.~A Brood X Cicada from 2004~Experts have been telling us for months that here in Virginia “We are at the epicenter of an event that happens nowhere else on the planet except here in the Eastern United States.” Those same experts are also telling us that it's going to be pretty remarkable, come the latter half of May. The densities of the cicadas in some places is going to be nothing short of phenomenal, about 1.5 million per acre. ~We have a lot of space for cicadas!~In our corner of Virginia, we are already starting to see them emerge, as 100's of holes are starting to appear around some of our trees. ~Cicada holes are starting to appear around our trees~We were here in Virginia in 2004, the last time \"Brood X\" made their appearance, but we were living in a relatively new subdivision and only heard them. However, where we live now the ground and the area has been pretty much undisturbed, the trees are mature, so it's anyone's guess as to how many we'll see. I may feel differently once Brood X actually appears, but at the moment, I cannot wait to see them -- After 17 years, it really is the cycle of nature at its best!~Me, showing Todd a cicada tunnel~"},
{"title": "Today It's About Todd", "date": "Tuesday, April 20, 2021", "text": "Post Script to my last post. Thank-you all for your kind words of encouragement and support that have meant so much and have lifted my spirits. I have responded on that post to most of your comments, or on your blogs. You all are the best!Now, I promised good news. A few of you noted the roll of Todd in our household. You are right about him. And I'd be remiss if I didn't say what you already know, that each dog, and cat truly provides something to the fabric that makes up our lives and our household. But today, it's about Todd. On April 9th, we celebrated a milestone with him. Todd is now 10 years old. Can you believe it? I know I can't.  ~Todd, one day old~And as is customary I have taken Todd's annual birthday photo. Longtime readers of this blog know that I take the same photo of Todd each year, with the same hat, same place at the table, and it was a bit of a challenge this year, but I purchase the same cookie too.  At some point, I'll put them all into a collage. At 10 years old, there is an air of calm dignity and wisdom about Todd that is more noticeable than it has been at any other time. He stands still for attention more than he used to, and as the only dog sleeping on our bed, he never gets up in the morning before I do and never goes to bed before me either. He is a loyal, devoted friend and companion and pack member too. Now, don't get me wrong, Todd still very much has that feisty independent spirit and that spark that makes him a Scottish Terrier, and just a terrier. As an example, he sadly \"made dead\" two bunnies that somehow got into our yard this past week. 😥But Todd is great fun, and he makes me laugh. But he's clearly not into some of my nonsense. For instance when I was trying to get a silly photo of him with these ridiculous butterfly ears that I found,Max was okay with wearing them....for a few minutes anyway. Todd wanted absolutely nothing to do with them, and he let me know that. However, as you saw in my last post, he was more than willing to pose in a respectful Easter-bow-tie.  Because as I've said many times, he is a Scottish Terrier after all, and his character and personality really reflects that. I cannot think of life without him as my co-pilot. 💓"},
{"title": "The Not So Good News", "date": "Sunday, April 18, 2021", "text": "~A deer crossing between our property and the neighbors~This my friends, has been a really hard couple of weeks. I have not wanted to say that out loud because I am very well aware of others who are struggling and are having a much more difficult time with much more serious issues than I have. It makes me feel selfish to say anything. But the struggle over the last couple of weeks is real and has been difficult for me. It has left me feeling pretty defeated given that I'll admit to already struggling with being burned out.I was however, feeling pretty good about where we were with our dogs. Having no foster dogs was a relief and a welcomed break. When Cooper was added, I was glad that we could welcome him, especially given that what prompted the move from his first foster home seemed to me that it would be easy to resolve, and by all reports, he was said to be a really nice dog. ~We didn't know how Cooper would be with cats, turns out, he's fine!~His previous foster home said Cooper was sleeping all day, and wide-awake at night and roaming the house. That problem was easily fixed because it was related to the medications that Cooper was taking. I knew by looking at the ones he came with, that one in particular had been labeled incorrectly, and the dose was wrong and another was one that dogs can develop an intolerance to. So, I took him off an anxiety medication, corrected the wrong dose for the one he was taking for pain, and we helped him to adjust to our routine. For the most part, I was happy with how Cooper was settling in even though he was starting to show signs of separation-anxiety when we'd leave him alone. I had allowed him to be free in the house for a couple of days while I went to work, because he seemed like he was okay and settling down after I would leave. While we were helping Cooper to adjust, I was also keeping track of how Shelby and Jack were adjusting to their new home. Things were going okay, but I had a nagging feeling all wasn't exactly as they were saying, but I stayed hopeful. But then things fell apart. Wendy and Denis (adoptive family) wanted to return both Jack and Shelby. They felt that Jack was too active, and Shelby wasn't active enough. There were a few other issues that I felt had no merit. Despite that, I tried to remain supportive of them, even as I was picking up Jack and Shelby and bringing them back to our house. As if having Shelby and Jack returned to the rescue and to us wasn't disappointing enough, when I came home with them, Cooper's separation-anxiety came to a head while I was gone. In about 2 hours Cooper pulled down curtains, broke one window and damaged 2 others. Added to that, there were several things that were knocked over, or knocked off a shelf and were broken. He had also gotten into the fireplace. Thankfully, no-one was injured.  And I will also add that I don't have a lot of really nice things. At our age, we are trying to be minimalistic and so the things I have, I really love...  And of course I wasn't \"mad\" at Cooper, just very sad about what's gotten broken and disappointed that it happened. The feelings about it all consumed me since I was already on the proverbial edge about everything. At first I was so upset I couldn't talk about it with anyone. I let the rescue know that day but it was almost 2 days before I heard from anyone about it, and then it was only a couple of text messages offering a reimbursement for the broken window. But in all fairness, both coordinators that I work with had no way of knowing just how upset and discouraged I was about it all. I think they only found out when I had a melt-down at the vets office when I'd taken Cooper in for his ears to be rechecked on Monday. I'd asked the vet for her help with his separation-anxiety, only to be given the most trivial advice that even first time dog owners already know, and I pretty much said that to her. However, a call did come from one of the coordinators on Tuesday that was really helpful and went a long way. ~Cooper at the vet on Monday~We now have a plan going forward with Cooper that does involve his being crated and medicated. It makes me hopeful that we can work through all of this with him. Although I know it won't be easy for either of us. And as for Jack and Shelby, the search for their new forever home begins, again.  And with that, I'll end this post, and promise, that there is some fun news, that I'll save for the next post that will come in a day or so. Below is Todd wearing his Easter-tie."},
{"title": "Cooper Arrives (unexpectedly) at Golden Pines", "date": "Monday, March 29, 2021", "text": "Well, you all were right. It didn't take long for us to get a new addition. Lab Rescue asked this afternoon if I'd take an 8 year old boy named Cooper that needed to be moved from his foster home TODAY. Of course I say yes, and he was dropped off at my office as I was leaving work. ~On our way home from work!~I don't know much about Cooper. Other than he was given up by his elderly owners who could no longer care for him, and he came into the rescue about 2 weeks ago. However, Cooper apparently isn't sleeping at night, and this was becoming a problem and causing some frustration and so the Foster Home ask that he be moved. We've not done any one on one intros. But Cooper doesn't seemed bothered by the dogs passing by him in an ex-pen and vice-versa. I was told by his foster home (who could not have been any nicer!) that he is easy going....except at night when he pants and paces and whines and won't settle down. I wonder if he has sundowners syndrome? Well, lets welcome Cooper and see how it goes."},
{"title": "A Quiet Time and a Forever Home", "date": "Sunday, March 28, 2021", "text": "It's a quiet time at our house right now. That's working for me, because I've really not been feeling well. I've pretty much come home from work, fed the dogs, and gone to bed. Thankfully, I'm feeling a bit better. And even though I've been sleeping my spare time away, it hasn't stopped life from going forward.  The Eastern Phoebes have been back for more than a week, and they've wasted no time building a nest above the garage door. Meanwhile, Todd and Max had their spring haircuts last week.~On our way home Todd is my co-pilot~While they were getting their spa treatment, I spent a really nice day in Winchester, Virginia treating myself to lunch and window-shopping. ~Window shopping~And last Sunday, I took Shelby and Jack to meet a couple that were interested in adopting them. They are retired and like everyone, they're home almost all the time, and they have 3 acres that is beautifully landscaped and fenced in for the dogs. The meeting went really well, and I enjoyed our visit, and I know Jack and Shelby were very comfortable there. They were eager to adopt them both, but I gave them a few days to think about it anyway. ~At the home of Wendy & Denis~Fast forward to today, and Jack and Shelby are now at home with \"Wendy and Denis.\" It was a rough start when Wendy fell over Jack when we got there this morning. But no worse for wear (thankfully) the signing of the adoption contracts and the rest of the visit was uneventful. ~Photos I used to \"advertise\" Jack and Shelby for adoption~However, I do have to confess that I stole something from Wendy and Denis ..... Jack was chewing on an old tennis ball, and when I mentioned about his tearing it up, neither Wendy or Denis seemed concerned about it. But because I have made a career out of worrying about things like intestinal-blockages and choking, and not wanting Jack to maybe get the ball after I'd gone, I took it from him and slipped it into my jacket pocket. It goes without saying that of course I never take things that don't belong to me, but in that moment, I really just felt like it was something I needed to do to make sure Jack was safe. There's a part of me that feels guilty for taking it, but another small part of me that doesn't. Maybe I'll send them a new can of tennis balls as restitution for my crime. A picture of the ball is below - Can you see why I was worried about Jack's having it?~The stolen tennis ball~Back at home, its been another relatively quiet day. For the first time in what I'm sure is at least 10 years, we do not have a foster dog or cat. I know there are not as many dogs coming into rescues right now. But I still have a small worry that Lab Rescue may not ask us to foster for them because of what happened with Buddy. So all I can do is wait to see what or who comes next. And whatever or whenever that comes, I know Todd will be ready. And so will I."},
{"title": "What Time is It? ", "date": "Sunday, March 14, 2021", "text": "I’m a morning person. I'm usually awake by about 5 a.m. But I have to confess that today with the time change, I'm not sure what time I woke up. It seemed like every clock said something different. Although it did feel like the dogs were sleeping in this morning, because at what would have been the \"old time\" the dogs finally stirred. Or was it the old time? 🤔Which takes us to mealtime. I'm the one that always feed the dogs, and because of that, they don't always get fed at the exact same time, especially at night. When I'm in the kitchen, and they hear the bowls, they know their mealtime is coming and they start to get excited. I know some nights they are really hungry even with a good snack mid-day. ~Shelby and Ms. Yellow in the background waiting for breakfast~But today, are the dogs getting fed an hour later, or is it an hour earlier if they're fed by 8?  Looking out the window, I'm not sure what time it is, although the clock is right in front of me. I know there's always a bit of a fuss when the clocks are changed. But for us, it doesn't really matter too much, we'll figure it out and get through this time change. The dogs know they're going to get fed.... eventually. I think Todd understands that.  He probably thinks that running our lives by clocks is foolish.I think it's time to learn from the dogs. Especially on a weekend! Okay, Your Turn: What do you think about changing the clocks? How does your household cope with the time change?"},

I know that I need to let go of everything that happened over Buddy and to focus and remember the moments that connected us.  As for Charlie, it goes without saying how much I will always miss him. I'm at a loss for words to express how grateful I am for his life, for our life together that has more than 14 years of memories that will always connect us. Thank-you all for sharing Charlie's loss with us and remembering him. ❤Life has a way of continuing and now that things seem and feel a bit brighter, I'm noticing that Spring is here! Okay, okay, I know it’s not official until the sun passes directly over the equator sometime on March 20. But it is here. I have heard its opening notes in the pre-dawn-chorus - but it is missing the song of my very favorite bird, the Eastern Phoebe, which should be back any day now. Added to that at night in the woods behind us, we are hearing the spring peepers which are the frogs that make that crystal clear “peep, peep, peep” call that, when you get enough of them together, sound just like sleigh bells. All of these unique sounds combine to create a piece of music unmatched by any symphony. ~An Eastern Phoebe last year~Even though it's supposed to get cold again in the next few days, along with the sounds, the smell of spring is also definitely in the air, just ask Todd!  We are both glad that it's here. What do you like best about spring?  Along with all the new smells, I think Todd likes digging holes. Although, he likes doing that in any season. 😊"},
{"title": "Charlie Forever in My Heart", "date": "Sunday, February 28, 2021", "text": "Our angel watch with Charlie began on Sunday. He hadn't been eating much in the previous week, and he was sleeping longer and deeper and needed help getting to his feet, and we were carrying him outside. And while this may sound crazy (or maybe not) I'd had a dream that I was holding Charlie and giving him to someone. However, I have to think that the dream was prompted by the poem in my previous post. I'd just read it, and it truly spoke to me and the journey I was on with Charlie.  So, on Thursday, after just a little more than 14½ years with Charlie, we said good-bye. The years passed much too quickly and I had a hard time thinking of him as a senior dog because throughout his life he had always been so active and bright. But the years did pass by, and in one of life’s tricks, he or rather we somehow aged. Charlie didn’t have a lot of energy these last few months, but he still followed me around the house and would greet me when I came home. Like every dog, Charlie was so many things on so many levels. On the outside, it was his long thick coat and his sparkling bright blue eye. I'd never had a dog with anything but brown eyes, and it took a little bit of getting used to at first, but it became something that truly made him unique. ~A very first photo taken of Charlie in 2006~Charlie was a traveling companion that never complained about hours spent in the car. ~Charlie and Sheba, who he totally adored and thought we got just for him!~He loved the smells of new places, and of course he loved when we went to Tennessee. My best memories of him are when we have gone there and spent time relaxing and recharging.Charlie was a very vocal and expressive dog. His barking-howl and small grunts and moans and whining noises he'd make to protest something or to make what he wanted known took a little getting used to at first. That along with Charlie's loyalty and clear devotion were his most endearing qualities. And I will add here, that it was those very things that made him \"so not a Golden Retriever\" and why I just didn't want to keep him initially when we were fostering him for Old English Sheepdog Rescue.  In looking through photos of Charlie today, I found this 2014 video below that I'd totally forgotten about. I loved hearing his voice. It's what I needed today. Up until the last year Charlie always used to sleep on our bed at night. He'd always sleep next to me and any dog that would come to the side of the bed, he'd leap across me and snap at them. I always found it a bit humorous in that it was the only time he ever did anything like that. Especially because he got along so well with all the dogs. Charlie's being this way reminded me of what our Holistic Vet calls \"a secret life\" that she thinks are made up of the things that our dogs will do or don't do, like or dislike and we've no idea why. I think this is true for every dog. One of those secret things for Charlie, was his love of young cats and kittens. When we were fostering them for a local rescue, Charlie could never get enough of them. We started calling him \"Father Charlie\" because he always wanted to be near them and have them all to himself.  And like a good patriarch, he was serious about his ability to care for them, he'd look at me like he was telling me, “Go ahead. Finish cleaning the kitchen. I got this.” Why he loved kittens so much remains a total mystery as is why he felt the need to keep the other dogs away when he was sleeping on the bed next to me.  All of those things and so much more, and I have to add being a 2¾ year cancer survivor, made Charlie who he was. I know it goes without saying that we’re all completely heartbroken and I am feeling Charlie's loss just as I thought I would. I always knew it would be sad when we said goodbye to him, especially given his connection to so many dogs that we've known since 2006. It occurred to me that Charlie was one of the first of what I used to call \"the lost boys.\" Longtime readers of this blog know that Wendy, our very first dog from the Golden Retriever Rescue was re-named after the Wendy in Peter Pan. When the dogs that we began fostering were \"male-strays\" I began calling them \"the lost boys.\" Charlie is the last of that original gang - Louie, Ben, Josh, Cubby, JT, Logan, Tucker, Reggie, to name a few, were all part of that early club. Charlie's passing also represents the the passing of time -- the end of an era --The Charlie Era. It was beautiful -- some of our very best years, spent with the very best dogs. If there's a welcome at the Rainbow Bridge, Charlie is certainly going to have or has had one. We’ve lost a part of us that can never be replaced. The gift of having Charlie all these years was priceless. As Queen Elizabeth II once said, “Grief is the price we pay for love.” When it comes to our relationships with our 4 legged family members, grief is the price of admission. We all know it will happen when we open our hearts and home to them. Charlie was part of our family, and he and more than 14 years of memories will forever remain part of my heart and my soul.~One of the last photos taken of Charlie 2-2021~"},

{"title": "Buddy and a Letter to PH", "date": "Sunday, February 21, 2021", "text": "I’m still exhausted from the events with Buddy. On Saturday, I ran some errands, and took a 3 hour nap afterwards. It did a lot to clear my head. But I’m still upset about everything.Below is a letter of sorts that I've written directly to Buddy’s first family because they are or have been readers/followers of my blog. They are the reason behind what has happened with Buddy and why I am feeling the way I am -- And this post picks up about where my last one ended yesterday. They are words that I really want to say to them, but felt \"muted\" until now. Dear Peter and Family, When the decision was made to let Buddy go, I wanted to be kind and keep my word, and so I contacted your son to let him know that we were going to let Buddy go. It is, and always will be a decision that is difficult to make. But it's one made out of love for that particular dog, and I felt strongly that it was Buddy's time.My plan was to meet your son at the Vet’s office and give him all the time he wanted to spend with Buddy. Then, quietly, and peacefully, as it should always be, we would all be there as he left this life for the next. At least, that was my plan. What came after I contacted your son has truly changed everything. Your son’s insistence that he be allowed to take Buddy overnight of course came with my resistance.  Then being told your daughter was coming from out of state along with all your text messages didn’t help the stress I was already under and the emotions I was already feeling. Then being told by your son “that he was on his way to get him” really made it worse. I will say here that in the time that I had Buddy, I never ever played the “you are no longer his owner card,” but this time I did to both you and your son. You no longer legally owned Buddy. You signed your ownership of him over to the rescue. I was not, under any circumstances going to allow Buddy to leave our house with your son. I thought that agreeing to let your son and daughter spend time with him was more than fair. And I’ll also add that believe it or not, there are rules and protocols that the rescue has in place and I have agreed to those rules, and I intended to follow them. But I will of course have to confess that I broke a few of them in allowing your son to visit Buddy. In my defense, I tried to create a distance between us, that is why Peter, I never answered any of your e-mails and didn't mention him much on my blog - I needed and wanted the space to care for Buddy on my own and make those decisions that I or WE felt best for him and not be judged for them. And now knowing how you have \"intervened\" shows that my thinking that was correct.   But anyway, none of that appears to have mattered. In the end, you never showed any amount of respect for me, or to an organization that had accepted Buddy into their program. We never thought of Buddy as anything but \"our dog\" and the rescue never hesitated to provide him with everything that he needed. Your actions spoke volumes when I refused to do as you were asking, because you took it one step farther and you made me feel bullied. When the comment was made that “he should be with his family and that he should be made comfortable” really stung. I’m not sure what that meant that we had been doing for him? The care we had given Buddy the last 175+ days were never considered and our feelings were totally tossed aside by what you wanted, not what may have been best for Buddy. You never once considered anything but your own need to control everything and you said as much in a text message.  We were caring for Buddy in a place where he was comfortable, and content. He had other dogs (and cats) around, us around, and I think he was happy here. That night in the kitchen, and “Angel’s dream” I think confirmed that. Buddy was in a place that he felt comfortable (he hardly ever barked by the way) and he ALSO knew us and knew what to expect.I know, I know, this is all a moot point, but I have to say it. Peter, you all got what you wanted, Buddy has been returned to you with barely even a thank-you from you; but there has been plenty of criticism of the rescue, and maybe even me, that has provided Buddy with everything, and that you have shown nothing but disrespect towards.  In case you didn't know, the rescue is a non-profit all volunteer organization that relies on donations to help pay for the expenses of nearly 1000 labs each year. And your son scoffed at a nominal adoption fee of $125 that was asked for by the rescue, and that would have helped to offset a very small amount of Buddy's expenses - which by the way was almost $1000.  I think the rescue waiving that small fee in the end says more about an organization that I support as much as it does about you. For the rescue, it’s always about “the dog.” and their needed care.In the end, I don't know if any of this matters to you. Because you got what you wanted and what you demanded, and didn't care who you stepped on in that process. You have Buddy back. You are free to make any and all the decisions for him. And it has come at no expense to you. For me, it has cost me plenty, including the trust the rescue has had in me. I worry that I may not be asked to foster for them again. I am angry at myself that I allowed you to manipulate, control, and bully me and the rescue to get what you selfishly wanted. Giving him back to your family was just easier and I do find some consolation in that he is with someone who loves him- How YOU all felt was never ever in doubt, and is why I allowed your son to visit and be part of Buddy's life. I know now, I should never, ever have allowed or agreed to those visits. Finally and for the record, I am angry at myself for so many things - One being sorry for the problems I have caused the rescue, and for what it has cost them financially. And, I am hurt that I personally will not get that “good-bye” to Buddy when his time comes. The stress of getting him \"packed up\" at the last minute (not even having time to feed him his dinner) and the chaos of the entire day, affected everyone in our household. But I don’t regret having the chance to get to know Buddy, to love and care for him for 175-ish days. Peter, I fell in love with the Buddy you first told me about back in August. The one that jumped on the trampoline and was the world traveler and whose charm and spirit allowed him to be loved by so many, including me and my husband. I look forward to the day when I get to see ‘that big-eyed boy’ once again, whole and brand-new, smiling, his tail wagging, his eyes happy and sparkling like they were that night, in that perfect moment we shared in my kitchen. Best regards to you and your family. I do wish you all well. ~Kim W~"},
{"title": "Buddy's Story - Chapter One", "date": "Saturday, February 20, 2021", "text": "It's around 3 o'clock in the morning, and I can't sleep. I go into the kitchen, and there's an empty place on the floor where Buddy used to sleep.  That empty place, and the emotions of the day are still very fresh in my mind, and they are the reason why I'm awake at this hour and why sleep is eluding me. I realize I need to write down now everything that's tumbling around in my head when my emotions are so raw.~The empty spot in our kitchen left by Buddy~So, let me start at the beginning of this story that began a couple of weeks ago, when Buddy last saw the Holistic Vet for acupuncture. He was unable to walk that day and had to be carried in and out of the office. Holistic Vet said that she thought he'd sprained his neck. I think he must have done that by rolling over, something he loved to do.  I thought he'd get better with some rest, and a little bit of time. Buddy did improve somewhat. But in judging him day to day, even before he'd hurt his neck, it was easy to see that he was losing that spark, and was struggling more and more. My heart was telling me that it was time to consider letting him go. But as always, I shoved those feelings and thoughts aside. But when Lab Rescue received the report from Holistic Vet, it prompted a phone call from my coordinator and a very frank and honest discussion. In our conversation about Buddy's needs and care, we decided it was time to let Buddy go. In going forward with that decision, I knew I would have to talk to Carl about it, and there was one more person who should know too. That was Buddy's first family. ~Buddy, on his first day with us~When I first met them in August, they were very much on the fence at that time about turning him over to the rescue, and so, the coordinator and I bent a rule, and let them come to my house to see where he would be living. That meeting had gone well, and they asked if they could come and visit Buddy while we had him and I'd agreed to that. The husband and wife left the country as planned and the son, who remains in the area, did come to see Buddy. And there was no question that Buddy was happy to see him. I couldn't deny it, it was obvious that there was a connection between the two and I even mentioned it to the son. Fast forward through the fall and I'm going to add another story to this. Buddy was available for adoption, and there was one person in particular named Angel that was interested in adopting him.  Her name popped up more than once on Facebook whenever Buddy was posted, and I wondered who \"this Angel lady\" was. Finally, she called me. And I felt like I was talking to a long time friend. She is wonderful! We chatted for over 2 hours on that first phone call. Angel had previously had a dog with Buddy's limitations and was well aware of what it took to care for him - I thought Angel was perfect perfect for Buddy!! The only problem, if you want to call it that, was that Angel is a single lady that has steps in her house. She worried that she wouldn't be able to get Buddy in and out by herself, despite using the 'Help em up harness.' I understood, and reluctantly agreed with her. It was a decision Angel struggled with, because she really felt a pull and a connection to Buddy. Knowing that, I told her to think about it, and we would catch up in a few days. ~Big eyed Buddy! ❤~A few days passed and as we agreed, a phone call came from Angel that still in this moment, brings my own tears to the surface. She had had a dream about Buddy the night before. In that dream, she said that Buddy came to her and told her that he was happy with us and wanted to stay in our home. Maybe by itself, you could discard and trivialize that dream -- If it hadn't happened on the same night that I'd gone into the kitchen in the early morning hours and there was Buddy, standing on his feet looking at me. It was unusual in itself because Buddy was unable to get to his feet on his own. But there he was, standing there, looking at me, slowly wagging his tail and smiling and his eyes were bright and sparkling. Had my brother been awake and gone into the kitchen and gotten Buddy to his feet? I don't know. I never asked. But I gave Buddy a few treats, talked to him, kissed him on top of his head, and in that one quiet and perfect moment, I felt love and happiness from him, and I also felt a connection between the two of us that hadn't been there before. When I started to go back to bed, Buddy followed me down the hallway (something he never did) and back into the bedroom, where he slept next to the bed. So, as you can understand that the next day, when Angel called and told me her dream, I felt, and I still do feel that there was truly something \"cosmic\" about it. In talking to Angel, we both knew Buddy was where he was supposed to be. We never had any more inquiries from anyone interested in adopting Buddy after that. Buddy was with us, and where he was supposed to be.And on that cosmic note, I've rambled on long enough so I'm going to end this post so I can go and cry some more. But I will post the rest of Buddy's story tomorrow and tell you what has happened to him and why he has left us and is no longer part of our household.                                                   G'night......Or is it good morning?"},

This past week it's like someone passes by every couple of days, turns us upside-down and shakes us up because I really think I'm hearing the faint sound of  “Winter Wonderland” as its snows again. At least that’s how it feels when I look out the window, especially this week. But that's going to change today because we’re looking rain, snow, and ice. I. can't. wait. 🙄But even if I feel like we're living inside a snow globe right now, at least I have all my favorite things inside, and here at home.We have soup for dinner - Pasta Faggioli It's pretty picture-perfect inside our snow-globe too. There are many birds to look at that often land on the railing of our porchAnd so much more. I'm grateful for that we're able to be home and that's it's pretty quiet on the home front right now. Coming up this week is finishing up the write-ups for Shelby and Jack to make them available for adoption. I think Jack is one of the most handsome Black Lab we've ever fostered for the Golden Retriever Rescue! One adoption that is almost final is Buddy, our \"big eyed foster boy\" for Lab Rescue. I can't tell you about it yet because Lab Rescue needs to put or give their approval on it first, and so I'll tell you all about it in my next post. ~Buddy in December~And who knows, maybe by the next post, the snubbing of the Mercedes-Benz dog bed will have ended.

I guess that's my problem.  There were so many predictions on the other channels and weather sites. BUT regardless that Chuck lied to me, I loved the quiet and snowy Sunday we had!  And I love that the doctor I work for has closed our office today. So I get another day at home....To take a few more pictures ~Our Foster Girl, Shelby~and our crew will do what they do best, and that's sleep.~A Sleeping Sunny~We just got what I call the \"Mercedes-Benz\" of orthopedic dog beds. It's made in the US, it gets great reviews and it even has a 10 year warranty.  I have wanted one for a couple of years for our crew, but a brand-new one is way more than I usually pay for one of their beds. But I was able to get a \"second\" bed from the company that came last week. It's really a nice bed -- It is a memory foam bolster-bed with a waterproof cover under another washable one -  that I have of course put a 3rd cover on - and it comes with that 10 year warranty. Better than a Mercedes! The only \"problem\" with this Mercedes-Benz dog bed, is that after about a week **none** of the dogs are sleeping on it. So unlike what they do when we get a new Costco dog-bed for about $30  -- The ultimate snub for this \"Mercedes Benz\" of dog beds, don't you think?  ~Notice the empty bed in the middle between Shelby,(right), & George, & behind him, Sophie~Enjoy your Monday!"},
{"title": "Back in Business! ", "date": "Friday, January 29, 2021", "text": "We’ve all had those weeks. Well, mine turned into one of those months. It all began when my desktop computer (about 8 years old) started shutting down for no reason. Carl tried everything to fix it and keep it going, even putting a fan in the back because someone mentioned that it could be a \"cooling issue.\" It didn't work. So before the computer and *WE* gave up, Carl got me a new computer. I don't need all the bells and whistles when it comes to a computer, and thankfully he got a really good deal on one and assured me that setting it up would be a breeze. Transferring pictures, and files proved to be a bit of a challenge. Actually, not so much of a challenge for Carl, but getting the \"old\" computer to agree to give them up in between shutting down was not the easiest. And I'll admit that my impatience at the whole thing and how much time Carl was spending on it didn't really help either. At any rate, aside from those few glitches I think I am back in business. Yay for us! Happy New Year! ~The Wolf-Moon shining bright this morning~In what feels like for-ever that I've been gone because of waiting on Carl to get my computer set up, I've been reading blog posts on my phone, which worked okay.... And that's all I'll say about that. With that, I've decided to tweak things just a little bit on my blog. You may or may not notice, but my blogging goal for 2021 is to post a little bit more often -- So, lets see where it all goes.  With that, I'll tell you that we had a couple highs and lows at our house last week. A high was that we celebrated a birthday at our house. It was the **14th birthday** of our girl, Sophie. You'll recall that in June 2018 she was treated with radiation for a softball size malignant thyroid tumor that her previous owner was told would extend her life by one year. Obviously they were wrong, and we are thankful for that, and that Sophie is part of our household.  And while she may not have been smiling on the outside, I know she is on the inside, because there was a lot to celebrate on her birthday. Sophie is up and around, loves her mealtimes (💓!), she practically runs to her spot when she sees I have her bowl. She breathes really heavy, coughs and chokes a bit more than I'd like, but she gets herself through those moments and is no worse for wear.~The Birthday Girl!~I sent Sophie's birthday picture to our groomer, who is friends with Sophie's former owner. Irina (groomer) shared it with \"Judy\" who I will add is about 95 years old, and her caretaker said that Judy was so happy to get her picture that she cried. I'm glad I thought to send it to her. On a lower note, there's Buddy, our foster boy for Lab Rescue. I don't post about him much. I have my reasons for that. I have a story about Buddy that I'll tell you at some point very soon - It remains \"in draft\" until I can find the right words to finish it.But he is doing pretty well. Despite that Buddy cannot get to his feet on his own, he is engaged in what's going on around him, has a good appetite, and he loves having acupuncture with our Holistic Vet. But he's having spasms in his neck that appears to be strained, making it hard for him to move his head. We think it happened when he was rolling over -- something he loves to do -- Buddy had acupuncture yesterday to help with that, and today, as expected, he's worn out from it, and we're hoping he'll feel better in a day or so. And speaking of a day or so, the weathermen tell us we are in the path of a winter storm that after a dry-spell of about 2 years since we've had a measurable snow, we are hopeful and ready ..... I think! ~Todd waiting for snow~"},
{"title": "Feeling Just Fine", "date": "Friday, January 8, 2021", "text": "In many languages the month January is named after the Roman god Janus, who often was depicted with two faces—one looking back on the past, one looking forward to the future. Reflecting on 2020 of course it goes without saying that there are feelings of frustration over the changes, sadness and pain over terrible and heartbreaking losses. I think there's already too much of that for 2021 too. It has already been quite a month and we're not even to the middle of it yet.This past Wednesday was a terrible day on so many levels. To not take away from any of those events, or trivialize them, at our house the day ended with Max pacing, panting, licking his lips and gagging. I worried that he had something stuck in his throat. And as much as he would let me, I looked inside his mouth, and reached to the back of his throat to try and clear it, just in case something was caught. I could find nothing. His gum color was good so I knew he was getting plenty of air, but I then started to worry he was having an allergic reaction to something he ate. I had given him a bite of my dinner.... I gave him three Benadryl and waited 15 minutes.It didn't really get any better. That's when I headed to the animal emergency room, about 25 minutes away. When I was about 10 minutes out, I called to let them know I was on my way, but I was told that they would not be able to see Max - Apparently with COVID they have cut down on their staff on each shift, and that cuts down on how many emergency patients they can take. This unsettling news took me to another 24 hour vet's office that I did not want to go to and to a vet that I totally detest that was working. As hard as it was, I put that aside, and waited outside in my van for the vet to call me. (did I mention I really don't like or trust this vet?) to give me the diagnosis. Okay, the vet, that I call \"Dr. Death\" because of his callus disregard for those in his care, I will say, just this time, that he did what appears from the outside where I was, a good exam and x-rays that found nothing but a lot of gas in Max's stomach. Max was given a steroid injection and another injection for the nausea and very thankfully there have been no more symptoms. Yesterday Max was quiet and subdued and so un-doodle-like. But his appetite seems to have returned. And after another friend told me she'd had the exact same experience with her dog, it helped to know from her what to do if it happens again. So with that I ended my work week having my first COVID vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that \"dental personnel should also have priority access to the vaccine.\" I will confess that I was really on the fence about getting it. Partly because there are so many others that are missing being with their family's and other similar reasons, and they are really waiting and hoping for it, and I hate to take that vaccine from someone like that. But in a moment of watching a report about COVID, I felt that I should go ahead and have the vaccine. ~Waiting in line~To have it or not to have it, is really a personal decision, and for me, it was the right thing to do. Other than a bit of a sore arm, so far, I'm feeling just fine. I so hope you, my blogging friends, are \"feeling just fine\" too and I look forward to catching up on your blogs and reading your news. I have really missed you. 💓"},
{"title": "Cheers To The New Year ", "date": "Thursday, January 7, 2021", "text": "For so many of us, December is by far the busiest month in the year, and oftentimes it slips past, which is what it did for  me. ~The lovely Shelby on New Year's~I did all the planning, (reservations, games, etc.) for our office Christmas party. In past years, we've always invited the \"Office Alumni\" to attend, but with social restrictions it was just the 8 of us that currently work in the office. We all agreed that with the year, as a staff, we really needed the time to just be together as an office without the phones and the patients and chasing the clock.     At home I did manage to get most of my New Year's cards mailed, the shopping done and everything else that comes with the holidays. ~A socially distanced lunch with my good-work-friend~We did have one snow fall that got me out of work early.  I got home work safely, only to become a casualty in our driveway. I backed up to get some momentum to get through the snow, and in the darkness and a dirty back-up-camera, I managed to back into the ditch. I didn't get any photos. I was just way too upset about the whole thing. Thankfully the next day, a extremely kind passerby stopped and with a chain and pulled my van out. Without a doubt, and answer to all my prayers for help. All the while Carl was working nights - arriving home around midnight, leaving around noon to go back. All this left me as the sole care giver for the dogs. The dogs are so forgiving when their meals were late, and I think were cheering me on to just keep going. ~George, \"did you say it's finally time to eat?!~One night in particular I tumbled into bed, exhausted and cold and too tired to even get another blanket to help me to warm up. Todd must've known that, and he curled up next to me and warmed me up. I remember falling asleep that night telling him what a good Scottie he is. But I think he already knows that.  ...  I am so glad to have December in the rearview mirror - Onward to 2021!~I saw this at a local grocery store 😀~"},

I'm not sure about the sprint, but I do know I'm here to try and go the distance with my blog, no matter how far behind I get.  And right now, I'm really behind on keeping it updated and reading your blogs too. Having said that, I want to tell you that our foster girl for Lab Rescue, Sugar, found her forever home a couple of weeks ago. I am never ready to let go of some of my fosters and Sugar was no exception. I felt a real connection with Sugar, and wanted to adopt and keep her. I'm not sure what kept me from going through with it.  Fate perhaps. ~Sugar, the first week we met~The senior couple that adopted Sugar, could not love or adore her any more than they do. The post-adoption updates have all been glowing reports about how much they love her and how well she's doing.  I did however mention to them several times that Sugar is a typical Lab, and will get into any food that is within her reach. And that she did. Sugar helped herself to an entire cabinet of food that included a box of granola bars, tortilla chips, bread and cookies -- I tried to warn them. She did end up with a pretty upset tummy. But she is fine now, and aside from that, I do think they are perfect for Sugar and I know she is where she is supposed to be. ~Sugar and her new forever family~But I do miss her."},
{"title": "Shelby & Jacket Arrive at Golden Pines", "date": "Sunday, December 13, 2020", "text": "It's the holidays and I have a arms length list of things that are keeping me busy. One thing the past few weeks has been the arrival of Shelby and Jacket. I was first asked to consider a hospice boy named Vaughn from the Golden Retriever Rescue. But a day or so later before he was supposed to come, there was a change in plans. The Foster Home Coordinator called and asked if we'd consider taking a 17 year old girl, named Shelby instead. Of course I agreed to the switch. A little later came another phone call asking if we would also take Shelby's brother from another Mother, a 10 year old Black Lab named Jacket. What's one more dog, right? So I agreed to that too. So, on Saturday, November 21, after traveling more than 200 miles, Shelby and Jacket arrived at Golden Pines.~On the way to Golden Pines~This duo came from a shelter in southern Virginia. Their original owner had a stroke and the two were rehomed. And when that owner couldn't keep them, he took them both to the shelter - full of fleas and \"other things\" that dogs should never have on their coats and skin. Both were also not in the best of health, and have just finished antibiotics, and steroids. However, Shelby is still on doxycycline for Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis. Shelby is absolutely delightful! I don't think she's 17 years old (an unheard of age for a golden) She has fit into the household and the routine really easily. All the dogs like her just fine. She's very overweight, and has problems getting to her feet and moving around. I've put her on a pain medication that has really helped, and she's willing to go outside on her own now, and doesn't need so much coaxing. Shelby is pretty picky with her food, but she loves green beans, so we're giving her plenty of those with her meals. ~Shelby on her first day with us, tired and not feeling so well~Jacket, or Jack as we're calling him is another story. He's about 10 years old, and is a really handsome Lab. He's eager for attention and friendly and does as we ask of him. He's also wonderful with Shelby and our girl Sophie. But Sunny and Charlie for whatever reason, he doesn't like at all and has attacked them both. He's not hurting them, (thankfully!) and the fights are easily broken up. But Sunny and especially Charlie being seniors, are easily knocked off their feet and do not fight back. Jack just has to see Sunny and he reacts to him. Because of that, we're not allowing him to interact with Todd at all, so we are keeping Jack separated from the group. As you can guess, Todd being a terrier is a fierce fighter, and I don't want to take any chances and risk him or someone getting injured.  ~Jacket or Jack as we call him~Of course I am very concerned about all of this and I have my worries about Jack in the long-term as far as his and even Shelby finding a new forever home. But right now, I'm willing to stay the course and see where it takes all of us. ~Taken yesterday - trust me, Shelby does have an inner smile!~"},
{"title": "Chuffed Up", "date": "Sunday, November 29, 2020", "text": "Its been the usual crazy, hectic and busy the last few weeks. I've sat down several times to write a post, but the words didn't come as fast as the distractions have. In looking at my posts, I have 3 that are in \"draft.\" This one will make it 4 if I don't finish and publish it.Like so many, we had a nice and quiet Thanksgiving. I decided this year to not pick up a prepared dinner from our favorite grocery store (Wegmans) as I have the last 3 years, but instead to do it all myself. Except for the pies. The daughter of a friend of mine, made and sold homemade pies to earn some extra money. The apple pies were beautiful and taste as good as they look. I'm glad I bought two. It was for a good cause after all. 😊Whatever is going on inside, doesn't keep Todd from being on patrol outside. We have woods along the back edge of our fenced yard and we see deer in there all the time - and of course Todd has to bark at every. single. deer he sees. The deer seem to know that he's all bark and can't bite, and they have learned to accept him because they go on living their lives as normal. At least that's how it typically is.Cue the arrival of a big and handsome buck. (photo below) The other day this buck stumbled out of the woods right after another deer and right in front of a barking Todd. He must've thought Todd was after his girlfriend because he reared up once and then charged at Todd, hitting the fence. I saw it all from the back porch and went as fast as my gimpy knee would allow to chase the deer away. But not before he charged the fence at a very worked up Todd a second time. By the time I got to Todd, the buck ran off - along with his girlfriend who was watching close by. Now experts say that dogs don't feel pride because it's a human emotion and dogs have an emotional  repertoire of a 3 year old. I have to disagree with that. Because in that moment when Todd turned and came to me, I saw nothing but a confident, chuffed-up, and very proud Scottish Terrier - And I can't be sure, but I think he was walking on air, because he seemed about 2 inches taller as we walked back to the house.He's a good Scottie."},

The photo below was taken last Sunday, and by this Sunday, most of the leaves are now on the ground. The dogs have had a pretty good week. There were a couple of days where Sugar wasn't feeling well. I think it was just a bad restaurant review - she eats everything and pretty much anything. Thankfully by the end of the 2nd day, her appetite had fully returned. Sugar is really a nice dog, and she's now available for adoption via Lab Rescue. I've had no inquiries on her, and I think it's because her age is said to be 15 years old. I truly believe that's wrong, and she's more like 11 or 12, but not 15. I know what 15 years old looks like, and she's not it.  Speaking of 15 year old's. That brings me to Charlie. In a previous post I'd mentioned for the first time, I wasn't going to take Charlie to be groomed. He's really been showing his age the last few months, and I just thought it was too much for him. So, after talking it over with our groomer Irina, she told me to bring him when I returned to pick up Max and Todd, and she'd trim him up for me. And so I did and she quickly trimmed up Charlie as she sat in her driveway. I appreciated Irina doing that for Charlie, and me too. You might recall that Irina was the one that originally found the lump on Charlie's bottom (anal-gland-carcinoma) more than 2 years ago. At the time it was removed, we were told it would probably return. We beat those odds, because the vets gave us a timeline of 6 months to a year before it would be back. Unfortunately, when Irina was trimming up Charlie, she found that the lump on his bottom has returned. I'd seen it, but will admit to hoping that I wasn't seeing what I thought I was. 😞I discussed it all with our Holistic Vet, and we're not going to change anything we're doing for him. Charlie is feeling pretty well, he has a good appetite on most days, and is up and around. I feel like we're in a good place as our journey, this wonderful journey we have together, continues. 💓"},

And that was exactly what I did. Even after I'd gone to bed on Tuesday night, I woke up a few times to get the updates. There was no shortage of them, that's for sure. I was glued to the TV all day Wednesday.  Then on Thursday as I ran the boys to Irina to be groomed, (40 minutes away) and I ran a few errands, I listened on satellite radio.~The flag in our town center on Thursday~As always, our groomer Irina, did a great job on Max and Todd. You may recall that last time Todd was groomed,  he jumped off the table, and when Irina caught him, he bit her forearm.

We certainly are! It just seems like all of the sudden the leaves have changed and are falling. And can I just tell you how happy I am to have October in the rearview mirror?  In so many ways, it was a long, difficult and emotional month. But as November starts, I am feeling so much better and I have some of my energy back. I've just finished my 3rd or 4th round of antibiotics, I've lost track, but I guess they worked. I only missed one day of work last week so that says something too. Knock, knock, knock on wood, just in case. 😊Today I was home by myself, for the first time in a long time. Being home alone, there just seemed to be so many possibilities of things to do. I did do some baking - pumpkin bread. After cleaning up the kitchen because no one was here to do it for me, I got an early start on fixing dinner. I was feeling a bit chilled, time to turn on the heat or close that window and so I warmed up in bed and did some reading which ended with a nap. What a lazy day!Aside from being lazy, all the dogs seem to be pretty well. ~George waiting for breakfast~New girl Sugar has settled in really nicely. She's really a lovely dog and gets along really well with our crew. Now that she's learned to leave the cats alone, we've been able to give her more freedom in the house. But we still keep an eye on her because she is a counter-surfer and is a bit of an escape artist too.  Sugar did return to the vet for a follow-up to recheck her ears and skin, and she got an \"all clear.\" With that, she is now available for adoption. ~Sugar on her way home after getting the all clear at the vet~Our other foster for Lab Rescue, Buddy will also be available for adoption in the coming days too. We've completed 5 sessions of acupuncture and the rescue feels, as do I, that he's ready to make the next steps forward to a new forever home. He's a nice boy, and despite not being able to get around that well, I'm hopeful that someone will fall in love with this charming boy and want to make him part of their lives. ~Buddy having acupuncture on our front porch in September~And speaking of adoptions, Leo is still doing really well. Annie could not be happier and I don't think Leo could be either. ~Leo at home!~It's a busy week ahead for us. Past due grooming appointments for both Max and Todd. This will be the first time that Charlie will not be going with them. But I think a day at \"the spa,\" even though \"Irina\" takes her time with them, it'll all just be too much for Charlie. The photo below came up on my \"memories page\" on Facebook and is from October, 2010. It's a fun Halloween memory with missed faces! ~October 2010, Charlie, with Sammy in the middle, Hamlet and a corner peak of Rudi~ I hope you had a good Halloween and are doing well! I've missed you and reading your blogs!~Our driveway on Tuesday~  Now that I'm finally feeling better and have more energy, I look forward! to catching up on your news!"},
{"title": "A Forever Home for Leo", "date": "Sunday, October 18, 2020", "text": "I am still not feeling the best, but I'm hopeful that despite a \"flare up\" this past week, that a shot (ouch) and new medications will all work together to kick this stubborn infection and I won't have to see a specialist. Paws crossed! Behind the scenes, I have been talking to and meeting perspective family's for Leo. I have had this vision in my mind of the kind of home I'd hoped and wanted to find for Leo. But no one we've met were really family's I could be excited about. Looking at the photo below, can you see why? Notice how Leo is walking on the leash that's being held too tightly.One lady (a widow) in particular was a bit too eager, and I kept finding ways to discount her. She lives more than 2 hours from me, and finding a place and time to get together was a bit of a challenge, so I kept putting it off  -- Added to the more than a week when I was totally out of commission, helped to delay our meeting. But I have to confess that I liked her. We'd had a few good chats on the phone, and her home visit report had nothing but positives things to say about her. She was persistent about getting together and meeting Leo. Her son lives just over an hour from me, and so when I'd run out of excuses, I agreed to bring Leo to meet her. I'll confess, that I was being selfish and I didn't want this meeting to go well and I didn't want to like her, and I didn't want Leo to like her either. He'd not really seemed to like the others that he'd met and he never wanted to go with them for a walk, and he always tried to get back to me. That didn't happen this time. Leo liked Annie, and he liked her son too. When they went for a walk, Leo was happy to go with them.With that, I couldn't deny it. Annie was exactly who I was looking for, for Leo. She has trained dogs and given AKC's Canine Good Citizen tests, has done agility, she and her husband had Labs and Goldens, and she's had (Jack Russell) terriers too. On my way home afterwards, I felt that meeting with Annie was like meeting a friend. It was relaxed, and I enjoyed getting to know her a bit better. Leo enjoyed the visit too.Annie sent me this message after our meeting...Hey Kim, I want to thank you for coming to my son's house in Arlington so I could meet Leo. I know we said we would talk in a few days, but I want you know that I loved him. I absolutely would love to be Leo's forever home and now I just want to hear back from you what you think. I've had dogs my whole life. I have had multiple dogs. I've had big dogs, I've had dogs that have been destructive and afraid of storms like Leo, and I have loved them through all of that and I would love Leo through all of his storm fears too. I would love to have him in my life. Give me a call when you decide. I'll understand if you don't think it will work with me. Just let me know. So, after another week of dragging it out, on Thursday, Leo and Annie became official. Leo was adopted by Annie. Annie, on your right, Leo middle, and Annie's friend after signing the adoption contractLeo loved Annie just as much the second time as he did the first, as did I. Leo walked so nicely with her on the leash - Unlike he had with others we'd met. The two really had connected.I love Leo's that Leo's tail is up and he seems relaxed and happy to walk with AnnieWhen it was time to go home, Leo walked off with Annie and her friend, and he never looked back at me. It was a good sign. It was how it was supposed to be. It was how it should be. I'll miss Leo.Post adoption updates have all been good. Leo is doing great, eating, having fun meeting Annie's friends and is even sleeping on her bed with her at night."},
{"title": "Sugar and Bear Arrive at Golden Pines", "date": "Saturday, October 10, 2020", "text": "To begin this post, thank-you for the good thoughts and vibes for our girl Sophie. Several of you commented about her previous owner. *Judy* does know that Sophie and Tiggy found a home together. ~Tiggy has found that the dogs make a great body-warmer~Our groomer (who gave me Sophie), heard from *Judy* this past spring and texted her photos that I'd sent. And she also mentioned that the son called her in July to ask how the two were doing. Given how he felt about them both, we think he was probably being pressured by *Judy* to get an update. Sophie's update this week is that she's feeling much better. Her coughing will always be an issue and a worry. But the antibiotic seems to have taken care of the respiratory infection that had made it worse. knock, knock, knock on wood and POTP that we are over and well past that hurdle!Looking back on the past week, it goes without saying, its been another busy week at our house. I am still in \"recovery mode\" with my knee and leg that had a bit of a set back this week. But it hasn't slowed down the changes that are on the horizon, and I'll tell you about them as they happen. One of those changes I'll tell you about now, was the arrival on Thursday of (Brown) Sugar, and (Black) Bear via Lab Rescue. They are a \"breeding pair\" given up by their owner who no longer wanted them, and are reportedly the respectable age of 15. Despite having lots of puppies, it was initially thought that the two are not a \"bonded pair\" and could be split up. So, the plan was for us to foster Bear, and Sugar would go to another foster home. When no one could be found to foster Sugar, I agreed to take her only because I didn't want her to spend any more time in boarding than she needed to, so she's here temporarily. Both Sugar and Bear are really nice dogs, and so far, are getting along with our crew. However their unknown history with cats has me a bit concerned. Bear won't stop barking at them, and I worry about their safety when we aren't around -  The cats, not theirs. 😊. It was first thought that at Bear's age, it wouldn't be an issue. But let me assure you, this boy (maybe a border collie mix - what do you think?)  as you can see in the video below, still has some speed under those legs!Sugar on the other hand is a gentle and easy going girl, that I think will leave the cats alone and would be a better fit for our household.Until it's all sorted out, both need some TLC and time to get over their skin infections caused by fleas and just poor diet and neglect. So, whatever their story ends up being, I'm glad we have the chance to get to know them."},
{"title": "National Black Dog Day", "date": "Friday, October 2, 2020", "text": "Yesterday was National Black Dog Day which is a day aimed at bringing awareness of the plight of black dogs waiting for adoption who are often overlooked in favor of their lighter counterparts. Black dogs are less likely to be adopted for no other reason than their coloring - Regardless of behavior, size, breeding, personality, or age, the phenomenon persists. It's sad, I think. At our house, we only have one black-dog. Who happens to also be the only girl, and that of course, is Sophie. I've been going to write a post about Sophie this week. You may recall that Sophie and her counterpart Tiggy the Siamese cat, came to us last September from our groomer after the son of their owner took them to the vet to euthanize them both when their owner, who is in her 90's had to go to an assisted living facility. The son, I'm told, wanted nothing to do with either of them. With 3 of our dogs having respiratory infections (kennel cough) my vet put them on an antibiotic, and Leo, Charlie both got better pretty quickly. Sophie however, who has laryngeal paralysis (a condition that involves loss of normal function of the larynx that causes coughing and loud rasping breathing) seemed to have been hit a bit harder. Her coughing was really getting to be an issue, and because of her \"pre-existing condition\" I worried about her kennel cough turning into pneumonia. So, with Sophie's health history, instead of taking her to my vet, I decided to call her previous vet instead. I'm glad I did. Dr. S called the night before her appointment and we chatted about Sophie. He has seen Sophie her entire life. He knows exactly how old she is, 13 years 8 months, Dr. S knows everything about her, including the details about her cancer treatment, a softball size malignant thyroid tumor that was successfully treated with radiation in June of 2018, and that the prognosis was that it could extend her life by 1 year. So, Sophie is a 2+ year cancer survivor!  And Dr. S who of course knows Sophie's original owner, told me that \"she loved Sophie to the ends of God's green earth, and there wasn't anything she wouldn't do for her.\"  Hearing how much Sophie was loved, touched my heart, and I know that they were not just words, but how *J* really felt/feels about her. **And we'll see if those feelings remain because Dr. S told me he was sending the bill (almost $500) for Sophie's treatment to the son to pay. Of course I said I would pay the bill because we consider Sophie our dog, but Dr. S insisted. Dr. S took great care of Sophie. He did x-rays, an ultra sound, blood work, and a very thorough exam. I like Dr. S very much. He's a vet that I knew only by his reputation as a longtime vet in our area, that is kind and well known for providing good care to his patients. Now that I've met him, I have to agree with that. For the most part, Sophie is healthy. There are a few concerns like a nodule on her spleen, and of course there are the remains of the tumor on her throat. Dr. S gave me another antibiotic for her cough, that knock, knock, knock on wood, a week later seems to have helped. Shortly after her dinner last Saturday, Sophie did start coughing and choking and she collapsed - I got her to her feet, and cleared her throat to make sure she had an open airway, and thankfully she's been fine since then.  ...whew..... I am really hoping that Sophie, our single black dog, on the day after National Black Dog Day, will be fine for many days ahead."},
{"title": "Good-Bye to Alf, Another Lost Boy", "date": "Saturday, September 26, 2020", "text": "My week has been spent resting and recovering. I'm somewhat better, and the advice from my doctor is that if I'm not \"significantly better\" by the end of the weekend, I'm to return to the emergency room for more IV antibiotics.  I hope that won't need to happen....Again, enough of me....  I must tell you about the loss of our beloved Alf in the midst of everything last week. I knew weeks ago that Alf's health was starting to fail. But like that old car, we did everything we could to keep him up and going. For the most part, we were successful. It wasn't always easy, he could be a stubborn boy. But when I was sick in bed, and his health also took a turn, I prayed for that tender mercy that would allow him to hang on a bit longer. Carl took great care of him until I felt a bit better to resume his care. I'd gotten him out in the morning and I was encouraged that he was up and around, and had a bit of an appetite. However, by the next day, despite several try's his strength was totally gone and he wouldn't stand. I knew he'd waited for me to feel better to allow me to be with him for the last of his journey.  ~Alf, the first day we met~Alf had truly been dealt a bad hand in his previous life. Found as a stray in downtown Baltimore, while in the shelter, it was recommended by 2 or 3 vets that this \"lost boy\" be euthanized because of his condition and health issues. However, he was turned over to the Golden Retriever Rescue, and the rest, as we can say, became HIS story (history?). The little more than two years with Alf went too fast. So much has happened, and Alf, in the background was a witness to all of it. He wasn't a dog that liked attention and fuss. And when I read the definition of a curmudgeon as being a crusty, ill-tempered old man, I knew this was Alf. He could be grouchy, moody, and more than a little stubborn. However, his head-butts to the back of my knees and his always wanting to be nearby spoke volumes and showed a gentle side of him. I knew he'd never allow me to hug him, so instead I would kiss him on his head, look into his dark brown eyes and tell him that I loved him. But I will confess to sometimes having a passing thought that he might snap at me for being in his space. But he never did. He knew my words came from my heart and I know how he felt in those moments too. Even now, thinking about them, brings out those tears and makes me miss him that much more. ~Alf loved the snow!~About a week before Alf left us, I took the below picture of a rainbow-prism that was coming through the window as Alf laid on the kitchen floor. Given how he was feeling, I knew that his angels and the rainbow bridge were near....I think we've all heard it said that our four-legged family member stay by our side after passing away. The day after Alf left us, there were 2 prisms in the same spot. I found myself smiling and thanking Alf for that. I know that was him. I know he's nearby. I know he knows he meant something to us. Alf's color for the rainbow is the green from in his collar. Green is said to symbolizes unconditional love and forgiveness. It's also said to be a healing color and I know that being a dog, he forgave the neglect and treatment in his first life. With us I think Alf, another one of our lost boys, found renewal, and harmony that I hope healed his heart and spirit. God-speed Alf. You may be our 5th loss for this year but the ache and sadness of your loss is all its own, just as that place is that you have in my heart. I'm so thankful that you found your way to us and were part of our lives for two years and that I had the chance to know and love you, \"my hot mess of a 'doodle!\" 💓"},

I'm not sure where to begin other than telling you that I've not been feeling well, and have even missed work - But not before I spent an entire day in the emergency room, something I hope I don't have to do again anytime soon. The good news is, is that I am feeling much better, and I am planning on returning to work on Monday. For those who might be wondering, yes, I did have a COVID 19 test, and the result was  negative...…whew....Three dogs are also not feeling well. At the moment, Charlie, Leo, and the lovely Sophia each have respiratory infections. Yesterday they were started on an antibiotic, and I'm hopeful that they'll each feel better very soon. This morning Leo ate all of his breakfast, which I was happy about because he'd not done that since Friday. ~Leo feeling better!~I just mentioned that the dogs have a respiratory infection. Dogs typically get them from one another, and I could only conclude that it came from Lenny, who arrived just about 2 weeks ago. He started coughing shortly after he came to us, and he was diagnosed with kennel cough. He was already on an antibiotic, so a cough medication was added, and Lenny was good as new!  I'll add that with all that he was being fed, 3 times a day, he gained 4 pounds, the sores on his feet were healing so well, and he was already starting to look healthier! Lenny left us this past Thursday to have surgery to remove the \"3 foreign objects\" and to be neutered. The surgery went well, and he is still recovering at the vet. The picture below is one of the \"objects\" that was removed.  Where Lenny will go to finish his recovery has not yet been decided because a new foster home has not yet been found for him. I will confess to secretly hoping that we'll be asked to take him back. But until our dogs are all healthy, we can't be, and won't be. So, send those healing vibes!"},

He is a \"lost boy\" that was found as a stray on a rural road on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. He couldn't stand because he was so weak and dehydrated and was described as \"half dead.\"Having been a stray, it was no surprise that Lenny's first exam showed an arms length of medical issues. He'll need surgery to remove 3 \"foreign bodies\" that thankfully are not causing any obstruction, he has terrible teeth, a problem with a hip that will also require surgery, and he's not neutered.On the outside, he has multiple sores on his body and both his back feet are skinned up and infected.And he's painfully thin.Despite everything medically, Lenny is really a friendly boy, and eager for attention. The plan is for Lenny to stay with us until he regains his health, and gains a few pounds which he'll need before any surgery can be done. After surgery, Lenny will go to another foster home for his recovery - Lenny is being fed 3 times a day, so it should only be a few weeks. At least that's the plan.For now, Lenny is being \"social distanced\" from our dogs while he gets used to being indoors, and gets used to the vibe of our house.And for now, this \"lost boy\" that a shelter in Princess Anne, Maryland named Lenny, is safe. ~The end of our first day - G'night Lenny, sleep well~"},
{"title": "Buddy Arrives at Golden Pines", "date": "Saturday, August 29, 2020", "text": "A full and extraordinarily busy week that began on Monday with the arrival of our new foster boy, Buddy.  Buddy who is 13 years old, was a very well traveled and treasured companion of a family that has lived in different places around the world. Unfortunately, a new job assignment in Australia, is one that Buddy, because of his physical condition is unable to make.Buddy is an easy going, well socialized boy so he's settled in really nicely with his new pack-mates, which includes the cats too.One issue we had right away was getting Buddy to eat. But I expected that. On Tuesday, he barely ate anything and showed his disapproval of the cuisine that was very different from his usual fare of canned food mixed with liverwurst. Sorry Buddy, but your days of eating liverwurst with your meals are over ...  And I was/am determined that Buddy's diet be close to what the other dogs eat, so on Wednesday, I offered him a dehydrated food mix, that he has eaten all of at every meal - (Yay!) So, I think that says that he likes it, so we can check \"eating new food\" off of our list.Next on our list for Buddy was a vet visit on Friday.My biggest concern with him is the muscle deterioration in his rear end. Buddy needs a lot of help getting to his feet, and doesn't walk all that well and was diagnosed with spinal-stenosis a couple of years ago. (As a part of normal aging, the spine can develop arthritis - the discs begin to collapse and bone spurs form, and the ligaments around the joints of the spine begin to thicken). Long time readers will remember our boy Jake a few years ago that was diagnosed with the same thing. We did acupuncture and cold laser therapy for him, and it made a huge difference. Lab Rescue Vet totally agreed with that treatment, so I'm really hoping that Lab Rescue will agree and approve the expense so we can do it to hopefully help Buddy too.Buddy, welcome to Golden PinesI'm sure Todd is glad you're here!"},

It was 125 days ago that he was returned to us by his owner, sadly minus his Barkalot brother, Abe. George is involved in everything that goes on around the house, and his motto for his life has to be, \"If I'm not barking about it, it's not important.\" But even with all the barking, he's a really nice, silly and endearing boy that has his own place in the household and my heart too. I'm so grateful he found his way back to us.And by the way, we found out purely by accident a few weeks ago, that George can really carry a tune and hold a note. We knew that Max could when he hears a siren, but who knew that George could too?  It must be all that practice he gets barking! The weekend at our house is a quiet one. Today my brother is working, and Carl for the first time since March, had to go into the office. Our week ahead looks to be a busy one, as we prepare for the arrival of a new foster boy on Monday evening.

At some point, I may share why its been that way, and only say right now, at the start of the day, I'm emotionally worn out. I came home yesterday from work, changed my clothes and in the peace and quiet of our guest room, I laid on the bed and closed my eyes.I was immediately joined by Todd who snuggled up right next to me. In the next moment Max came in and he also jumped on the bed, and laid down on the other side next to me. Max was quickly followed by a very happy George, Leo, Sophie, and Charlie who each stood on the side of the bed wagging their tails - George also tried to crawl on the bed.Study after study has shown that our pets help us to maintain a more positive, optimistic perspective on life. And I've read that they can even lessen the symptoms of depression and anxiety. Whatever magic they have to do what they do best, that moment lifted my spirits and went straight to my heart and nurtured me in a way that nothing else could or can. I felt so much better. I felt so lucky. I am so lucky."},
{"title": "Clouds of Hair ", "date": "Sunday, August 9, 2020", "text": "Back From Vacation. Back to the routine. Back to work, which is getting busier again as more patients are coming it. A full schedule wears me out.We were asked by Lab Rescue to take a new foster dog this past week. Simba was 14 years old. He was being turned over to the rescue because the family had to move into an apartment that wouldn't allow him. He'd not been to the vet in quite a while, and it was unfortunately discovered that he was in total kidney failure.~God-speed to this old soul we never got to meet~There was nothing that could be done. The coordinator contacted the family, and they came to be with him. I'm sure they were grateful for that kindness, and I'm grateful that someone that Simba knew was there with him as he left this life for the next.We now wait for our next foster dog. Until that time comes, we're keeping 3 four-month-old kittens for another rescue until Tuesday.No new-comers has given us time to just spend with our crew. All of the sudden, the Labs seem to be shedding - There was a cloud of hair under George as Carl brushed him out.  But look at George's big smile. He loves being brushed.Todd doesn't like it so much and I'm sure he was just glad it wasn't him!Before vacation Alf had his turn at being groomed. We have two groomers. Long-Time-Groomer that takes care of Charlie, Todd, Max and Sophie for me. Then there's \"young-cool-groomer\" who has groomed Alf and a couple of the other dogs for me. I called her beforehand, and we discussed Alf at great length because he has problems standing. She assured me that wasn't a problem and it could be scheduled on a day where she wasn't so busy. So, I left it to her to schedule it that way, even changing it one time in between. When I got there we talked again about Alf, but I couldn't help but notice the number of dogs being dropped off. I was still in the parking lot when my phone rang. It was \"young-cool-groomer\" telling me that she just didn't think she'd be able to groom Alf, giving me a couple of excuses, including his not being able to stand. Yes, I was irritated. I understand that Alf's not being able to stand may have partly been the reason. But I really think \"young cool groomer\" had a full schedule, and just didn't have the time she needed for Alf, that she'd promised me she would make. I was really grateful when the girl that comes to our house to trim our dogs nails, who has a good set of clippers, offered to do it. Nail-Trim-Girl did a pretty good job, and with the hot weather, Alf has been so much more comfortable. ~Look at all Alf's hair on the floor~In this weather, comfort is what it's all about! And as a post script, I'll add that \"young-cool-groomer\" and her cool significant other bought her business from \"Long time groomer.\" who now sees select clients from her home. But I've really wanted to support young-cool-groomer and her significant other because I like them, and they do a good job and I want them to be a success. But a couple of glitches like this, has me doubting my return there, even though I recently won a contest they had that includes a discount for my next grooming appointment. We'll see."},

In the high temperatures we've been having lately, Sophie's breathing has become louder and harsher in this heat because of her laryngeal paralysis.

She is hypoglycemic, and had a diabetic seizure. So, the rescue has decided to keep her in the direction of Richmond, about 2.5 hours from us, with the vets that know her best. So, we wait for the cosmos to do its magic and bring us another pup that needs a place to call home.I'm not in any hurry for that to happen.Just like I'm not in any hurry to go back to work tomorrow - Or make Leo, below, available for adoption again.

Your words were a great comfort and I didn't quite feel so alone at not being able to be with Hannah. She left this life with Carl with her, knowing that he loved her and that she meant something to us.My time in Tennessee comes to an end today. It has been a whirlwind of a week. A good, longtime friend and my brother were here for a few days. We laughed, played cards, ate too much of all the wrong things and enjoyed the mountain views from the cabin and other places.When they both left on Monday, it was needed time alone with my thoughts and a chance to mourn the loss of Hannah. In an unexpected moment, I saw a rainbow. It was the first one I've personally seen in a very long time. In looking at it, I felt that peace and comfort that only a rainbow can provide.The time alone the last couple of days has also given me time to finish recharging my inner batteries and to put things into perspective. I didn't find the answers to my worries, but I think they'll come when it's time.And now, it's time for me to get on the road and head home.But not before I switch to the much lighter side and tell you that Todd, Max and Charlie had a great time!Todd barked way too much! So much so, that my friends who own the cabin said someone nearby called them to complain about it.....  whoops ...Max who played the role of social butterfly when my friend was here, was worn out from all the attention and fun that he really loves being a part of.Which takes us to Charlie. At his respectable age of 15+ he seems to have enjoyed his time here too.  As I finish writing this post, he's sleeping soundly and snoring loudly!And finally just as a teaser, I'll say that I hope you stop back by in the next day or so to meet this lovely gal named Leah. Who, like Hannah, will be coming to us as a \"hospice foster\" via Lab Rescue."},

But last night, as our day ended and I looked up into the stars, I knew that the miles apart didn't matter. She knew how I felt about her.  Hannah's place in my heart and as part of the fabric of our lives will always be a part of me. I'm grateful for the chance to have known and loved this beautiful and brave and courageous girl for 171 days. God-speed Hannah-Bannah until we meet again at the Rainbow Bridge."},

We both had them scheduled at the same time. She and her family had already rented a house in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and I had already reserved my favorite-go-to-place in Tennessee.  At that time with all the uncertainty, we didn't know if we were going to be able to go or not, and July was so far away.Well, the time arrived, and here I am in Tennessee with Charlie, Max and of course Todd, who was my co-pilot.Our first day here has been a relatively quiet one as we're getting settled into the cabin and just relaxing.Because that's what it's all about."},
{"title": "Celebrating Fourteen Years", "date": "Monday, July 13, 2020", "text": "I am humbled and grateful and so happy that on Monday, July 13th, we will reach what I consider a real milestone and a day of celebration and cheers.The occasion?  It is exactly 14 years to the day that Charlie came into our lives. Fourteen years.  I cannot believe it. Fourteen years ago, I was serving as president of the Golden Retriever Rescue, and was helping out Old English Sheepdog Rescue whose president I'd gotten to know a few months before. She called and told me about a \"sheep dog mix\" in a shelter near me, and asked if I could get him for them. Of course I agreed.~The shelter papers for Charlie in 2006~The shelter had named him \"Charlie\" and he was certainly cute enough. But in my mind, 14 years ago, he wasn't a Golden Retriever, and I never, ever had any thoughts about keeping him, but I did agree to foster him until a home could be found.Charlie was added to the \"Petfinder\" website and there were several people who were interested in Charlie. This included a movie production company that wanted to buy him - And I am not kidding, even Old Navy contacted sheep dog rescue about maybe \"leasing Charlie\" for an ad campaign they were doing. Of course we rejected those offers, ending Charlie's chance at stardom - I remember thinking, \"movies and commercials? Really? Am I missing something?\" ~The Face of a movie-star? Really?~Everyone was drawn to Charlie, and as I just said, I just didn't see it, or feel a connection to this white-shaggy-dog, despite 2 perspective family's telling me that they thought I should keep Charlie because they thought he was bonded to me.  But I didn't waiver, he wasn't a Golden Retriever, and I really didn't want to keep him.I'm not sure when I changed my mind about Charlie. But I did, and it was some time in late fall of 2006 we made it official, and he became a member of our pack, and our very first, non-Golden Retriever.~Our pack in the fall of 2006~I've never looked back and of course, I've never, ever for a single moment regretted keeping him. Charlie is a companion, a friend, a partner, a teacher, a listener, a student and a connection to a past and our present. He is a true gift.At what I am sure is more than 15 years old, Charlie sleeps more than he did, doesn't hear so well, his appetite can be compared to a finicky cat, and he's not as steady on his feet as he was even 6 months ago.  But this goal of 14 years together, as I said at the start of this post, has me humbled and grateful and celebrating.~Charlie, 14-years later~"},
{"title": "Cookie-Cutter Days", "date": "Sunday, July 5, 2020", "text": "The weather-lady said this morning that we are having \"cookie cutter days.\"  I know she was talking about the weather, but the same could be said about our last few weeks. Each day seems like the one before, and passes just as quickly.However, a very talented and kind friend made me a cake - For no particular reason. And no, Todd did not get any part of it.We have had in the last couple of weeks several evenings of thunderstorms that have done a lot to frighten poor Leo. After a lot of discussion about Leo's storm fear, I've learned that this type of fear is most often \"baked in\" and not one that can be totally resolved. It's one that is managed.~A VERY NERVOUS Leo~On the positive side to Leo being so afraid, if there is one, we've found a way to manage him during a thunderstorm that makes him feel safe and he'll settle down. In the finished part of our basement living area, that has no windows, is a quiet place where we can sit with him, turn on the TV and wait for the storm to pass. This has worked out really well - In fact its worked so well that there has been no need to give him any medication to ease his nervousness and anxiety, which I think is another plus. ~Leo a bit more relaxed during a storm~Having this solution has really helped. So, knowing what works for him during storms, its been decided to make Leo available again for adoption, so stay tuned.....At the vet was Hannah. Before we adopted her, I was concerned about her back leg that has had swelling around her hock. I brought it up several times, but the vet for the rescue, for whatever reason, never addressed it. It is actually (another) one of the reasons for adopting Hannah because I was concerned about it. But the first day I took her, Mobile Vets x-ray machine didn't work, so we had to reschedule. Mobile Vet wanted to try and stabilize her leg, so we tried a brace on it, that didn't stay on for too long.Back we went last week, and the news was that her heart and lungs looked pretty good.Of course I'd really hoped that the swelling on her hock wasn't anything too serious - But I had a feeling that it was. Unfortunately, just like Chip, it's bone cancer. With Hannah having heart-worm, mammary cancer, and eye problems, more than anything I wished that this girl could get a break in her health.Mobile Vet said that given all of her health problems, we're really on borrowed time with Hannah. Of course, I don’t know how much time we’ll get to borrow. But however long it is, we’ll make it count. We all agree that with all she has been though, this sweet girl deserves that."},
{"title": "A Not So Good Day for \"Longtime Groomer\"", "date": "Sunday, June 21, 2020", "text": "Last Friday it was Todd, Charlie and Max's turn to be groomed. Like so many of us, they were well past due for a good haircut. It was good to see \"Longtime Groomer\" and I'm glad that she's able to open her shop again.Unfortunately, it didn't end all that well. \"Longtime Groomer\" said that Todd seemed nervous when he was unable to see Max or Charlie. And, in a moment when he couldn't see them, Todd tried to jump off the grooming table. When she quickly grabbed him, he bit her.  Oooohhhhh nooooooo.....Of course, I could not feel any worse about this!  But if there is one good to come out of this, and trust me, it takes a lot to find a good point, it's that the single bite was on her forearm, and not her hand. \"Longtime Groomer\" was as understanding and as forgiving as she could possibly be, and of course I appreciated that.When I called a couple of days later to check on how she was healing, we decided that Todd may have been out of sorts because she was wearing a mask the entire time. Not that any dog should ever bite anyone - But I'd noticed that Todd was a bit unnerved and leery around me when I'd had a mask on a few days before and he was a little nervous when we arrived at \"Longtime Groomers\" that morning. So, that may be what led up to the bite, I just don't know.We'll have time to figure it out though. The three of them won't be due to go back to be groomed until at least September. Plenty of time to worry about next time, right?"},
{"title": "A New Co-star at Golden Pines", "date": "Wednesday, June 17, 2020", "text": "Even though I'm back to finally working only 3 days a week, the last couple of weeks have been fully charged with a lot going on.~Todd, always a star, and always  fully charged!!~My last post mentioned about my going out of town overnight. It came about when a friend in Kentucky was trying to find a home for a stray cat. I am really missing having an outdoor kitty and with a few days off work, along with just wanting to get away, I considered a 3 day round-trip to Kentucky to get this cat.Okay, I'll agree, it was probably not my best idea. And just to help validate to my inner self what a crazy idea it was, I had that nagging feeling (again) that it wasn't something I should do. And for whatever reason, I said something to a \"very cool and fun longtime friend\" in North Carolina who by the way, just happens to have her own, non-profit, cat rescue.  So, can you see where this led me?Yes, it took me to North Carolina instead of Kentucky to get a cat from Cool and fun Friend, G.I stayed overnight in the small town in Virginia where Todd came from - and also the home of Lynn, of Rocky Creek Scotties. Unfortunately in these crazy times, I wasn't able to see her. Hopefully we'll get that chance in the months ahead.Cool and fun Friend, G and I met around Winston-Salem, North Carolina in a shopping center parking lot. After more than 10 years, it was wonderful to see her again and it would have been even nicer to be able to sit down and just catch up. But again, these crazy times kept us from doing that. However, her great company via phone on the drive home was almost as good.~Winston-Salem, North Carolina~So, without further delay, please welcome Gerry to Golden Pines.~Gerry's first photo~He's a young cat, that was a stray, and a lady that he had picked for his very own, was moving. She had an outside dog, that he seemed to get along with, so that was a big plus.~A photo from Gerry's first life~Our plan was to have Gerry live outside, as Gino had done. But after nearly 2 weeks, he's adjusting nicely to living inside - And trust me, he has a pretty strong opinion about being outside - So I've decided to just let Gerry, our newest co-star in a big cast of characters, decide how and where he wants to live at Golden Pines.Thank-you again \"cool & fun friend, G\" for your friendship, for all you did to for Gerry and to get him to us!!"},
{"title": "YOU All Were Right!", "date": "Saturday, June 6, 2020", "text": "As I prepare for a quick overnight trip today, that I'll tell you about next time, I wanted to give you an update on Leo.I appreciated your thoughts about the path that Leo should take to his forever home. Those of you that reluctantly thought that Family #3 was the best choice for him, were right. They WERE the family that I had chosen for Leo. Personally, I liked them very much. They are a really nice, fun couple and I know they are a good home. But I will confess, that I had a nagging feeling that I couldn't quite get rid of. Even as I talked about \"being sure\" about the decision, deep inside, I knew, but wouldn't admit, that I was trying to convince myself.Leo has a storm phobia. We knew about this from his previous family, and it was discussed at length with every family interested in him. One of the reasons I chose \"Family #3\" was because they felt confident with being able to manage it. However, on Thursday night, we had a pretty bad storm that included thunder and lighting, and it gave me an unvarnished view of how Leo reacts during them. He was pawing at me, digging at corners as he tried to get into the smallest of spaces, and pacing and panting. Nothing and I mean nothing I could do, or did, consoled or reassured him. Once the medication that he takes for them started to work, he settled down and we were both able to get a little rest.I told Family #3 about what had happened. And I received an e-mail that said:Thank you for being honest in your evaluation of Leo's fear.  We spent a good part of the day talking about this and we have decided that we are not able to manage him.  We didn't understand the full extent of his fear.  We thought it could be managed with a thunder vest and comfort from a human.  Our experience with pets with anxiety has been that human touch calmed him down enough to rest and sleep. We are concerned about what will happen should a storm come up while we are away.  At this time of COVID of course we aren't away much but at some point this will end and we will occasionally be away for several hours. We are sorry and we want you to know that we made this decision with heavy hearts.  We do feel that this would not be a good fit for us thereby not being a good fit for Leo.  He is a sweet boy who needs the right home.  Looking back on all of this, it's all been a reminder to pay attention and listen to that inner voice, and even listen to YOU the readers of this blog.So, where does this take us? We are lucky to have great support from the rescue and resources to tap into. With that, I'm feeling optimistic that we can find something that will help Leo going forward through this \"stormy season.\"Thank-you for cheering Leo on."},
{"title": "Two Adoptions ", "date": "Tuesday, June 2, 2020", "text": "Thank you all for your thoughts about the path that Leo should take. You've helped more than you'll ever know.  By the weekend, I'll have an update about his new forever home.Until them, I want to tell you about two of our Lab Fosters, who have found their own forever homes in the last couple of weeks.To start, remember the nearly 15 year old girl, Maya who came to us in early March? I didn't write much about her. She was mostly in the background, just going with the flow. A true gem, and I never thought that there would be anyone that would want to adopt her because of her age. Wrong! ~Maya on the day we met, March 11, 2020~Two retired police officers who live not too far from me, did. With 2 other Labs, Retired Police Lady had a dream of adopting a senior girl, and Maya was perfect, and they were perfect for her. So, she left us almost 3 weeks ago. Of course I miss having her with us. But she's doing really well, and has settled in nicely into her new life with her new family.~Maya at her new home~ This brings us to our foster girl Hannah, who came to us in February. She was a stray from a West Virginia shelter. When she was turned over to Lab Rescue it was discovered that she is heartworm positive and has multiple mammary tumors. After her medical needs were addressed we were hoping that despite that she is \"hospice\" someone would fall in love and want to adopt her.~Hannah, on the day we met~It turns out, that someone did, and that was us. We have officially adopted Hannah. Sure, there were calls from other people interested in adopting Hannah. But I managed to talk them out of her for one reason or another. I realized that I was doing it because my heart wasn't in placing her. Given how I feel about Hannah, along with her health, I just didn't think it was fair for her to make a change. So, Hannah is ours. And she is Lab-Rescue-Foster-Fail number 5 in 5 years. I couldn't be happier."},
{"title": "Who Do YOU LIKE for Leo? ", "date": "Sunday, May 24, 2020", "text": "One the things that has kept me busy the last two weekends is meeting families for our foster boy Leo. Yes, of course, there was the thought about keeping him for ourselves. But I just feel that we are once again, the gateway to get dogs like Leo to where they are supposed to be. Of course, there was a lot of interest in Leo. But I was able to narrow it down to 4 families that I thought could possibly be a match for him. I've now met them all. Two family's we met last weekend in the backyard of a friend who was kind enough to let us use it while they were out of town.Below is a summary that comes along with a home visit report from the adoption coordinator for the rescue, and I've added how our visits went.So, tell me, who do YOU LIKE for Leo? Family #1Summary: A 70 year old gentleman that lives in a fenced house. He is semi-retired and rarely gone long hours. He has had three previous Goldens; one is a 4 yr old NM who lives with his ex and the other two have since passed at ages 12 and 14. He has a large collection of valuable art, some plants, slippery floors and bare stairs. He recently had knee surgery. He likes to visit with his neighbors and their dogs and use dog parks. His son will help with any walks.THE VISIT:  Leo liked the man \"okay\" but clearly liked his son who came along with him, better. *HE* and his son took Leo for a walk.  HE was concerned about Leo's walking on a leash, because Leo doesn't heal, and *HE* was concerned about possibly tripping over Leo. He had brought with him a couple of toys and a bag of treats for Leo. He also showed me 2 pronged collars that he'd used on his other dogs to help them to learn to walk easily on a leash.Family #2Summary: A family with 2 children (girls) 7 and 9. Live in an unfenced house that backs to woods. They are thinking about getting an electric fence and it appears that they think that will contain a dog unsupervised, please check. They work from home and are rarely gone long hours. This will be their first dog and they want one that's smaller. Their cat hissed and growled at the volunteers dog. There were lots of toys and the kids were overly excited. There are slippery floors and the dog will not be allowed on the furniture.THE VISIT: Went pretty well.  The younger girl tried to \"ride\" Leo like a horse. But he didn't mind and loved their attention.  This scenario is closely to what Leo knew before. They are very nice, open to advice because they don't know much about dogs.They felt that Leo would be okay to be taken out just 3 times, and the MOM was concerned about his hair, and mentioned giving him a good summer haircut.Family #3  - I was not able to snap a photo of them walking LeoSummary: Live in an unfenced house. There is a catchment pond through the woods. *SHE* is a homemaker and *HE* is currently working from home so their dog would rarely be alone long hours. They are previous adopters of *** who passed at age 13. Their daughters high-energy 7 yr old Border Collie is a frequent visitor. In the past they have had other Rescued Goldens that they have moved overseas and back with. The main level is hardwood floors with area rugs.THE VISIT: Leo warmed up to them the longer we were together. At first, he kept coming back to me, but I really think it was because he was confused about why we were at a park. They were very easy to talk to, very relatable, and clearly their dogs are part of the family. I'll remind you that Leo has a storm phobia, that he takes medication for when the storms approach. They've dealt with storm issues and countersurfer's like Leo.FINALLY FAMILY #4Summary: Retired Couple, both 67 years old. Unfenced house on lakefront property. Both are retired and rarely gone long hours.They do not allow their dogs in the bedroom so he or she will need to sleep on the main floor. They have had three previous Goldens, all of whom have since passed away at ages 8, 9, 14. They have Grandkids and Granddogs that visit, plants, and slippery floors.THE VISIT: Also went well. Leo liked them, but they also didn't like how Leo pulls on a leash when walked. As you read above, Leo wouldn't be allowed everywhere in the house. They think that his storm phobia can be managed by taking a more analytical approach to it. And in talking to them, I think they do this with their dogs. They said this in an e-mail to me last evening, \"Regarding storms, his fear is probably more basic. We would need to provide the feeling of a safe haven and help him when he's fearful.\"  For the record, in what I've read about Leo, it's not basic. His previous family indicated that it had been escalating to his being a bit destructive. I think it's important to manage it correctly so that it doesn't get worse.So, again, who would you pick?  I've already decided against two, and have almost but not quite made up my mind, but I always love to hear your thoughts!"},

To not take away from the events and take too much of your time, I'll break it into smaller posts this week.I have to begin with telling you about the loss of Chip last Friday, May 8th. His battle, our battle together against bone cancer was not one that we knew we would or could win. But I'd hoped that we'd have more time to try. It was not meant to be. Managing the pain that this type of cancer always brings, became nearly impossible. And I'd promised him ............The picture below is the last one of Chip that I took. There was a peace about him as he sat there looking and smiling at me. Time stood still in that perfect moment - And before it ended, I quickly took this picture. Looking at it now, how everything changed so quickly afterwards, maybe he was telling me everything he wanted me to know.~The very last photo of Chip~Chip left this life for the next on the peace of our front porch as two hummingbirds I've not seen much since, buzzed around us. Chip's life had been one filled with so many things that made him afraid. I'm grateful that for two years we were able to show him that the world was not one to always be fearful and afraid of. I'm grateful that he learned about being part of a family. I'm grateful that he learned about companionship. I'm grateful he learned about treats, warm beds, toys and being carefree and loved.  I'm grateful he was part of our lives.Despite those fears, Chip had such a gentle, kind, trusting heart and soul. And, I know that he trusted us. His color for our rainbow can only be one color, and that's blue. Blue is often associated with trust, depth and stability and it symbolizes confidence, and heaven.  He had all those things.On Saturday I heard the song Tin Man, by America, and the words,\"Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man, That he didn't, didn't already have\" reminded me of Chip. Someone had said that we'd given Chip so much. But I don't think so. He already had everything and so much more inside him. We just helped him to find it.~A first photo of Chip in June 2018~"},

He's getting along really well with all the dogs, and the cats too.Here's what we know about Leo ...He countersurfsHe begs at the tableHe wants to sleep on the bedHe loves treats so much so that he got into the treat bag of the girl who comes to trim nailsHe has great eye-mouth coordination to catch those treatsHe loves mealtimesHe doesn't come when called - When he knows you want him to come with you, when you reach for his collar, just as you get within inches of him, he'll playfully run offHe likes everyone (mostly women)He is afraid of storms (like so many goldens)He is always smiling and wagging his tailHe is always ready for the next fun thing to happenWe think Leo is perfect! And in the weeks ahead, he'll be available for adoption via the Golden Retriever Rescue.  Leo will be a great addition to someone's home who will also love his fun and easy going personality and nature as much as we do!"},
{"title": "Good-Bye to Outdoor Kitty, Gino", "date": "Tuesday, April 21, 2020", "text": "The first day of this week ended on a sad note for us as we said good-bye today to our outdoor kitty Gino. His appetite was all but gone, and he began hiding from us, and not coming back inside. The diagnosis was liver failure. There was nothing that could be done.Gino came to us exactly 2 years and 2 days ago after someone moved away leaving their 8ish cats behind -- The \"Loudoun Community Cat Coalition\" trapped them all, vetted and re-homed them, and through what can only be described as serendipity he found his way to us.~The first day we met \"the cat with no name\"~At first Gino was strictly an outdoor cat.But his six month plan to come inside came in a little ahead of schedule. It took him only about 4 months to find a spot inside the house and on the table.It did take him a little longer to learn to trust the dogs, who in turn got over their fear of him.Gino truly became part of our lives and household.For a cat that was supposed to be feral, Gino was a gentle soul.  And when I held him and he purred, on my worst days, it was a great comfort. He was a good friend and good company wherever he happened to be.Near the end our driveway, where the mowing ends, and the grass grows tall, was Gino's favorite spot. He spent hours there, watching birds, and whatever else crossed his path, and soaking up the sun.It only seemed right to make it his final resting place.God speed to our very first \"outdoor kitty\" who has a place all his very own inside our hearts. We will really miss him."},
{"title": "George Returns to Golden Pines", "date": "Sunday, April 19, 2020", "text": "Saturday was the day I arranged to get George picked up from Paul's brother. I really wanted to make it easy for the brother, so I drove over an hour to get there, to an area of Maryland that I'd never been to before.~Sykesville Maryland~George was happy to see me, and wouldn't stop barking. In fact, for the first 20 minutes of our drive home, all he did was bark and shove his head under my arm. It was really good to see him!  ...not so much to hear him though.Unfortunately, about 20 minutes into our drive home, I had car/van trouble again. It was the same issue I'd had in February.  Not knowing the area, thankfully I was able to make it to a shopping center, I'd passed on my way to pick up George, where I was able to safely park. Having done this before, and because we have an \"extended warranty\" I called and a tow truck to take my van to a dealership closer to home was arranged.~Here we go again....~I will fast forward through the snags caused by the (less than competent) man I had initially spoken to, because the next person on the phone was totally sympathetic, and helpful (she could hear George barking) and she solved those issues for me. Carl and the tow truck showed up at about the same time and six hours later, we were safely home. What an afternoon!I read recently that dogs have associative memory, remembering people, places, and experiences based on their associations they have with them. I totally believe that. George has settled right back in, even remembering where he used to eat, and I'm so glad to report that he's not barking much at all.So, whatever is ahead for George -- Lab Rescue has said they'll help to find him a new home if needed -- George is going to be just fine.  Welcome back George!"},
{"title": "We'll See What Happens", "date": "Thursday, April 16, 2020", "text": "It has been a bit of a strange and mixed bag of a week. I'm not even sure where to begin exactly.Maybe I'll start with tonight, and work my way back with to the real news of the day.This evening, for some reason, our outdoor kitty Gino won't come back inside the garage. We tried for over an hour to catch him, so we could shut the door to keep him safe overnight, but he won't come to us and keeps running off. I'm wondering if something maybe scared him?Work at the office continues to slow down. But I'm still asked to be there all day. We have two emergency patients to see on Thursday. With no patients scheduled on Wednesday, I took Max in with me to the office. He was fun company, and the girl at the front desk, who is a real animal lover gave Max lots of extra attention which he soaked up.While I was at work, I got a phone call from Paul. You'll remember him as the owner of Abe and George, the Barkalot Brothers. You''ll also remember that Lab Rescue returned them to him in January and Abe passed away in February. Well, Paul is back in the hospital. I'm not sure of the details, (but it's not COVID), and he wants to GIVE me George. He said he's no longer able to care for him because George was becoming more and more \"mobility challenged\" and along with being hospitalized a few times, it's just to hard for him to give George the care he needs.  Of course I agreed to take him back.~The day the Barkalots were returned to Paul~Paul's brother called me last evening, and we're going to try and arrange something for this weekend or early next week. And with that, can I just say I had a feeling that might happen? Of course, I didn't and hoped it wouldn't. But I kept the door and communication with Paul open just in case because I wanted to make sure that Abe and George were safe.~George~We'll see what happens."},
{"title": "Two Birthdays and a New Boy ", "date": "Friday, April 10, 2020", "text": "I don't have to say what a busy week it has been. I'm not sure how I ever managed to work 5 days a week. Even though it's not 40 hours (and it's less pay) being gone from home every day means that nothing is really getting done.~Virginia Bluebells are in bloom right now~Thankfully, Carl is temporarily home while his agency tries to cut back on the teams that are working at his location. So, he's been a big help. Despite the busy week and no real free time and all that has come with it, it has been a pretty good week for our crew.On Saturday, we marked a 10th birthday, for Max. I post his pictures often enough, but I don't say much about him.  Max has been with us for nearly 4 years now. He is a picky eater, sensitive to my emotions and has been a great comfort in sad times and happy ones too. He is an affectionate, fun and comical companion, who loves to chase and pounce on the cats. He's also a good friend and an attentive canine brother to the other dogs, including Todd.And speaking of Todd.... He also had a birthday this week.  Can you believe that Todd is now 9 years old?  I know I can't!  So, as is my tradition, I take this (silly) picture every year, using the same hat, same setting, the same, (but different) cookie -- Next year, at 10, I'll make a collage of all the photos.But at 9 years old, Todd is fearless, smart, and so much more. It goes without saying that I love his spirit for fun and tireless energy for whatever comes next. Like most Scotties, Todd can be independent, but he is a devoted companion and friend. An example of that is when I go to bed at night, he follows me, and stays on the bed until I get up the next morning. Even if I sleep late.Finally, just because things aren't hopping enough at our house, we have welcomed a handsome new arrival. A very nervous Leo arrived on Wednesday evening. At eleven years old, he was given up by his owner who has stage 4 breast cancer. Leo spent the last 2 semesters at college with the youngest daughter. But because of life and its circumstances, none of the 3 children are able to provide a longtime home for Leo. He's a really nice dog, and you can't help but like him.Leo is a bit of a \"nervous nellie\" and is not a fan of thunder storms, new men, and change. But today, with better weather, feeling comfortable and confident, there have been lots of tailwags, and smiles --The best way to start a weekend!~Cat, what cat??~"},
{"title": "Settling Into Change", "date": "Friday, April 3, 2020", "text": "Friends, thank you for sharing the loss of Rhett with me. I have been comforted by the messages and kind words you sent, and have left here on my blog. Thank you for thinking of me.It is now just over a week later, and I am doing okay. But I will admit to still getting a bit choked up at times. I really miss Rhett and the change in the daily routine because he's no longer here.~Rhett and Alf~But I know I'm not the only one dealing with change and the uncertainty that it all brings. With all \"elective dental work\" now being postponed throughout the US, many dental offices are now closed. And with all that, the doctor that I've worked for, for nearly 15 years, has furloughed all of us that work in the office until at least June. However, the office needs to remain open to reschedule appointments, answer the phone and see any emergencies. So, Dr S worked out a schedule so that all of us in the office could work at least one day a week.~Dr. S trying out his new mask.... He hated it....~But when you work in an office full of germaphobes (me included) the fear of catching the virus from a patient has all of the clinical staff passing on that offer. So, for the moment that leaves *ME,* yours truly, to work every.single.day. until another co-worker decides they are comfortable coming into the office. Which may or may not happen. I don't know. Of course I'm trying to be understanding and supportive of my co-workers. But I will confess that I'm not happy about it; because of course, I would like to be home too. But the doctor needs someone to work with him when there's an emergency patient. And I want to do what I can to help keep the practice open, so that when all this is over, there's hopefully a job to come back to.So, with all of that, unfortunately, I'm gone from home more than I want to be. With everything that's happening, I was looking forward to some extra time at home to get a few things done, and of course to spend time with the dogs. Because I need the comic relief  that only Charlie the ice man can give....and all the others like Todd....And a beautiful and delicious homemade pie can bring!"},
{"title": "What Happened.... ", "date": "Saturday, March 28, 2020", "text": "It may be Saturday, but the events of this past Wednesday are still fresh in my mind.  I'll start by saying that I'd noticed changes in Rhett over the last several weeks. Of course it had me very concerned, and so I was keeping a very close eye on him.Wednesday began with what could have best been described as a perfect day for Rhett. As I was leaving to run errands, Rhett, who loved a car ride, stood at the door and wanted to go along. It was a cold rainy day, so on a whim, I decided to take him and Max with me. I occasionally rolled down the middle windows so Rhett could stick his nose out and smell the air. He didn't do that so much, but he seemed happy to be along for the ride.Before going home, I made a last stop at \"Chick Fil A\" to get a quick lunch that I shared with Max and Rhett. Just as we were finishing, Rhett who had been laying in between the seats, started gagging, and when he put his head way back, I saw his tongue and gums were pale -- He wasn't breathing. I quickly got out and pulled him from in between the seats and I laid him flat, got his airway open, and did an equivalent of CPR, by blowing into his nose and shaking him - And I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure I was yelling and begging him to not go.... Time seemed to be standing still, and so when I saw Rhett blink and take a breath, I just started crying. Max was sitting on the backseat, shaking and when I started cheering for Rhett, we both felt a huge sense of relief.A blur of phone calls and within minutes we were sitting in the parking lot of a nearby vet. Because of the virus, I had to wait outside while a vet I'd never met, but I knew by reputation, assessed Rhett, and took x-rays. Those x-rays showed an enlarged heart, (a possible tumor) and a mass on his spleen. Several phone calls with the vet and the what ifs followed. But in the end, as devastating as it was to hear, there was nothing that could be done - This was all made harder because from outside, I could hear Rhett barking inside. The vet, who was showing us nothing but kindness and patience, of course allowed me to take Rhett and spend time with him.I'd been told that what happened earlier, could and probably would occur again. Or, that Rhett could pass away on his own, in his sleep, or without me there. This all weighed so heavy on my heart and mind. I knew that what the vet was telling me was the explanation for all that I'd seen happening with Rhett the last few weeks.That feeling of total helplessness that I'd had in the parking lot of Chick Fil A was still so fresh in my mind. Of course I didn't want any of that to happen again. What if I could not revive Rhett again? What if I wasn't there? None of this would be fair to Rhett. Along with having a big personality, he was also truly a dog that had a great deal of dignity. I felt strongly that his life should be one that ended that way. Not one filled with panic or chaos.So, as I sat on the floor, next to a snoring Rhett, in the early evening of Wednesday March 25th, he left this life with all the dignity and peace that he deserved. And of course, breaking my heart, and taking a piece of it with him, but leaving so much more behind.Our candle has been lit since Wednesday to both honor and remember Rhett and to help him find his way on his journey. However, I have a feeling that Rhett has been able to find his way to that on his own. Thinking that, somehow lifts my spirit.Finally, as is our tradition, giving Rhett his color for the Rainbow. I've thought about that over the last few days. Not long after Rhett came to us, I bought him a new collar. I found what I thought was the perfect one for him -- A tie-dyed/multi-colored one that I thought said something about him.With so many colors to consider, yellow has been a color I've seen all over the last couple of days. It's  practically everywhere right now.And so, I have decided that Rhett's color is yellow. Yellow is the third color from the top in a rainbow. Yellow is vibrant in itself, and it represents the color of the sun, full of energy.It also represents brightness and happiness.~A carpet of yellow flowers along the tow-path near the Potomac~And now, it represents my beloved Rhett."},
{"title": "A Sad Farewell to Rhett ", "date": "Thursday, March 26, 2020", "text": "While the world is practicing social distancing, yesterday, my precious and beloved Rhett was sent to the Rainbow Bridge.I will tell the story of the unexpected events that took Rhett from us in my next post. Today, I just want to post a small tribute to a dog whose big personality eclipsed Todd's, but only in the way that a Golden Retriever can.~Rhett, on the day we met in September 2017~Despite having several homes before he came to us, Rhett's spirit and spark never dimmed. He was confident, affectionate, happy, mischievous, and those were just a few of his qualities. And of course I can't forget to mention that he was also very photogenic, independent and he could be pretty stubborn at times.I loved Rhett's \"intense\" expressions that he had when he wanted something.Of course I always let him have his way - How could I not?I fell in love with Rhett the first day I met him in September of 2017. There was something so familiar and comfortable about him. All the dogs liked him right away as well. His easy going nature made it obvious that he thought that life was a fun adventure, and he was always ready for what came next.This may go a long way in explaining why he was such a good escape artist. I will never forget on our first day together, how I turned around several times after thinking I'd confined him, only to see him standing behind me with the other dogs. Or the time he managed to get out of the breakroom at the office where I work, and was halfway down the steps before I caught up to him. His eagerness for a fun game, more times than I can count, had a way of making me forget my troubles.I will always treasure the 908 days we had Rhett in our lives. Through the heartache, the tears, and the swollen eyes from crying, losing him at this moment feels unbearable. I am going to miss having Rhett as part of my life. Walks won't be the same. Rides in the car won't be as much fun.  Mealtimes will be quieter.  Life will be quieter. And I know it goes without saying that despite how I'm feeling, without a doubt, I would do it all over again. To be loved and love a dog like Rhett was a priceless gift.Thank you, Rhett for finding your way to us and being a “once-in-a-lifetime” and to us, a perfect dog."},
{"title": "Plenty of Time! ", "date": "Tuesday, March 17, 2020", "text": "The doctor that I work for has decided to close the office until at least April 1st. My co-workers and I knew the day may be coming. In an office full of germaphobes, we supported it coming sooner, rather than later. The patients that I spoke to about rescheduling their appointments understood. However, there is always one who doesn't, and *he* is insisting on being seen for treatment that he has put off for a couple of years. So, I'm working on Friday to assist the doctor.~A dental photo of Todd!~So, with my new found time off, I will admit to having grandioso plans of things that I could do while I'm at home. In fact, one of my co-workers and I have made a bet to see which one of us will get that one task done that we have put off doing (because we didn't want to do it) before the office is scheduled to reopen on April first. The loser has to buy lunch. The job I keep putting off?  Just look at the photo below. This kitchen cabinet has been a thorn in my side for months. I've been shoving things into it to the point where I just about cannot get the doors to close. It's the cabinet that I keep all the dog medications and dry and canned good in.  Believe it or not, I do know most of what is in there. But I have to admit that there is also no telling what's hiding in the back or under something that I've forgotten about. Which is why it really needs be organized. But it's after 2 o'clock, and I've not even had lunch yet. I'll think about doing that or another task tomorrow... Yeah, tomorrow .... There's plenty of time ... Right now, I need to go see what Todd is barking at."},

(For several reasons, the Golden did not come into the rescue with her).After 4 days, Maya has settled in pretty well and is adjusting to her new life and routine. We still have a few things that we need to show and try to teach her; like how to get back inside the house, and where the water bowls are. Maya is deaf, so it may take a little time. But I'm sure that together we'll figure it all out.Maya is a gentle and old soul. She's not interacting much with us or her new packmates. But I am hopeful that will change as she gets to know us and finds her place in the household.However, in true Lab form, she's all about anything that has to do with food or mealtime - a good appetite is a good sign!~I love Maya's smile!~Welcome to Golden Pines, Maya!"},
{"title": "A Week in Picture Review", "date": "Sunday, March 8, 2020", "text": "The start of yet another week. Today started daylight savings time, but it still begs the question with the time change, is spring really around the corner?  How I'd hoped for at least one good snowfall this winter.  But there's still time, right?Okay, enough of my dreaming.  Here's a day-by-day-picture review of our week.Monday....Again.... really? Rhett's face says it perfectly!Tuesday.... I voted.Tuesday was also the day that outdoor kitty, Gino was let into the house by our dog-walker, and she didn't put him back outside when she left. When Carl and my brother got home an unopened bag of flour had gotten knocked off a shelf (that the dogs couldn't reach) and it was everywhere - That part was thanks to the dogs.  Of course, Gino (outdoor kitty) was blamed for it and not allowed back inside.But I realized the next day, that it wasn't Gino that knocked the bag of flour off a shelf, that was Sophie's annoying siamese cat, Tiggy. And, I realized that only because Tiggy returned to the scene of the crime and was sitting on that same shelf. I couldn't help but think that it was a whole scene reminiscent of Lady and the Tramp when the Siamese cats, Si and Am got poor Lady into trouble for their mischief.Finally it was Wednesday... My last day of commuting to work.... Rhett loves being a co-pilot!Rhett's expression says how I feel about being home for 4 days!Thursday.... Chip met our Holistic Vet. He did really well, and was so relaxed that he took a nap as we discussed a palliative option that I didn't know about.  More about that if I decide to go forward. Until that decision is made, we've started Chip on a couple of Chinese herbs to try and slow the progression of the cancer.Friday....This gave me a grin.And hold on.... When we got to Saturday, we welcomed a new girl, a Chocolate Lab, named Maya.  I'll tell you about her in my next post.So here we are on Sunday..... A great day for Todd and his new ball to spend some time outside together.I've looked for weeks for a ball that I thought he couldn't chew up. The ones I've bought for him for the last few years held up really well, but they are no longer made. I've looked all through the online stores to try and find one and can't. So, I hope this new one will be Scottie tough!Because he really does seem to like it."},
{"title": "Chip and My Promise to Him", "date": "Sunday, March 1, 2020", "text": "Since Thursday I've been trying to find the words for this post. But they just won't come. I've wanted to tell the story of the last few weeks with Chip. But the uncertainty and trepidation that I've had about him has consumed me and I just haven't been able to.It began a couple of weeks ago when Chip started limping and holding up his back leg.  He'd slipped a couple of times and when he got up, he was favoring his knee. But after a day or so he'd be fine. But now, his limp wasn't going away. I just knew he'd torn his ACL, (anterior cruciate ligament) and would need knee surgery. I decided last week to confine Chip.  I thought that in making him rest that maybe if it was a partial tear, his knee would improve, and maybe we would be able to avoid the surgery.Well, Chip didn't get any better. And, having to wait three days for an appointment with Mobile Vet didn't change that. When we arrived for our appointment, Mobile Vet said without even examining Chip, that he thought that it was a torn ACL. But when he did the exam, that changed.A single x-ray was taken and that was all Mobile Vet said he needed because he could see right away what was causing Chip to limp. And before Mobile Vet could say it, I said, \"it's bone cancer, isn't it?\"  He nodded his head and said that it was. It was my worst fear realized, and it was one I'd thought of, but I kept it deep inside, and didn't allow myself to even consider or say it until that moment. It was a crushing blow.....Mobile Vet and I discussed every. single. option. for treatment and I have considered each one. Years ago, the first senior Golden we had, had bone cancer, so I know from that experience, and from others experiences, that it is a very painful cancer. So taking everything about Chip into consideration, it has taken 2 days and a lot of tears to feel comfortable about the path to take with him.Chip will not be having surgery to remove his leg and do chemo, which is the traditional treatment.  Instead I have made an appointment with Holistic Vet for this coming week. My hope is that she has some tricks up her sleeve that will slow down the cancer, and give us and Chip more quality time. And most importantly and what is paramount is to keep Chip as pain free as we can.Managing his pain is not a challenge at the moment, however, it will be one in the days to come. But I've made Chip a promise that we'll do our best to make his last days ones that are free from pain. And this promise is one I fully intend to keep."},
{"title": "A Mixed Bag of a Week", "date": "Sunday, February 23, 2020", "text": "Last week was really a mix bag. On Tuesday, I had car-trouble. I don't know about you, but I put car problems right up there with computer issues. Thankfully, I wasn't far from my office, and I was able to make it there, and on time too! I've had my van for a couple of years and it has an \"extended warranty\" so it was towed to a dealership. A new ignition coil, and spark plug had it all fixed by Wednesday afternoon, at a minimum cost to me. I was really grateful for that and when I had nothing for lunch on Tuesday, a thoughtful patient by chance, brought us lunch that day.Car problems behind us, we cruised onto my day off where Alf made a trip to the groomers for a mid winter haircut.Hannah was also back at the vet to recheck her eye and ear infections. New/different medications for both will hopefully do the trick.~Hannah~ We are still waiting to hear about Dexter, who we were asked to foster about 2 weeks ago. He was unexpectedly snapped up by another volunteer for the rescue, so whether he will be coming to us is a guess right now.With the weekend, we did slow down for the really nice weather on Saturday, and we spent a little bit of time outside.It was nice to be out in the fresh air and sunshine to recharge a bit.Finally, I want to share with you some sad news that I got this week. Paul, the owner of the Barkalot Brothers called me to let me know that Abe has crossed to the Rainbow Bridge. He also sent the below e-mail to Lab Rescue which one coordinator shared with me.It is with much sadness that I must tell you that I had to have Abe put down last Sunday. He was having a seizure and I called his vet who lives up the street ...  He came and took his temperature that was 108.5 and I told the vet to put Abe down as I could not stand to see him suffer any longer. Abe passing is really hard for me, he was my special needs buddy and even with his blindness and diabetes he was all dog and heart. You would never know about his disability. In all the years giving Abe insulin he never gave me any trouble. I miss him very much and I am heartbroken. I think George misses him also.I thank you and all the wonderful people at Lab rescue for taking care of my boys when I couldn't. I am forever thankful to you gals and forever heartbroken over Abe. Sorry to have to tell you this horrible news.I was grateful that Paul called me to share the news. We talked for nearly an hour, and I think it gave him the chance to talk about Abe's loss, and for me it gave me the chance to let him know that I share the loss of Abe with him. I am so grateful that Abe and George were returned to him, and that Abe left this life with the person who loved him first.  ~Paul, Abe and George in January~God speed to Abe and prayers of peace and comfort to Paul and George too.~Abe~"},

Charlie got a good report and we're staying the course. And for Sophie, it was something new. I'm can't remember what exactly Holistic Vet called it, so I will just call it \"tuning fork therapy\" and it was done to give some relief from Sophie's laryngeal paralysis. Its been used on people for quite some time, but using it on dogs, is relatively new. A tuning fork was used on all of Sophie's acupuncture points and it's supposed to open up the pathways to help to improve her breathing. Sophie sounded better afterwards, so we'll see how it goes. Have any of you heard of this?Finally, on Tuesday, I received an e-mail from Lab Rescue, asking us to take another \"hospice-foster-dog.\" I said \"no\" because this boy, named Oscar, doesn't like cats or small dogs. And despite Todd being a big dog in a little dog suit, something I would never tell him, I didn't think it would be a fit. Then came another e-mail on Wednesday ......would you consider Dexter.  He is being returned to us after being adopted in 2013.  He is now 13 years young, and about 80lbs. He's had a rough go of it: He was left with a family member when the original adoptive couple split up, then left with another family member “for a week” six months ago.  Since then their landlord told them they have to get back to two dogs. When they started looking into rehoming him, and trying to locate vet records, they found out he came from us.  Dexter doesn't enjoy small children poking around in his face, and isn't a fan of having his ears cleaned or nails trimmed. Beyond that, he's reportedly 'a terrific dog.' Housetrained, enjoys hanging out in the yard and napping on the couch, good with cats and other dogs.Below is a collage of pictures taken 5 years ago. As always, I'm sorry that Dexter has found himself without a home. But I'm always grateful that the rescue is there to take them back and keep them safe. I don't know yet when Dexter will arrive. But I look forward to meeting our 'newest Valentine.'"},

This is simply because they're on Sunday, and I often teach at church, so I have never attended. But for whatever reason,  I decided to go to the one held this month and take our foster boy Hershey.I didn't really think he'd get adopted, and I'll admit to only going through the motions in getting everything together for him. But the cosmos and serendipity had other plans. Because I had just gotten out of my van, when a couple walked up to me and asked if I had Hershey. They told me they had come specifically to meet and adopt him. After my shock and surprise wore off, and okay, I'll admit some hesitation too, I knew after chatting with them for several minutes, they were perfect for Hershey. They are both retired teachers that only want to spoil and pamper a senior dog for whatever time they have left. How could I say no to that?I spoke to both \"K&L\" this afternoon, and the report of how Hershey is settling in could not be more glowing and they could not be more smitten with him. They've bought him a new orthopedic bed (even though he sleeps on theirs) and new toys too. There is no doubt, he is being totally spoiled and pampered and could not be in a home with a nicer new family all his very own.~Adoption day board noting Hershey was adopted!~It's all been a reminder to me about the good things that happen when you're not looking for them. It's what serendipity is, and I am a believer.Congratulations to Hershey!"},

As I mentioned in my previous post, she is the first dog accepted into Lab Rescue in 2020. Hannah's life changed around the end of last year when she was picked up as a stray. After Hannah did her time in the shelter, she was released to the rescue and her new life began with a long road trip to Maryland.~Hannah on Weds., enjoying what I'm sure was her first Puppuccino~In boarding, Hannah was evaluated, and had surgery to remove a very large mammary tumor. A surgery that would take nearly 3 hours. The rescue has addressed everything that they can cure or manage - severe eye, ear and skin infections. But unfortunately along with the initial surgery, it was discovered that she has 10-15 other tumors that are malignant and aggressive. She will not undergo treatment for them, or for her heartworm.Despite this diagnosis, Lab Rescue has made Hannah available for adoption. We're hoping someone will fall in love with her and want to spoil her and give her a home all her own, and make her last days and hopefully months, her best days and months.Welcome to Hannah.

So Carl helps by holding him still. He had the hair on his feet trimmed up too. Rhett oversaw all of that.Afterwards I picked up the winter farm share of vegetables for a friend who is out of town for the weekend. In exchange for picking it up and taking it to her home, I get to keep whatever I'd like.I'll admit, I'm not much for winter root vegetables, but I did keep fresh eggs and carrots.Max who was also along with me and Rhett approved of those choices.  Groundhog Day on Sunday. Todd and I checked for our shadows.The way our sky looked at the time, we had to agree with Puxatony Phil who didn't see his shadow. That's supposed to mean an early spring.We're okay with that, but I am really hoping Mother Nature has a snowstorm or two for us.  I am missing winter.You may have noticed, that Todd has been groomed. I took him last week, along with Charlie and Sophie. Sophie was just along for the ride so that the groomer (who is the one I got her from) could see how well she's doing, stayed for a spa day too.  Both were worn out afterwards.And I am all rested as the week begins.  SORRY that I may have confused a few of you in my last post when I mentioned work.

This is the pair I was asked to take last week, and declined.  I was asked again on Tuesday since Bean is having some health issues, because of that, and feeling a bit recharged, I agreed to take them.~First photos from the rescue of Hopper and Bean at the kennel ~These girls come to us from North Carolina. In September their owner took them to a kennel for boarding, and never returned. After due diligence by the kennel, the two were considered legally abandoned and Hopper and Bean were turned over to Lab Rescue.They are nice girls, and have gotten along pretty well with our crew.Unfortunately after a couple of too-close-encounters with the cats, and their behavior when they're around, it's easy to see that the two have a very high prey drive that can't be curbed. Of course, I don't want our cats to get hurt (or worse) so I've asked for Hopper and Bean to be moved to another foster home.Since they have been in boarding since September, and with Bean not feeling so well, I don't want them to have to return to a kennel. And since I'm feeling relatively confident that we can keep the cats safe, we've agreed to keep them until a new foster home can be identified.~Hopper~I'm glad that we have the chance to get to know Hopper and Bean. Aside from their prey drive, I like them very much. Hopper, is what I think may be a Lab mix. She's very smart, does as she's asked, and is alert to everything happening around her. She was a bit reserved and tentative at first. But today she's much more relaxed and follows me everywhere. Hopper was so happy to have room to run in our big fenced yard. This is another reason why I've agreed to keep them instead of returning them to boarding.On the flip side is Bean. At 14 years old, as I've already said, she's not feeling well, and she's having problems getting up and around. She also loved the chance to be outside soaking up some sun. She sat in the grass for a long time and sniffed the air. She is a patient and gentle old soul, who enjoys attention. I hope being in a home, on a warm bed, and some one-on-one personal care, she'll start to feel better before she and Hopper leave us to begin the next chapter of their lives.    ~Bean~"},
{"title": "Sleeping In ", "date": "Sunday, January 12, 2020", "text": "It has of course been a quiet weekend at our house as I've let the dust settle from the departure of the Barkalot Brothers. The schedule that we were keeping to make sure Abe got fed and his insulin on time is now out the window. On Friday morning, I got up, let the dogs out and back in, and went back to bed and slept until nearly 10 o'clock. Totally unheard of for me. The dogs slept too, so maybe the peace and quiet was needed for them as well.When breakfast finally did come, Todd was outside barking at the deer (or something) at the far side of the yard, and my calling and trying to bribe him couldn't convince him to come inside. He had brunch around noon. None of the dogs seemed to notice the time.On Friday I was asked by Lab Rescue to take another pair. This time a pair of senior girls whose owner left them at a kennel and never came back for them. Of course I want to help them, but at that very moment, I just didn't feel like I was up to it.But I was up to taking a few fun pictures of the dogs eating some of Charlie's food mix off the spatula.~Rhett - Sure, I'll eat anything!~~Max - You want me to eat that?!~~Todd - You called me to the door for this??~~Alf - Sure I'll try it, why not?~~Sophie - I like to see my food as I eat it~~Chip - Just put the food into the opening~I hope you had a relaxing weekend too!"},
{"title": "The Barkalot Brothers Go Home ", "date": "Friday, January 10, 2020", "text": "~A little bit of snow on Tuesday~On Thursday, Abe and George, or the Barkalot Brothers returned to the person who loved them first - Their original owner, Paul.I was pretty sure that I didn't want to be the one to return the Barkalot Brothers to Paul. But the cosmos had something else in mind because I was asked to do it. Despite my feelings, I knew I needed and should see this through and make sure for myself that Abe and George's return to Paul was the right decision.I spoke with Paul the evening before and he was quite emotional about Abe and George coming home. He was really missing them. He said he felt right away that it was a mistake to give into the pressure by his family to give them up. But he felt he had no choice. Paul told me about what the two meant to he and his wife who as you may remember, passed away 2 years ago. And I'll confess to being curious about her afterwards and looked up her obituary online.  Abe and George were mentioned in it.  George remembered Paul right away and whined and cried. He was not the only one. I could tell Paul's brother who'd come with him, felt the emotions in that moment too. Abe was a little bit aloof at first. I think it may have been because of his blindness, but after a minute or two, it was obvious he remembered Paul. Both dogs remembered how to get into his truck and with that, they were ready to go home!Paul called me last evening to thank me (and the rescue) again for caring for George and Abe. He told me that they'd settled in and were sleeping in their old spots. I know it's how it should be and all is right in their world. And it's eerily quiet in ours."},
{"title": "Three to Six Months? What?! ", "date": "Sunday, January 5, 2020", "text": "¸.•´¸.•*´¨) ¸.•*¨)(¸.•´ (¸.•` ¤HAPPY NEW YEAR blogging friends! Your support and friendship has been one of the most valuable things in my life this past year. Thank you for that and so much more that keeps me here and blogging which helps me to focus. My goal continues to keep this blog going, and to work to be better at it than I was last year. ~Rhett~But what was a better way for us to start off this 2020 year than with someone injured? This time it was Sophie's cat, Tiggy. He got tackled by George who chased him down the hallway. George is a bit unsteady on his feet and slipped on top of Tiggy. Tiggy wasn't putting all of his weight on his back leg, but he was putting some, and eating and drinking, which was a good sign. Since it was New Years Day, we opted to wait until the next day to have him seen by the vet. ~Tiggy - Sophie's cat~ On Thursday, Abe had yet another glucose curve test. So after his breakfast and being given his insulin, I had to get him dropped off at the vet's office as soon as I could. While getting Abe to the vet, I was getting in touch with Mobile vet to get that appointment for Tiggy. Mobile Vet could see us right away. And as you can see on the map below, the vets offices are about an hour away from each other, (One in Maryland, one in Virginia) so it's a bit of driving, especially with traffic.  After reviewing all of Tiggy's faults with Mobile Vet ....He bites, he hisses, he doesn't like to be touched or handled, Tiggy was on his very best behavior during the x-rays and could not have been more accepting of being handled. He made a really good first impression with Mobile Vet. Cats have a way of doing the opposite of what you think they'll do, don't they? But thankfully nothing is broken, and he has a soft tissue injury. So, no dogs and restricted activity for a few weeks for Tiggy. For George, no more chasing him. Which by the way, is always the rule, no matter which dog it is.~George - What's that about no cat chasing?~But yet again, the not so good news is for Abe. This time, his glucose levels were too high. So, yet another adjustment has been made to his insulin, and another test is to be scheduled in about 2 weeks. Can I just confess to all of you, that I'm really frustrated by all of this?  I mentioned Abe to Mobile Vet and he told me it can take 3-6 months to find the right insulin dose for a dog -- What??!!  I did a bit of reading, and Mobile Vet is (of course) correct. Three to six months.~Abe~The owner, Paul, asked for Abe and George to be returned the first part of December. I have understood and supported the rescues decision to return the dogs to Paul, and to wait to do that. But 3-6 months?  I think that's too long. Since the decision has been made, Abe and George should/need to be returned to Paul, and let him incur the expense of the tests to figure out Abe's proper dose of insulin. If Abe and George had been adopted by someone else, it would be the same thing. This was all on Thursday and more than once I've asked the Foster Home Coordinator to call me, and that has yet to happen. I know she's busy and there are dogs with bigger and more serious needs than Abe and George. And so I'm trying to be patient.~The Yellow Labs practicing patience - Chip/red collar, and George, left and Abe~But I'm not always good at that. I think I learned it from Todd. Who by the way was already creating a bit of mischief this year when he somehow got onto the ironing board in search of Tiggy's food, that wasn't there.So, onward to the New Year we go. With 2019 behind us, I'm reminded that all we can do is look back, relish the good times, learn from the bad and go forward. Or as some people, and maybe even dogs like Todd would say, “Bravely Onward.” Yes, indeed."},

How have your holidays been?  I don't know about you, but I ended up running around like a lunatic trying to get everything done. And yesterday, two days after Christmas, I finally got the last of my cards sent. Today two gifts go in the mail for my brothers and their families, and I will officially hobble across the Christmas-finish line. Hurray for me!I have thought about my blog every single day since I last posted and really wanted to keep it up to date. But that just didn't happen. **Stephanie, thank-you for thinking of us and asking if we were okay!!** Last Saturday a friend and I were off to a matinee at the Kennedy Center to see the play, \"Come From Away,\" which tells the true story of 7,000 passengers, who were on their way to different parts of America when the tragedy of 9/11 struck. As the American air space closed, 38 planes were grounded in the Newfoundland community of Gander, a town with only five hundred hotel rooms. My friend and I both loved it, and if you ever get the chance to see it, I highly recommend it!~Hall of Nations - Kennedy Center~Back at home, the Barkalot Brothers are still doing what they do best, barking. Abe returned to the vet for yet another glucose curve test, which he failed again. We've tweaked his insulin dose and food again, and next week, he'll go back for another test.~Abe~The Foster Home Coordinator has spoken to their previous owner, and the decision has been made to return Abe and George to him. However, the coordinator is adamant about not returning the two until Abe's medication is at its proper dose. This hasn't made *Paul* happy. And while I'll admit that I'm ready for them to leave us, I support the coordinators decision to keep them for a bit longer.~George, left -- Abe, right~Moving onto our only girl Sophie. Her appetite is off, and she's been coughing a bit more than I'd like and she's breathing pretty heavily at times too.  Sophie is due to return to the vet in January. I just hope this isn't a sign of the progression of the laryngeal paralysis, or the return of the thyroid cancer she was treated for before she came to us.~The lovely Sophie~The rest of our cast of characters are doing pretty well. Knock on wood of course. They're in pretty good spirits too.~Max~Well, Todd wasn't for about 5 minutes when he had to do another quick photo shoot for me.  Another blogger calls these pictures, \"The Hat Tax.\" She says it's a tax \"for the costs our beloved dogs incur without contributing financially to the household, so several times per year, usually around holidays, they are required to pay the hat tax.\"  I am totally embracing this tax, and explained all this to Todd. Being a Scottie, and given that there were lots of treats involved, I think he understood, because in less than 5 minutes he was \"paid in full\" and the photo session ended.    It was the same for Rhett. Who I think looks dignified no matter what ridiculous thing I put onto him.And so with that, it's onto the end of the year!~Outdoor kitty Gino~"},

I've not been feeling well, and have even missed work. I'm feeling a bit better this evening.But thank-you so much for sharing your experiences, candid thoughts and support on my last post; they went a long way. They helped me to articulate my thoughts and feelings about returning George and Abe. They also gave me and the coordinator from the rescue, a few things to consider. At this moment, Abe and George being returned is on hold.Abe returned to the vet on Friday for another glucose curve test.  He failed. His glucose was so low that they had to feed him to bring the level up. We've decreased the insulin, and increased his food.~Chipper, on the left keeping George company while Abe is gone~We all know that Labs live to eat, but Abe really is hungry and his continuing to lose weight is a concern too. The special/prescription food that Abe eats, I think, has no nutritional value, so it's not a surprise that he's hungry all the time. Abe goes back to the vet on Friday for another test.~Abe~Paul (previous owner) was contacted about returning Abe and George to him. He assured the rescue that he's financially able to provide for them. However, he was going back into the hospital today (Tuesday) for a couple of more days of tests and should be home in a day or so. This raised the nagging concerns I have about his continuing to care for Abe and George, concerns which the foster-home-coordinator for the rescue also shares.    ~George~As I said, as it stands right now, we're on hold until the end of the week. Lab Rescue is in favor of their return to their former home.  However, the concerns we all share about Abe and George's ongoing care is first and foremost and will again be discussed with Paul.  And, the foster home coordinator feels strongly that we need to get Abe's diabetes stabilized as well. So, whether they will be back home in time for Christmas is anyone's guess."},

I AM PRAYING THAT YOU REACH OUT TO ME AND I AM REUNITED WITH MY BOYS  Returning Abe and George to their previous owner is being seriously considered.  The foster home coordinator is going to reach out to the previous owner today and she will make the decision. I told her that I trusted her to make the best decision. But I am not sure how I feel about it. Of course my first concern is for Abe and George. They needed all their care updated when they first came into the rescue. Also to consider is that Abe is diabetic. Also diagnosed when he came into the rescue. Will the owner be able to afford and give him the care he needs?What do you think?"},

{"title": "Lessons Learned and Remembered", "date": "Saturday, November 23, 2019", "text": "Thank-you all for your support and great suggestions on how to curb the barking problem we're having with George and Abe. You have been a tremendous help by reminding me of some of the tried and true tricks that I'd not thought to try or remembered. Another thank-you to kruzingwithk9s who reminded me about \"Composure.\" I've used it before, and had good success with it. The more potent and vet prescription of it, called Composure Pro, should be arriving on Monday; thanks to Mobile Vet for letting me order it through him via an online pharmacy. I've also got new Lavender essential oil, and added another that I like, called Serenity. Our house smells really good now!~Our front yard on Thursday~Longtime readers of this blog may remember a dog we had a number of years ago named Rudi. She'd come to us in 2003 as a foster dog for the Golden Retriever Rescue. At just over 2 years old, she'd already had 3 homes, and we were her 4th. Rudi had been mistreated, mishandled, and totally misunderstood. I struggled with Rudi for months. She was seemingly out of control, mostly because of her barking. Even a behaviorist considered Rudi unadoptable. I just felt like Rudi had so much potential, and I just couldn't give up on her. I tried every medication, including a citronella bark-collar, which by the way, made her even worse, because I think she liked the smell of it. But at some point, I stopped trying to control Rudi, and just let her be herself. Because when I tried to control her, her barking would escalate. Letting Rudi be who she was, was the biggest lesson she taught me. And this lesson became the cornerstone to how we have handled each and every foster dog since then - We let them be themselves, and add in the rules, the best we can, as we go along.~Rudi on the left, Kasey on the right, with Cowboy and Charlie in the back~I tell you this only because I was reminded of Rudi this week. I was out with Rhett and Max on a walk around our property when the two found the partial remains of a deer.~On a walk with Max and Rhett~A similar thing had happened several years ago with Rudi in about the same place. I remembered that when I'd told Carl about it, and asked him to dispose of  \"the part\" he'd asked how he'd ever find it in our big front yard. I told him to take Rudi with him, and she'd show him where it was. And she did. The photo below is of her rolling on \"it\" while Carl was trying to clean it up. The picture made me laugh then, and it still does now. . Okay, so if you're still reading, this brings me to the lesson I remembered this week. I understood Rudi, and I let her be herself. When I did that, it all came together for Rudi and for us. I've not let the Barkalot Brothers be who they are. We've tried to control them and their barking, which has made the barking even worse. YOU'VE reminded me that I needed to give and take time with George and Abe to understand them, and let them be themselves. So, I've started doing that, and believe it or not, things have been much better the last few days. No, it's not perfect, but perfect doesn't work for us anyway.~Abe~We still have progress to make. But I think the spray bottle, which I just have to show George, along with the essential oils are working, and I think the \"Composure\" will make a difference too. You know, it took me months to learn these lessons from Rudi. From the Barkalot brothers, it took me just over two weeks. That's progress. But it is a lesson that has come again because of a combination of my total exhaustion, your thoughts on my previous post and in remembering Rudi.And so, as I sit here this morning, the sun is coming up and everything is peaceful. George is snoring on a dog-bed nearby with Abe. I am remembering my beloved girl Rudi and my heart is full of gratitude and I am humbled.  Thank-you all for your help and for cheering us on. I think we are going to be okay. I think Abe and George are going to be okay too.~Adoption photos for George & Abe~Now if someone could just help me to figure out Todd....If you want a trip down my memory lane click here to read my blog post where I paid tribute to truly, one of the best dogs I've ever had, my girl Rudi."},
{"title": "Trying to Settle In", "date": "Sunday, November 17, 2019", "text": "Whatta week it was!  It has not been an easy week with the Barkalot Brothers. Their constant barking is an issue. Nothing we say or do can get them to stop.  So if any of you have any tried and true remedy about how to stop their barking, please feel free to share. ~George~Abe and George know very few basics, and teaching them anything has its challenges. Can you teach old dogs new tricks?  I had thought so.~George, what a handsome boy!~Added is the pressure to make sure that Abe gets his insulin at the right time. On work days, I chase the clock from the minute I get up in the morning and of course at the office. Doing it after work is something I haven't had to do. But Abe needs to be fed as close to every 12 hours as possible, so he can be given the insulin afterwards. It adds to the stress I'm already feeling. I'm hoping as we continue settling into a routine it'll get easier.Abe spent all day Thursday at the vet for a glucose curve test. Five blood-tests are done during the day to check the effectiveness and level of the insulin he's being given. We're adjusting his dose, and also giving him more food, which I think he needs because he's pretty thin. I'm also hoping more food will help to curb, at least a little bit, his obsession with it. I don't expect his fixation with food to go away, he is a Lab after all!  ~Abe~Even though it hasn't been the best first week with the Barkalot Brothers, it has had its good moments.They get along pretty well with our dogs.There's no question that Abe and George are nice boys. They are bonded and they do love one another. Despite all their barking and chaos they have brought, Abe and George are easy to love too."},
{"title": "The Barkalot Brothers Arrive at Golden Pines", "date": "Monday, November 11, 2019", "text": "Part two of our weekend came on Saturday when things got bumpy. You may remember that I'd agreed to foster the pair, Abe and George before Sadie came. But they got sick, so that was the end of their coming to us. At least that's what I thought. Well, they popped back up on the radar again. After they were feeling better, they went to another foster home who quickly returned them. So when Sadie went to her new home, I was asked again about fostering Abe and George. They were in boarding and the foster home coordinator really wanted them in a home setting.~George on the left, Abe on the right~ So, I met Abe and George up on Saturday. High drama ensued, because both dogs were so wound up, okay, they were crazy, because they were so excited to be out of boarding and to see each other. I had to call Carl and ask him to make a 40 minute drive to where we were to help me get them home in seperate cars. Once home we let them explore the yard and play together until it started to get dark.We brought them inside, and put them in a large-ex-pen and George started barking. For about 5 hours he barked. Nothing we said or did could get George to stop. Both dogs finally settled down around 10 o'clock. The barking started again at about 2 o'clock in the morning, continuing until around 4. I've no idea what George and sometimes Abe were barking at. So, needless to say we were all exhausted, tired and worn out, and yes, I was stressed out. I contacted the foster home coordinator and she made a couple of great suggestions, one involved medication, and that did the trick.  And that made Sunday a very quiet day as all of us caught up on missed sleep.Despite that rough start, both Abe and George are nice dogs. For obvious reasons, I've nicknamed them \"The Barkalot Brothers.\" I think it fits.Of the two dogs, Abe is the more outgoing and curious one.  He's diabetic and needs insulin injections twice daily. He is also mostly blind from cataracts. But that doesn't stop him, Abe is totally engaged in what's going on and wants to be part of it, especially if there's food. He's good natured, and his tail is wrapped up because he has \"happy tail.\" **Happy tail is also known as kennel tail when a dog whacks his tail hard enough on a hard surface that it causes a cut or split on the end of the tail.~ABE~George, the more vocal of the two has problems getting to his feet. He is equally friendly, a bit more laid back and silly and all that comes with his not being afraid to let us know his opinion.~GEORGE~So far, they are fine with our dogs, ignoring them and the cats. That of course, suits ToddAnd Tiggy the crazy cat, just fine!! Welcome to the Barkalot Brothers!"},

", "date": "Sunday, November 10, 2019", "text": "Having worked every day the previous week, I was looking forward to Thursday and Friday and getting a few things done at home and catching up. But the end of last week could not have been more hectic or stressful.It began with Sadie on Thursday morning. After a vet visit to have her staples taken out and a few errands, it was time to come home to pack her up. Even though it had just been a week, someone was coming to meet Sadie with the hope of adopting her. I wasn't ready to let Sadie go. She is such an easy going girl with a gentle soul, and there was a big part of me that wanted to keep her.~I loved Sadie's smiling face!~But, I had to be honest because as hard as I tried to find fault with Sadie's hopeful adopter, I just couldn't find anything. She is kind, caring and compassionate. There was a connection between the THREE of them right away. And so I said good-bye to Sophie, who now has a dachshund brother named Marshall and she'll be going to work daily with her new owner, who is a Registered Nurse.I've gotten several reports and photos, and all is going really well. Registered Nurse couldn't be happier to have Sadie as part of her life!  Judging by the photo below, I think Marshall agrees too.***And I'll add here the the tumor that Sadie had was a Spindle cell sarcoma which is a type of connective tissue cancer. The slow-growing-tumor won't metastasize, but because there was not a good clean margin when it was removed, it will likely reoccur. Despite that it may grow back, it's still good news for Sadie!  We landed on Friday when Sophie went to see the holistic vet for her first follow up since she started taking the chinese herbs for her thyroid cancer. Holistic Vet was happy with how Sophie was doing and felt confident in saying that she thought that the lump on Sophie's thyroid hasn't gotten any bigger. Like Sadie, that's good news for her too!With the good news for the girls, I'll end this post asking if you remember these two boys from a previous post? On Monday, I'll tell you about them."},
{"title": "Sadie's Story ", "date": "Sunday, November 3, 2019", "text": "Thank-you all for your blogging-welcome to Sadie! What a nice, nice dog she is!! Sadie has fit right in and is getting along really well with our dogs and the cats too!  Being the 900th dog for Lab Rescue has meant that Sadie's story of rescue has been shared by them, so I am sharing that and a couple of their photos with you.Story as told by Lab Rescue:  Sadie's story before coming to Lab Rescue is a sad one. She originally belonged to an older woman who could no longer care for her, so she gave her to her daughter. Eventually, the daughter decided she could also not care for Sadie and gave her away to a couple. Sadie repeatedly escaped from the couple’s yard, and they eventually stopped going after her.When she escaped, Sadie would wander down to the police station nearby as the police officers would share their chicken biscuits with her. Eventually, the officers told her owners to sign her over since they weren’t caring for her. The officers brought Sadie to the local shelter in North Carolina. Sadie was in very rough shape with a cantaloupe-sized tumor on her side and a small one in her mouth.The shelter asked if Lab Rescue could help, and we immediately said, “yes!”  Sadie’s transporter described Sadie as a “dreamboat of a dog” as she never stops smiling and wagging her tail. The Rescue quickly arranged for Sadie to get the veterinary care she needed, and she is now recovering from her surgery. We don’t have the final reports back on her biopsy, but no matter what, she will be safe and loved from now on!\"This is quite the sad story, isn't it?  The sharing of Sadie's story has also meant that there are hopeful adopters that want to meet her. I got an e-mail late Friday night from a coordinator that had someone that wanted to come Saturday morning.  For several reasons, I wouldn't let them come this weekend. One reason that may seem and probably is totally selfish, is that I really want this time to get to know Sadie, and let her settle in just a bit before she moves on to the next chapter of her life.I did agree to let someone come on Thursday. Which means she may be leaving us. I'll be totally honest and admit that I am regretting that. But in my heart, I know that I am just the gateway to  help and keep dogs like Sadie safe and to get them to where they are supposed to be. But you know me, and you know it's not always easy for me to let them go."},

Those of you that guessed the pair, Abe and George were right!  We've not fostered a bonded pair in nearly 10 years, so I was a tad-bit reluctant. But there really is something special about fostering a pair, and so I agreed and was looking forward to welcoming them. Unfortunately Abe (who is diabetic and blind) has pneumonia and George has a respiratory infection. As of Wednesday, both are hospitalized. So, when they improve, they will be going to another foster home without other dogs to make sure no other dogs become sick, and where they have the best chance of regaining their health.  I'm disappointed, but I so hope these two boys feel better very soon!!~The Great Pumpkin in a local pumpkin patch~But knowing that my dog-beds were getting cold, I was asked to foster another dog. She has come to Virginia from a shelter in North Carolina, about 300 miles away. Her name is Sadie, and today we welcomed her into our home.~On our way home!~Sadie is about 11 years old, and she was turned into the shelter by her owner who could no longer care for her. Sadie had a very large tumor on her chest that needed to be removed and so she had surgery a few days ago.  Because Sadie is recovering from surgery, and we had really stormy weather this evening, we have opted to not do intros with our crew. There's plenty of time for that. Tonight after her dinner, and a walk outside in the rain, we're letting Sadie get her rest.~At home this evening~We look forward to getting to know Sadie, who by the way, comes with a little bit of celebrity. She is the 900th dog that Lab Rescue has taken in so far this year!  Welcome Sadie!!And Happy Halloween from all of us!"},

{"title": "Lifting My Spirits", "date": "Sunday, October 27, 2019", "text": "A pretty quiet week for us as the proverbial dust settled on the unexpected loss of Buddy. Thanks to a \"memory reminder\" on Facebook, I was reminded that Buddy's loss, as a coincidence, came a day before our last foster dog named Buddy left us 5 years ago. My hopes and dreams for them both were exactly the same, but not meant to be. I have to be honest, I've had a lot of feelings of guilt over everything that happened. I suppose it's only natural.But your friendship and sharing Buddy's loss has really helped. I know that holding onto that guilt will not bring Buddy back. And it also doesn't allow room for positivity in moving forward, because life, our lives, must go on. ~Buddy~And going on it has. The dogs have a way of pulling me back into reality and keeping me grounded and lifting my spirits. I had Thursday off work, and it was a good day to recharge. ~Rhett & Max in the background~It was a beautiful fall day as the sun shown brightly. A walk around our property allowed us to be outside, clearing my mind and enjoying the dogs.~Max~We were outside again a bit later and I had to chuckle at the photo below of Todd. I'd noticed him rolling on something and when I got to him, he was so still, just laying there. My guess is he was trying to get whatever it was to soak into him? He is such a character, and his energy and spirit, makes me laugh every day. Actually, all the dogs do that. And for that, along with your friendship, I'm grateful."},
{"title": "After 9 Days - Good-Bye to Buddy  ", "date": "Sunday, October 20, 2019", "text": "I don't know how to start this post. Other than with a much shorter version of what I wrote to the rescue when I told them that Buddy had passed away in the early hours of Sunday morning. The numbing, gut-punched feeling as I relive the events are consuming because my mind keeps going back to those moments and scrutinizing a timeline and moments that I cannot change.  There had been nothing that gave us a hint that anything was wrong. It had been a normal and a good day for Buddy. It had ended with his spending time with us in the office, until he got restless around midnight, and I put him into the ex-pen that he was staying in at night. About an hour later, I turned out the lights and said good night to him. I can still hear the sound of his wagging tail as it hit the side of the ex-pen. I remember smiling. Not long after I'd gone to bed I was awakened by what sounded like Buddy scratching at the rug under the bed he was sleeping on, and bumping against the ex-pen. I'd told him \"no\" and it stopped for just a moment, but started again. I got out of bed, and for whatever reason, I noticed the time of 2:14.When I turned on the light, I saw that Buddy was having a seizure. I sat with him, and when I thought the seizure would end, it began again. I know time is critical with seizures and I was keeping close track of how much time was passing. I had awakened Carl, and after about 10 minutes, I knew we had to get him to the animal emergency about 20 minutes away. We took turns staying with him as we quickly dressed and we were on our way. A blur of phone calls leaving messages for my contacts at the rescue and a call to the emergency vet along the way - Pleading prayers for safety on our drive to get there, and that Buddy would hang on, as Carl was with him in the back of my van.The seizures only stopped as we rounded the corner to the animal emergency and as Buddy passed away at 3 AM.I know the shock and the sting of this day will ease. But today, I've cried and slept for most of it. I'm still in shock and heartbroken because I cannot believe what happened. A reminder from the \"logical side\" of me and kind friends tell me that I couldn't have done anything differently. In my heart I know that. Maybe having that peace is Buddy's gift to me?More than anything I wish it would have ended differently for Buddy. But the hopes and dreams I had for him of his finding a forever home was my dream, and not the one that was meant to be. How I wish more than anything that this easy going and always smiling boy could have stayed with us a little longer. How I wish I could have had the chance to get to know him better. How I wish I could do those 9 days with us all over again.God speed Buddy. You were here for such a short time, and in those 9 short days, you found your very own place in our hearts.You will not be forgotten, and we hope tonight you are finding your way to the rainbow bridge where I hope to see you again."},
{"title": "A Hospital Visit", "date": "Saturday, October 19, 2019", "text": "I mentioned in my last post that I was in \"foster home rehab.\" And I just realized that in keeping with that theme, my overnight trip on Thursday goes along with that. Our trip was to the small town of Weston, West Virginia, where there is an imposing, formidable building that, at nearly a quarter mile long is nearly impossible to miss. This building in its history, has gone by three names, the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, West Virginia Hospital for the Insane, and Weston State Hospital.  Whatever you call it, my brothers and my sister-in-law and I went pay the former hospital a little visit...  as a tourists of course.~Thanks to Retired Navy Brother for this photo!The hospital was in operation from 1864 - 1994. It's a Gothic and Tudor Revival style, hand-cut stone building that housed thousands of patients who suffered from mental illness and many who did not.It was built in a beautiful rural area of West Virginia because social reformers were convinced of the healing powers of fresh air and picturesque landscapes.Today, the former hospital is privately owned and offers various history and paranormal tours.  The building's name has also been changed back to its original name - Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum.Being superstitious especially at a place like a mental hospital, Irish workers added faces like these to ward off evil spirits. They believed evil could only enter through the back, so only the back entrances have these carvings.~ The hospital was originally designed to house 250 patients. But during the peak of its overcrowding in the 1950s and 60s, it housed upwards of 2,400 patients.By the 1980s, wide sweeping changes had been made in mental health treatment and the hospital's population was in decline.  All of the operational and maintenance costs were no longer cost effective and the hospital was closed in 1994.The building sat empty for 13 years and during that time fell into disrepair.  It was also subjected to looting and vandalism.  In 2007, the building and grounds were purchased at auction for $1.5 million and renovations on the building began. Today the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum offers various tours and other seasonal activities held on the property. All proceeds go towards the restoration of the historical building.A photo of one of the upper floors that has been renovated.  This floor housed nurse and doctor apartments.We took two tours. The first night, it was the paranormal tour. The guide, dressed in all black, with a flashlight led us throughout the main parts of the building recounting stories of some of the hospital’s better-known spirits, including a little girl named Lilly who was born in the asylum, a man named Jesse who died of a heart attack in a bathtub, Civil War soldiers, and a patient who was brutally murdered by his roommates. And several others I can't remember.~Thanks again to Retired Navy Brother for this photo!~The hospital is so vast that it is easy to feel lost amid the maze of hallways and patient rooms covered in peeling paint. Of course everyone on the tour is hoping for some kind of a paranormal experience. But we all agreed that walking through the building and learning its history in the dark was plenty thrilling, ghosts or no ghostsBefore we left town, we took another (daylight) 90-minute historic guided tour. We were again able to visit all four floors of the main building as well as the Civil War section and the Medical Center.  Our guide, a young woman dressed in an all-white nurses uniform, lead us throughout the grounds and shared so much history about the 160-year old facility that it was a little overwhelming.~A solitary confinement room~Two of the most disturbing things I learned during the tour were 1) some of the treatment methods that were used on patients in the hospital and 2) some of the utterly ridiculous things people, especially women, could be admitted for early in the hospital's history. --Notice the ingredients on the medication below....Chocolate covered??!!  Some of the early treatments of mental illness were simply barbaric.  Patients were often shackled to the walls in isolation rooms, restrained in bathtubs for hours on end in cold baths (which was thought to cool the blood to the brain and calm the patient), subjected to electroshock therapy or insulin shock therapy (the latter put patients into  medically induced comas), or worst case scenario, given a lobotomy.~The ingredients on the cough syrup would put anyone to sleep!~In the early 1950s, the Weston State Hospital was home to what has been called the West Virginia Lobotomy Project.  Dr. Walter Freeman, the father of the lobotomy who was responsible for performing Rosemary Kennedy's lobotomy, visited the Weston State Hospital numerous times throughout the 1950s.  He developed a more \"efficient\" method of performing a lobotomy that didn't require drilling a hole into the person's skull. I'll spare you the gory details of this horrible and barbaric procedure and just say that this crude practice left many patients in a vegetative state or reduced them to child-like behavior.  It is reported that Freeman performed 228 lobotomies within a two-week period while visiting the Weston State Hospital. How awful.Doorknobs used on the inside of patient rooms.  This style prevented the patient from being able to hang him/herself from it, and to allow to open it  from the outside, or to be used a weapon.The other thing I learned that I found disturbing was that often people in the late 1880s were admitted for utterly ridiculous reasons.  Sadly, asylums were often viewed as repositories for more than just the insane and people were committed for ridiculous reasons.~Many of those who worked at the asylum were also required to live there - This top floor is where they slept.If I had lived in the time after the Civil War, there are many reasons why I could have been admitted.  For instance, I could've been admitted for a dog bite or novel reading. Yes, a dog bite or novel reading - And that my friends, as you can see in the list below, is just the tip of the iceberg.Women were at a distinct disadvantage during this time because they were viewed as the property of their husbands.  If I had lived in the last nineteenth century, my husband could admit me to the insane asylum if I inherited money.  Yes, the man in my life could've locked me away until he decided to come back and get me or he could've just left me there until I died.  And of course, he would get the money.  Also if you were a woman and your husband decided to cast you aside, your children would be admitted to the hospital as well. An innocent child (or children) could have their childhood taken away from them merely at a father’s whim if he chose.~One of the restored first floor spaces. This would have been for the more well-off and mildly ill patients~What was further disturbing was learning that when a male child reached the age of 16, if he was deemed to be mentally fit, he would be allowed to leave the asylum but a female child, she would stay indefinitely since she was after all the “mother’s daughter.”  To think of the number of lives that were destroyed by having been sent to a place like this for no legitimate reason was just heart-breaking.All I can say is THANK GOODNESS times have changed because it really was not easy being a woman late 1800s!  But I digress....~Coffin style staircase~I found the history of the Trans Allegheny Lunatic Asylum absolutely fascinating!  There's just so much history you just can't fully comprehend it all. One of my brothers wants to return next year to do an overnight ghost hunt. He thinks it'll be great fun.  I so enjoy getting together with my brothers and their families because I don't see them often enough.  And I did offer to buy my brother's ticket if he decides to do the overnight tour.  So, we'll see.... We'll see ....THANK YOU FRIENDS for stopping by, and reading this very long post!  I hope you enjoyed it and like me, maybe learned a thing or two as well!! Enjoy your weekend!~From a rest stop on the way home~"},
{"title": "Letting Go - Foster Home Rehab", "date": "Thursday, October 17, 2019", "text": "I've entered what I call \"foster-home-rehab.\" It's something I made up years ago for myself after I place a foster dog with their new families. From the rescues, foster homes are given \"guidelines\" as to when to do follow up calls to adoptive families to see how it's going with their new addition. I've followed those guidelines, and always looked at making these \"allotted calls\" like therapy. There's a lot of reassurance in knowing how it's going, and it helps me in letting go of that particular foster dog. And I always tell the families that I'm part of the adoption process, and to expect these calls.  I also always add that I call them not because I don't trust them, because I do. But I'm here to support them, and good or bad, I want to hear how it's going.This takes me to Tanner, who went to his new home almost 2 weeks ago.  I have gotten very, very limited updates about how it's going.  In very few texts messages, I'm told that they love him, he's doing great with their dog. But last week, the Mom texted me because she was worried and concerned about how it went at the vet. Apparently Tanner growled - And the Mom asked me if he'd done that when we had him. He hadn't. I texted  back to her right away that because Tanner was a stray, we don't know what his experiences have been at the vet - That not all dogs like the vet... I then waited a few hours and heard nothing back from the Mom.  I told her to please keep in touch, and to let me or their Adoption Coordinator for Lab Rescue know how it's going; that we're here to support and cheer them on.  I've still heard nothing. It's really disappointing and disheartening. I just hope that no news means that all is well.  And, I hope that I would know if it wasn't. But I'll admit, that this doesn't help in my foster home recovery therapy, because by nature, I am a worrier.~Tanner in September - I hope it's going well~On the flipside, there's Ginger.  It was a match for the lovely Ginger on Sunday! Semi-retired couple were so excited to meet her and make her part of their lives! Mrs. Semi-retired called me on Monday evening and gave me a glowing report about how well it was going, and how much she already loves Ginger. Mrs. Semi Retired told me how when they first arrived home, Ginger walked right up to the front door and turned around and waited for them to let her in - Just like she'd always been there.  Of course this is good news! It helps me in my \"foster home rehab program\" to let go of Ginger, because I could not be happier that after 287 days, Ginger has a home of her very own.~Semi-Retired Couple with Ginger~"},
{"title": "Buddy Arrives at Golden Pines", "date": "Saturday, October 12, 2019", "text": "I'm glad this is the weekend! Last night wasn't a good night. It was 12:30 when I woke the first time and it felt like I’d been sleeping for a long time when in fact it was only two hours. I woke up again at 1:30 when Chip was barking. Thinking he needed to go outside, I tried to coax him out the door with a treat, but he wouldn't go. Back to bed, and awakened again not long after that when it was Rhett's turn to bark. He did want to go outside. Then at 4 something, Todd jumped off the bed, and knowing he'd want to go outside too, and since I was feeling wide-awake, I decided to just get up and stay up.  With our cooler night temps, and the open windows, maybe the dogs are hearing something outside.Or maybe the dogs were just feeling out of sync because of the arrival of a new foster dog, Buddy who came Friday afternoon.~On the way home!~Buddy, is around 10 years old, and comes with a little-bit of a story.  Originally he was used for breeding in North Carolina. The second chapter of his life was spent at a Christmas tree farm, where he chased deer away from the Christmas trees.When Buddy no longer had interest in chasing deer, in January of this year, he went to live with the family that turned him over to the rescue - Sadly it was because of a divorce and the changes that one can bring, meant that not being able to keep Buddy was one of those changes.~A tag from Buddy's collar~Buddy is easy going and very friendly and always smiling. So far, things have gone well with our crew.~Meeting the new boy~The cats however, are a different story. I knew by the information the owner provided that Buddy would chase cats if they ran. But a big pounce onto our outdoor kitty Gino was a bit unexpected.~Nervous drool after meeting our crew~Also unexpected was that his house-training needs some polish. A lot of polish. That's all I'll say about that.  I'm hopeful we can work it all out. But it all means that we'll watch him very closely around the cats, and wherever he happens to be when he's inside.Finally, wish our girl Ginger good luck on Sunday! Semi retired couple (see previous post) are coming to meet her. After 286 days with us, I'm hopeful it'll finally be Ginger's turn to have her very own forever home!!"},
{"title": "Aches, Pains and A Forever Home", "date": "Sunday, October 6, 2019", "text": "September ended quietly at our house. And the first weekend of October, after a long summer, and above-normal temps this past week, autumn found its feet this weekend in northern Virginia. A cool breeze the last couple of days allowed us to have the windows open to bring in some fresh air.Mother Nature aside, I've felt like we were the walking wounded at our house this past week. At the top of the list is Charlie. Yes, Charlie. The Charlie that never needs help or anything.I'm don't know how or what happened. On Wednesday morning he was really limping and needed help getting to his feet, and had to be carried outside. Charlie has never been stoic and even when he was laying down, he was whining. I have a hard time thinking of Charlie as anything but that young vibrant dog that I first met in 2006 and so he (of course) had me worried. Mobile vet is out of town, so rather than wait for his return, I know I have some room to raise the amount of medications he takes daily, so that was what I did. By Friday evening, thankfully Charlie was up and around again on his own and his appetite has returned. So, I'm back to thinking of him as that young dog once again. But I'm keeping a close eye on him.The rest of the crew will be okay too. Mostly it's aches and pains that age can bring. Sunny has a vet appointment in a couple of days for his ongoing ear problems. The photo below is Saturday morning. The girl that trims dog nails for us came and trimmed Sunny's nails and paws which takes two people to do because he doesn't cooperate.  She does a great job, and we're lucky to have her!  But if there's any good news, it's with our Lab Fosters. There was an inquiry for Tanner this past week. After a few conversations, the family came on Saturday along with their Goldendoodle, Ollie. It could not have gone better, and I couldn't like them any more for Tanner. So, he left with them yesterday to begin the next chapter of his life. **I've yet to receive an update from the family. But knowing that \"the Mom\" is a NICU nurse, I am sure her busy schedule has just kept her from responding. ~SMILES ALL AROUND - Just look at Tanner!! (left)~As if that weren't enough, I also received a call about Ginger yesterday. I was surprised. Semi-Retired couple are in their 70's and want to give a senior dog a good home. They've had their eye on Ginger since July and want to come and meet her next weekend. With no other pets, they seem like they'd be a good home for Ginger. I've held off on adopting Ginger because I've felt that she should be in a home where she can be the center of attention and be a star.  She can't be a star in our house.Because we already have one....Or two...Or three stars already."},

Or maybe they just know that their breakfast won't come for a few more hours.~Eager for breakfast!~ Our week ended with vet visits. On Thursday I took new girl Sophie to see Holistic Vet. Our hope is to slow down what we think is a re-growth of a tumor on Sophie's thyroid.~Sophie at Holistic Vet~So we have started Sophie on a special mix of chinese herbs similar to the ones that Charlie takes. Also prescribed was a medication called Doxepin for her laryngeal paralysis.~Sophie's Chinese Herbs~Also along with us for the ride was Tanner. Lab Rescue asked about trying him out in a \"city setting\" to see how he reacts to traffic and new people. I also took him to the shop where we buy our dog food, and we walked around the city center. Tanner did really well, and wasn't bothered at all by the city sounds and people. Knowing this should help broaden the pool of hopeful adopters for him. At least that's the hope and plan.~Tanner watching the other patients at Holistic Vets Office~ We rounded the corner to Friday and drove the opposite direction from Holistic Vet to the office of Mobile Vet with Todd and Alf.Both were due for yearly check ups, blood work and to update vaccines. Pending the return of the blood work, they got good reports from Mobile Vet.~Alf and Mobile Vet~Todd got his last distemper vaccine. He was happy to be on his way back home.And with that, at the moment, everyone is all caught up on their needed vet care for the month of September.  Good thing, given that there are 8 days left.

They are a breed of cat that my Mom loved, and just about the only cat she'd let us have as kids. ~My late brother and me, circa 1966~Which is why my brother and I decided that having Tiggy as part of our household reminds us of her. I did finally catch up with the vet who has cared for Tiggy, whose real name is actually Tigger, and the lovely Sophie.  He told me that Sophie had radiation for throat cancer last year. The radiation she had did shrink the tumor. However, during an exam that Sophie had recently, her vet said a lump has appeared next to her voice box, but he can't be certain if it's the same one.  I've decided to take Sophie to see Holistic Vet next week. I hope that maybe herbs like the ones Charlie takes may help Sophe as well. ~Sophie and Tanner - I love Sophie's white eyebrows~Our other new arrival, Tanner was posted on the Lab Rescue (LLRCP) Facebook page today, for \"Foster Friday.\"   I know I keep saying it, but I hope his new forever home comes forward soon.~A Facebook collage for Tanner~Our Friday was a quiet day.

{"title": "Sophie Arrives at Golden Pines", "date": "Thursday, September 5, 2019", "text": "YES, you have read that right.  In just 8 days from when we met Tanner, Sophie has arrived at Golden Pines, thanks to what I am pretty sure is the cosmos at work, and serendipity!    Get comfy, because here's the story.... I FINALLY got around to making that grooming appointment that Todd has needed since July.  But there was a mix-up with his appointment and our new groomer (who bought the grooming salon in the spring).  So, since Todd didn't have an appointment with them, and our old groomer is now set up in her home about 30ish miles away, I called her.  I did this for two reasons.  One because I told her when she contacted me in the early part of summer that I would and second because I'd had this nagging feeling that I needed to call her. It was a feeling I just couldn't shake.When I called our \"old\" groomer, Irina on Tuesday, the first thing she said, was not hello, but something like, \"Hi Kim, I can't believe you are calling - I've been thinking about you.  I have a 13 year old Lab that needs a home.\"  What?!?!  Irina explained to me how the 90 year old owner had moved to an assisted living facility, and the son had taken Sophie and a siamese cat to the vet to be euthanized because he didn't want them. (go ahead, think it, I thought the same thing about the son too!!). The story gets a little vague here, but the vet said he'd take them both, and since Irina and the vet know each other, somehow Irina ended up with Sophie, who by the way, she has groomed her entire life. And today I took Todd and Charlie to be groomed, and met Sophie, and brought her home.~A handsome and happy, worn out Todd on the way home~In three words, Sophie is wonderful!  She has met our big crew with no problems whatsoever. The cats she would love to get to know, but they are having none of that.  I can only guess it's because she may be missing the cat she lived with....Irina (previous groomer) wants me to take the cat too.  We'll see.  But it has been a big day for Sophie, and she is fast asleep on a dog bed.Welcome to Golden Pines Sophie!!"},
{"title": "****** Arrives at Golden Pines!", "date": "Wednesday, September 4, 2019", "text": "You all know me too well, and are great guessers!!  YES, it was TANNER who caught my eye on the list of dogs looking for a foster home and we were asked to foster! He arrived a week ago this evening.~Tanner's shelter photo~Tanner was a stray from a shelter on the eastern shore of Maryland.  Found in late July, he was covered from head to toe with fleas and ticks.  He has a skin allergy caused by the fleas and is missing about half of his coat. He needs weekly baths with a medicated shampoo to soothe his skin and help it to heal. He's on several medications, which is really helping as you can see in the photos.  ~What kind eyes Tanner has & he loves to give you his paw~Tanner is estimated to be between 8 to 10 years old. I would guess he's probably more like eight.  He has great energy, and loves attention.  He's getting along really well with all the dogs.  The cats are an irresistible curiosity for him, and so we watch him closely around them.  He doesn't chase them, he just seems very interested in whatever they are doing; which usually isn't really anything.~Exploring our yard on his first day~It's anyone's guess how this nice and easy going boy ended up as a stray. Tanner knows all about being in a house, he loves to sleep on the bed, and knows all about tennis balls and the kitchen. He has a tender heart and spirit, and puts his head down when we tell him \"no.\" So, we're careful to not hurt those canine feelings in teaching him the rules of the house. Tanner was also microchipped previously, but the information was incomplete, and led nowhere.  A reminder to make sure your pets 'chip information is updated!   We're glad Tanner is here and we are enjoying getting to know him. Soon, the rescue will make him available for adoption, and the search for his forever home will begin."},

The sadness and being a bit on autopilot as the \"what if's and maybe I should have...\" have been repeating over and over in my mind for our beloved Baloo. It can be a bit consuming. And it happens every. single. time.... I will question all of it in the days ahead. It's just how I'm wired and what I do. And I do it pretty well I have to admit! But I cannot say \"thank-you all\" enough for your friendship and for your kind and caring comments and your support that truly makes a difference!I never did mention it, but we were in the process of adopting Baloo. But we were never able to sign his adoption contract. Time simply ran out. However, the adoption coordinator made it official anyway, meaning that we posthumously adopted Baloo, making him ours. I thought that was such a nice gesture because it means, at least on paper, that he had found a new forever home.  We all know, like it or not, and ready or not, life has a way of going on. Carl returned home late last evening and said this morning that it's easy to see the hole left in our household by Baloo.

So much so, that more than once, I got up in the middle of the night to make sure all the dogs were inside. I'll confess that I even cruised the internet looking at dogs. Even with all that, I'd decided that I was doing it only because a friend has just gotten a new puppy. Which by the way is totally (!!!) out of the question for us. ~Shaggy Todd will agree about our not getting a puppy!~I kept trying to shake that feeling. Despite \"that feeling\" it was a bit unexpected when another foster-home-coordinator, that I never work with, asked me to consider a new addition. I was worried about Baloo, so I asked her to try and find another foster home for this particular dog. But whether we are able to foster or not for the rescue, foster homes always get a list of dogs needing a place to go, that includes their information and photos. When I'd seen the list a few days before being asked, one dog caught my eye. When I received another updated list a few days later, the same dog caught my eye again. And it was the one I was being asked to foster. So, when another foster home couldn't be found for this dog, and I was asked a 2nd time, I agreed.Since this post is a little long (sorry about that!) I'll post the picture and ask YOU which one do you think caught my eye, and which one did we welcome this past Wednesday? I'll let you know tomorrow, who is our newest addition.I have a feeling, you'll be able to easily guess..."},

With work and caring for the dogs, it has left time for little else.  One thing that kept me busy and had me worried was Baloo. He was barely able to get to his feet, and somehow I'd managed to keep him going, but by Thursday I knew he needed to go to the vet. The vet decided to try cold-laser therapy as a tune-up to the same treatment he received back in June in hopes he would get a bounce from it.  But by yesterday (Friday) I knew that it hadn't.~A tired Baloo on Thursday~This morning Baloo's strength and willingness to try to stand or even put his head up was totally gone. This only told me what I'd known and was feeling all week. It was time for us to say good-bye.In the peaceful setting of an apple orchard Baloo and I spent our last tender moments together.~Baloo's harness and collar afterwards in the orchard~In the cool grass I stroked his beautiful white muzzle, and I couldn't help but reflect how quickly our 4 months together had passed. I told Baloo how he'd totally stolen my heart that first day we met -- How even though I knew he had happy times with us, I wished I had been able to mend what I knew was his broken heart ...~Baloo, the first day we met, such sadness!! ~I told him how I wished I'd known him in his younger days -- How I loved having him as part of our lives and I told him what I would remember about him -- I told him how I wished he could have stayed longer -- And I kissed him one more time and told him how I look forward to seeing him again one day.God-Speed to blue-Baloo. This quiet and gentle, old soul easily took with him a piece of my heart, and I will always have a piece of his in mine.~The last photo I took of Baloo - A much happier face!!~Baloo's Rainbow color is blue. I've given him that color for several reasons. One is because the cataracts in his eyes sometimes made his eyes look blue. I especially noticed that today. And the color blue can also be one of sadness, which was something that I felt from Baloo. I hope that as he arrives at the Rainbow Bridge, that sadness is replaced with joy and he's able to do something his tired old body wouldn't allow, and that's to run....                                                                             Run free Baloo..... This video of Baloo from about 3 weeks ago, always makes me smile - He loved mealtime and would always grab any nearby bowls!  One time, he even grabbed Charlie's while he was still eating!"},

I have until about 7:15 to get all the dogs out at least twice, medicated, fed, watered, settled, house tidied up, and get myself ready for work.~Waiting for breakfast~With the dogs it's easy to get behind, which sometimes happens - When I leave, usually in a rush, I always give all the dogs treats, grab a snack for work, make sure outdoor kitty Gino has a bowl of food and water for his day outside. When I pull out of the garage, I glance at the yard, and make sure everyone is inside.Okay that's how it's supposed to work on a perfect morning. Because after the dogs have all eaten, I get them out again, and Todd stays outside until I get ready to leave for work. And when I leave, I always get Todd inside and give him a \"Kong\" when he goes into his crate.I'm not sure what exactly happened on Tuesday. But I know I was running my usual late. And the note below was left by our dog-walker.Thank-goodness that she's reliable. It was a cloudy day, and there was only a little bit of rain, but of course I felt bad that he'd been left alone outside. Some friends had this to say about it when I posted about it on Facebook: .Bonnie  - I’m sure Tod had a Great time!❤️🐾❤️Jane - Scottie Todd is a hearty Scot.Lynn -  In true highlander spirit, Todd probably had a blast in the rain!!Vicki M - ...I’ll bet Todd had tons of fun in the rain! 😘🐾🐾❤️Wendy - Are kidding!!! All that free time to run and play all alone. Even dogs need ‘me’ time! 😊Vicki S in a text said - He ate his extra cookies, had a nice long drink to wash them down and slept the sleep of a guardian of the castle until You came home.They're right of course. Todd was safe and totally fine. He just needs to be groomed. Which will probably upset him more than being left outside for a few hours."},
{"title": "The Vet and Nostalgia  ", "date": "Sunday, August 11, 2019", "text": "A pretty non eventful week has passed with the dogs all being in good spirits.On Thursday I was off to the office of mobile vet with Charlie, Sunny and Chip. I'm not sure what I was thinking when I made the appointment for the 3 of them together.  It took me nearly 10 minutes just to get Chip into my van. He was nervous, but he relaxed once we got there. By the time we left, Chip was feeling confident enough to take treats from Mobile Vet, and he just hopped up into my van when we were leaving.~A nervous and unsure Chip~Sunny however, being our problem child was a bit of a handful. He snapped at Mobile Vet a couple of times. But he has a really ugly ear infection. Of course Mobile Vet was very gentle and understanding about his grouchiness and was patient with him. We did put a muzzle on Sunny just to keep everyone safe.Then of course, there's Charlie, who is good no matter where you take him. Back at home he enjoyed another bowl of ice. Judging by how he acted, I'd say it felt good on his face.One thing that I did at the end of the week was to go through some old pictures of Charlie. I remembered that I got him from the shelter in late July. But I had a question in my mind about the year. Was it 2005 or was it 2006? Not that it really matters.I found the pictures I was looking for, which are the first ones I took of him. They confirmed what I thought. Charlie came to us in 2006. Thirteen years ago. Wasn't he a cutie?I loved seeing the other pictures of those familiar faces that were on the disc too. They all made me smile and made me feel a sense of nostalgia.Aside from Charlie, all of them are gone. So yes, the photos also made me grieve, grieve a little over their losses all over again.  It's like looking through a window into those past memories.~Charlie, Kasey and Josh with Abby (center) and a glimpse of Tucker~But I felt a little warmer around and inside my heart for having the chance to have them as part of our lives.~Who I called my \"big girls,\" Kasey (left) and Wendy~Have a good week, my friends!"},

Todd, Max, Rhett and Charlie were totally worn out.  It was a \"good tired.\" They all slept nearly the entire time for the 7 hour drive.But now we're back home, and time to step back into real life and our routine.~Getting ready to leave -Max & Rhett were a bit worried~Work tomorrow. For the first time in almost a month all of the staff (including the doctor) will be there. It's going to be a be a busy day and week too.Carl did a great job caring for the dogs while we were gone. All was well when we got back.I did want to show off Alf who went to the groomer (again) just before I left.  You'll recall, my middle of the night idea, had him looking like a Lab in a yeti coat.And now he looks like this. (below) With the heat, Alf is definitely happier and looking better too.  It really was the best and right thing to do to have him \"buzzed\" completely down.  By winter he'll have a really nice coat to keep him warm.Outside, there are no sightings of the wrens around the house.~This handsome Cardinal kept tapping on the window of the cabin. My friend said this is his 2nd year he's done this~ I did take the wren nest down in the garage. Inside was one egg that didn't hatch. I put the nest into the woods in a quiet place.

This was helped along when the doctor I work for told us that he'd be taking 2 weeks off for a family trip overseas. So, I contacted my friends in eastern Tennessee, and reserved their cabin.  We've been here several times before, but never in July.~Todd, my sleeping co-pilot~At the time, July seemed so far away, but here we are, at a place that I've come to love and enjoy for its peaceful setting and as a place to recharge my inner batteries --  And it's dog-friendly too.  (Carl is a left-behinder at home with the other dogs) ~Early morning view from the porch of the cabin~I may be here alone, but I'm not totally alone. With me on this trip is a very shaggy Todd, Charlie, Rhett and Max.~On the way with Rhett probably wondering \"are we there yet??\"And here for the first couple of days was a longtime friend who I have known since about 1975 when she dated my oldest brother.  Their dating may not have worked out, but Teresa's friendship and connection with my entire family, and ours with hers over all these years is one that without question, I truly value and treasure. Teresa lives just over an hour away from the cabin and it worked out perfectly with her schedule to come. We talked and laughed until the late hours of the night and ate too much.~Freshly baked blackberry cobbler is best enjoyed with a friend!~It was really great fun having her here, if only for a couple of days!~We took a drive through Smokey Mountain National Park~Now that I'm alone, and with 2 days left of my trip, it's time to just relax, reflect and of course recharge before I get back to my life.I hope you're having a good week!UPDATE on the Wrens in our garage. They family of Wrens were ready to leave before I thought they would be, and they did not leave quietly or without a little drama.  The drama came when one of the three fledglings appeared to not quite be able to find its way out of the garage. This really upset the parents who made no secret of their unhappiness with the situation. I think the fledgling was one that got \"misplaced\" when it fell out of the nest the day before -- During the day I saw it fall behind a box on the top shelf, fly and land on Gino's bed, sitting on top of the garage door, on the floor, and finally the next morning, I saw it sitting on top of my van looking in the direction of the big scary world. That was the last time I saw any of the wrens. It appears they all made it out of the garage safely!  Yay!!~Two of the three wren fledglings out of the nest on flight day~"},

The one we had on Wednesday afternoon wasn't too bad as far as storms go. It passed through pretty quickly and the skies began to clear. Then, for a still unknown reason, our power went out.It was a mostly sleepless night. I kept waking up for reasons ranging from thinking I heard a dog barking outside, (there wasn't), the power coming back on (it hadn't) and to let Gino back into the garage, (because he was meowing to be let out).  We were up early sitting on our front porch as the day began.Sometimes it's nice just to sit and listen as the world around you wakes up.But life has a way of creeping back in and I had to think about getting ready for work. Thinking through how we were going to manage 3 of us getting ready for work, with no power, little sleep, and a limited amount of water made for a bit of a challenge.Thankfully our power was restored around 11 o'clock, and the regular programming of life resumed.But last evening, we were all in bed by 9 o'clock."},
{"title": "Gino and The Wrens", "date": "Wednesday, July 17, 2019", "text": "I saw the wren in the garage about a week ago when I was leaving for work. I checked the top shelf, and sure enough, back behind the small chain-saw, there was a nest. Thinking it was a \"new-nest-construction\" I decided that when I got home I would knock it down.I decided this only because our mostly outdoor kitty Gino living in the garage doesn't make for the best of neighborhood to raise a family of birds. I know the picture below makes him look innocent and like a real marshmallow. But trust me, Gino has a wildlife-crime record. Unfortunately. But he is a cat and an outdoor one at that. Last year we had another family of wrens build a nest in the same spot and Gino (somehow) managed to get onto the shelf one night and well....you know.... I really enjoy the wrens and was really sad when the lives of the nesting birds came to an end. And, I know it goes without saying that I don't want that to happen again.So, when I got home from work, I decided I was simply going to just knock the nest off the shelf with a broom. Carl said he'd take care of it with a gentler approach and just put it into the trash. When he took the nest off the shelf, inside were 3 little wrens with barely any feathers.  I was glad he'd not done it my way for once. He put the nest back and we hoped that our disturbing it wouldn't be an issue. It wasn't.And so now I'm watching the parents fly in and out of the garage. We're opening the door first thing in the morning, and close it after dark which gives the wren time to get settled in for the night.And the air is now filled with the wren's loud shrill-rattling-warble-warning of danger. The danger is of course Gino.I just hope they heed their own warnings and stay safe and leave the neighborhood soon!"},

My counterpart at work is on vacation so I filled in for her this week, and I'm working every day next week too. Finally, I have to tell you what happened to Alf....  I don't know about you, but I sometimes get some pretty good ideas in the middle of the night. But this time, maybe I didn't.  It began because I'd been trying to figure out what to do about Alf's thick coat that had gotten really matted around his face because he kept rubbing it on the rug.  But its been a little bit of a challenge to manage because his coat has 2 kinds of fur that is fine, curly and thick on his top half, with a more Golden like and thinner coat on his bottom.  I decided to just have the thick, poodle part of him clipped, which was the top half.  Alf can be a tiny-bit moody, and being a senior boy and not able to stand for a length of time, I thought it was the best thing to do.  The groomer tried to talk me out of it, saying it wouldn't look right. But I wasn't worried about that, and I told her to do it.  Below is the end result.Ooohhhh noooooo.....  Alf is going back on the 15th to be fixed.I'll admit though, I couldn't help but laugh at Alf - And I really needed a laugh.But the moral of the story is, to trust your groomer and don't always trust any ideas that you get in the middle of the night.  I think Alf looks like a Lab in a Yeti coat.Poor Alf...."},

It really does mean a lot. Your words have (again) helped to fill some of the emptiness from losing Bailey.Several times I've heard, \"I don't know how you do it.\"  Honestly, I don't know either. What I do know is that I'm a bit of a crumpled mess right now. The tears are just under the surface. When I was at work yesterday and today as well, I really tried to keep my emotions from bubbling up at an inopportune time -- like when I was with patients, or picking out produce at the grocery store. And of course what has gone along with all of this is that I am eating all the wrong things. Can you go through the drive-thru twice at McDonalds? ~My heart-stopping breakfast this morning~I've decided that taking in the senior dogs has allowed grief to shadow me in quite the same way as Bailey did - It's always by my side, touching me at unexpected moments, chasing me until it catches me and forces me to look it squarely in the eye. I can't get away from it. However, despite the sadness and heart-break I'm feeling right now, the words of the Irving Townsend Quote still ring true.“We who choose to surround ourselveswith lives even more temporary than our own, live within a fragile circle;easily and often breached.Unable to accept its awful gaps,we would still live no other way.We cherish memory as the onlycertain immortality, never fullyunderstanding the necessary plan.”― Irving TownsendAs hard and sad as it can be and is, I would live no other way. Thank-you again, friends, for sharing the loss of Bailey as well as Cissy and Joy too.  You all are truly the best!"},

But as I write this, I'm not kidding, there is a little wren sitting on the railing outside my window, singing its big song. Maybe it's telling me to not be sad, but to sing and celebrate that what for Bailey, was a long life.  She was more than 14 years old.I don't know much about Bailey's life before she came to us in September of 2017. What I put together from the papers that came with her, is that she was born in Kentucky, not far from where my own Mother was from. She was part of a family with 2 children and the husband was in the military and was stationed in Germany, where she lived too. Somewhere her life changed and there was a divorce. Bailey lived with the husband, and several other dogs until her owner died.~Bailey - Stuck in the middle~I've said before, and it was so true, that Bailey was truly the quintessential Golden Retriever. She was always happy, easy going, gentle, and a good friend, companion and comforter. And I never mentioned it, but Bailey's former owner, took his own life. Of course I don't know the circumstances of any of that. But as my day has ended without my beautiful Bailey by my side, and as she journeys back to the one who created her, I hope she is met on the other side by \"Jim\" who loved her first - Because if his soul still needs that same comfort and friendship that she always gave me, I know that  she will (again) give it to him.God-speed Bay-bay...  Through my tears and heartbreak  I am trying to smile and find joy and celebrate the time we had together. You will be missed, not just by me, but by all the dogs who you were a friend to. I will look forward to the day when I'll see you again. Until then, those memories of you are tucked into their own place in my heart that is only for you.   ~A fun outing - Bailey looking at the chicks~ And finally, Bailey's color is cinnamon. When I had her at the office several months ago, the daughter of a co-worker thought with all the white in her coat, that Bailey looked like a cinnamon roll. Kids have a way of pointing out the obvious, because Bailey really did look like one. And we all know that nothing says comfort food like a big, fluffy, soft cinnamon roll warm and fresh from the oven - And \"soft comfort\" was what Bailey was all about.I will miss my friend."},

He struggles to get around, but he's been able to get up on his own, and go outside by himself even though he always needs help to get up the two steps. That changed on Wednesday night when I got home and he couldn't stand on his own.  Baloo didn't want his evening meal, and wouldn't even put his head  up to look at us.~At the vet~On Thursday morning he wasn't any better, so I called Lab Rescue. The vets office that has seen Baloo had no available appointments, but within the hour we were off to be worked in at another office. Of course I was really worried that I was going to have let Baloo go - But aside from a slightly elevated white blood cell count, Baloo's bloodwork was all okay. And New-vet was unable to find anything obvious on the x-rays to explain why he wasn't able to walk or hold his head up. So, New-vet recommended starting him on an antibiotic and adding a pain medication along with cold laser therapy -- Two things which I have thought since I met Baloo that he would benefit from. However, I couldn't get the first vet he was seeing to recommend it, so Lab Rescue wouldn't approve it.~Baloo getting cold laser therapy~With the new medications on board, Baloo is brighter and more alert. He's still unable to stand up on his own, but now he's walking without much help from us and only stumbled and fell once this morning, and I'm seeing a few tail wags too. With all that I'm optimistic and hopeful that with more time, and continued laser therapy (maybe acupuncture too) Baloo is going to okay. And I will say here that I'm very relieved about that and very thankful too!  ~On our way home~Finally on a personal note, I want tell Vicki, a good friend and reader of this blog (again) how very sorry I am about the loss of her beloved Scottish Terrier, Jack this past week. Aside from Todd's clan, I don't know anyone in my \"real life\" that has a Scottie, except for Vicki. And our friendship that began in part because we both had Scotties is no doubt why I feel like I lost one of my own dogs.~We lit our candle for Jack~In his senior years, Jack had some health issues and had a kidney removed about 5 years ago. But none of that kept Vicki and Jack from enjoying their life together and that included doing agility.Jack was almost 14 years old. A good and long life that was full and well lived. Jack's life was truly a testament to the excellent care, love and devotion of Vicki and her husband.~Photos taken by Ellen Zangla Photography~Jack, who was ”large hearted and loving, with the soul and mind of an honest gentleman,” is truly missed.~Photos taken by Ellen Zangla Photography~"},

Her strength and her smile along with the bright spark that always brought a smile to my face was gone. It was her time.~Joy on the day we met~We first met Joy in January, after she'd gotten so ill from eating a 5 pound filet of salmon. I felt like when she came to us, it was a new beginning. I had such dreams for this very brave, resilient, sweet little Golden Retriever who'd been found as a stray in West Virginia. But those dreams that so many of us had for Joy were not meant to be when the diagnosis came that she had lymphoma.But Joy didn't know she had cancer.  She enjoyed the moments of being outside in the cool grass and the little bit of snow we had this year. She never worried about time, or complained - She and all dogs remind us to not do that. They truly do teach us what it means to have joy, to be alive - without judgement, just pure gratitude and happiness. This was how Joy lived every day she was with us.  Our days with her were truly a gift.  I knew that then, and even more so now.So, as the day ends without Joy, and as I write this, I'm reminded of how very sad and hard these moments are for me. And as I look through the pictures I have of Joy, I wish I had more. I wish I could do the last 136 days with her all over again....... I wish....God speed Jo-Jo...Our candle is lit to help you find your way back to the one who created you. And tonight, before I go to bed, I'll stand on the porch, and look out into the darkness and say a silent prayer of thanks for having the chance to know you and love you. The color I have chosen as Joy's is yellow.  Today as I was taking Joy to the vet, I noticed the mullein that is blooming in the fields....It reminded me of the yellow flowers on her collar. Yellow is also the color for freshness, happiness, positivity, energy, remembrance, and joy.   All of those things that Joy was and will be remembered for."},

I'm not sure how Bailey does it, but she manages to push through it and she bounces back and is just fine.~Alf, Bailey & Rhett~The week for us ended at the vets office. This time it was with Charlie and Sunny who has a stubborn ear infection that needed to be kicked up to another level because I couldn't get it to go away.  An oral antibiotic and ear-infusion of a medication will hopefully do the trick.For Charlie, it was for a check-up. On Friday, it was exactly a year ago when I found out that the surgeon didn't get a clean margin when the tumor on his bottom was removed. At that time, the surgeon said it would probably return. But at the vet, an exam showed that the tumor has not yet returned. We are **very silently** celebrating and knock, knock, knocking on wood (!!!)  at this good news of Charlie being cancer free for 1 year!!Onward to June we go!"},

Saying thank-you actually doesn't sufficiently show my gratitude for what your friendship and support means to me.  Cissy was a loyal friend and an active part of our household for six years. She will be and is greatly missed.~Cissy's bowl and collar~On Friday morning I just wanted the world to stop and not be a part of it. It was hard to get going, and I didn't get the dogs fed until around 10 o'clock.  While their breakfast was late, my breakfast of cold ricotta-pizza and a diet coke showed right where my emotions were. Those of you with dogs, know that at your lowest moments, dogs have a way of making you chuckle and keeping you focused and grounded in life and reality. The video below shows how Todd did both of those things this past weekend when his ear was bothering him - And I really needed it.What would we do without our four-legged-family members?~Our foster girl Ginger~Or our friends?

{"title": "Good-Bye to Not Just Another Dog", "date": "Friday, May 24, 2019", "text": "A co-worker said to me yesterday that she didn't understand how Cissy was not just another dog for us because there have been and are so many. Trying to explain to a non-animal lover that she was wrong and that I considered Cissy one of \"my girls\" and a canine sister was impossible to articulate. But it didn't matter, Cissy knew that. Cissy knew that she held a unique position in or household because the rules didn't really apply to her. She also had to know that she was the only dog that never had an \"assigned\" place to eat. Her bowl was always brought to wherever she happened to be at mealtimes.Cissy was fiercely independent and opinionated and I let her decide the pace of her life and do what she wanted.  She was happy with that arrangement.  She had let us know early on that she didn't want to be let out into the fenced yard. Cissy instead preferred to wander around outside the fence. She always walked the same little route, and when she was ready to come back inside, she let us know. Cissy also didn't like to be brushed or be fussed over, so I just did what she would tolerate.  It almost seems like neglect, but she always seemed happy and content, which made me feel okay that her nails didn't get trimmed as much as they should have.Despite that independent nature, the last few weeks, there seemed to be a frailty to Cissy as her pace started to slow and she needed our help on the steps and getting to her feet a little more. In those slower and quiet moments with Cissy, even though I tried to ignore it, the whisper that her time was coming to an end came to my mind and heart more than once. She also began her days earlier and she would come to the bedside and start barking at me and hurry off after I acknowledged her.Cissy really was really a vocal dog and from wherever she was in the house she'd let me know that she knew I was home or that she was ready for her dinner. Of course I'd always say something back to her and let her know I'd heard her. My favorite had to be the times when Cissy would stand at the office door, or wherever we happened to be, take a look around, bark once or twice, and then totter back to her spot and lay down. I'd always thought of Cissy's life as being two totally different volumes because I didn't know anything about her life before she came to us from a Virginia shelter. At the time we thought Cissy was around 12 years old. But looking back at it, I guess she had to be around 8. Whatever her age, Cissy was truly a shell of a dog when we met and initially there was a lot of uncertainty about what was ahead for her.~Cissy, 3-23-13 -- The day we met~But despite all of that, Cissy surprised all of us and her big personality blossomed and she regained her health.During the second volume of her life with us, there are so many of the best memories wrapped up into the 6 years we shared together. The video below made just after she came to us, and so many other things are what I don't want to forget about this beautiful girl who I said goodbye to today.Like anyone who has lost a four-legged-family member, or really anyone who has a heart, you know how hard this is... not just because of Cissy being a loyal friend, but because she represented a time in our journey through life, who made me smile every day, who I had a strong connection with and who always lifted my spirits. I have truly lost another piece of my heart and I am keeping those memories of Cissy in what's left of it.God speed to you Cissy ...  Cissy Miss... girly-girl.... My pretty girl .... Big girl....  You will be greatly missed and remembered. Our house seems lonelier and quieter without you. And a candle is lit to help you find your way back to the one who created you. I know there will be quite a welcome for you there, and I so look forward to the day when I'll see you again. Finally some of you may remember that I've started giving a color to our dogs that pass to create our own rainbow. I thought I had one for Cissy. But as I wrote this post and thought about it, for whatever reason, it just seemed all wrong. I am sure that in the days to come and as I grieve over her loss, I know one will come."},
{"title": "The Girl Who Cried Wolf", "date": "Friday, May 17, 2019", "text": "What a week! As I mentioned in my last post, when I got back on Sunday, Bailey wasn't feeling well. The three days that followed didn't end with her getting any better. Text messages from my dog-walker made me a nervous wreck and so I left work early on Tuesday and Wednesday to come home to care for her. Bailey's appetite was all but gone. She was coughing, vomiting and was unable to keep any food, water or even medications down. She would protest when I tried to get her to her feet, or to change the bedding she was laying on.This hasn't been all that unusual for Bailey and normally after a day or two of not feeling well, Bailey usually starts to improve. But no matter what I did or tried, this time she just wasn't. She was miserable and uncomfortable, not to mention tired. I really felt like there was nothing else that could be done. So, I contacted the medical coordinator for the rescue and had the discussion about letting Bailey go. I know it goes without saying that these decisions are not made easily. But I really felt like it was the only and right one because she was a bit unresponsive and her spark seemed so dim. If you could have seen Bailey, I think you would have agreed.I contacted Mobile Vet and made the appointment for Bailey on Thursday.  When I came home early on Wednesday afternoon from work, Bailey was sleeping soundly. When I said something to her, she opened her eyes and wagged her tail. She surprised me then, and when I helped her up, she went outside by herself and came back in with no help.That evening Bailey drank and ate without getting sick. I checked on her several times overnight, and she was fast asleep without as much as a cough. By Thursday mid-morning, well after a full breakfast I knew that it was not Bailey's day to leave us. Another conversation with Medical Coordinator, a visit to Mobile Vet to have her looked at, and we all agreed.Of course I've no way of knowing how long the good days with Bailey will last. But I am so happy that she's feeling better and she's still with us. However, I have to admit, that the emotions of it all, leaving work early, my lengthy conversations with Medical Coordinator, and Mobile Vet making room in his very busy schedule, I really do feel like I was crying wolf. But everyone knows that this was (certainly) no joke, and I'm grateful to Medical Coordinator and Mobile Vet for being there when I don't need or do need them."},

{"title": "Getting to Know Baloo ", "date": "Tuesday, April 30, 2019", "text": "Hello Blogging Friends! Many thanks for those of you who have checked in asking how Baloo has settled in and sending your best of vibes for him.The answer to your question is YES, Baloo is doing well and has settled in to his new life.  Of course there is always that learning curve as we get to know one another. Baloo still is quite slow on his feet and needs help getting up and down the outside steps so he doesn't stumble and fall.  Ideally, we'd like for Baloo to walk up and down the ramp that we have, so we're trying to teach him to do that instead of the steps. But one thing we have learned is that not all the dogs like the ramp, so we'll see what his preference becomes.One thing we had no idea of, is how Baloo would do with the cats. At first he ignored them, and now, if they get too close he'll bark and snap at them. So, we're correcting him, and I have decided that the cats also need to learn to be a bit smarter around him too. So I hope that the longer he's here, the more they'll ALL learn to keep their distance from one another. On the flipside to that, he's getting along well with all his new packmates, and for that I'm always grateful.In other news, there was the reality check late last week with Joy, who you'll recall has lymphoma. It began with her nose bleeding that of course had me quite concerned along with her not being able to get to her feet. A visit to Mobile Vet was made, and he said that it was being caused by what he was pretty sure is a respiratory infection. Easy enough to treat with an antibiotic.  And since we were there, I mentioned to him about my concerns with what looked to me like \"muscle wasting\" and I thought that it was because of the prednisone. But Mobile Vet said that it isn't what's causing all of it, but it's also the cancer consuming the fat and muscle that's stored within her tissues. He told me that sadly and unfortunately there's not anything that can be done. He suggested a few diet changes to help and said that I should take Joy home, continue to spoil her, and know that her time with us is coming to an end very soon.I know, respect and understand that Mobile Vet has an obligation to be honest. But I was of course heartbroken with the sad reality check, and felt totally defeated. So much so, that I went to bed early.But the next morning there was Joy, looking at me, alert, eyes bright and she was wagging her tail and eager to start the new day, just as she has every day since we met. She hasn't given up. And it's not time for me to give up either."},
{"title": "Baloo Arrives at Golden Pines! ", "date": "Thursday, April 18, 2019", "text": "Meet Baloo. A new arrival via Lab Rescue that arrived at Golden Pines on Monday. At nearly 14 years old, I have to say, his expression, at least to me, is among the saddest I have seen in a very long time. Bringing him home and all evening, his tail remained tightly tucked under him, and his head stayed down and his back towards us most of the time. It all broke my heart.Baloo's previous owner was moving, and wouldn't take him with her. Did I mention that from where \"she\" lived she moved about 20 miles? My apologies. I need, want to, and should be kind, fair and not judge because I don't know her circumstances. What matters is that in the end, despite being dealt a bad hand, Baloo found his way to Lab Rescue, and has a place at Golden Pines, and (of course) quickly found a place in my heart.And finally, I know, trust me, I know what you may be thinking  ......   The last thing we needed was a new addition.  But almost exactly a month ago, Baloo came up on Lab Rescue's radar and I was asked to take him if he needed a place to go. Ginger, our other foster girl for Lab rescue had several really good families interested in her, making me pretty sure she would no longer be with us when Baloo was expected to come. However, for various reasons, those perspective families didn't work out as we'd hoped and thought they would. But I know the rescue is continuing to work on finding Ginger her perfect match, and so I'm hopeful her forever home will come very soon.~Ginger~And today my weekend starts, I saw what I **think** may have been a glimpse of a smile from Baloo this morning. He's up and around a bit more than he was, getting along with our crowd so I'm hopeful for a good weekend ahead."},
{"title": "A Favor for Ginger and Ziggy", "date": "Sunday, April 14, 2019", "text": "If the two weeks prior were a storm, this past week has been the calm.Spring is finally coming, and the spring flowers are blooming everywhere.~Rhett with a perennial smile!~Easter that seemed so far away is now just around the corner.As I was leaving lunch on Thursday with a couple of friends, I got a message from another friend who lives nearly 2 hours from us. Her 85 year old friend, Ginger, had a sick 30 year old (!!) African Grey Parrot named Ziggy that was being cared for at a nearby vets office. Ginger was understandably really worried about her and was unable to drive herself to even see Ziggy, (who was brought to this particular vet by someone else). Ginger was told by the vet that Ziggy, who was now on medication and feeling somewhat better could come home if she'd just eat on her own. Ginger was sure that if Ziggy just had her favorite food that the vet couldn't (wouldn't?) provide for her, it might just do the trick. Ginger was feeling really depressed and defeated because she knew of no one to ask for a favor, and so asked my friend if she did. THIS is where I came into the picture. My friend knew it was a lot to ask, but she wondered if I wouldn't mind going to the grocery store and buying for Ziggy, 2 RED apples, RED grapes, and 1 banana all of which are her favorites and taking it to her at the vets office, adding that they would pay me back for the gas and the fruit. Of course I said I would and told my friend that if they gave me anything for what I consider a small favor, I'd be insulted. So off to the store I went, and I dropped it off, also hoping it would tempt Ziggy to eat, and happy that I was able to help someone out. My friend sent me a message telling me that Ziggy immediately ate some of the fruit. And today I received another message that Ziggy was able to come home! Adding that Ginger is so happy and that the first words Ziggy said to her were  \"Are you hungry? At hearing those words, Ginger said she cried. She was even cleaning her feathers, which Ginger says is a good sign. Ziggy, who she has had since she was a very \"young chick\" now has special food and meds for a liver issue and all are hopeful she will be okay.~Ziggy at home!~At the moment, we're all \"okay\" too. It has been a pretty good week for Bailey, (in the middle below) as well the others as I opened up a new 12 pound box of dog-treats today. For us, it's of course more cost-effective to buy them this way and I'm grateful that the shop where we buy their food will special order them for us.And I was sure to give a few extra to Rhett who was a good sport and let me put the ears and petals on him to take a few \"seasonal\" photos.Todd is enjoying the seasonal change and is really enjoying spending more time outdoors.  If spring has come to your corner of the world, I hope you are too!"},
{"title": "No Excuses Needed! ", "date": "Sunday, April 7, 2019", "text": "Oh my...it has been 2 weeks since my last blog post! To be honest, from the moment I wake up in the morning, I spend my days chasing the clock. From the time spent in traffic to get to work, stay on time with patients, and getting home again. Spare time at home really ebbs and flows depending on how the dogs are doing. But in the end, I guess the bottom line is, I am just a lousy blogger.Lousy or not, I know you all understand and I have nothing to explain. But here we go on some of what's been going on at our house. It has really been a couple of weeks where time is taken up with something or some-doggie. One evening I attended a candlelight ceremony for pet loss. For those who have never attended one, it is a non-denominational memorial service to remember our companions that have passed away. Holistic Vet has organized one at a local church for the last several years. She does so much for us, and I went because I want to support her and her community efforts. In both the words that were spoken, and being among about 100 people that I didn't know, I left the one hour service with a different and broader view of loss and that it encompasses both personally and as a whole.Helping out a friend filled another evening, and we landed on Friday. Alf had a 2nd dental surgery to remove an infected canine. I had noticed he was having problems eating and it seemed sensitive to the touch. The tooth had appeared healthy but we think there was an underlying infection that wasn't visible in the initial x-rays and exams. Having extracted the canine on the other side the first time, Alf is now canine-less on the top. By Sunday Alf was back to himself.Last weekend had me playing catch up as I got ready for what I'd thought and hoped would be a quiet week ahead. Boy was I wrong about that!Bailey began coughing a little on Sunday. We really tried to keep her up and moving, but by Monday night she was coughing and vomiting and pretty listless. It was a (mostly) sleepless night, and I was up every hour with her, making sure she remained as comfortable as possible. By Tuesday she took a small amount of food. I was encouraged. Of course we were both exhausted. She slept almost soundly through Tuesday night. I didn't get a lot of sleep because I wanted to make sure she was okay and comfortable. By Wednesday, the cough was all but gone, and her appetite had returned.  For that I was and am grateful.~Bailey catching up on her sleep~On Thursday it was off to the groomers with Todd and Charlie for their spring haircuts.~Not so happy Todd?~I'll spare you the personal drama when I arrived to find out that the groomer I totally trusted, and have taken our dogs to for more than 10 years, and who owned the shop was gone. The business had been sold to a young-ish girl named KeriAnne, who by the way, I'm sure I have socks older than, and her husband.  Feeling blindsided and not trusting our dogs to just anyone, I fought off the urge to leave, and give them the chance. They did a good job and I added $10 to the tip because they had to put up with me in the beginning.~A Happier (and handsome) Todd~But for Charlie, I think his spending a day at the groomer may be over. At what has to be about 14 years old, a whole day away from home is just too much for him. He was really wiped out. (Vicki get your clippers ready!)Back to Todd. Those who have owned Scotties know their nickname is “The Diehard.” It was given to them by the Earl of Dumbarton to his Scotties in the 19th Century. Todd was, of course, true to that. Once home, he was charged and ready to go.I'm hopeful we are also ready to go for next week too.Rhett in the photo below that was taken last week, would just like me to stop taking pictures. He was ready for his breakfast!"},

As the weather has gotten warmer, I'm hoping it's just allergies and nothing more serious.I did have a few outpatient tests done at the hospital and I won't bore you with all of that. But I do want to share a sign that I also posted on Facebook that was on the back of a bathroom door. As a total germaphobe, especially in public places, it gave me a bit of pause and a grin because I just had to wonder who in the world would do such a thing?  And I also wondered how many people actually did do *it* before a sign was made? But do we really want to know?  Oh my .....But I digress. So back to the dogs. In between running back and forth between work, and the hospital, the weather could not have been better. It was so nice to be outside and have the chance to recenter and clear my head. The dogs love being outside for longer periods too. The spring sun is warm and energizing as a bit of color and spring flowers are starting to appear. .Rhett is enjoying the better weather we've had as well, and did what I've dubbed a spring roll.And today, its been rain the entire day.

She really is a nice little girl, quiet, eager to please and loves attention. A quintessential Golden Retriever. It goes without saying that we love having her as part of our household.A few of  you asked about the herbs that we will be using for Joy that are on their way to us from Australia. Longtime readers know I'm a big believer in balancing the use of herbs with conventional care. However, in the more than 15 years that I've used them, I have always used Chinese herbs from the same company in the US or that I've gotten from a holistic vet.The ones we'll be using for Joy are ones that I've never used before, from a company I've never ordered from previously. There have been a few dogs in the rescue I volunteer with that have had good results in their use and have allowed dogs diagnosed with lymphoma to continue to enjoy a good quality of life and extend it as well.The combination we are going to use for Joy is not available here in the US. I will admit to being a bit skeptical of them. However hearing what the results have been, has caused me to be more hopeful and support willing to give them a try.The name of the company is called McDowells Herbal Treatments.Click here for the link One of the herbs we are using for Joy is Maritime Pine Bark Extract -Click here for the link  This herb will help to boost Joy's immune system.The other is a \"support mix\" specifically for lymphoma - Click here for the linkHere is a page that describes their recommended treatment for lymphoma -Click here for the link As I said, I've never used these particular herbs before, and I know practically nothing about the company or the herbs. However, if any of you do, I hope you'll let me know. And I hope you'll stay tuned and I promise to let you know how they work for Joy."},

The good news is that at the moment Joy is not symptomatic. This makes me hopeful that we will have more time with her. So, now that we have that diagnosis, we can now move forward with our plan for Joy's care. This will include herbs from Australia for her specifically for lymphoma that are now on their way to us.~Joy~On another day, Bailey began coughing, but it didn't keep her from getting her rest. Making sure Bailey getting up and walking around is key in keeping her airways open. So, I decided to take her with me on a little morning trip.The first stop was at a friends home to drop something off.  Bailey met their puppy, a Flat Coated Retriever named Keeper. I didn't get any photos of their meeting one another - This was partly because my friend and I weren't quite sure of what Bailey would do. We all know that not all dogs, even including a couple at our house aren't crazy about the antics of a puppy. However Bailey is not one of them. She loved him and wanted to stay and play with Keeper.Our next stop was Tractor Supply. It's one of the few stores nearby where dogs are allowed, so I took Bailey inside. When the door opened, I heard something that sounded like spring to me. It was the sound of baby chicks.  And they had plenty for sale!Bailey watched intently as the chicks were taken out of the box.  And they had plenty of ducks too.Bailey really enjoyed all the new smells, and meeting a few new faces too.Our little outing did the trick for Bailey. Aside from being worn out by the time we got home, she didn't cough once the rest of the day and we've both had a good weekend.Despite our time change, our lights going out overnight for about five hours, we're ready for the week ahead.

Of all the dogs, Max. Really. I was sitting on the edge of the bed and at the moment he was jumping up, (something only he and Todd can do) I moved my arm, accidentally blocking him, causing him to fall back. He was okay, but he'd taken it personally and stayed away from me.Seeing that I may have fallen outside his circle of trust, to regain that trust, I took Max on a walk with just the two of us to feed the birds and take a few photos. He was reluctant to come with me, but did as I asked him to. And I will admit, I had to chuckle because at the first moment my back was turned, Max ran back to the house.~Max retreating~He's not as leary around me today, but he does not want to get onto the bed either.

So this appointment was to check the levels of the phenobarbital that he has in his system, and make sure that his liver remains healthy.~Rhett~Joy tagged along because I'd noticed a lump on her neck that I thought needed to be looked at. I'd also heard from the oncologist. The assistant felt that there was nothing that could be done for either Joy or Bailey because we didn't and don't have a definitive diagnosis for either one. **Uh, I thought that's why we were seeing an oncologist, to get that diagnosis...**  So I talked it all over with Mobile Vet who agreed. He knows the oncologist pretty well and promised to talk to him about them both.~Mobile Vet and his assistant doing an aspirate on Joy's lump~And finally, Bailey has had a pretty good week. She's been coughing a little bit, but not enough to make me overly concerned. She has been up and around and is in good spirits.I think we're in a good place as we start the new week. Knock on wood that it stays that way!"},
{"title": "On About Day 70 of Grace for Bailey", "date": "Sunday, February 17, 2019", "text": "I'm grateful that we are rounding the corner to another week. Last week was quite a week for both me and part of our pack. On Friday our foster girl Ginger had her spay done. It all went well. She's home and resting.Most of the drama was Bailey. And I've been feeling the emotional fallout from it since. It began when I got home from work Tuesday evening, and found Bailey laying in the same place as she was when I'd left for work more than 10 hours before. My dog-walker hadn't gotten her up and outside, and my brother and husband had no idea about any of it when they'd arrived home before me.~Bailey not feeling well~Being in one position for so long had made Bailey sick, and she was refusing to move. We got her up and moving and outside, but she continued getting sick and was having problems breathing. By bedtime she seemed brighter, so we opted to monitor her overnight. It was a mostly sleepless night for both of us.By the time the sun was coming up, I was exhausted and stayed home from work. I called Bailey's vet when they opened, but they were unable to see us until late afternoon. I didn't want to wait that long, so I called my Mobile Vet, who could see her a few hours earlier.Having someone else see Bailey turned out to be a good decision. Mobile Vet decided to take x-rays.With all the coughing up of fluid, we thought she might have pneumonia. But she does not. The x-ray below was taken with Bailey on her back. I've \"enhanced\" the x-ray so you can see that the darkened area in between the two arrows is her trachea. You can see that there is a curve. It should of course be straight/smooth. The tumor which is on your left has displaced that.  This is why Bailey has breathing problems. When she's in the same position for too long, fluid pools in that curve and obstructs her airway, and she coughs. If she's up and around, it helps to open up her airway and allow any fluid to move through.Mobile Vet took the time to talk to me about everything that he thinks are options for Bailey's care. There are not many, but Mobile Vet thinks that a visit to the oncologist is a good place to start. His thought is that a bronchodilator may be something Bailey may benefit from. So, next week, Joy and Bailey will be off to see the oncologist.And as we start a new week, Bailey is doing much, much better and is hardly coughing. Her appetite is back, and Mobile Vet gave me some new ideas for helping to keep Bailey's airway clear. My hope and optimism that all but vanished mid-week has returned as we continue on our \"days of Grace with Bailey.\"On a much lighter note, I hope you had a good Valentine's day! Here are a few photos used to mark ours. ~Ginger~~Rhett~~Joy~Thanks for stopping by - Have a good week!"},
{"title": "The Hardest Part - Update on Joy  ", "date": "Tuesday, February 5, 2019", "text": "For me, there is no way to articulate the rewards that have come from fostering the senior dogs for both the Golden Retriever Rescue, and Lab Rescue.Last week, Joy met Mobile Vet for follow-up blood work. Her previous vet had been concerned about her high white blood cell count, and Mobile Vet was concerned about her elevated lymphocytes. I was hoping now that she is past being so ill, there would be improvement from the previous tests done just 2 weeks ago. But below is an e-mail that I woke up to this morning.As Dr. R suspected, the blood work is consistent with lymphoma/leukemia.  He can add on another test to help confirm, but it may be best to see an internal medicine specialist for ultrasound, chest reds, and consultation...And/ or an oncologist for consultation.Sorry for the bad newsThis is truly the hardest part of fostering senior dogs like Joy. Especially when it's a dog like her that you've practically just met, and have hopes and dreams for. Knowing those dreams cannot be, for me, is heartbreaking."},
{"title": "Do You Remember Chipper? ", "date": "Thursday, January 31, 2019", "text": "With arrival of Joy last week I'm behind in telling you about Chipper. Do you remember that we even have him?  I've hardly written about him, so it's okay.  Chip arrived here in June from Lancaster Pennsylvania. He'd been used for breeding, and was given to Lab Rescue by an Amish farmer.~Chip the day we met him in June, 2018~ Chip is a dog with a gentle heart and a wounded soul. He is afraid of practically everything. In the nearly 20 years that we've been fostering dogs, I have to say, that he is the most fearful dog we've ever had.  Honestly, he spends most of his time, running away from everything. Even including us. The picture below is an example of that - he's worried and his head and tail are down, and he's avoiding any eye contact as he tries to get away. It's very sad.But I think Chip is torn by what he wants to do, and what he's always known. In the past 6 months that we've had him, he has made good progress and is much more relaxed. But the progress is slow, and sometimes we take steps forward, only to go back several more. There is no doubt, he has a long way to go and so much to learn. The progress that has been made is that he'll come to us for treats and attention so I know that he has come to trust us. It does help that he is highly food motivated.In December when Lab Rescue announced their waived adoption fee for the senior dogs, it generated some interest in Chip, who is about 10 years old. But among those few calls about him, no one really seemed to understand the challenges of having a shy and fearful dog like Chip. And for that matter, no one had an interest in helping Chip overcome his fears and find his confidence. They appeared only interested in him because of the waived adoption fee.I talked to Lab Rescue about my concerns, worries and hopes and dreams for Chip. The coordinator totally agreed with me about his special needs. And others who've met him also agreed that Chip needed a special adopter. I knew that we could continue to wait, and eventually someone may come.  But those of you who have lived with dogs like Chip know there is a unique and strong bond that develops when a fearful dog has given you their trust. The more time that passes, I feel that trust and bond with Chip. And last week when I was bent over and greeting another dog, Chip snuck up on me and quickly licked my cheek. He'd never done that before, so it surprised me, and he quickly backed away. But he didn't go to his \"safe place.\" Instead he stood several feet away, looking at me and wagging his tail. And I knew in that moment that the decision that was made a few days before was the right one.  Chip has found his forever home, with us.~Chip this morning, with his pack-mates~"},

Found abandoned on a road in West Virginia by a family that couldn't afford to keep her, Joy eventually found her way to the Golden Retriever Rescue. I will add here that even though the family that found Joy couldn't keep her, they bought her a dog bed and sent it along with her. The bed may not be a well made one, but I'm touched by their thoughtfulness that says a lot about them.  ~Joy's first night with us~We did not start out as Joy's foster home. But there was a bit of a \"mishap\" between Joy and a 5 pound smoked fillet of salmon in which the salmon and Joy both lost. She became very ill, and ended up hospitalized for about a week. The rescue felt it would be best for Joy if she went to another foster home.Our dogs easily accepted this new comer who is quiet and very easy going. She's estimated to be about 11 years old, and her tail does not stop wagging. At just over 40 pounds, Joy has a few pounds to gain. She also has a few health-hurdles to get over; anemia, lyme disease, and of course her bout of severe gastroenteritis.But this endearing little girl that was left abandoned on a road in West Virginia, now has a pretty brand new collar, and most importantly Joy has a bright future.Welcome Joy, we're glad you're here!"},

I couldn't breathe and I was coughing and coughing and coughing and .... Well, you get the idea. Even with the maximum over-the-counter-strength medications redeployed from being sick the week before, I knew I needed to step it up and go to the doctor. So that's what I did.  And I (unfortunately) tested positive for the flu.I am not sick all that often, so I will admit that I make a terrible sick person. The dogs seemed to know I wasn't feeling well, and one day when I was home alone, they let me sleep in until about 10 o'clock. I am finally back on my feet, and I'm pretty confident I've finally got this flu bug behind me. Despite my not being 100%, our newest arrival Ginger is all settled in. Aside from chasing the cat on occasion, she's easy going, happy and getting along well with everyone. All the dogs like her, and we of course, like her too. And we aren't the only ones. When Ginger came into the rescue, she met a family that happened to be at the vets office (with their cats) when she arrived. This family taken by her story applied to adopt her. I was asked to let them see Ginger and spend some time with her.They had a 3 year old dog that was unneutered, and pretty energetic. He wouldn't leave Ginger alone. With that, and my just not getting a good vibe from the family, I felt strongly that they weren't a match for Ginger. The rescue supported my opinion, and they let them know. And then this week I had a reminder to follow those feelings when it was discovered that Ginger is NOT spayed....That's all I'll say about that and what a disaster it would have been to place her with that family and their unneutered dog.Aside from that and snow expected this weekend, it has been pretty quiet as we're nearly halfway into January.Happy belated New Year from us!~Alf~"},

So, he decided to pledge on her behalf to cover the adoption fees for all of the dogs age 9 and older from now until the end of the year.\"What a generous donation to the rescue! It has of course, created a lot of buzz. And for our foster girl, Nina, there ended up being no shortage of interest in her. By Thursday I had 4 phone calls, and by the end of the week, Nina had met her perfect match! Joanne is retired, recently widowed, and she lost her previous Lab about 6 months ago. I liked her right away. She is compassionate, and caring and she and Nina are perfect for one another.~Joanne and Nina~Joanne loves senior dogs. She cried when she met Nina and felt a connection to her instantly. I have no doubt that they should be together.~Nina all settled into her new home on her new bed!~You know our dog beds never get cold. So, our year is ending with the arrival of Ginger at Golden Pines! Ginger will turn that respectable age of 13 in May. She was given up by her owner who simply no longer wanted her. He even threatened to take Ginger to a shelter (or worse) if Lab Rescue didn't accept her.~In my van for the ride home~Ginger was so happy to be out of boarding, and was anxious to get into my van to start the next chapter in her life. Her tail has not stopped wagging! Intros that are always taken really slow have gone well. Our dogs like Ginger just fine!~Checking out the new girl~Ginger is a typical Lab. Easy going, happy, and eager to be friends. If we're having any problems, it's that Ginger is constantly pacing and panting and won't settle down inside. Given that her world has been totally turned upside down, it's understandable. I know when she realizes that she's going to be okay, and finds her place she'll be just fine.Welcome to Golden Pines, Ginger!"},

And I could ask that age old question, \"where has the time gone?\"  Usually I don't know the answer to that, but this time I do. Because, believe me, even without Christmas, there has been plenty going on at our house.It didn't help that I was sick for about a week, missing work, and staying in bed one weekend helped to put me behind on almost everything. A cough is still hanging on, but I'm recovered from the bug that also knocked down half of my co-workers, and my husband and brother too.~Charlie!~Back on my feet, I got almost all that I needed done just before the holidays. And during that time Alf had his dental surgery. Six teeth were removed including a canine that exposed his sinus. Alf has fully recovered, and is back to eating normally and barking at me when I am not getting his dinner to him quick enough.~Alf when he wasn't feeling so well~ Sunny has had a bout of what is either canine vestibular syndrome, or an inner ear infection. We don't know which. He's unable to fully keep his balance when he walks, and we've started him on an antibiotic. He's much better, but of course I'm worried about him.~A not-feeling-so-great Sunny~Then of course there's Bailey. She is having mostly good days right now. We had a visit to Holistic Vet and she's given Bailey a Chinese herb that we hope will help her digestion and keep the acid in her tummy to a minimum.~Bailey~I'll now just fast forward past some of the other things that have happened, like the opossum inside our garage that got caught halfway inside a plastic bag the other night and couldn't free itself. And how a couple of the dogs are growling at the rocking chair that has been sitting in the same place since we moved here. Is it a ghost of Christmas past? ~Outdoor kitty Gino, NOT keeping our garage critter free~Whatever it is, we do know that the end of the year now in sight. And after a week off work, I'm filling in on Friday for my counterpart who wants to spend time with her family. So with that, it's onward to the New Year!Thank-you, friends, for stopping by!

{"title": "Days of Grace and Goals for Bailey", "date": "Saturday, December 8, 2018", "text": "The end of another week, as Christmas draws closer.  ~Rhett~This week ended with Bailey back at the Internist for x-rays and an ultrasound in hopes of finding the cause for her cough and all the problems that it brings about for her.Unfortunately, the Internist \"identified a 3.9 cm mass deep in the abdomen that is likely pressing on her esophagus.\"  This mass is expected to grow and will eventually cause discomfort or blockage. This mass in particular, because of where it is, is totally inoperable. Even if Bailey were a younger dog, the Internist does not feel that removing it would be an option.  And if that weren't enough (and it was) also found was another mass between Bailey's ribs.~Bailey waiting for her tests~Given all of that, and at the recommendation of the Vet, I've discussed everything with the medical-coordinator from the rescue and together we have decided to make and keep Bailey happy and comfortable but not pursue any further treatment for her. She will of course have any needed medications and vet care, but there will be no \"extreme measures\" taken to prolong her life. So, as we begin Bailey's precious days of grace, I will do as I always do.....  To really (really) try to not dwell on what's to come. And if I have learned anything about this kind of diagnosis, I know to just forget what the vet says and remember to live in and savor the moments together. It also helps to think and remain positive and set goals and do our best to reach them. Bailey is feeling well, she is not coughing, she has a really good appetite, and is up and around. She is happy.  So, for our first goal it will be an easy one, Christmas and onto New Years.  The big goal will be her 14th birthday that comes in March. I think with your cheering her on, and POTP, we will make it together.~Good night from Bailey~"},

Life to him is serious, to be met with dignity, reserve and stout heart. He is by nature aloof, but to the accepted few friends and family his devotion is deep and lifelong. A secure place in his home, understanding and companionship are essential to his happiness. In spite of his independent spirit, his strong desire for approval will win compliance with your wishes where harsh words and punishment will fail.

He has at least 3 teeth that will need to be extracted, and of course they'll need to be cleaned too. After the console, I had no real plans for the rest of the day.~Alf, ready for the next step~So, I decided to take a small road trip. The vet that I'd taken Alf to was in the same direction as a parcel of property that is for sale in the neighboring county. The land and its location really caught my eye, so much so, that I contacted our realtor about it.~I think it's this view that has caught my attention~I was about an hour from home, and knowing I needed gas I decided to wait because gas in this neighboring county is almost 50 cents less per gallon.  My thriftiness became my downfall because when I got to the gas station, I suddenly realized in my rush to get Alf to his appointment, I'd forgotten my wallet. I had no money, no credit card, no ID, nothing.  And, my gas tank was almost on empty. I scrounged through everything and came up with $2.60ish in loose change. It would buy enough gas to get me pretty close to home,~The not-so-good-start at looking for spare change~But I knew once I was closer to home I could count on my friends to help me if I needed them. So, I went in to buy the gas, and explained why I was buying so little with change. Before I realized it, a man behind me in line said he'd give me a couple extra dollars that he had, and another man behind him did the same, even offering to fill my tank. (I thanked him, but said I only wanted to get home).  Between the two men in line, and I can't be sure, but maybe even the lady behind the counter, I ended up with $10 for gas. More than enough. I do not think I could not have been more thankful for their kindness. Alf also thanked them with tail wags and we were soon on our way home.~Hope safe 'n sound with Alf!~I thought about going to see the property. But decided against it. It'll have to wait for another day. When I have more gas and my wallet."},

Don't get me wrong, I really do love a beautifully set table, especially for a holiday or special occasion. Who doesn't?~This was NOT our table because I am NO Martha Stewart....~But I have to say that it's totally lost on my husband and brother. So because of that, I didn't feel the pressure to morph into Martha Stewart for the day. It's never going to happen today or any day for that matter, and it's okay!Max, (below) cares nothing about Martha Stewart. After dinner and dessert he came to the table hoping there may be something left for him.Another hopeful after dinner was Sunny. I don't write much about Sunny, and I should. He is slowing down a bit and the cold days are hard for him because of his arthritis. He avoids the spotlight and especially a camera whenever he can. But he doesn't realize that I'm taking his picture with my phone, so Sunny is staying around when he sees it in front of him.But all the dogs did get a little bit of turkey added to their evening meal, the ultimate treat for them. Todd, checking out the refrigerator this morning, is hoping for the same thing this morning. Again,m he and the others were not disappointed.Now with one holiday behind us, it's onto the next one.

She's had a  productive cough the last several months. Antibiotics have helped, and the cough all but disappears, and Bailey feels better, but then the cough returns.Then the vet puts Bailey back on the antibiotic, and the cycle starts all over again. I've lost track of how many nights I've listened to her raspy breathing and we've both been awake as she coughs up fluid over and over again. At 13 years old it's taking its toll on her. X-rays show a spot on Bailey's lung near her heart is probably the culprit. But its hard to see because of a large lipoma that's blocking and clouding the view.So we are hoping that tomorrows ultrasound brings the needed answers for Bailey.And finally can you answer the question of who our outdoor kitty Gino is reacting to?"},

I had fun reading who you thought would be a good fit for Kirsten.  You were all right, both Ms PhD or Old Friend would have both been a good match for Kirsten.So, I will start by telling you that I did not pick the Grandparents for Kirsten. The reason was based on \"Grandma's\" purely and utterly absurd and ridiculous concern that Kirsten's missing eye would scare her grandchildren. Grandma was also worried about how she would explain it to them and other people who she was so sure would be frightened by Kirsten's missing eye and even her spotty tongue. Based solely on what I felt and feel is so ludicrous,  I could not end the visit fast enough.~The face of a frightening dog??!! I don't think so!!!~So that left the two people who you thought and I liked very much for Kirsten. But in the end, it came down to who I felt Kirsten really connected with, and that was Ms PhD and her dog Frisky.  Kirsten responded really well to them both, and there were lots of tail wags and an ease and comfort that just seemed so natural when they were together. I also really thought Kirsten needed to have a canine companion. And with Frisky being a bit shy, I thought the quiet reassurance that only a dog like Kirsten could give would help her, and allow Kirsten to blossom in that role.~Kirsten and Frisky~The reports have all been positive ones, and I feel strongly that all is as it should be.

With the passing of her last dog several months ago, Ms PhD really wanted Frisky to have a companion, so the two being compatible was important.  She lives in the country and is home most of the time and does therapy work with all her dogs.

It has been a number of years, but I knew her from the time that I served on the board of the rescue.

Despite being a little sore and reluctant to get up, he's doing really well.  There's still more vet care that's needed for him, but that will wait for him to heal from this round.~A shaggy Alf~And yesterday Charlie and Todd were off to the groomers. Todd and I are off tomorrow for a Rocky Creek Scottie Reunion on Saturday.  It's going to be a chilly picnic, but Todd is ready to look his best!Thank-you Friends for stopping by. Your thoughtful kindness, friendship and support has become a constant that I treasure. And I look forward to catching up with your blogs and your news. Enjoy your weekend!~Rhett~"},
{"title": "A Trip to Memory Lane", "date": "Sunday, October 7, 2018", "text": "A trip planned in March has had me out of town since Thursday.It has come at a good time. This much needed break to clear my head and recharge is a dog-less trip down memory lane.Yesterday morning I stood in front of my high school and was taken back nearly 40 years to an age of innocence and a world so much different than the one I know today. Around me old and new friends from that time.  It's easy to see that we are a pretty diverse crowd. Life has taken us in so many directions.~Fort Knox High School~But at the time we attended Fort Knox High School, (in Kentucky) we all had one thing in common, our Dad's were in the Army.I suppose at times like this it is only natural to rummage around in ancient memory and recall events and classmates and the journey to adulthood that is high school and is so full of first-time experiences.~The United States Bullion Depository, or the Gold Vault, what Fort Knox is famous for~To say our class has experienced change is understated. We did not imagine a world where we would carry a phone in our pockets, and connect on something called \"social media.\"For a lot of us, we've not been back to Fort Knox for many years.  I was lucky in that a friend of mine who used to live down the street from me still lives in the area and works on post.  She gave me a great tour of Fort Knox and was able to show and tell me all about what has changed, and what hasn't.~Our house hasn't changed at all, at least not on the outside~And talk about change, this weekend I've seen lots of gray hair and waistlines that have expanded. Of course my classmates looked at me and saw the same thing. But despite those outer changes I also saw football players, cheerleaders, fellow band members, and even \"that girl\" who bullied a few of us. I wonder if she remembers that?~The fire-station nearby across the street that we used to go and buy a soda and candy bar for 25 cents!~I guess it's a reminder that maybe we can’t really go home again - There are some that say you shouldn’t live in the past. I suppose that's a good rule to live by for the most part.~The movie theater near our 'housing area' that I spent lots of Saturday's~ But for this weekend, and for this class reunion, that phrase was tossed out the window, as we remembered those good times and shared a weekend with friends and classmates from long ago. I'm especially glad I was able to come and spend time with a friend who I've stayed in contact with for more than 40 years. She is a true connection to my past, and I treasure our friendship.~This seemed like such a steep hill to ride our bikes down. It doesn't seem that steep any more~Today I said good-bye to those classmates, and had a really nice visit with family that still lives in the area. On Monday it'll be time to head home and back to my life.  I miss the dogs."},
{"title": "Good-bye to our Beautiful Eva ", "date": "Sunday, September 30, 2018", "text": "Eva's angel watch ended Friday afternoon with Holistic Vet, her husband, and me there to send her to the Rainbow Bridge. A sad, heartbreaking good-bye. With edema starting to set in, her body was failing her. Eva's battle with renal failure was over.  Despite having lost that battle, her gentle and peaceful nature and golden-smile remained until the very end.~One Last Photo~As I was looking through Eva's pictures this morning, I have to admit, its hard to find one that truly encompasses her. She was truly the quintessential Golden Retriever, just as beautiful on the inside as she was on the outside. Her eyes always sparkled, and she was always happy.  I'd say that if I had to find any fault with Eva, I'd be pretty hard-pressed to find something. But if there is one to mention, it would be that you couldn't teach her anything, and trust me, I tried.However, thinking about it now, I wonder if it was just because Eva didn't want to learn anything? She was truly all about living and being happy in the moment. It actually made her that much more endearing and that much more treasured and loved.I know that it goes without saying that Eva will be missed. I've been home most of the day, and it's easy to feel like something or \"someone\" is missing. When you've had your heart expanded and broken by a dog (or a cat) you know what I'm talking about when I say that. If you haven't, I can tell you this, life with a dog or a cat always ends in tears. My heart is shattered and in pieces from Eva's loss. But despite that, I can say that with all certainty and without a single doubt, that after all we went through with Eva and her illness, if I could spare her from having kidney disease, I would do it all over again.God-speed to our lovely and beautiful Eva, I cannot wait for the day when I'll get to see you again. I will miss you leaning on me as we drove to your appointments. I will miss you happily running down the hallway in front of me at mealtimes and rushing back into the kitchen after you'd eaten for the leftovers. I will miss your always wanting to eat all the treats I gave out as I was leaving.  I will miss you pawing at me and always wanting to be the one to get all of the attention. I will miss watching you rush out the back door to see what Todd was barking at and being part of the fun. I will miss waking up in the middle of the night, and looking down the hallway towards the living room and seeing you sleeping on your bed. I will miss you Eva. And as has become our tradition, I've picked a color for Eva to sum up her life with us and create our own rainbow.  The color for Eva has to be pink. Pink is a delicate color that means sweet, nice, playful, and tenderness. Eva had all those qualities. Pink is also the color associated with girls and Eva was all girl - From her being a \"momma dog\" in her first life, to her pink collar, and soft pink skin under her beautiful blonde coat. The color pink is also the color of love, and that's truly what Eva was truly all about...Love.~Eva on the first day we met, November 17, 2016~"},

I've tried everything I can think of. Eva has become very quiet, not moving around much, sleeping soundly most of the time. She'll wake and wag her tail when one of the other dogs come near her, or we talk to her or sit with her. Eva is (thankfully) in no pain. Getting her to go outside is meant with protests, but she reluctantly does as we ask of her.The TV has been off all evening, the lights are low. and it's very quiet and peaceful as Eva sleeps nearby. There is an ache and sadness in my heart and soul.  Eva's journey is coming to an end, as her Angel Watch has begun."},
{"title": "A Warm and Sunny Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday, September 18, 2018", "text": "Thank-you all for the get-well-wishes, they really helped because I'm feeling much, much better!  What has also helped is that I had an unplanned day off work today when the doctor I work for was out of the office. We sat on the front porch for a little while and just soaked up the warmth of the sun. After all the rain we've had the last week, it was so nice to see the sky for a change.  Eva gets easily chilled these days, and gravitates towards warm places. So, she also enjoyed dozing and warming up on the porch.After we'd been sitting on the porch for a while, I realized that it was also a good day to give newcomer Alf, a much needed bath. He really needed one to remove the \"flea dirt\" and just to freshen him up a bit. He didn't mind the bath at all, and afterwards there were lots of tail wags as I dried him off.  I think he feels better.  He looks and smells better, that's for sure!~Did you just say bath??~Also just for this week, while his foster home is on vacation, we're keeping a 13-ish year old senior boy named Buster. He's getting along well with our dogs, and we're enjoying the chance to get to know him before he goes back to his foster family on Sunday. Buster has quite a story of rescue. He was found alone in a home that had been condemned. His story goes right along with reports on the news about stranded pets being found tied up and/or trapped who were left behind by their owners during Hurricane Florence - And it asks the mind-boggling question, \"how could someone just leave a dog like Buster or any dog or cat behind to fend for themselves knowing danger lay ahead for them?\""},

He has had a pretty rough week.  He was unable to really walk when he was at the shelter, was \"depressed\" and in the records we received, three times euthanizing him was mentioned.~Shelter photos of Alf~He has an infected tooth and elbow, and what looks like a wire within a lump on his chest, he had fleas and a matted coat. But after a day or two on medications, he was feeling better and the rescue was asked to take him. ~Is that a wire??~When we met on Thursday, Alf was able to walk, he had gotten a (really) bad haircut, the fleas were gone, thankfully, and he was exhausted.  Once at home, we didn't do any one on one intros because he fell fast asleep. Not even waking up for my brother or Carl coming home. After his evening meal, he was soon fast asleep again.~Out cold!~When he was awake, Alf was tentative in our interactions and his eyes followed and watched everything that I did and they even seemed a bit puzzled. His world had been turned totally upside down so it's understandable. ~The look from a 'doodle whose life is turned totally upside down~No longer that \"lost boy\" three days later, Alf is a totally different dog with confidence. His eyes have softened, he's relaxed, and following me around the house and he's even a bit silly.  He's getting along fine with the other dogs, and just sits nearby and barks and wags his tail when we talk to him. I'd say that unlike Max, his personalty seems more Golden than Poodle.  He also loves exploring the yard and just laying in the grass.~Alf loves our big yard!~Alf has a vet appointment on Monday afternoon. But given how he's acting today, maybe those health-issue-hurdles that he has to get over will be easier than we all thought."},
{"title": "The Unofficial Finish Line of Summer", "date": "Monday, September 3, 2018", "text": "Monday. Labor Day weekend and the mark of the end of summer.  Okay, just to be technical, Labor Day is not the official end of summer – that title is reserved for September 21st since the 22nd marks the first official day of fall. But with that being said, many people like me, see it as summer ending. And talk about ending, I'm not just limping across the finish line to the end of summer, I am being dragged across it, waving my white flag of surrender.....I AM DONE with summer. It has been far too busy and a much too hectic summer.This past Saturday we were invited to a Shabbat lunch with the family that adopted Brandon.  It was such a lovely and enjoyable afternoon, and it was great to see Brandon all settled in.  He is loved, adored and pampered, as I knew he would be. I've made the joke several times that if there were 100 ways to spoil Brandon, Pam will find 110!~Brandon and his new pack-mate Omelet~Back at home, the crew is doing pretty well.  Eva spends most of her days sleeping, and I know it is because the kidney disease is progressing. There are times that I see the \"old Eva\" and I cannot help but smile and be grateful for those moments when her illness is not so much on the surface.~A good day for Eva last Thursday~I've also been grateful that Eva's appetite had been stable the last several weeks. But this weekend she missed 3 meals in a row, so I'm back to trying to find something she'll want to eat.  If you have a few to spare, could you send some good vibes for her? On the much lighter side, Cissy (below) has been eating her meals with Chipper, our foster boy from Lab Rescue because they both eat slower than the others. But he has seemed so hungry lately and I found out why. I've left he and Cissy alone to eat, and she has been eating his food.  Under that innocent senior face, lies a food stealer. Who knew?  Today she got a bath, and I think I heard a snicker or two from Chipper about that.We did take some time to sit and relax on the porch today. Even Eva (below) joined us.As Labor Day weekend comes to an end, it's easy to see that the nights are drawing in. It will be dark when our day starts on Tuesday.  I'm not sad that Summer is leaving us. We will still have some nice days in September and October and even into November. But I am glad to put the summer unofficially behind us and I look forward to Autumn, and a new season."},
{"title": "Helping Brandon #18-018 Find \"Life\"", "date": "Saturday, August 25, 2018", "text": "~More veggies from our garden~Today Carl returns from being out of town, and I end 10 days as a single-dog-parent. I'm exhausted.  The loss of Momma, and two sick pups, Eva and Bailey took its toll because of a few nights of little sleep and having to work, and care for the other dogs.  Thankfully both girls are feeling better, and for that I'm thankful and grateful.~Bailey, not feeling well~We also end the week minus another member of our household. You may, or may not remember that back in June, we welcomed a 14+ year old boy named Brandon.~Brandon, the day we met~Brandon settled in very nicely and got along with all the dogs. But somewhere along the way,  that began to change. I can only think that being part of a multi-dog household got to be too much for Brandon. He began growling and sometimes fighting with the other dogs. Most of the time, for whatever reason, Bailey, was the one he targeted.  And Todd, who is always ready for a fight, got involved a few times which took the fight to a whole other level. Thankfully no one was injured, but we began \"managing\" where Brandon was, and which dogs he was with. It wasn't always easy, but we worked it out.The foster-home-coordinator for the rescue really tried to find a new foster home for Brandon. But she wasn't able to find anyone, and I think now it was because the cosmos had other plans. Brandon had been on the rescues website as \"available for adoption.\" and a few weeks ago, there was an inquiry about Brandon. But the family had to go through the approval process and so we decided to hang-on and see where it would take us. They were previous adopters from the rescue, and with all their information updated, a new home visit completed they were approved to adopt again, and so we met last Saturday.Meeting \"P\" and her husband was just like meeting friends. They were warm and welcoming. \"P\" is currently undergoing treatment for cancer, and she felt she needed something to take care of and something that would also take her mind off herself.  \"P\" had seen Brandon on the rescues website when he was with his previous foster home and available for adoption , and she'd noticed when he was no longer listed.  So, when \"P\" saw him listed again, she knew they had to apply to adopt him. \"P's\" feelings about Brandon, even before she met him, were so strong, that she even ordered him a new leash and collar.By himself, Brandon is gentle, sweet, endearing, affectionate, and even silly. He was all \"P\" and her husband hoped he would be, and our meeting could not have gone any better. Taking on a senior dog, especially one that is 14 years old is something to consider, so I asked them to think about it and we would catch up in a few days. I received a call from \"P\" a couple of hours later. They were totally smitten by Brandon and of course I thought they could not be more perfect for him!So, on Thursday, Brandon was adopted. \"P\" and her husband could not be happier or  more excited to dote on and spoil Brandon and to have him as part of their lives! \"P\" and her husband are Jewish. I mention this only because when we were filling out Brandon's adoption contract, I remarked to \"P\" about his ID number for the rescue being 18-018 (referencing the year and that Brandon was the 18th dog that came into the rescue this year)  \"P\" had noticed that as well, and told me that the Hebrew word for \"life\"has a numerical value of 18. So, Brandon's ID numbers mean \"life.\" Very appropriate I think.Brandon's story and his journey that began this spring to find a new home speaks to my heart and soul. I know Brandon is where he is supposed to be for this chapter in his life. I'm grateful to be part of his story, and helping, Brandon, #18-018 find \"life,\" happiness and a perfect forever home and family.~Brandon settling into his forever home~"},
{"title": "Good-Bye (for now) to Momma", "date": "Saturday, August 18, 2018", "text": "Yesterday was a very long day, but the past 17 days before it, passed all too quickly. After 17 days, I said good-bye to Momma. The last few days had been difficult for her. I upped her pain medication and added another with the hope that it would alleviate the obvious discomfort she was having caused by the very large mammary tumor. But, unfortunately, it did not. During the night, I was awakened more than once by her whining as she tried to get comfortable. It was heartbreaking to listen to. I prayed she would find comfort.~Our first photo together~My hope when Momma came to us was to make the last days of her life the best. I'm not sure that we did that, but I think that she liked being part of our household. She enjoyed lots extra treats, sneaking a nap on the bed in our guest bedroom, a big yard to explore, and the company of lots of canine friends, and one in particular, Chipper, is really missing her. I am too.  It didn't take long to get used to hearing her tail whack-whack-whack against the wall when she'd see me. It didn't take long to get used to seeing her smiling face, seeing her lounging on the big dog bed in the office. It didn't take long for her to find a place in my heart.In the hopes of making a last memory with Momma, on the way to the vets office, I decided to go to McDonalds. I was going to get my favorite, a cheeseburger and fries for her. But once at the drive thru, it occured to me that I should get what would be her favorite. A bacon-egg-and cheese biscuit. We went to a quiet place and I showed it to her. There was a puzzled look on Momma's face when I offered it to her. When she realized it was for her, her tail wagged as she gobbled it down. Afterwards, as I sat next to her for in our final quiet moments, there was a smile and sparkle in her eyes as she leaned into me as I talked to her. I wonder now, if on those rare times when I have a bacon-egg-and cheese biscuit, I'll not think of her.As I left the vets office, I couldn't help but notice the purple wild flowers, called Ironweed that is  blooming along the road.Seeing them reminded me of the purple flowers in her new collar that I'd bought for her just last week.As I did with Jake, to sum up their life with us, to build my own \"rainbow\" I've given her a color.  Momma's color is purple. Purple represents wisdom, dignity,  devotion, peace, independence, and magic. Until the end, I could see the wisdom, and peace, trust and devotion in her eyes. The dignity she had through the pain of the cancer, her independent and kind nature, and the magic in the way she quickly stole all of our hearts.God-speed Mommaaaa, until we meet again on the other side. You are missed and will not be forgotten.    ~One last, and final photo~  As a postscript, a good friend also said good-bye to her cat named \"Pal\" yesterday. His time with her, was also much too short. But with her, he found all that he needed and more. Our candle, (sat here on a throw that she gave me), is lit to help Pal find his way to the Rainbow Bridge."},

Almost all of my spare time these days is being taken up with the dogs.  This past week began with our girl Bailey at the vet for x-rays and bloodwork and were given a diagnosis of a respiratory infection, and 2 antibiotics. As a new week begins, she's much better, her appetite has returned, and the cough that she had has all but disappeared. ~Bailey~Eva also had a turn at the vet this past week, and her latest blood work shows that her health, in particular, her kidneys continue to deteriorate.  The infection that we hoped was cleared up, has returned, so she's back on antibiotics.~Eva~I've asked Conventional Vet to contact the medical coordinator from the rescue about Eva's future health reports. I know hearing the test results are important.  But right now, hearing about how Eva's sodium, potassium, creatinine, albumin, calcium and protein levels continue to worsen is just too discouraging. I have accepted that Eva will never regain her health.  So, I'd rather focus on each day as it comes; making sure she's happy, in good spirits, finding something she'll want to eat, and making sure she's getting her IV fluids, supplements and medications and getting to her appointments with Holistic Vet.And going down the list of the girls, I have to mention the little milestone that its been just over a week since the arrival of Momma. I've enjoyed getting to know, this easy going girl. Usually we take intros very slow, and over a week we allow the new arrivals to have more and more freedom in the house, and with the other dogs.  But Momma is one of those dogs where that has not been necessary. She quickly became part of our big crowd, and has settled right in. All the dogs like her.~Momma & Todd~Chipper, our other foster boy for Lab Rescue, cannot get enough of her, and wherever Momma is, Chipper is not far behind.  I think he likes that there is another Lab around.

We hobbled (and I suffered) through it and it appears as the end of the week is in sight, the problems are finally resolved. And, I'll add that the loud humming we had on our land line is gone too. Thank-you Verizon. ~Todd, cares nothing about the internet, but he does care about the deer on his turf~The second news story is the arrival of a new addition from Lab Rescue, named Momma. Our taking another dog, because of the lovely Eva, was not for a single moment a part of the plan. But when I read the below e-mail from the foster home coordinator, how could I say no?Hi, Kim. I'm sorry to be writing to you to ask you if you might consider taking a hospice dog. Mama is a 10 year old black female. The owner contacted us because he took her into the vet to be euthanized because she has a huge mammary tumor and didn't want to spend any more money on her. His vet told him it was operable and to reach out to us. She has been seen and this tumor is a monster that has wrapped itself around the back leg, the lymph nodes, and it is not operable. Her whole leg is swollen. I don't think she has much time left. Maybe a few days or weeks. They put her on anti-inflammatories and pain killers. They also treated a horrific ear infection. They packed her ears. And she has a hole in her gum, can't remember the name of it. Anyway, she is the sweetest girl, of course, and she is always wagging her tail. I don't want her to spend more time at the vet. She arrived on Saturday. I asked them if she should go to Heaven now, but the vet said she is still happy and should enjoy whatever time she has being spoiled in a home. What are your thoughts? I'm sorry to impose on you like this. Thank you for listening. Momma arrived yesterday. She is a sweet and endearing girl and she has not stopped wagging her tail, or smiling since we met.  I look forward to the chance to get to know Momma, spoiling her, and saying good bye when it's time for her to go."},

But in the end, it's up to me to try and find something she'll find palatable and want to eat. But I keep striking out, but of course we'll keep trying.Turning the focus there's our temporary addition Chipper. He's been here since late June, and its been a bit of a challenge, but he's gaining confidence in himself, and isn't hiding as much as he was initially.  Because of this, when the foster home coordinator for the rescue returned from being out of town, we decided it was best if Chipper just stayed here ..... for now..... The only thing is, is that the rescue wants to make him available for adoption, and let another family work with him.  I don't think that he's ready for that step, because he's still so afraid of so many things.  But maybe Chipper's trust that he's building with us, is the same that we should have in someone else."},

Am I the only one who can remember when time seemed to stretch on forever, especially in the summertime?  Of course things have been steady and busy.  Eva continues to do pretty well.Her appetite has been pretty consistent for the past week, but the last couple of days, I've noticed that she's eating a little slower, and not finishing her meals. I'm hoping it's just the heat and not the nausea associated with the kidney disease returning.  I've given her the medication to try and head it off, just in case.Then there is our new TEMPORARY addition Chipper.  While the foster home coordinator has been out of town, we've been trying to decide what to to - Move him to a new foster home, or work with him through the transition to being part of a family. I'm on the fence.Chipper is making slow progress and is still very nervous and unsure. The progress is his going outside on his own without a leash.  This is only if it's a clear path to the door.  Chipper is truly torn between what he knows and what he wants to do.  Outside he's more confident and I'm glad that he has found a companion in our other little foster girl, Kirsten. If any dog needed  a friend, there's no doubt that it's Chipper.  Finally in my last post, some of you were surprised to read about the Amish puppy mills and their treatment of dogs; especially because their religion is all about peace. It's not my intention to put all Amish into the category of mistreating animals.  That would be totally unfair. My friend that has lived in Lancaster Pennsylvania for many years is not the only one that knows many of them to be truly kind, humorous, educated and reliable people. But the Amish that raise and breed dogs in deplorable conditions, (without electricity) and sell them do not consider them any different from the livestock that they raise on their farms and treat them that way. This is because to them, dogs are almost of no practical use for them except for hunting, especially since they don't produce anything edible, like milk, meat, etc.  I am not the only one who finds it heartbreaking and sad that this is how they perceive and consequently treat dogs like Chipper.

Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and counties in Ohio and even Indiana are home to thousands of breeding dogs that will and do spend their lives in puppy mills. The dogs in these Amish mills are treated like livestock. Many times, they don't even live that well.  At 9 years old, Chipper's breeding days and his past are now behind him. And through a series of events that I'm not really sure about, it took nearly a month for him to make it into the rescue.  His back legs have pressure sores from laying on the concrete and he had to have several teeth taken out. On the inside, Chipper is really fearful and afraid and will \"pancake\" when approached too quickly or he will try to get away from us. He won't walk on a leash, and is submissively urinating.  It's really very sad.So, how did Chipper make it to our house?  Well, Lab Rescue was boarding Chipper, but he was becoming more scared and withdrawn, and so the rescue asked if I'd take him for a few days. They were also concerned about his pressure sores not healing in the kennel, and his just needing a more quiet place to be.  Since we live pretty close to the kennel, it just made sense.  We're happy to welcome him, and give him the chance to feel safe.Finally, there's our girl Eva.  Your suggestions and advice about what to feed her, and your prayers and good vibes are appreciated more than you know. They are making a difference. Thank-you for sharing your thoughts and for caring about Eva.She ends a really busy week on a pretty good note. Eva returned to the vet on Friday to have her blood pressure checked, (still high) and recheck other renal values.  There hasn't been much change, and her infection is still not cleared up, so we've added another antibiotic until the culture is returned.~Blood pressure check at the vet~I've started a diary to keep track of when Eva eats, misses a meal, and receives fluids. But this weekend, she ate most of her meals and even though she's not totally herself, she was in pretty good spirits. ~Fluids again on Saturday~And so am I.  And Todd too!"},

The heavy doses of medication that are supposed to alleviate her nausea, aren't really working.Last week she had been eating pretty well, but by Monday morning I could see that her appetite was starting to wane a bit. Then she didn't eat, and the battle to get her to eat began again.  I try everything and anything to interest Eva in food.  Nothing is off limits since she has now decided she doesn't like the stinky-green-tripe.  I just hope, hope, hope, that maybe I'll find the one thing she'll eat for that one meal. That's all that matters.  Because the next meal, I can fix the exact same thing and Eva will decide that she doesn't want it. And so the next battle begins.....  With apprehension and trepidation I put Eva's bowl down in front of her.  I always keep it light and fun on the outside, giving her lots of of praise - But it's all an act. Inside I am praying and pleading and my heart is breaking as I hold my breath hoping that Eva will find what I have prepared for her a little bit appetizing and she'll eat a bite or two, or even better, the whole meal. When she does, we of course celebrate.  When she doesn't, I'll admit, I end up in tears. It's hard to not take it personal, because it really is.This morning Eva's meal consisted of some canned cat food and a cooked cut-up hot dog mixed in with her kibble.  As you can see in the photo below, she ate.  We all celebrated.~I even try different bowls for Eva's meals~Eva's kidney disease is a war that we sadly won't win in the end.  Eva's being given fluids here at home twice a week now. But this morning WE won this battle and for that, I'm thankful and grateful and it gives me hope.~IV Fluids at home for Eva now~"},

But the berries are just starting to ripen.  My worries about Eva (below) continued through the week.  She was taken back to the vet on Wednesday for IV fluids that did seem to help her feel better.  For more than a week we've had to put a leash on Eva to get her to go outside.  But by Friday, she was volunteering to go out on her own.Her appetite is much improved, with the help of the very-stinky-green-tripe most dogs can't resist.  But it's all good signs that she's continuing to feel better.Not wanting to venture outside much is our newest addition, Brandon.  He'll just stand at the door and watch us.He's a good natured fellow that follows me around the house.  He's fit in really well and has settled into his new life and routine. His appetite has also returned (thanks again to the very-stinky-green-tripe) and he'll wait with the others in the kitchen while I get their meals ready.With this, I'd say that we're ending the weekend in a good place.  And for Todd, that good place is on the front porch this evening."},

There has been some improvement, but not enough to make me feel like we're on firm footing with her. Your continued good vibes for Eva are very much appreciated.Eva's not feeling well did cause the Foster Home Coordinator for the rescue to hesitate in asking me about taking a new senior boy.  I will admit, I didn't hesitate at all, and agreed to welcome him into our home.  On Tuesday, Brandon arrived at Golden Pines. ~The trip Home~At more than 14 years old (his birthday is in January) Brandon was given up by his owner who was moving and couldn't (wouldn't??) take him.  Brandon came into the rescue in the spring, and has been in another foster home, so I don't know much about his past. But I will add here, that the girl that brought Brandon to me and was fostering him, is the same volunteer for the rescue that brought me Jake.  I've not seen her since then, and had forgotten it was her - It was good to catch up with her and tell her about Jake's life with us.  Was this a coincidence or the cosmos?  But going forward, aside from a few age related issues, Brandon has good general health. My camera batteries chose to die at the moment I started taking pictures of his meeting our crew.  So, take my word for it, he was really happy and excited and couldn't stop wagging his tail when he saw them.  So, he is getting along really well with his new packmates, and they like him too. It's hard not to like him. Brandon is an affectionate, easy going and gentle old soul.  I am enjoying getting to know him.  And I couldn't help but smile when I watched him try out several of the dog beds to find one he liked as he gets settled into his new life with us. Welcome Brandon!We're glad to have you as part of our lives!"},

But up until now, she's not been symptomatic so I'd felt that despite the changes she had in her tests, that she was \"okay.\"  Conventional Vet that sees her has not given me, or the medical coordinator for the rescue, a reason to think otherwise. We had not realized how wrong it has been to think that. Holistic Vet is very concerned about her latest lab results. Most recently because of an infection that Eva has, that Conventional Vet didn't seem too worried about. I'll fast forward through all my emotions about everything, and just say that a cocktail of medications and supplements have been added to Eva's meals with the hope that the lost ground can be regained.~Eva's cocktail of medications for each meal~I hope you'll send some good vibes for Eva that her appetite will return, and the good days of the past will return too."},

Charlie has an appointment with Holistic Vet on Thursday so we'll see where that takes us.Also going with me on Thursday will be the lovely Eva.  I'd like her to see Holistic Vet for an herbal console to discuss her kidney disease.  Like Charlie, the goal will be to also use herbs to try and stop its progression and keep her kidneys functioning the best we can. Happening on the outside there's our outdoor kitty, Gino.  He's no longer being confined and just as we hoped, he's made his home in the garage.  He'll roam a bit, but never goes too far. We're only having two little problems with him.  The first one is that he's pulling out his fur.  We know there are no little \"critters\" on him, so we're thinking it may be caused by stress from the short times he is confined.  If you have any ideas about what could be causing it, I hope you'll share them. And the second problem is that Gino attacks the dogs.  Yes, you read that right.  He attacks the dogs. Not a \"lets play\" attack, but a \"you're on my turf, I'm going to get you\" kind of attack. ~The innocent face of an attack-cat~This has the dogs like Cissy, a little bit, okay, a lot confused. Because she barely even looks at him. So, now that Gino is free to roam, we'll have to work on that relationship.~Cissy, confused about why Gino the cat doesn't like her~ Todd on the other hand, isn't interested in anything related to Gino. At least not at the moment.  For the past 2 days, he's been watching something under our barn.  We've looked several times and don't see anything. But apparently there's something that's keeping his attention.You'll recall that he's done this before, and nothing, not even the rain that is falling tonight can keep him away.  He is one determined and a very shaggie Scottie!"},

Most of the bruising and swelling  on his bottom is gone.  However, he's **hating** having to wear an e-collar and to keep the noses away, he's being confined when we're away.  The surgeon called on Thursday to let me know the results of the biopsy.  The tumor was cancer.  Sigh .... And, unfortunately, the surgeon wasn't able to get a clean margin when it was removed, and there were cells along the edge.  This means that the tumor will probably return. Sigh....again .....  The surgeon (and a good friend) is recommending a console with an oncologist. Which I may do.  I will definitely take him to see the Holistic Vet.  I know there are herbs that can be given that will suppress tumor growth, and would be worth trying.Another \"loss\" I haven't mentioned, is our foster girl Misty from Lab Rescue. She went to her forever home last week.  A really nice couple drove nearly 4 hours each way to come and meet Misty.  Misty loved them right away, in particular their 20ish year old special needs daughter, Joy. They were looking for a friend for Joy that she could walk with, and Misty truly fit the bill. The reports from them have all been good, and they are thrilled to have Misty as part of their family. Misty is enjoying long daily walks and swimming in a nearby pond.  I'll admit, I'd seriously thought of keeping Misty. But knowing that she's a star in her very own home, and a friend and companion to Joy, reminds me of why I shouldn't have. She is missed, but I couldn't be happier for the family and for Misty.I think Max may be happy about it too.  But then, he's always happy."},

The sun was shining, there was a slight breeze, and the temperature was about 10 degrees cooler than it had been in previous days. The soft-tinkle of the windchimes, the songs of the Cardinals, wrens, the eastern phoebe, and a few others were in the background as the hummingbirds buzzed around the feeder.  All that encompassed in the moment in time where I sat on the front porch with Jake and the Holistic Vet.~Jake at Selma Mansion, February 2018~All the good days, the fewer not so good days, the cheering Jake on, going for walks, helping him to his feet, and letting him set the pace for this chapter in his life, brought us to Thursday, 841 days from the day we first  met. His time with us had come full circle.  Even though Jake's spirit was still willing, (he even tried to get up to greet holistic vet when she came), his body had truly failed him. It was time for me to let go and to set Jake free from this life.~Jake, November 2017~In those tender and final moments with him, Holistic vet told me a story that I'll relate another time, but it suggests finding a color that sums up a life. Holistic Vet suggested that I find a color for Jake.  This color would be his and be a reminder of him and his life with us. All I could think of afterwards was the color red.~My very last picture I took of Jake~ I picked red because I'd noticed the red on the Ruby-throated Hummingbird that buzzed around the porch on Thursday.  Red for the color of Jake's collar and leash.  Red for the elbow pads that he wore to cushion his sore elbows. Red for his strength, courage, determination and of course the bond and the love I felt from him during our 841 days together.  Red for my heart that is broken at his no longer being with us.The very last verse of a poem by e.e.cummings that I heard for the first time today seemed to sum it up perfectly:here is the deepest secret nobody knows(here is the root of the root and the bud of the budand the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which growshigher than soul can hope or mind can hide)and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars aparti carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)Jake's heart will always be part of mine as he took a part of  mine when he left.

The drive to the surgery center was nearly an hour away and there was plenty to look at. We've had a lot of stormy and severe weather for more than a week.  Small streams like in the photo below are either at or near flood stage.  On Tuesday, lightning struck the ground next to a co-workers home. It found its way into her house and \"electrocuted\" everything that was plugged in.  Thankfully she and her family (and their dog) are all safe.  But it will be awhile before they can live in their home.  All this a reminder to take weather warnings seriously.Even though we were late arriving at the surgery center, Charlie and I still waited, a little nervously, for the technician to come and take him to the back.I'd been initially told that I could pickup Charlie at the end of the day and bring him home.  However, the surgeon called a couple of hours ago to discuss a few things with me, and said that he'll need to stay overnight.  I'm really disappointed he'll need to stay, but I know it's for the best.Here at home, there's plenty to keep my mind off of everything. Our boy Jake isn't doing well. While his spirit is still willing, his body is starting to fail because of the severe arthritis in his back.  Its been a struggle the last week to keep him going. I know that this all means that our time with Jake is coming to an end. But this is his journey and we will let him set the pace and enjoy the time we have.And even thought I'm trying to focus on Jake and the other dogs today.  I have to admit that my mind does wander back to Charlie, and now that it's after 5 PM, I wonder, when will the surgeon call me to tell me how everything has gone?   I'll bet Todd knows."},

The time alone gave me some needed down-time, and of course the time with my friend allowed me to recharge as well.  I really needed it.My friend has lived in Lancaster for more than 30 years, and so she knows all the best places to eat. And eat we did - A lot of the wrong things, and too much.Tomato pie with a rosemary scone. My friend also knows all the best nurseries.  A favorite of hers, and mine as well, is a Mennonite nursery that has a really good selection and the healthiest of plants. I also like them because they do not use neonic pesticides on bee-attractive plants like many (most?) of the big-box stores do. Now I just need to find the time to plant everything.All too soon, my dog-free weekend ended.  Of course I missed the dogs. But for the first time in a long time, I feel recharged and ready for what's ahead. At the top of that list will be Charlie's surgery which is scheduled for May 17th.But before I go back to work on Wednesday, tomorrow there is one last road trip. It's to return the lovely Molly who has been with us for a few days while her family has been out of town for a memorial service.  It's always nice to have her stay with us, and today happens to mark exactly one year since we met her for the first time.It doesn't seem possible and I have to wonder where does the time go?  I'll bet Todd doesn't even know.

In many ways, it seems like more time than that has passed since I last posted, but in other ways, it's doesn't. I hope it goes without saying that I've missed my blogging friends and that glimpse into your lives and world.I think I'll begin with a new arrival. Two weeks ago today we welcomed a new feline. He and 7 other cats were left behind when their owner moved.  The \"cat-coalition\" in our county trapped them, and now that they are all vetted, they are ready for new outdoor homes.It was really a chance meeting when I was dropping off our foster cat at the vets office who had been adopted. But I'm not sure how it happened. One moment I was saying how handsome \"Orangie\" was, and the next minute, the cat-coordinator had him packed up and was taking him to my van and she was telling me there was no adoption fee. Gino, as I've decided to call him, will be an outdoor cat. For about another month, he'll be crated in our garage with an outside view during the day, and free inside at night, to help connect to the new place he calls home.  He's a really nice cat, and I'm hopeful and hoping he'll want to stay around. Even though he doesn't really seem to like the dogs.I'll save some of the other news that has consumed me for another post, and tell you about Charlie.Two weeks ago he went to the groomer for his spring haircut. When I returned to pick him up, Irina (our Romanian groomer) told me about a lump she'd noticed on Charlie's bottom. She was quite concerned about it, and told me to be sure and have it checked out by our vet. Mobile vet came last week and confirmed that it was an anal-gland-tumor that is more than likely cancer. After seeing a surgeon, we've been told there are few options.  But surgery should be done.Before proceeding with any surgery, I felt like I should know if the cancer, which has a high probability of spreading, has metastasized anywhere else. The surgeon didn't do x-rays and so I returned to Mobile Vet to have them done. It was good news in that it doesn't appear to have spread, and Charlie's blood work looks pretty good for a dog of his respectable age (about 13).~Waiting for the surgeon~With this news, I've decided to move forward and do a palliative surgery to remove the single mass, and no lymph nodes even if the cancer has spread into them. I'm hoping that will give Charlie more time, and make him more comfortable. The holistic vet that sees Jake will also play a part in helping to manage Charlie's health.For several reasons, I've opted to not have the surgeon who did the console not do the surgery. Instead, I'll be contacting another place to see about getting it scheduled.  I'm hoping that \"this place\" will be able to take Charlie as a patient. When and if they do, I'll fill  you in on those details.Of course I'm worried about him. But I am optimistic about everything, and I feel like we have a good plan going forward. Charlie is feeling well and that really helps too. I'll end by sharing one of Charlie's x-rays. Mobile Vet commented when reviewing it that Charlie has a big heart. I told him I didn't need to see an x-ray to know that. Those of  you who are longtime readers of this blog, know that too.Thank-you all for stopping by.  I hope you all are doing well, and I so look forward to catching up on your news. ~Max catching up on his TV watching~"},

A friend from the rescue suggested that the more time they spent together, the more Retired Man would become committed to Jameson. It appears that she was right and I continue to hope that'll be the case.This brings me to the newest arrival, Kirsten.  She's settled in really nicely, and has not been a moment of trouble. She's a little timid, but a very gentle and quiet little thing (she's 30 pounds). She's like a little ghost as she follows us all over the house, always watching what we're doing, never imposing herself into anything, but keeping her distance until we acknowledge her.  You cannot help but like her.  This is why I told the foster home coordinator from the rescue that we would love to foster her.  The uncertainty about her left eye means that she'll need to see an opthamologist.  And since there is a specialty vet-care center nearby where she could be taken, it just seems to make sense to have her stay with us for now.~Kirsten, all settled in~Continuing to stay with us is for now is Misty.  Still no one in particular is interested in her.

The others came back inside, and as I always do, I left Todd outside for awhile. I loose track of time on my days off, so I'm not sure how much time passed. But when I went to bring Todd inside for his breakfast, there was a strange silence as I called him several times and he didn't come, and I didn't see him. It only took me a minute to see the blown open gate, and realize that Todd was gone!With my heart in my throat, I kept calling him, knowing that in the wide open space of the country where we live, Todd could be anywhere. I tried not to panic and continued calling for him.  And, just like that, there Todd was, standing on the far side of the yard, on the other side of the fence, his tail wagging and looking at me.I knew that Todd coming to me would have to be his idea. So I kept the mood light and kept talking to him as I quickly went inside for treats to bribe him with.  I opened the gate on the front porch, called him, showed him the treats, and he happily came to me.  I gave Todd the handful of treats, and there was celebration from both of us, and he quickly raced from one end to the other of the porch, stopping only for a moment to jump up on me, as I told him over and over what a good Scottie he was!  The celebration continued inside, as I overindulged and calmed my nerves and racing heart with early morning treats.I also gave thanks for this Scottie that has maybe, just maybe learned to come when called.  Providing of course, that there are treats involved."},

A diagnosis in July of last year of hemangiosarcoma left us with few options. The vet recommended letting him go that day, but I felt strongly that it wasn't his time. I was right. The last 8 months held almost all good days for him and I had my doubts that Bo had been given the correct diagnosis. But I continued on with the herbs to help control any internal bleeding, just in case.  However, in the last week or so, I began to notice changes in Bo, and I knew we were now fighting a battle that could not be won.Bo came to us in October of 2016 from what was described to me as a \"hell hole\" in Ohio. He wouldn't interact with us very much, but that all changed when this past spring I was inspired by another blogger, KB at Romping and Rolling in the Rockies who does nose-work with her girl, Shyla.  I found a beginner nose-class and enrolled Bo.It was a good experience for both of us, and while Bo may not have been the fastest, maybe in part due to his blindness, it connected him to us in a very unique way and changed him in ways I can't describe.With his sense of smell fully engaged, Bo became a frequent face around the dinner table, and was always underfoot in the kitchen. Of course we never minded and we always tossed a piece of whatever we were eating for him to find. It was easy to see that he enjoyed the search, because we'd see that quiet wag of his tail at those moments as he soaked up the praise we gave him for finding his treat.I have to admit, when I first met Bo, I saw him as a \"blind dog.\"  But I forgot that when I realized that he truly saw and trusted with his heart. Bo will always have a place all his own in what's left of mine.Godspeed Handsome Bo.

But I'll share just a few snowy scenes from our house on the second day of a new season Wednesday, March 21, 2018.~Jameson~~Jameson & Max~~Max & Rhett~~Charlie~~Rhett~For me, it was the perfect snow day! I think Snowman Todd agrees with me!If you found yourself in the middle of \"Winter Storm Toby\" I hope you had a good day too!"},
{"title": "It Was Max's Decision ", "date": "Sunday, March 18, 2018", "text": "I am playing the role of single-dog-parent while Carl is out of town for work.~Todd, playing role of Single-Scottie-Watchdog~In the quiet moments, I have managed to get a few of the \"to-do's\" off my list. One of two things at the top of that list had to do with Max. I mentioned in a post a couple of weeks ago about taking Max to meet someone who was interested in adopting him.~Max and Rhett~I'll start by saying that we weren't exactly hitting it off, but she looked good on paper. She is a single lady, about my age also with a Goldendoodle named Dex who is about the same age as Max.  I felt that we should at least meet and see where it went.  Did I mention that she and I weren't exactly clicking?  But this was about Max.  All went well initially.  Usually Max growls when meeting new dogs, but this time he didn't.  Was it a sign?  I let them all take a walk, but Max kept pulling on the lead to get back to me, and he pulled so hard he began coughing. I tried to get out of sight, but Max wasn't being fooled. They returned from a very brief walk with Dex's Mom telling me that Max needed a lot of work on the leash and she continued on and on about how he could use a gentle leader, how she loved a gentle leader, what a difference the gentle leader makes, and how she's always used a gentle leader, and Max should have one, at the very least a harness and a lot of training.  This went on and on and on (!!!). And, while I didn't agree with her about Max, I stood there quietly and listened.  I'll add here that Max walks nicely on a leash.I listened to Dex's Mom for as long as I could, trying to change the subject. But she didn't let up, and when she said that \"she knew to me that Max was just a foster dog\" for whatever reason, I couldn't take the criticism of Max any longer, and said to her exactly what I was thinking. And I have never done that to a hopeful adopter before. But I did this time. I put Max back into my van, shut the door, and told her among other things that I thought she was wrong about Max and how I felt about him. It left her a little speechless. I did feel (kind of) guilty because even now looking back at it, I guess she was just trying to be helpful. We stood there making polite small talk as I opened the door to my van hoping to change the direction of how the visit was going. But then someone came over to see the dogs, and she walked over to show Dex off.I looked at Max relaxing on the seat, and I guess it may sound silly, but I said to him that I didn't like Dex and His Mom but if he did, that was okay. However he needed to give me a sign if he didn't want to live with them, because I needed a good reason to tell her no, and I didn't have one.When Dex and His Mom came back, Max got out of my van, and Dex got too close, and Max snapped at him, not once, but twice. Dex was a little afraid of Max after that -- There was no recovering from that.  I guess Max was telling ME what HE thought.  ~Our opinion of meeting Dex and his Mom~We ended our meeting rather quickly.  And, the next day, Dex's Mom sent me the e-mail telling me she didn't think Max was a fit for she and Dex. A conclusion I'd already come to. Which takes me to where we are now with Max.I really thought that he would find another forever home. I really thought someone would come, and they would be wonderful and they'd make that connection with Max and see what a funny silly character he is. But my thoughts about that happening began to change with that disastrous meeting. I thought a lot about everything during our power outage a couple of weekends ago when I allowed Max on the bed to keep me warm during the night.~Max during the power outage~It all came down to that sometimes I really think that you get to pick a dog, other times, I think you are chosen.  I've decided that Max picked us.  So, I've told the rescue, sent in his adoption contract and fee, which makes it official.  Max FINALLY has a forever home. It has been quite a journey this past 19 months to get to this point. But I think it's how it should be.  But I think YOU already knew that!"},

The weather could not have been better and the dogs could not be in better spirits.The newest arrival to our household, Misty, has really settled in nicely. What a nice dog she is! Aside from some of Max's (usual) grouchiness, which she shys away from, she continues to get along with all the dogs. And when one of us arrives home, Misty is right with the crowd happily greeting us. As I said before and will keep saying, she's a true gem!The weekend did rob us of one hour of sleep with the change to daylight saving time. The only one in our household that won't have to do any adjusting to the new time is Cissy.  She has an inner clock that cannot be changed. The last time change 6 months ago meant that Cissy started barking at 4 AM.  Sometimes she wants to go outside, sometimes it's to let us know the water bowls are empty and she wants a drink.  Other times it seems that it's just to let us know it's time to get up. But then there are the times I can't help but wonder if it's her way of simply telling me that there's a rumbling in her stomach and she wants to be fed. Whatever it is, we've not been able to change her inner clock. So at least until the next time change when Cissy starts barking, it's at the time we usually get our day started.This is good news, because I think we're going to need all the help we can get in the morning until our inner clocks get used to daylight savings time.~Rhett~"},

And, just as I was getting ready for work, our lights went out here at home. I managed to get ready, and once at the office, our power went out there as well, so it became a short day which I was grateful for.~The wind blowing in Charlie's face~ I'd prepared for a possible power outage, and we were fine for the most part.  I'm very grateful that on Saturday, friends who were out of town gave us the use of their home to warm up, recharge our cell phones, my laptop and refill our water supply. Other friends had us over for a dinner which along with their company recharged our inner batteries.~Rhett our first night without power~Even though I learned that you cannot underestimate the value of a warm dog when you're cold, I'll admit that by Sunday morning I was getting irritable. I was really dreading the thought of another day and night of being without power, and being cold. However, utility trucks were spotted throughout our area, so I just hoped we'd be one of the lucky ones that would get our power restored. Thankfully we were, and by late Sunday afternoon as our house was warming up, I was on a little road-trip.Misty arrived at Golden Pines. Misty is 12-years old, and was given up by her family who were moving overseas and could not (would not??) take her with them.  She is a lovely dog with great manners, an easy going personality and has the approval of everyone at our house. We were told Misty didn't like small dogs, but we've been pleasantly surprised to find that she doesn't mind Todd at all and vice versa.Lab Rescue already has Misty listed for adoption, and I've a feeling that she probably won't be with us for very long.  But however long she is with us, we're enjoying getting to know this sweet little gem that needs no polish."},

But as this week comes to an end, I have my concerns that I could become another casualty of the flu. Time will tell.Last Thursday after 20 days with us, I returned the lovely Molly to her family. She was happy to see them, and we were sorry to see her go. She is a perfect house-guest, and our dogs all like her.~Molly seemingly confused and wondering where she was going?~With Molly's return home, she goes back to work as a therapy dog at the \"Memory Care Center\"  in the retirement community where Dick and Judy live. (A Memory Care Center is specifically for individuals living with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia who can't live on their own any longer). Molly's gentle personality make her perfect for the job.Along with me for the little road-trip to take Molly home, was Max. Max is still available for adoption through the rescue, and after we said good-bye to Molly, we met someone who was interested in meeting him. I will elaborate more in a future post, but will add a picture (below) of how Max and I felt about the visit.~Max's opinion of our visit~The day could have ended there, but I was asked to come into work afterwards to cover for our \"front desk girls\" in the afternoon who were both out. The doctor I work for lets me occasionally bring dogs into the office.  But since Max's coat is considered \"hypoallergenic\" and does well with allergy sufferers, he was allowed at the front desk with me.But the doctor asks that I not take the dogs into the operatories.A rule I follow.... Until no one is around.  Back on the homefront, Todd is much better. His limping comes and goes, and we're still working on those confining and no-jumping rules given to us by the vet two weeks ago.  Todd's not so good at following the rules either!There is still more news to post about, but I will end this post for now with a picture from the very short-lived show fall last weekend, and tell you the rest of our news in my next post.Thank-you for stopping by my blog.  Your friendships, visits and your comments mean a lot.~Rhett~"},

In fact, it often had the opposite effect, especially when it was something he felt strongly about; it drove him to work harder and to become better at whatever it was. A lesson to remember!   My friend has been a devoted Eddie Izzard fan for a very long time, and this was the second time I've gone with her to see him. And I have to admit that the show left me with an understanding of what's at the core of who Eddie Izzard is, and (Vicki) I’m becoming one of his devoted fans too.It was a late night, but it was an early start on Friday because it was Todd's turn to be the star.  He returned to the vet. ~A prisoner inside the mobile crate~The staples in his neck have been removed, but his back-leg is still an issue. On Wednesday he started crying and holding up his leg again after he'd been jumping up. So, I made sure the vet had enough time to take a second look. But of course at the vet, he didn't show any signs of limping or favoring that back-leg.  My thoughts about what it could be and the vets are totally different because she's unable to illicit any kind of response when she examines Todd.  But he's been put on an anti-inflammatory medication for two weeks, and if that doesn't help, we'll take it to the next level of taking x-rays to try and figure it out.  Until then we're to keep him crated, and not allow him to jump up.I think we'll be doing those x-rays."},

Priscilla came and loved Lucky, as did her Yellow Lab, Gabe.  At the end of their first week, aside from Lucky doing a little cat-chasing things have gone pretty well.The worst of times was after Lucky left.  Looking back at it, I think there was relief that Lucky was gone, leaving the dogs all feeling a bit frisky and playful. Whatever it was, Todd's Napoleon complex reared its head when Jameson stood over him to get him to play, and Todd took offense to it. I'm not sure exactly how it happened, but Todd ended up with a gash in his neck.  By Monday it seemed to be healing nicely, but there was some redness on the edge of the wound, and Todd was limping.  Off to the vet on Monday evening after work.The best is that the vet thought that Todd's wound will heal without any problems, but to make sure, she put 5 staples in it and put him on an antibiotic. I think he's looking a little bionic-frankensteinish.  .Todd's limp was a whole other topic. He didn't limp a single time at the vet. But he did when I got him home, and set him onto the ground. Thinking that it's a soft tissue injury we have put Todd on crate rest.There were a few other \"worst of times\" that I won't bore you with that included having to work the two days I'd scheduled to be off.  It left no spare time.~On my way to work~ However Saturday was a reminder of the best of times.  We celebrated two years with our boy Jake. Two years ago he left a county shelter where he'd been taken to be euthanized because he was unable to walk.  Jake is slower now than he was even a few months ago and needs more help getting to his feet than he did before. But even at about 14 years old now, he still has that same spark that the shelter saw and felt should have a chance.And speaking of spark - Long time readers will recall that when I first met Jake, he accompanied me to see Selma mansion. This 110 year old mansion is a pristine picture of the Old South. At the time I got Jake, Selma was a victim of time and severe neglect and vandalism. But like Jake, it was also \"rescued.\"  The new owners of Selma have spared no expense whatsoever in its rebirth. Two years later, work is still continuing, but it is once again a beautiful and stunning home.(click here to see for yourself on their Facebook page)And Selma, like Jake is full of spark and life on the inside and out.Finally, despite the really cold temps, Jake and I celebrated the milestone with an ice cream cone.  It was a good day that gave me a much needed reminder to remember the best of times and not to dwell on the worst. th"},

He has done pretty well settling in this past week. But unfortunately, he's developed separation anxiety. Thankfully it's limited to just his non-stop-barking and he's not become destructive.

We are enjoying having him here, and I look forward to helping him find his way to his new forever home.Sad news came on Friday afternoon as I was leaving work when I heard from the family that adopted Kingston from us, via Lab Rescue in August.  He has made his trip to the Rainbow Bridge after 5 short months with them.  I am truly heartbroken that they didn't have more time with him. But they felt, as do I, immense gratitude for the time they had him as part of their family. We have lit our candle to help him find his way and wish him god-speed until we see him again.~Kingston on the day we met in June 2017~The day didn't end there and it was Eva's turn at the vet. Kingston was lost because of total renal failure. We've been struggling to keep Eva's kidney's disease from progressing, so his loss reminds me to remain determined to do all we can for her. When these test results are returned, Eva will be seeing the holistic vet who will come up with a treatment plan for her.~Eva on her way home from the Vet~As we rounded the corner to Saturday there was no time to slow down.  It brought another unexpected and unplanned arrival from Lab Rescue. We have welcomed a 13 year old boy named Lucky.In November his owner had to enter a care facility and passed away in December. It's unknown where Lucky was during that time, but he ended up at a local shelter.  A kind shelter worker opened her home to Lucky during the holidays, and Lab Rescue was contacted. He's been moved several times since then, and this coming Saturday Lucky is supposed to meet what **might be** his new family. He panted and paced much of yesterday and last night as well and wouldn't eat or drink as he tried to find his place. So, we set up a crate for him this morning, and he settled down and slept much of the day.  The rest really helped and Lucky ate a small meal and drank water this evening and seems brighter and content. So now I am waiting to see a tail wag, just to be sure."},

He's only worried about the gangs of pillaging-marauding deer on our property.Thank-you all for your kind words as we welcomed Jameson to our household. The Coordinator for the rescue found a new foster home for him. By Thursday an initially very nervous and unsure Jameson was finding his footing, and was settling in. He was eating again, and had warmed up to Carl and my brother (he seems a little wary around men).  By Friday, many of my concerns about Jameson staying with us were starting to pass as he and Todd seem fine together. As we rounded the corner to Saturday morning, the day it was to be decided if he should stay or go to the new foster home, we decided that he could/should stay. After the work I know it took to find a new foster home for Jameson, the Coordinator from the rescue could not have been a better sounding-board in talking this through and more supportive of his staying until he finds his forever home.I think we can all agree that Jameson had been dealt a bad hand.  And I am looking forward to being part of his story and helping him find his way to his forever home."},

But a warming trend began on Monday bringing with it the slightest amount of snow.It also brought an unplanned arrival. Jameson arrived at Golden Pines.Jameson was taken to the vet in the town where I live to be euthanized because he snapped at his (former) owners baby who had crawled onto him. Young Vet was able to persuade the owner to release ownership of Jameson to his practice and allow them to find him a new home.  It didn't take long for Jameson to catch the attention of others in town, and soon he was popping up on local social media.  Even I was told about him, if that tells you anything.  Young Vets office found what they thought was a new home for Jameson. But they'd also contacted the rescue that I volunteer with who of course, agreed to take him if things didn't work out. On Monday, Jameson was returned to Young Vets office, and the rescue was called. The Coordinator for the rescue and I had already discussed Jameson, and I'd agreed to take him if needed. I was home from work on Monday morning, and so I was able to go and get him right away.~Jameson at Young Vets Office~We do not know too much about Jameson. But we do know he is about 8 years old, has arthritis and he's lived as a single dog for his entire life. I also know that he's was initially very nervous because he does not understand what has happened to him. Losing his first home, spending time at Young Vets office, going to another home, with two dogs who didn't like him, back to Young Vets office, and here to our house, it's totally understandable. This is why we've been giving him lots of time to adjust to our household, and have taken intros to everyone, including Todd, very,very slowly.So far, things are going pretty well. I do not know if Jameson will stay with us until he finds his forever home or not.  The Coordinator from the rescue and I are just letting Jameson settle in and regain his confidence. My instinct is telling me he would probably fare better in a single-dog-household.  Until all this is decided, thankfully the adaptability of Jameson being a Golden Retriever is showing and for now or forever, wherever he goes, Jameson is going to be just fine."},

Our boy Sunny was not feeling well last week.It began when he was reluctant to get to his feet.  He has been struggling to get up the 3 outside steps and has needed a boost to get onto the porch and inside. I gave him a pain medication to help with any discomfort. But instead of feeling better, Sunny only seemed worse the next morning and had a bit of a cough. I upped the pain medication and added another to help with inflammation. But by Thursday night he'd developed a huge (!!) hotspot on his hip made worse by the harness I'd put on him. Sunny still wouldn't get up without help, and the cough seemed worse.Thursday was a long night as I was awake most of it listening to Sunny's breathing and feeling extremely worried and guilty that I'd not contacted the vet. Mobile vet came on Friday making me feel better by saying that I was on the right track as far as how I was caring for Sunny. He added a couple of other medications to help get rid of the congestion and heal the hotspot.  As this week starts, don't let the photo below fool you, our camera shy Sunny is much brighter. He is getting up by himself, the cough has almost disappeared and his appetite is returning.I am hopeful it'll be a quiet week when I return to work on Wednesday. But Eva's paws say something else.  She was left outside a little too long with Todd, and is hard at work digging to Australia - I think she may have other plans about where the week is going.Todd, who had mud on his nose, certainly does!  All we can do is be like Jake (below) and see where it take us!~Jake~"},

Despite knowing in July when Georgie came to us as a \"hospice foster\" that this day was coming, it didn't make it any easier when it did. ~First photo from Lab Rescue of a boy they knew as Peanut Butter~I suppose that I always held onto the hope that the vets were wrong, and we'd be given more time than just 5 short months. The visible signs of the cancer were every where on his body (which is why he wore a shirt) and he had become paper-thin.~A photo of a first day with Georgie~George was still involved in the daily comings and goings and followed me every where I went.  He had a voracious appetite, and still loved playing ball.  This all made the decision to let him go, that much more difficult and that much sadder. ~Georgie in August~George was truly a dog that was full of heart and courage. But I knew this week when the cancer became visible around his eyes, and he was having trouble seeing, that it was his time. So, yesterday as I held his beautiful face in my hands, I told him all those things that come from the heart at those times, including that sadly, his journey and his battle that was so hard fought, was over. It was time for me to let go. It was time for him to leave us. It was time for him to rest. He quietly left this world for the next. ~George in October~God speed to another lost boy who found his way as a stray from a shelter in Charleston West Virginia over 250 miles away to Lab Rescue, and then to us.  I have no regrets other than the feeling of being \"cheated\" out of never being able to see Georgie as a healthy and vibrant Chocolate Lab - Which is why I look forward to seeing him that way when we meet again one day at the Rainbow Bridge. ~A last photo of George taken a week ago~Finally, thank-you all for stopping by and for sharing in the loss of Georgie.  I hope you'll bear with me as I regain my footing from all that has been happening on the home-front and mourn this loss.  I am down, but not out - So, until I regain that momentum, and to end on a positive note, here's a photo of Todd taken after a trip to the groomers on Thursday. What would I do without this character?"},
{"title": "Post Thanksgiving ", "date": "Sunday, November 26, 2017", "text": "It has been a relaxing and recharging 5+ days off work. Thanksgiving day could not have been any more enjoyable or relaxing - despite being in the kitchen for about half of it. The day ended on a good note with games and a friends invitation to come and enjoy dessert in their home.  My very talented friend is also a baker and made cookies for us to enjoy.~One of the cookies my friend made~ Friday brought more time for me to relax at home as Carl and my brother headed back to work.Saturday came much too quickly and before the vet appointment for Millie, came a much needed bath for her.  The girls at the shop know me, and since Millie is a TEMPORARY (yeah, temporary) foster dog, they donated her bath-time. She wasn't crazy about the bath, and was happy when it was over.Millie's vet visit went much as expected, and confirmed the diagnosis of the first vet.  Millie has six mammary tumors. Typically these tumors are cancerous and will metastasize into the chest.  X-rays were taken and thankfully her chest is clear. She also has another tumor on her bottom that is more than likely inoperable. Aspirates were taken and the results will be returned in about a week. At that time, a treatment plan for her will be discussed and decided. Until then, Millie is fine \"on hold\" here at our house.  She has fit in really well, and has quickly become part of the crowd. On Thanksgiving day she was having a great time barking at the deer with Todd and Eva.~Todd telling off the gangs of rogue deer~Millie is very gentle sweet and easy going and all the dogs like her.  She leaves the cat alone and has great house manners too.  Which begs that question, \"how did she end up as a stray?\"  It's anyone's guess. ~Millie leading the crowd~Speaking of guessing, can you guess why today Todd was once again wearing the \"cone of shame?\"  Yes, that annoying ear problem continues to be a bother.  He's still on the oral antibiotic and ear medication in hopes we can knock it out completely. He really doesn't like wearing that annoying e-collar (what dog does?) and is constantly trying to get it off.  I don't know why I bother putting it on him.  But he doesn't let it slow him down one bit - He's a Scottie after all!"},
{"title": "\"Old Lady\" MILLIE Arrives at Golden Pines ", "date": "Wednesday, November 22, 2017", "text": "~Cissy, planning an escape?~A short work week has brought a new arrival at Golden Pines.  On Monday I was contacted by the rescue and asked about helping to spring a senior girl from a shelter in a neighboring county from where I live.  Coincidentally, other \"confinement facilities\" are right next to the animal shelter.  Appropriate or ironic or both?But the timing worked perfectly. I had taken yesterday afternoon off work, and even though I had self-made plans, I was happy to have a good reason to change them.~An \"Old Lady\" in the shelter~Picked up as a stray, and named \"Old Lady\" by the shelter, because, they said, \"she's an old lady\" is estimated to be about 12 years old (not too old!).  This past Saturday, the shelter took her to the vet and she was diagnosed with cystitis, mammary tumors, and with two large tumors that the vet feels are inoperable, she has been given a \"cautious prognosis.\"  And with the time for her owners to come forward to claim her having passed, it is now time for Old Lady to start a new life.That new life began with a new name.  So, two old ladies talked about it on the hour drive home.  After trying on several names, we have settled on the name Millie.  It's a name she responds to, and it just seems to fit her.  ~Old Lady's response to the name Millie~Because Millie is not feeling well, intros to our crew have been very limited.  I'll do longer intros through the day today. The plan for Millie is for her to see the vet for a full check up, which is scheduled for Saturday. Once we have all of those test results, the coordinator for the rescue will look for another foster home for Millie - Because she can't stay here......can she?"},

I am not quite ready for it, but it is November and the cold and the frost had to come sometime.Todd being true to his Scottish heritage doesn't mind the chillier weather. He is dealing with a sore ear the last couple of days.  He's on medications for it, but is still scratching at it.  I put an e-collar on him (or the \"cone of shame!) to keep him from making it even more sore.So, I doubt that he's noticed the cooler temperatures today because he wants nothing more than to get that annoying e-collar off.But he's just daring any of the other dogs to make fun of him because he's wearing it!I wonder if that's what Rhett was doing?"},
{"title": "Perfectly Executed? ", "date": "Friday, November 10, 2017", "text": "Okay, it's been much too serious around here lately.  So, here's some random photos from the past week, that aren't the best - But there's a little bit of canine-mischief going on at our house.Lets start with Jake.  He started out by posing for a few photos. Afterwards, I started taking pictures of Georgie. when I turned around, he was up on his feet and headed at a pretty good pace towards the road.  I caught him before he got there.Not to be outdone, a few minutes later, Rhett (below) AKA, the escape artist, glanced over his shoulder as I was taking his picture, and did the same thing.  Carl was able to catch him.On the other side of the yard, there's Todd.  He's been out of the news lately but he has been totally consumed the last couple of days by what's around the corner of our barn.  A mouse maybe?When he's not standing innocently in a corner he's been randomly digging holes. At least we think it's him. He's a terrier, so it has to be him, right?  However that face really does speak innocence, doesn't it?  Is that possible with a Scottie?Not to be left out, our cat, the lovely Ms. Yellow knocked over a small container of dry food that was on the counter.  I caught her batting it off the counter and onto the waiting dogs below. Maybe she thinks I bought the wrong brand of cat food. Or maybe she was simply feeding the masses.But at least she didn't knock over this beautiful dessert a friend brought over for us. And speaking of eating.  It takes me to Rhett this morning. What have I been saying about his being a mischief maker? Rhett and Cissy are fed in the office. This morning I did as I always do, I set down Cissy's bowl, then Rhett's - Cissy for whatever reason followed me out of the office and somehow the door closed and when I went to open it, I realized it was locked, leaving Rhett alone...With two breakfasts.... By the time I got the door open, both bowls were (of course) empty. I can't say for sure, but I really thought I heard some chuckling coming from Rhett's side of the door.  But Cissy of course got another full breakfast.  In looking at it all, I'm pretty confident these were plots that were perfectly devised, planned and executed! ~Rhett~"},
{"title": "A Dilemma is Resolved", "date": "Sunday, November 5, 2017", "text": "~An almost picture of a bird setting on the limb~A couple of weeks ago I'd posted about a dilemma I was having with the rescue and our hospice foster boy, Georgie. I was bothered because only the end of life medical care was going to be provided for him. Without question, I totally supported, understood and respected why it was to be that way. Especially given his grim diagnosis. But, I'll spare you the saga of my inner struggle by skipping several chapters and go to nearly the end of this story....~Photo of Georgie in June~I thought I'd remembered that I'd seen in a chain of e-mails just after Georgie came to us, that he was being made available to someone else for a \"hospice adoption.\"  This couple decided against it, and nothing more was ever mentioned.  Looking back through my e-mails and to be sure, I decided to ask if I would be able to adopt him.~Georgie on Saturday~I made a phone call to my Lab Rescue contact to discuss it with her.  My Lab Rescue Contact has been involved in Georgie's rescue from a shelter in nowhere West Virginia from the very start.   A long time stray with a sun-bleached blonde-coat, Georgie arrived at the shelter very thin and sick. So of course, my Lab Rescue contact feels a very strong responsibility for him, and of course has only his best interest at heart. She could not have been more supportive, agreeable and happy about our wanting to adopt Georgie. Because he's considered \"hospice\" all of his adoption fees are (of course) waived.I know that time is not on our side with Georgie.  I know the battle with the mast cell tumors that cover most of his body, is not one that will be won. And of course I also know that I will never get to see him transformed into a totally healthy and vibrant Chocolate Lab.  But none of this matters. Because I also know without a doubt that I begin my day humbled and grateful to officially be a forever home, for this \"lost boy\" named Georgie."},
{"title": "The Mischief Maker", "date": "Sunday, October 29, 2017", "text": "Off to the vet on Thursday with Bailey and Rhett.  Bailey for a recheck of her eye pressure, and 'anomalies' found in her senior panel last month. It was all pretty good news for her, except for her ears which we'll recheck again in another week.Rhett got off pretty easy on that visit and ended up not being seen. He's been with us for a month now, and on the first, it'll be a month since he has had a seizure (knock on wood, please!!). So, Rhett needed to have blood tests done to check the levels of the medication (phenobarbital and zonisamide) that he takes for his epilepsy. But I totally forgot it was supposed to be 11 hours post medication, and that he also needed to fast beforehand. If they told me that detail, I totally forgot that too. ~At the gas station - Fill 'er up~So, back to the vet on Friday and on to work with me afterwards. I kept him in our breakroom with the door closed.  And, aside from his whining, which nearby patients and the doctor heard, he did pretty well, napping most of the time. ~Rhett, dreaming of mischief?~However, at the end of the work day, I went into the break-room, and panic immediately set in because Rhett was gone!  A co-worker had left a few minutes before and the door had not gotten locked, and Rhett had gone out into the outside stairway.  THANKFULLY I caught him just as he was headed down the 2nd flight of stairs.  I've decided that Rhett may be 12 years old, but he is proving to have the heart and spirit of a dog half his age, and is just as mischievous!    With his age and experience, I'm wondering if Rhett may be able to teach Todd a thing or two about mischief - Would that be possible?**Simba Update:I got a short e-mail from D&A this evening.  The subject line said \"Love This Boy\"They'd had family visiting this weekend., and the e-mail simply read:  Kim,He is was such a great host to his cousin pups. He is an absolute gem!!!We are so lucky to have him in our family!"},
{"title": "Excused Absence! ", "date": "Saturday, October 28, 2017", "text": "I know that I always say that it's a whirlwind at our house, but for more than a week, or the past month for that matter, it really has been.~The road to our house~When we turned the corner for last week, it brought Simba to the front. You'll recall that while \"couple number 2\" or  D&A liked Simba, we really needed a more formal visit for them to get to know him a bit better.  We also needed time to talk more about his specific needs, and most importantly of all, he needed to meet their nine free range chickens.After talking to several people, I was really worried that D&A may lose a chicken or two with Simba around.  So, on Sunday morning we put Simba to the test. What I thought was going to be a free-for-all for Simba to run after and terrorize the chickens, wasn't that at all. D&A were so prepared and ready with a temporary fence, and a good solid plan to keep their hens safe. In the end, none of them were harmed, and everyone was happy and I was enormously relieved!~Simba looking a little worried about the chicken-test~After nearly 2 hours of visiting with them, we decided we would all think about Simba coming to live with them. But I had nothing to think about.  During our visit I felt that they were all a good match for each other. He responded so well to D&A, and there was no doubt they were crazy about him. To not put any pressure on them, I sent an e-mail and only thanked them for letting us come to visit.  In return, later that evening, I received an e-mail outlining all their pros and cons in Simba coming to live with them, (there were more pros than cons) that included their saying they respected whatever I decided to do.I will admit, that I thought a lot about keeping Simba. How could I not?  But my friend who told me about him, reminded me that living with us, Simba could not be \"a star\" because we already have one or two.  Living with D&A means that he will be. She was right, and he deserves that chance to be a star.So, yesterday, Simba left us for his new forever home. Simba and Rhett (Chief?) got along really well and they enjoyed playing with one another.  Simba was great fun to have around, and there was no doubt that his energy brought in some needed fresh air to our quiet and kinda stale household. He is missed!!My first reports from D&A let me know there was a glitch that first night.Below is their e-mail;The first night was too lonely for him. He missed you, your house, your pups, etc.  But, night 2 went much better as we went to Plan B. (In fact we talked about having him in our room the first night, but decided that keeping his crate routine might be beneficial the first night.)  Rather than crating him, we gated him into our bedroom and he slept, all night, on the dog bed. In fact, we had to wake him up!  We’re really, really happy to have this bedroom routine in place, though, and now that he knows his bed, our room, etc., we’re confident he’ll settle in nicely as the old people go to bed.Yes. Boring he is not.  Right now, he is rolling his peanut butter kong around, part in play, part in finding new ways to wedge residual tasty out of it. Drool is involved.  Cats are coping well. Chickens will take more time, though, we visit the chicken yard regularly. I showed him an egg yesterday to help him understand why we want to keep the girls hale and hardy. Sadly, he was unimpressed.I sure feel the uplift of having him in our lives.  Truly.  All the walks have been as much for our benefit as his! And, he is such a happy lad to begin with, its infectious.It's not an over-the-top and glowing update singing his praises. But then, they are not an over the top couple either.  They are quiet, thoughtful, devoted and kind.  I think they're all settling in and will be just fine - Don't you think?Finally, here at home, we're all exhausted.But in having Simba around, the needs of the rest of our crew have been a little overlooked.  It's time to catch up and focus on them.  Bailey and Rhett were off to the vet on Thursday.~Rhett on our way to the vet~  In my next post, I'll update you on them.  Enjoy your Saturday!~Bailey at the vet~"},

{"title": "The Labs:  Breaking a Rule ", "date": "Thursday, October 12, 2017", "text": "I have to admit, that I'm a tiny bit superstitious.  I'd had a random thought that when I posted previously about \"the Labs\" I may be putting something out into the cosmos that would cause things to change.  And that's what happened.On Monday morning, Bo wasn't feeling well and he refused his breakfast. I've been giving him Yunnan Baiyao. (a Chinese herb used during the Vietnam war to stop bleeding by activating platelets, and helping to stop any internal hemorrhaging.)  There is what's called a \"rescue or emergency pill,\" so I gave him that, and by early afternoon he was feeling better. But Bo was still not himself. Knowing \"mobile vet\" was coming today, we've kept a close eye on him, and he seemed to be feeling a bit better.  Bo has been up and eating the last few days, but I can tell that he's not feeling well. Mobile Vet came this morning, and did a good exam and blood work that will be returned by tomorrow.  I've a feeling that the news will not be the best for Bo, but I'm trying to remain optimistic.Mobile Vet also took a look at Peanut Butter/Georgie for me. I have something to confess in doing this. Because last week I called the rescue and asked if I could take him to the vet to have the tumors looked at, and I was not given permission to have him seen.  I explained that my goal is to keep Georgie comfortable, because I know there is no cure for the cancer that he has.  I continued by telling the coordinator that I fully realized that it's a fine line to walk in his being considered hospice care and treating the cancerous tumors. But she still would not allow me to have him seen. I was told by the coordinator that if Georgie is uncomfortable, that perhaps it's time to consider letting him go.  I told her that I felt strongly that it's not yet time.  But I was still not given permission for him to be seen by a vet.  **I will just add here that I really try very hard to follow the guidelines and rules of the rescues we volunteer with.  But I really felt that Georgie needed to be seen by a vet. So, this is why I broke a rule and had him seen by a vet anyway.I so appreciated the time Mobile Vet took to explain to me all about Georgie's cancer. I really needed to talk to someone about my thoughts and concerns. Mobile Vet told me what to expect as the cancer progresses and what our care of him should be as well as what we've done right, and what we've done wrong. By the end of our visit, Mobile Vet had provided a good palliative plan going forward. This plan is completely and totally in line with the hospice care the rescue has asked me to provide for him, so I feel good about it. However, it also reminded me that our days with Georgie are limited.  But I have to hope that there are still many more good days ahead with him, and Bo too."},
{"title": "The Labs ", "date": "Sunday, October 8, 2017", "text": "Facebook reminded me that we have reached a 1 year anniversary with our boy Bo.  He's been doing pretty well these days and is up and around.  You'll recall that he finished his beginner nose-class at the start of summer.  I was going to enroll him in the advanced class, but I missed the deadline that came at the same time Josh left us.  Maybe I'll put him in the next one. But his sense of smell is totally engaged. Bo almost always comes to the table during mealtime and looks for a sample of whatever we're eating. I don't usually like dogs begging at the table, but for Bo, I make an exception. Overall, Bo seems to be feeling pretty well, (knock on wood!).  On Thursday \"mobile vet\" is coming, and we're going to repeat the blood work he had done a couple of months ago when he wasn't feeling well to see if there's any change.  I'm hoping there will be.The other Lab in our household that doesn't get mentioned much, is our chocolate lab, Peanut-butter, or Georgie as I call him.  He's been here since July, and to be honest, he was a hard dog to find a connection with. This has been for several reasons from his constant pacing inside and never settling down; probably because he's probably never lived inside before - And he wasn't housetrained, and he had a lot of \"digestive upset\" so that made it even worse. Georgie was so focused on food and ate everything and anything. I was really discouraged.Then one day, I asked the manager at the shop where I buy dog food his thoughts and he suggested raw goat's milk.  Almost immediately, everything changed when I started adding goat's milk to his breakfast. His stomach settled down, and so did he.  It has been easy to see that he is finally feeling better and seems content and happy. His eyes that never met mine, are looking at me and listening as I talk to him. We are finally connecting and for that that I've been grateful. His feeling better on the inside, has allowed me to focus more on Georgie's health on the outside. The mast cell tumors have gotten worse, especially on his back. He wears a shirt to keep them covered and clean. On Thursday, Georgie meets \"mobile vet\" who will give me his thoughts for any treatment that will not cure the cancer, but make him comfortable.~Georgie in early September~We all know that being comfortable is what it's all about."},
{"title": "On Our Ear! ", "date": "Thursday, October 5, 2017", "text": "We are officially a house hold that has been turned onto its ear!  All week long, I've gotten up about a half hour early to walk and try to wear out Simba before going to work and played with him when I've gotten home.  Its all gone pretty well as we get to know Simba as he settles into his new routine.  He likes the other dogs, and while some of the tempers are a little short with the kid, Simba takes the hint to leave them alone.  ~Simba taking a hint from Charlie!~My friend that I'd hoped would take Simba has decided not to.  We've been friends for more than 10 years, and I respect and understand that she would like a dog that's a bit more grown up, instead of a boy like Simba who has just barely turned a year old.Last evening Simba got to meet \"Couple #2\".  They live on a farm with more than 20 acres and the husband telecommutes from home.  He loves to hike the Appalachian Trail and he would like Simba to go with him. I know Simba would enjoy doing that. The only problem with Couple #2 is that they have free-range chickens.  Simba would have to learn to co-exist with them.  This could be a problem for the dog that has been chasing our cat.  So, Couple #2 is going out of town this coming week and when they return, we'll figure out a time to get together to see how Simba and the chickens get along.The other newcomer to our household,  Rhett, is doing pretty well.Unfortunately he did have a seizure on Sunday evening.  I have to admit, that I feel I may be partly to blame for it. I knew that rosemary extract found in dog (and cat) foods, can cause seizures. And I kept forgetting to check the ingredient list of the food I was giving him.  Sure enough, there is rosemary extract.  It's also in the treats that he's been getting.  On both lists, it is the next to the last ingredient, so there may not be much in the food or the treats.  However, I'm not taking any chances, and I've found another good quality food and treats without it.It goes without saying that Todd and the other dogs don't care about rosemary in their food. But they all like Rhett and so I've no doubt that they are all more than willing to take any of those treats that he can't have."},

I was given Simba with the promise to \"nice lady\" that I will make sure he has a good and permanent home. As you can guess, he's constant motion and hard to get a good picture of. But he's a really good-boy and it's hard not to like him, or laugh at his antics.  So far, Simba has gotten along with all the dogs. But because he's so excitable and life is a party, we have really limited his one on one interactions with Todd.Today a friend of mine is calling to talk to me about Simba.  She lost her Golden Retriever the same day that I lost Josh.  She and her husband are hoping for a new addition to their home but are looking for a pup that's a little older.My friend is someone I've known for more than 10 years.  She and her husband are both very dog savvy and kind and devoted dog-owners. They are both retired and would have the time for Simba and be a good home for him. So, we'll see what happens with this endearing counter-surfing, cat chasing new kid that has arrived at Golden Pines.Finally, thank-you all for your welcome to Rhett, who I think looks more like a \"Chief\"...  But I was able to get him into my vet on Friday morning, and he's now back on his seizure medications.  He is doing really well, and I'll admit that I am totally smitten by this boy who is showing what a kind, gentle and old soul he is."},

The previous owner got Rhett from a shelter and only had him about 6 months, Rhett had been in several homes before the previous owner - it seems like people didn’t know why he was having seizures and rather than trying to find out people gave him up.\"  Rhett has been given to the rescue because his last owner is expecting a baby, and is unable to pay for his needed medications.  Unfortunately, one of the medications he's been taking did not come with him.  I am hoping that until we are able to have Rhett seen by the vet, he'll be okay, and he won't have any seizures.~Eva meeting Rhett~On the flip side, our dogs like Rhett.Todd (below) of course has given his opinion of what he thinks about him...But my attempts to keep Rhett away from our dogs so he could settle in, didn't work.

From a distance I watched the two together, and I just didn't feel like they were connecting.  The rest of our nearly 2 hour visit fell flat. When we parted, I told her we'd talk in a couple of days. But I decided to not wait and I let her know that evening that I felt that she and Max were not a match. I never heard back from prospective adopter, so I'm not sure if she agreed or not.  If she did or didn't, it was my choice to make.

I was so sure it was poisonous and its sole mission was to kill me and the dogs.  I was insisting that Carl \"make it dead\" but he refused and scooped it up and tossed it into the neighboring field.  It turned out to be a (non-poisonous) baby rat-snake, so I guess that was okay. It was also okay that the rest of the week was quiet and uneventful.That just doesn't seem possible with Todd around."},

In the midst of Josh leaving us, another life was starting over.  On Sunday we welcomed a new addition named Bailey. ~Bailey on the ride home~Bailey is 12 years old, and she tragically and sadly lost her owner last week.  She and several other dogs were left without a place to go.  The fiancee of her former owner wanted Bailey to be happy, so she turned her over to the rescue. Bailey was a little nervous and tentative at first. But our dogs liked her right away and she's got the approval of Todd.It hasn't taken long for Bailey's big personality to emerge.  She's affectionate, will bark when she wants something or for reasons that I can't quite figure out yet.  As I write this, she's snoozing at my feet. I think these are all good signs!  I'm happy that this girl (with a spotted tongue) that once lived overseas for several years is settling in nicely in our little corner of Virginia."},
{"title": "Kindness ", "date": "Tuesday, September 12, 2017", "text": "~Josh, March 2011~Thank-you all for your kind words and sharing Josh's loss. I realized yesterday that Josh was not the oldest dog we've lost, but he was the one we had the longest. Josh was a gentle soul.  He was also a  \"pleaser\" by nature, and (usually) did what we asked of him. But yesterday was his day and a day that was totally out of my control. It was a humbling place to be. Josh peacefully passed away on the front porch that he loved before the vet would arrive.I wished I'd had another day off of work, but I didn't. It was a long day that ended with my having to go to the grocery store for a few things.  I really didn't want to go, but I had to, so I dragged myself there. I hurried inside, quickly got the few things I needed and rushed to the checkout. I got into a little longer line because I saw my favorite cashier.  I'm not sure when \"Nora\" became my favorite cashier.  But every time I have been in her line, I have heard her compliment every customer she interacts with. I’ve liked watching the people light up as she finds something positive to say about them.  She has such a refreshing attitude and I love chatting with her.  I think Nora is an example to follow.When it was my turn, she asked me how I was doing, noting that I was looking a \"little tired.\" I told her that I was doing okay, and that I was just really worn out.  And then, she asked me how our dogs were doing. As you can guess, the loss of Josh is still pretty raw and I'm not at a point where I can just blurt out what happened to him. So, I replied with my usual answer that \"the dogs were all present and accounted for when I left home this morning.\"  I think that Nora knew there was more to my answer. Because she stopped scanning my groceries, and said to me, \"I know just the thing you need,\" and she rushed away.  I'll admit that I was a little confused and embarrassed because there were other people standing in line in back of me.  But when Nora came back she had a little pot of bright yellow mums in her hand, and said to me, \"here's something to cheer you up, and they're on me!\"I know my mouth dropped open because I was so surprised by her unexpected kindness - And, through the sting of tears that have been so close to the surface all day, all I could say was \"thank-you\" over and over again.  I thought afterwards that I really hope Nora knows that her small gesture of kindness at a low moment made a difference, and is one I won't soon forget."},

He has a very dense, thick coat and doesn't shed, and it doesn't mat or tangle until it's really grown out. The groomer was looking over Charlie's coat as we were catching up and my heart sank when she found what looked like a dead flea - Now nothing strikes fear in my heart more than a flea, including a dead one because they may have friends - But the groomer called me after she'd bathed both Charlie and Todd to tell me that she found no live or dead fleas on either dog - But I still spent a couple of hours doing \"preventative\" cleaning just in case. I did have to grin that despite Charlie's thick and dense coat, the groomer had so easily (and hopefully!) found the one and only dead flea on him -- I guess that's how good she is! ~The look on the faces of Eva & Charlie made me laugh~Finally, Josh's bucket list got another check. With a 3 day weekend last week, Josh got to do something he's never done, and that was to go camping.  What's a better thing to do than sit around a camp-fire with good friends, toast marshmallows and enjoy a good s'more?  Well, okay, I enjoyed the s'more, and Josh enjoyed a marshmallow."},
{"title": "Lucky Dogs! ", "date": "Saturday, September 2, 2017", "text": "I rounded the corner to a long weekend with a planned day at the groomers for Todd and Charlie. Because of Todd's injury to his neck, I'd delayed his appointment to make sure everything is healed. I raced to get everyone fed wondering why I'd made their appointment for 9 AM?  I arrived just after nine o'clock to a surprised groomer, who was not expecting me - Until next week.  She graciously offered to take one of the dogs, but not both because she was working alone.  I opted to just wait until next week.  I don't think Charlie minded at all. I'm sure if I'd asked Todd, he would have agreed with Charlie. Later in the afternoon it was time to check something off Josh's bucket-list.  He has had a good and active life. In his younger days, he loved going for walks, sleeping on our bed and as you can see in the video below from 2012, chasing frisbee was a favorite game.All of this was possible because of a well funded rescue and a good and talented orthopedic surgeon. So, Josh's bucket-list began with a visit to Dr. W who did his surgeries in 2002. Dr. W said it wasn't very often that he got to see dogs that he did surgery on so long ago.  Dr. W is someone who doesn't like the spotlight.  But there was a smile and quiet pride about him during our visit, and he seemed quite pleased to see Josh again after all these years.  We feel very lucky to know Dr. W., who also did Max's surgery this past year.  And I think that Josh has been lucky too."},

I thought that it would have been a little darker, but it wasn't. Below is a picture I took of it. I also snapped a few of Todd, who was the only dog that wanted to be out with me.Broadcasts before the eclipse reminded all of us to not be so consumed with taking pictures, but to enjoy the experience, and notice your surroundings.  So, I did that.  I noticed that at the height of the eclipse, there was a call from one of our resident Barred Owls, how unusually quiet it was, and that the temperature fell about about 5 degrees.It's hard to top an eclipse at the start of the week, but we're going to give it a try.  The month of August marks a milestone as we celebrate 15 years with our boy Josh. There are no words to say how humbled and grateful I feel at being given this gift of time with him. And, for the last few months, I've been thinking about celebrating that time by doing a \"bucket list\" for Josh - It has been spurred on by a blog that another blogger shared on her Facebook page this week. The blog, Mr. Molson's Adventures was created when Molson, also a Golden Retriever, was diagnosed with cancer. Inspired by the memories the family made, with Josh's good health, I decided to wait no longer.  Our list isn't as adventurous as Molson's, but it is custom for Josh.  Yesterday we began with a little makeover to ready him for checking off that bucket-list!"},

That issue aside, it was easy to see that they are kind people who were so excited about Kingston and brought him toys and treats. Their black lab, Diesel, seemed to like Kingston too. So, after about an hour of talking and getting to know each other, I let Kingston go.  He never looked back when he jumped into the back of their car.  He rested his head on their dogs back and he was smiling and wagging his tail when I said good-bye.  My only regret, I didn't get any pictures.

This evening, I got the below e-mail from Judy:Dear Kim,  I think Molly must have read the playbook for how to win the perfect dog award..

I am glad to be back.To catch you up on a little of our news, I'll start with a good-bye we said to our foster-cat, Charlie. He'd had several inquiries from hopeful adopters, but because of the distance to come and meet him, people were deciding not to.  So, he was moved to another foster home closer to those who were interested in him.  We were crazy about Charlie, and this handsome cat is really missed!A road trip is planned tomorrow for Max.  As you know, he's been available for adoption since about the middle of June.  In all that time, there has not been any interest from anyone. The people that Max is meeting is the couple that adopted our foster girl last year named Bella.  You may remember her. ~Bella on her adoption-day~Sadly, after only being with her forever family for 9 months, Bella was diagnosed with bone cancer. They sent her to the Rainbow Bridge just a few short weeks later. Dick and Judy were of course, heartbroken by her loss, as was I. They are missing having a dog. Even before Bella's sad passing, I'd thought that Max would be a good fit for them.  However, they are hoping for a female Golden Retriever, not a Goldendoodle, and not a boy.  I understand and respect their preference.  But at the urging from their son, a friend, and me too, they've agreed to meet Max, just to see if there is a connection.   And, even though Dick and Judy are hoping to adopt a younger girl, they know that life gives no guarantees, so they would like to meet Molly, who at 12 years old, is also available for adoption.  I have a feeling it will be Molly that they choose, but you never know.  Either one of them will be lucky to have Dick and Judy as their forever family Finally, the left-behinders, like Todd are doing well.  He got more mail than I did one day which was a card from the Emergency Vet.He's all healed from his rumble with the wild lifeand soon he'll be rumbling with the dog-groomer!**On a personal note, my grateful thanks to you for your continued friendship and for stopping by.  I have really missed blogging and I look forward to catching up on your news."},

With the return of his appetite, I took a chance and took him off the medications that the vet had him on for nausea. When Todd was seeing the vet she seemed a bit vague about Bo's cancer diagnosis.  But she seems pretty sure that there's a mass in his abdomen. I am not sure what to think. I've had his records sent to the holistic vet and I'll talk with her about everything when she comes on Thursday to see Jake.Speaking of Jake. He went with me and a good friend on Thursday when I made my annual pilgrimage to see the sunflower fields in Maryland.

{"title": "The Not So Good News", "date": "Saturday, July 22, 2017", "text": "Hello Blogging Friends!  If you're looking for good news and a feel good post, you may want to move along, there's not much good news for us this week - However my hydrangeas are lovely this year...It began when I got home from work on Monday. Just as I approached our driveway, a black bear was crossing on the other side towards our house.  In the 10 years we've lived here, I've never seen one, and looking back at it, maybe it was omen of what was to come - Because as the yard came into view, there was Bo, (our Black Lab) laying stretched out in the yard. He'd been fine in the morning, and Carl said there was nothing unusual about his behavior when he let him outside when he got home from work. But now Bo was almost totally non-responsive, and he'd gotten sick. We carried him back inside and put him back onto his bed.  He wanted nothing to drink or eat.  It was a mostly sleepless night with his vomiting several times. At the vet on Tuesday morning blood work showed some anomalies, and x-rays showed a  mass in his abdomen. More tests would be more conclusive but the diagnosis of cancer will not change.Our vet, Dr. K recommended Bo be sent to the Rainbow Bridge that day, telling me that there was nothing that could be done.  I wasn't ready to make that decision for him, and so I opted to wait, hoping that with medications, he'd feel better, and it would give us, especially me, more time. To add insult to an already injured heart, when I got home on Tuesday, Todd came to me, covered in blood.  All alone outside, we could only conclude that he'd  gone a round or two with something that had gotten into the yard.  Fast forward through an emotional several hours at the Animal ER and all that goes with that, by around 11 o'clock there was the report that he was going to be okay.  There are several puncture wounds and scratches on his neck. The ER vet wanted to put a drain in his neck, but I knew he'd not tolerate that. So, we opted for my being able to keep it clean and covered.  We tumbled into bed in the early morning hours and I was glad the dogs let me sleep in until around 10 o'clock.~Todd - The day after~Wednesday was supposed to be my catch-up day, but since they say things come in 3's, there had to be one more thing added to our plates, right?   This time it was me.  I will spare you all the details, and just say that when you're at a doctor appointment and he says to you, \"I think this needs to be taken care of right away,\" since you're there, you probably should, so I had a \"little surgery\" Nothing worth telling about, and I'm fine (really!).The anesthetic and change of focus was like a restart for Thursday and I was alert enough to see the intruder, Punxsutawney Phil Junior run across the yard and disappear behind some flowers by the barn that borders the inside of the yard. We found the hole it had dug, filled it in, and covered it up - And as the picture below shows, it found its way out on the other side. As we rounded the corner to Friday, Bo was more like himself.  His appetite has mostly returned, and he's alert, taking treats, etc.  I'd say he's at about 85%.  We will take each day as it comes, and as we always do, we will let him set his own pace.Todd, is back on patrol.He'll return to the vet this morning for a recheck of his wounds.Life somehow goes on at Golden Pines."},

A few minutes later, I let Todd back in. But he was a dog with a grudge.  Because when he saw Kingston he went after him again.  Poor Kingston.  He had no idea what he'd done. Today all is forgiven.

As he moved to a new foster home, we are cheering him on to find that perfect forever home he so deserves!Backing up to Thursday, I received a call from Lab Rescue.  It was to arrange the timing of Duke's departure on Friday, and to discuss and arrange the arrival of another pup from Lab Rescue named Peanut Butter. With such a distinct name, I'd remembered posts about him on Lab Rescue's Facebook page. He was found as a stray around Beckley West Virginia, did his shelter time and made a nearly 6 hour trip to this part of Virginia. After receiving vet care, lots of love and putting on more than 10 much needed pounds, he was ready this past week for surgery to remove a large tumor on his neck. However, at the last minute, just prior to the surgery, the vet recommended not to go forward with it.  It was discovered that along with the tumor on his neck, that he has several other mast cell tumors on his body.There will be no surgery for Peanut Butter.  Instead, he will be spending the remainder of his life with us, in hospice care.  He's got great energy and is on a pretty good cocktail of medications that we hope will help prolong his days. And we will do our best to make those days the best ones for Peanut Butter, who loves a good game of ball!"},

It came about because he will take a mouthful of food from his bowl, walk off with it, put it down, eat it, and come back for the next bite.  As you can guess, at our house, that doesn't work.  Even though the dogs don't try to steal food from one another while they're eating, (an enforced rule), a bowl that's left unattended is fair game for whoever gets to it first.  And what is left, is usually eaten pretty quickly. I'm not sure how many meals Kingston didn't get to enjoy before I noticed what he was doing.  I guess all that matters is that he's enjoying his entire meal now.We ended the week with Kingston at the vet for follow up blood work to check his kidney's.  There is some improvement, but not much. I'm waiting to hear back from Lab Rescue on how they'd like to proceed, and what the results all meant. Speaking of Lab Rescue, I did hear from them prior to Kingston's appointment.  With July 4th it has meant that boarding space is a premium and unavailable at most places.  They were looking for a place to stash a dog for the weekend.  This has brought us ten-year-old Duke.  He was given up by his family who no longer wanted him. He is another really nice boy, who is pretty confused about what's happened to him.  He'll be with us until about Wednesday. With the holiday falling on a Tuesday it has left some people like me with only one day off, making it more difficult to carve out a three or four day weekend without expending precious vacation days. So I have to work on Monday. But I am not going to complain, I just enjoy any day I have off."},

For several reasons, this one had me a little more unsettled. But I trusted the cosmos and of course the vet to take care of her and she did just fine. By 6:30 that evening, I was picking up a very sleepy Molly, who ended up having two teeth taken out. Showing her true Golden Retriever personality, she's not complained at all about any pain or discomfort and has been a very compliant post-op patient.We rounded the corner at the end of the week with a couple of inquiries about our foster-kitty, Charlie.  I'd received a couple of e-mails in which the subject line read \"Meet Your Match.\"  I'd seen the e-mails, and not looking at who they were from, I simply deleted them, thinking they were spam; wouldn't you have thought that too?   Turns out, they were inquiries about Charlie.  After several apologies to the SPCA, and a few phone calls to respond to those e-mails, Charlie was taken and introduced to a retired couple that on paper were perfect for him,  He didn't like them.  Charlie is such a cat. This takes us to Max, who as you know is also available for adoption.  I've heard from no one interested in him.  I'll admit that I'm a little surprised.  But there's no rush. I know that like Charlie, Max will \"meet his match\" soon enough. And speaking of \"meeting your match....\"  Today is a bit of a celebration.  Six years ago today, Todd arrived at Golden Pines.

However, even though she was crated most of the time, she still put our household onto its ear, and threw off our schedule.  We all know, it's just what puppies do.

So, Kingston's tail will be bandaged for a few more days.Kingston is getting along well with our crew.  Of course Todd did let him know to keep a respectable distance.  Kingston seems to respect that. Thankfully. And thankfully, I think Kingston is going to be okay here with us.    And lets not forget that via the SPCA, Cookie, our little boarder that will be here until Tuesday. After feeding her and getting her all settled into her crate last evening, Cookie quickly let us know her disapproval of the accommodations.  That disapproval continued through the evening.  At bedtime we took her into the bedroom, and put her into another crate.  It was also not to her liking.  But she slept for a couple of hours before whining, for what I think was to be taken out, which I did half-asleep 2-3 more times overnight.Cookie has been napping most of the day.

I've read a couple of reasons why he was taken there, from the family moving to not enough time.  Maybe it was both.  But he has markers of early kidney disease, and is on a special food.  So, Kingston will arrive later this afternoon.  I guess the bath for Jake and Josh can be put off for a little while.  Then last evening I got a call from the SPCA.  They need a TEMPORARY foster home until Tuesday for a puppy who is having surgery today. She has a herniated umbilical cord and will also be spayed.  \"Cookie\" (don't you love that name?) will need to be crated, and kept quiet while she heals.  One of the directors for the SPCA is her \"forever home\" so she has a bright future ahead of her.I think we have a busy \"future weekend\" ahead of us - there won't be much time to sit on the front porch,~Cissy~Or go on any \"tours.\" --The above sign was in our town-square that gave me and several others in town a good grin before it was removed by the \"art\" committee --But I think it's going to be a good and long weekend!"},

Despite getting four messages this week about it from the rescue, finally the words came to complete his write up for their website.  I know I was well past due getting it to them.  But I have to say, that in the end, it only irritated me to the point where it became a distraction, and it didn't get the words to come or the write up done any faster.  On the flip side, I'll admit to having been on the fence about keeping Max.  After nearly a year with us, how could we not be thinking about keeping him?  He's a silly, playful clown, that is smart, loyal and devoted.  He can also be a little grouchy towards the other dogs, especially Bo, who I think he sees as a total \"subordinate\" in the pack.  But after discussing it, we decided to let fate decide where Max will go.  I have a time limit in mind for our search, so lets roll the dice and see what the cosmos will bring.Finally the end of our week brought a graduation of sorts.  Bo finished his \"Beginner Nose Class.\"I do have to say, that he wasn't as fast at finding the \"scent\" as Cocoa the Poodle ...or as enthusiastic as Devon the Papillon.And, I'll admit that I was discouraged when he wasn't. But the instructor and others in the class reminded me that Bo's reasons for being there were different than theirs - I took him to help engage and work his mind, have new experiences and try to get him out of his shell. Everyone in the class always cheered for Bo when he found \"the scent\" and everyone always gave him lots of attention.  I know that because of his past life, Bo will never be a \"normal bouncy Lab\" and will always be a bit withdrawn.  But I'm still proud of Bo, and I'm glad we took the class.  Who knows, maybe in the fall we'll take another one.Maybe I should take Todd too?  He seems to be good at finding things!Enjoy your Sunday!"},

Oldest Brother is great fun, and he spent a couple of days with us, and then we were off on a road-trip to Kentucky. Our trip to Kentucky was to help our youngest brother pack up all of his things to move here to Virginia.  Youngest Brother had been living alone (with Tubby the cat) in a small apartment since the passing of another brother and the sale of our parents home two years ago. With no one to rely on if needed in Kentucky, and with encouragement from myself, Oldest Brother, and Retired Brother, (who also lives here in Virginia), he decided to listen to his siblings, take a chance and come here. ~Packing up for the next chapter~ We have more than enough room, and with his new job not that far from us, he'll live with us for now.  Even though Youngest Brother is almost 15 years younger than me, we have always been close,  He and Carl get along really well too, which is why he's spent many vacations, etc., with us over the years.  My brothers and I, and of course Youngest Brother all agree that for him, living near family has more benefits than living alone more than 500 miles away.~A stop on our way back to Virginia~On the flip-side, there's our new arrival, Molly.  She's getting along very well with her new pack-mates, and is settling into her new routine.  I've taken to calling her \"Molly Mouse\" because of her smaller size, and because she's so quiet. I often find myself looking for her.  Outside, there are tail wags and she happily follows me around the yard. Her shyness is still evident, especially around Youngest Brother and Carl.  I have to wonder what her relationship has been with men that has made her hesitant and reluctant to be around them. Whatever has happened to make her feel that way, I'm hopeful we can figure it all out as we get to know this sweet little girl."},

Today I'd like to mark a new arrival and introduce you to Molly. At 12 years old, she was turned over to the rescue along with another Golden named Kacee, who is 5 years old.  Both girls were given up because their owner no longer had the time for them because of additional work hours, and they wanted what was best for them both.  If possible, rescues will keep dogs that are bonded to one another, together.  However, Molly and Kacee were not and Kacee has gone to another foster home. Because I was out of town, Molly had to spend a couple of days in boarding where unfortunately she developed stress colitis.  When I picked her up yesterday afternoon, she went right past me and to the door, letting us all know she was ready to leave!When I got home with Molly, it was easy to see that she was nervous and unsure about what was happening to her.  I wanted to give her the chance to relax and so I let the other dogs look at her from the other side of the fence. Molly's previous owners said that she is a bit shy by nature.  This meant that she wasn't very interested in the other dogs. But they are of course, very interested in her.Of course Todd doesn't care or know anything about shyness, he really wanted to get to know the new girl. Below is his reaction when she didn't notice him....But Todd is right,  We are all looking forward to getting to know Molly ...and being part of her story. Welcome to Golden Pines, Molly!"},

This past week, we had a new arrival.  This very special newcomer is the reason why I felt like we couldn't keep our foster-kitty, Mo.  His name is Tubby (after Tubby Smith, a former UK basketball coach)  and he's about 14 years old. ~Meet Tubby!~Tubby is considered \"family\" because he used to belong to my Mother.  Since my Mom passed, Tubby has been cared for by my youngest brother that lives in Kentucky. Changes in his life have brought Tubby to live with us. Tubby has never really been around dogs, so we were concerned that he might not get along with them.  It turns out, Tubby isn't bothered the least bit by them. On the feline side, he and Ms. Yellow are learning to ignore one another. And he has claimed a favorite spot, on top of the kitchen cabinets, as his own.  All in all, I'm really pleased that this family member is settling into his new life with us so well.Tubby is the precursor to a few other changes that I'll tell you about as they occur.  One change that we had this weekend was Max.  He was groomed.  I didn't take him to our \"regular\" groomer, but one that I knew would take her time and be careful with Max because of his knees.  What I didn't know is that she would sheer him like a sheep!  With cold temps the last couple of days, it had Max shivering so I put a shirt on him to keep him warm.  Poor Max....Finally, I want to thank-you all for your kind and supportive comments during this \"unfortunate incident\" with Todd.  I saw my friend's daughter today, and thankfully her finger has healed nicely.

They also needed to let me know that Todd is to be confined at home for 10 days.The agent from the Health Department will return next week.  He'll verify that Todd is still healthy and at that time, this whole unfortunate bite-incident should hopefully be behind us.

{"title": "\"T\" is for Todd and Trouble! ", "date": "Monday, April 17, 2017", "text": "Well, what I'd hoped would be a quiet Easter weekend at home alone, didn't end up that way. ~An Easter gift from a talented friend~I'll preface this by saying that those of you with Scotties, know that they are a bold and a dignified dog. And they can also be territorial - Todd is no exception to this.  He defends his territory against everything and anything.  When people come to see us, and he's outside he is barking and jumping up at the fence.  He does settle down a few minutes after their arrival.  But I always warn people to keep their hands away from him.So, when a friend stopped by on Saturday with her adult daughter and the dogs were outside, she asked if she could pet them.  I told her \"NO!\" that Todd would probably bite her.  I even warned her a second time, and she did listen to my warning.  But there was a quilt laying over the fence, and as Todd was jumping up, he was grabbing it, and so my friends daughter reached over and pulled it back - And can you guess what happened next?  Yes... At the moment she pulled the quilt back, Todd jumped up and he bit her, caught her \"pinkie\", whatever you say happened, it doesn't matter, the end result is the same, her finger was bloodied.  My heart sank when I saw it.  Inside we cleaned it off, and agreed that it needed medical attention.I knew what this meant.  Anytime you need medical attention for a dog-bite, nip or whatever, a report is always filed in the county with Animal Control. I mentioned this to my friend and her daughter to let them know what to expect, and they told me they'd try to keep our names off of any report.  I appreciated they're saying that they would do that, but I knew that it may not be possible.  **And I'll just add here, that I would and do take full responsibility for anything our dogs do, no matter what or even who it may be.  And of course I offered to pay all medical expenses for my friend's daughter, but they graciously refused.  They have been very understanding, nice, etc.,  about it, and admit that a mistake was made in moving the quilt.After my friend and her daughter left, the reality and what the consequences may be started to swirl in my mind as the \"what if's\" started to consume me.  A phone call a couple of hours later from my friend telling me that no stitches were needed, and her daughter was just fine was a relief to hear as well as her telling me that they'd not provided our information. But another phone call from the Sheriff's Office in our county would come later. They had no choice but to file a bite-report against Todd.  My phone call from a deputy would come soon after and he told me that the entire incident did not meet the criteria of what a \"dangerous dog\" is defined as.  Todd is licensed in the county, up to date with vaccines, and the Deputy confirmed all of his information.  The case is (thankfully) considered closed.  But I've taken this very seriously and as a wake-up-call to not be so complacent when strangers are around because Todd does now have a \"criminal record.\" And I know full well that IF there is a next time, we may not get off so easily now that we know that Todd's bite can be just as bad as his bark!"},

Our last week ended with Eva and what I'm sure was probably with the help of Todd, \"making dead\" a poor rabbit that somehow got into our yard.  In the nearly 10 years we've lived here, aside from the moles, only one other critter has found its way into the fenced part of our yard. In the early morning darkness, I thought that Eva had a towel when she was doing a very proud \"look-at-me, look-what I've got, woo-hoo!!!\" prance and dance around the yard with Todd in hot pursuit.  Poor bunny.  Poor me for having to get it away from her - Eva didn't give it up easily, not even with a bribe of treats could convince her - I had to pry it out of her mouth.  I buried it in our woods. ~Hunting partners - Todd and Eva~Mobile Vet came to meet Bo and do an exam on Friday.  He received a good report.  Mobile Vet did confirm something that we already knew, and that's that Bo hears very little if at all.  This now has me doing a bit of research to try and find things to get him engaged in life, and to help stimulate his senses.  Any thoughts you have, I'd be interested in hearing.  Josh also had an exam.  My concerns remain about his arthritis and being able to get up on his own, which he can't do very well.  He is on as high of dose of supplements and medications as he can be, so there's not much more we can do. But he's happy, and part of the activity of the day and that's what matters.Also receiving a good report card was Cissy.

But I had to be back to work on Tuesday. I brought back 4 exhausted dogs that slept the whole way home.I was just barely home on Monday when I got a call from the SPCA about our foster-kitty Mo that left us about 3 weeks ago.  He and the cat that he was partnered with were not getting along with the dogs in their new home, and the family wanted to return them both.  I was asked if we would take Mo back. Of course I agreed, and I picked him up on Tuesday evening.  I opened the crate, and with no hesitation at all, and a quick sniff from the dogs, Mo was home.  This is the second time a family hasn't worked for Mo, so I'm wondering if fate is trying to tell us that he belongs here with us.   And speaking of fate....  Before I left on my trip I'd been discussing Jake with the rescue.  He's been available for adoption on the website for about a year.  At about 13 years old, I felt that he should be taken off the \"available-dog-list\" and stay with us.  The rescue was unwilling to let Jake remain a \"foster dog.\"  I talked to Carl about it, and let the rescue know that we would go ahead and adopt Jake.  I know what you're thinking..... Given how much Jake means to us, we should have decided to do that long before now.  I'm regretting not doing that.  Because literally, out of nowhere a couple applied to adopt Jake.  To say that I was stunned is an understatement. A whole range of emotions followed because even though the policy of the rescue is to allow foster homes to decide who adopts their foster dogs. I was asked (by the rescue) to put our adopting Jake aside and seriously consider them.  The reasons for their suggestion was because Jake could receive more individual attention than we're able to give him because we're a multi-dog household. For whatever reason, that now has me doubting myself and the care I can and do provide for him, and the other dogs too.I'd hoped when I was in Tennessee that maybe I'd feel better about the situation, and perhaps letting go of Jake.  And I'd hoped meeting them yesterday would give me that moment of clarity and I would know what to do.  However it didn't.  They are a nice couple and certainly more than able to give Jake a good home.  But just where he will spend the rest of his life, and who will write the final chapter of his life, right now, is a really tough mystery to solve."},

With cool temps and high winds, my friend wanted to keep this new family warm; which was why she was asking her local friends for a heat lamp to use overnight.  I just happen to have one, and since she lives nearby, I took it over to my friend.

{"title": "Jake and Selma Mansion - One Year Rescued!", "date": "Saturday, February 4, 2017", "text": "Can you believe that we have just passed the one year mark on February 3, 2016 when we first met Jake? ~The first day we met Jake~Some of you may remember that at the time I'd compared Jake to nearby Selma mansion (a historic property and former plantation in Loudoun County, Virginia, that is best known as the residence of Armistead Thomson Mason, a Senator from Virginia 1816 - 1817).  I'd just read an article on the abandoned mansion and was taken by its history and story.  So much so that I'd stopped by to see it myself and taken pictures. Jake was with me that day. ~Jake February 2016~It was so sad to see this once grand home standing alone and in ruins; a victim of vandals, and so much neglect.  I really hoped that like Jake, Selma would get the chance to be rescued too.  In March it was announced that Selma had been purchased by a local couple who plan to make it their family home.I had no idea what the next year would bring for Jake. Jake had been taken to the shelter to be euthanized by his owner because he was unable to walk. The shelter thought he had some good days left, and asked if he could be turned over to a rescue.  Thankfully, they agreed.  Our trip to the vet that day in February was when he was given the diagnosis of spondylosis.~February 2016 - Coming home from the vet~Fast forward through what has been a good year for Jake!  The spondylosis is progressing, and Jake sometimes needs help getting to his feet, but cold laser therapy and acupuncture really help with that. And even though he's on the lowest possible dose, the continual use of prednisone (a steroid) is taking its toll on him physically, and is causing \"muscle wasting.\"  Unfortunately.  But it's really needed to help keep down the inflammation along his spine. Despite that, at about 13 years old now, mealtime is still Jake's favorite part of the day, and every once in awhile he gives in to the temptation to chase one of the cats. There's no doubt, that Jake is happy.For Selma Mansion, its well thought out restoration is well underway both inside and out.  The work is being chronicled daily on a Facebook page.  No detail appears to be too small, and it appears that no expense is being spared either - You can click here to see the Facebook photos.  So, today, as we celebrate a year with Jake, it seemed only fitting that we take a short drive over to take pictures of Selma .......and of course Jake too. Here's to the next year for both Jake and Selma!"},

", "date": "Thursday, February 2, 2017", "text": "A week since my last post.  And, I am humbled by your kindness and support in the loss of Teddy.  I know he was only with us for two weeks, but his loss really affected me.  And your words soothed the sting of his loss, and helped me to feel understood in my grief. While we might not know each other personally I feel we know one another's soul - the soul that knows how it feels to lose a dog, even a \"lost boy\" like Teddy.~Teddy~I've felt the need this past week to take a break to recharge my batteries and recover a bit of brain space….. When you feel this way, there's nothing like spending quiet and reflective time with your dogs to help get things back into perspective. This morning as the sun was coming up, I sat with Cissy and we watched the first light of the day appear from the back porch.      Directly overhead flew a flock of geese and the sound of their feathered wings beating in rhythm filled the air.  It was almost musical. I inhaled deeply, took in the moment, and felt my breath for the first time in more than a week.~More Geese - later in the morning~ Cissy and I sat there together until it was time to get the day started.  This little break has been a good thing.  I'm glad to be back, and I really look forward to catching up on what I've missed.   ~Eva~"},
{"title": "Good-Bye to a 'Lost Boy' Named Teddy", "date": "Tuesday, January 24, 2017", "text": "It is with a sad heart that I tell you that yesterday, we sent Teddy to the Rainbow Bridge.  If you had told me that after only having him for 16 days, that I would be writing this post about him, I would not have believed it. ~Teddy on the ride home the day we met~But I'd taken Teddy to the vet on Monday, holding onto a thread of hope that maybe, just maybe, there was something that could be done. The vet was very kind and patient and answered all of my \"what if we tried this questions\" about possible treatment.  But none of them were options for Teddy because of what we are certain were the advanced symptoms of a brain tumor. Added to that, his heartbeat was slow, his lungs were starting to sound \"crackly\" and he'd begun having focal seizures. It was time for Teddy to go.I'll admit to feeling an overwhelming sadness that our time with Teddy was cut so short. I suppose it's natural to ask, \"was there a reason that he came to us?  Is there a lesson to be learned in his loss?\"  At the moment, I just don't know, and I may never know. But what I do know with absolute certainty, is that for those 16 days, Teddy was safe, warm and he was loved. ~One of our last days with Teddy~Teddy loved attention and was an affectionate boy that would lean into you when you petted him. When I would kiss him on the head, or whisper in his ear and tell him how glad I was he was with us, and what a good boy he was, he always would wag his tail.  That made it easy to see that he liked being told that, and when he'd look at me with such soul filled eyes it melted my heart and brought a smile to my face. And so on Monday, when it was time for the vet to end his suffering, I held him and as he left this life for the next, I told him one last time that he was a good boy and that I was grateful that I'd gotten the chance to meet him.The well known quote by Irving Townsend has been tumbling around in my head since I let Teddy go, and it seems appropriate.  \"We who choose to surround ourselves with lives even more temporary than our own, live within a fragile circle, easily and often breached. Unable to accept its awful gaps, we still would live no other way. We cherish memory as the only certain immortality, never fully understanding the necessary plan.\" While I may not have the answers to my questions about \"why\" I have no regrets, and I would live no other way.  I would welcome Teddy all over again.  And I so hope I get to see him again healthy and full of life one day!Some of you may recall that the dogs that come to us as strays are affectionately called \" the lost boys.\"  So, I say God-speed to this lost boy, that I am so grateful found his way to us, and who I have lit a candle for to help him find his way to the Rainbow Bridge."},
{"title": "Occupied Inside and Out ", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2017", "text": "I want to start by thanking everyone who visited here last week and left kind thoughts and support for Eva.  Your comments and visits really mean a lot to me.~The end of the day from my front porch~This past week, the dogs have really kept me occupied and taken up practically all of my spare time.I'll admit to still reeling about Eva's diagnosis.  One evening, on my way home from work, I did what many women do when they're down, and that's a little bit of shopping.  It was for Eva. Replaced is her plain black collar she was wearing with a pink-hearted-plaid one. I made a big deal about the collar which she seemed to like.  But it was hard to tell if she liked the treats I was giving her just a little bit more.One thing it's not hard to tell is that Todd does like Eva.  Even if she doesn't always see what he does.They've become pals, and he has been a good mentor - Teaching her that when outside, to look left....And to look right...  On the inside, we've been struggling with our newest arrival, Teddy.  Getting him to eat this week has been a real challenge. I've been hoping that with time, rest, and medications maybe Teddy would improve, but I've seen no improvement.  Actually, we've been losing ground with Teddy the last few days.  He's only eating a few bites at mealtime. I've tried everything to entice him, finally settling with green tripe and cheese mixed with kibble, which he seems to like. --What dog wouldn't, right?Today Teddy, is very quiet, with slowed breathing. He is sleeping most of the time, and will barely look up when we rouse him. Holistic Vet came to see Jake on Friday and did a good thorough exam of Teddy.  She gently and kindly suggested I consider letting him go.  But I'd felt like it wasn't time.  Teddy is not in any pain, and there is a noticeable peace and calm around him. It's how it should be. Tomorrow we see the vet again and will decide then what the next step will be. I will end on a positive note and say that we have signed and returned the contract, and have officially added Bo as a permanent member of our household. It's how it should be with him as well.~Teddy and Bo snoozing together~"},
{"title": "Eva's Past, Present and Future ", "date": "Saturday, January 14, 2017", "text": "Friday was a particularly long day that began with a lot of hope, and ended with a lot of discouragement.  Exhausted from it all, I went to bed early.I'll begin this post by telling you the rest of the story about our girl that you know as \"Eevah, or Evah.\"  Because of where she came from, and how I got her, I felt strongly that I needed to protect her from her past. But on Friday, that past caught up with her. And I feel like it's time to share that past with all of you.  Eva (the actual spelling of her name) came from a commercial kennel here in Virginia.  The dogs at this kennel (puppy mill) are kept, bred and are exploited purely for profit.  Students at a nearby college consider it a \"fun afternoon\" to go there, pay a $5 donation to get to play with the Golden Retriever puppies and walk the parents.  \"Commercial Kennel\" advertises doing this, and a friend of mine has a daughter who attends this college, and she has gone there many times with her friends.  Eva was even part of their advertising as were her puppies. The $5 donation supposedly goes to \"charity\" but there is little doubt, at least in my mind, about where that money is actually going.  Commercial Kennel, with their carefully kept records, operates within the law and despite how you or I may feel about it, it's a legal business. Unfortunately.I don't really want to dwell on Eva's past.  But that past of her having puppies twice a year for about 7 years, now appears to be affecting her future health that we will all agree is of course the top priority.  As you know, I took Eva on Friday for an ultrasound to see if a spay surgery had been done when her last litter of puppies were delivered via c-section in October. The results were that Eva is still able to have puppies. The other not-so-good-news is that there is not going to be anything that we can do to change that. Tests we've been doing on Eva show a protein loss in her urine and high blood pressure.  Tying it all back to the ultrasound which showed that her kidney's have abnormalities in their appearance.  The diagnosis is Chronic Kidney disease.  Eva being put under anesthetic could cause renal failure, so it makes doing a spay surgery, too risky.It's possible that her kidney's may have been an issue for awhile, and Commercial Kennel probably never had any kind of blood work done to have known that.  It's also possible that the anesthetic from the c-section that Eva had in October could have been the culprit for the current condition of her kidney's. It's impossible to know for sure. The plan is to put Eva on medication (enalapril) with the hopes that it will help with the protein loss, and high blood pressure. Eva will be 8 years old in a few weeks. This disease usually affects dogs a few years older than she is and progresses slowly.  So, our goal will be to try and slow it down, with medications and diet.There are few words to say how sad and disappointed I am that Eva's life is going to be shortened by this disease.  It's a truly helpless feeling. But if there's anything I have learned in living with dogs, is that they live in the present. They don't drag their history with them into the present moment and they don't project their worries into the future.  They leave that to us!  They're happy doing what they do, wagging their tails and never missing the chance to enjoy life.  As you can see in the video below that I made at the start of the year of Eva, she's no exception.At times like this, I need to remember and hang onto this lesson. And do it - For Eva."},

Her reintroduction to our dogs went really well.  There are those that will say that dogs do not remember one another or places.  Others like me, feel like they maybe they do.  Bella sure seemed like she does.  For example, the first meal I gave her after she arrived, she stood in her place where she used to wait for me to bring her bowl of food to her, and she is sleeping in the same place as well.     ~Bella - Does she remember?~Max's recovery is going pretty well. I added another medication to help with some discomfort that I thought he was having, and he seems much happier and content. ~Max, one week into recovering a 2nd time~ Our newest addition, Teddy has adjusted nicely. I was able to get him to the vet and he tested positive for 2 tick borne illnesses, lyme and ehrlichiosis. He is also anemic, that we think has been caused by his intestinal parasites.  We began 2 antibiotics and my hope is that he'll perk up in a few days.  He sleeps a lot of the time, but it's hard to say if it's because of his age, or that he doesn't feel well. Maybe it's both. Time will tell.~Teddy~ Back at the vet on Friday will be Eevah.  She was scheduled to have her spay surgery but that has been postponed because she has high blood pressure.  Until we can get that under control, it will have to wait.  However, there is a question as to if she needs to spayed at all.  You might recall that when she had puppies this past fall, they were delivered via cesarean. Because of her age, it has left a question in all of our minds, including the vets that maybe it was done when her last litter arrived.  It might explain why the \"breeder\" sold her.  But because we cannot contact anyone connected to her past, and \"Retired Lady\" who I got her from doesn't know either, we're doing an ultrasound to find out.  So, Friday the 13th will either be a lucky or unlucky day for Eevah - Lucky that she may not need to have another surgery, unlucky in that she may.   ~Eevah, keeping the secret as to if she can have puppies or not~Eevah is not worried about any of that.  But when I put the monkey hat on her, as she stood there totally still, not knowing what to do, she may have been a little worried about what her life may be coming to.Todd knew exactly how she felt!!"},

Estimated to be about 13-14 years old, Teddy was found as a stray, walking in circles in someones yard.  The county Animal Control was called, and he was taken to the shelter to \"do his time.\"  As expected, no one came looking for this \"lost boy\" and he was officially turned over to the rescue.  I'll just add right here that it's always mind-boggling to me that someone could have a dog for so many years, and then not be looking for them.     ~Teddy at his temporary foster home~Teddy tilts his head, and along with his walking in circles it makes us all quite positive that he has  \"old dog vestibular syndrome.\" He is also very thin, had a terrible ear infection and tested positive for several different kinds of parasites, all of which he has been treated for. Given all of this, maybe this is the reason why no came to claim him at the shelter?       After our introductions, Teddy got comfy for the drive home. Soon enough we were back home and it was time for a few more introductions. Because Teddy loses his balance when he walks, I limited his meeting everyone - Meaning he did not meet Todd, who I call the \"wild card\" one on one.  After some rest, and a full meal, it was lights out until early this morning. We finished the intros...Or he met Todd, and all went well.  Teddy is a very friendly boy and I don't think his tails has stopped wagging since we met. . ~First meeting at the fence - Notice Todd telling him off~I'm grateful that with the snow and the temperatures below freezing the last couple of days, that this sweet senior boy named Teddy is safe and warm.  And I look forward to getting to know him."},

They were asking me to come and take him home to try and get him to eat something.  Max may have Golden Retriever in his genetic makeup, but he clearly channels his poodle side when it comes to eating.  He is as finicky as a cat when it comes to food and treats. By the time I got Max home and settled, he fell asleep. I woke him up to feed him and he only ate about about a 1/3 of his meal. But he had water, and wanted to be taken out.  So, I'm hoping Max just needs a good nights sleep in his own bed. Who doesn't benefit from that?"},

Here are a few random things from our week so far...It has been exactly 301 days since our boy Jake came to us.  I'm not sure why I've kept track of how many days it has been since we met him. I guess it's knowing how close he came to not making it out of the shelter in February.  I will always be grateful to the shelter for asking his owner to give him that chance, and to the rescue for being there for him.  Jake continues to do well and there's no doubt that he's happy.  The spinal-stenosis is progressing, but it's not slowing him down too much. ~Jake, celebrating 301 days!~I've decided that if there were a TV reality show about animals that hoard, the lovely Evah would be the star. She takes *every *single *toy we have into the ex-pen with her. We take them out, scatter them around, and she takes them back in.  I've told her it was okay, because now we know where to find them. ~Evah, making no excuses for taking all the toys~I've been in touch with Lab Rescue about our foster boy Bo. With his health problems mostly resolved, it's time to decide about who will be his forever home.  We are really on the fence with Bo and definitely leaning towards keeping him. His adjustment to his surroundings and our house has taken some time. Bo doesn't have a lot of confidence in himself and I've no doubt this is probably because of how he lived before he came to us. I describe him as aloof, a bit of a loner and he spends a lot of time alone and is a little disconnected with what is happening around him -- I'm sure that living in unimaginable circumstances with 40 other dogs has contributed to all that. I don't think that Bo has adjusted to his blindness like other blind dogs we've had before him.  We've spent a lot of time leading him around the house and yard and showing him how to get back to the door. Despite our doing that, he's still getting \"lost.\"  But he's much-much better than he was. ~Bo made me laugh when he got comfy on a cat bed yesterday~On the flip side, there's the endearing side of Bo that grabs my heart.  He is a gentle soul.  He perks up and will stand and wag his tail when he hears our voices. He loves attention and of course mealtime and treats.  Bo gets along great with the other dogs, and they like him too.  We've decided to roll the dice, let fate decide and see if anyone comes forward that's interested in adopting him.  I told Lab Rescue that we'll give it until about the middle of December, so Bo will have a forever family in time for Christmas.Christmas...  It will be here before we all know it, and I think Todd can't believe it either."},

And while I've been caring for those characters inside, the main-character in our house Todd is taking care of what's going on outside.  What would be do without him?Max returned for his final evaluation with the orthopedic surgeon.  He was happy with how Max has healed, and he was given the all clear on his left knee. His right knee as expected will also need surgery.  There is no reason to think that the rescue won't approve it being done, but it's going to have to wait. Max has got a pretty ugly ear infection going on right now, and to avoid any cross contamination, he'll have to wait until it's all cleared up.  Max is okay with waiting~Max has been doing a lot of head-shaking with this ear infection~Also at the vet was our foster boy for Lab Rescue, Bo.  You'll recall that his previous career was similar to the one that Evah had.  Suffice it to say, that his \"procedure\" now means that his puppy-making days are over too. The cats also couldn't be ignored.  We had our other little foster girl, Lucille at the vet too.  The same orthopedic surgeon that sees Max, sees her as well.  She's been given a good report and is healing well.  But Lucille still has \"six more weeks of winter\" before she is allowed to resume the life of an active and acrobatic cat.Todd is just glad that none of this is happening to him.  At least he hopes it won't."},
{"title": "Better Days Ahead for Evah! ", "date": "Thursday, November 24, 2016", "text": "Another blur of a week for us.  I'm sure many of you are like me and are enjoying the Thanksgiving break as much as I am.  The only thing we have planned is dinner with good friends and their family today (Thursday) and spending some time at home.~HAPPY THANKSGIVING from Cissy~  Thank-you all for your kind words and supportive comments for our newest arrival Evah. One comment that Stoermann Home left and deleted, was one I really thought was a good and valid thought about Evah's care that asked about her staying with Retired Lady, Stoermann Home said:  \"isn't there a program out there that helps the elderly keep their companion dogs when they get financially difficult to keep? I mean, its great that you got the dog, but what if SHE kept the dog and didn't have to bear the cost of the unexpected medical issues.\"  The answer to that question is yes there are vets offices that provide routine care to senior pet owners at a reduced fee or for no charge.  Understandably it's also up to individual practices to decide what discounted services they'll provide beyond that. The vet care that Evah needed by Thursday was more than Retired Lady was able and willing to pay, and my vets office and any nearby were willing to provide at no cost to her.It all began when Retired Lady got Evah on Saturday afternoon.  From that time until Tuesday when she was first taken to see the vet, Evah had not relieved herself. The vet emptied her very full bladder, but did nothing about her bowels.  Retired Lady wasn't charged for other palliative care and they were hoping Evah would be okay. But by Thursday, no matter how many times she was taken outside, Evah would do nothing but try to go back inside because she was afraid of the noise made by passing cars. By Thursday Evah was (understandably) beginning to not feel well and hadn't eaten.  When I got Evah home I'd hoped that letting her off lead in our big yard, with no cars around would do the trick.  It didn't, and she even became sick overnight.  On Friday morning I dropped Evah off at the vets office and she received all the needed treatment including blood work and a few other tests.  Twelve hours later I was picked up an exhausted Evah who was feeling much better.~Evah last Saturday, showing off her post-puppy figure~Caring for the other dogs (in my next post) and getting Evah all settled in has taken us to a week later. Evah has ended her first week with us on a good note and with everything (now) working like clock-work. A needed antibiotic has kicked in, and that has helped as well. Evah is just as lovely on the inside as she is on the outside.  She gets along really well with all the dogs, and is also learning about cats.  In true Golden Retriever fashion she takes everything in stride, loves her meals and happily takes treats.  If we're having any problems with her, it's that she is very nervous about exploring the house. I've tried to introduce her to other rooms but she gets nervous and wants to go back to the ex-pen where she feels safe. I'm sure in time that will change as she gets more confidence. I decided to sign over my ownership of Evah to the rescue.  This was in part in the event that there are unforeseen repercussions between the kennel and Retired Lady no longer having her. I think that there being another link between Evah and where she originally came from is best for her.  And the Rescue as Evah's owner are in a better position to stand up against the kennel that she came from.I think we'd all agree that Evah should only go forward to a new life and not back to her old one."},
{"title": "Evah Arrives at Golden Pines ", "date": "Thursday, November 17, 2016", "text": "Its been an unusually busy and hectic week for us, that shows no signs of slowing down even though the weekend is in sight.  Some appointments that were made weeks ago were rescheduled to make time for other more pressing ones.The week also took a turn when I received a call from my vets office on Tuesday.  A retired lady in her 70's had come in with a Golden Retriever that she'd recently bought from a kennel named Evah.  Her new addition has several medical issues. Medical issues that her limited budget does not allow her to pay for. Retired lady was overwhelmed and not knowing where to turn, a vet-technician contacted me in hopes the rescue I volunteer with could help.  I called Retired Lady and chatted with her. The bottom line was her concern about the money she had already spent and the funds that are needed to provide the care for Evah.  She'd decided to return her to the kennel for a refund.  Fast forward through a couple of phone conversations, and I felt like I had to do something. Rescues (understandably) never buy dogs from people.  Normally, I would never, ever have considered doing it either. But given the circumstances to which Evah would be returned has totally outweighed everything some would say was sensible.  So, I made an offer to Retired Lady to buy Evah from her, and she accepted my offer.Evah has been used solely for breeding.  Every single season for this nearly 7 year old girl has produced a litter of puppies. According to her papers, Evah was born at this kennel, and her parents were also born there.  The website and facebook page for this kennel show her puppies off, as well as the litters of several other dogs just like her.  Her last litter of 13 puppies born only 6 weeks ago via c-section, is probably why Evah was sold -- Her \"job\" as a puppy-machine are finally over.  ***I will add here that I am absolutely no way whatsoever against those who responsibly breed dogs because they are devoted to a particular breed, and do it with the health, soundness and welfare of all dogs being first and foremost. What I am against are dogs that are bred solely and purely for profit, which is how this girl has been used.***   Retired Lady and I met this evening, and I became Evah's legal owner.  Retired Lady could not have been more kind and grateful that she will be cared for. Tomorrow I'll drop her off at the vets office to have blood work and tests done while I'm at work.  I don't know what the future holds for Evah.  But she now has options.  I spoke to a coordinator with the rescue a couple of days ago, and I may sign my ownership of Evah over to the Golden Retriever Rescue. However, I'll admit that I've not really thought that far because my goal was just to get Evah from Retired Lady before she changed her mind about taking her back to the kennel. Thankfully, tonight and right now in this moment, there are no decisions to be made.  Evah now has a bright future, free of a kennel and that to me is worth more than any amount of money that has changed hands."},
{"title": "The Side Trip", "date": "Sunday, November 13, 2016", "text": "Before winter sets in, the holidays come and a few other things on the agenda, I was off to Kentucky for a few days to see my youngest brother. Weather is always concern when driving over the mountains of West Virginia this time of year.  But it was a good day for an 11 hour drive.A stay at a hotel for one night...A stay at my favorite Air BnB the rest of my visit. My Father was in the Army and was originally from Texas. My Mom's family roots are from around the little farming community of Yeaman, Kentucky located about 100 miles southwest of Louisville in Grayson County. There are mostly farms along the country road to get to a church that is just as I remember it growing up.  Next to it is a small cemetery where my Grandparents and other family members are buried. One headstone had the below quote, that I thought was worth remembering.My visit ended all too soon, and I was on my way back to Virginia.  Heading out of Charleston West Virginia, on Route 60, there is the classic section of what is known as the Midland Trail that begins as Charleston’s downtown skyline disappears. It stretches 120 curving miles and is a road full of West Virginia scenery and history that you miss by taking speedier interstate.  The two photos below are of Kanawha Falls that drops over a cofferdam built to redirect the river’s flow toward an old hydropower house at the left edge of the photo.My favorite stop is Hawks Nest State Park.  It's a peak on Gauley Mountain in Ansted, West Virginia. The name came from the many fish hawks which inhabited the massive cliffs. When the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway railroad began blasting in the area in the 1800's the hawks left the area and never returned.  Travelers like me stop to see the beautiful view of the river below. And for this building...  The bathroom... The side trip slowed down my return home -- And when it was getting dark and I still had a ways to go, I was regretting that I'd made that decision. But all that vanished when I finally got home."},

Feel free to scream or bark, whichever one you prefer.2. Manage your exposure  ..... to social media...or just people in general.3. Create an exit plan, or a strategy to get out of any anxiety-provoking situation.Number 4 and 5.  Practice acceptance and know what your triggers are.6. No matter how much you may want to, don't engage \"them.\"  No one wins.  Well, maybe if you're Todd.  But remember to respect your family members, friends and pack-mates.7.  Practice good behavior. 8. Slow down and do something that you enjoy.  Ripping up a new toy works for Todd.9. Look for and/or remember your support system and spend some time with them.10. Perspective and personal reflection may help too. ....So, go for a walk, or just spend time outdoors enjoying the fresh air.With your dogs of course...We hope this advice helps, and if you have any you'd like to share, please do.  As always thank-you for taking a moment and stopping by.  I hope you'll stop by again!"},
{"title": "Middle of the Week Already! ", "date": "Wednesday, November 2, 2016", "text": "We have rounded the corner to the middle of the week.  Where does the time go? All the dogs seem to be having a pretty good week.  No stomach upset, (knock on wood), no wanting out in the middle of the night (knock on wood) and no more counter-surfing for cat food or anything else. (knock on wood).  You'll recall that Charlie was a concern because he wasn't eating. I called Mobile Vet a few days ago, and we talked about it.  Again, instead of coming he prescribed a medication for nausea (Cerenia) that I already had, so I gave that to him.  As of this evening, it looks like Charlie's appetite has returned -- However I'll admit to topping his meal with a little bit of baby food to tempt him. Whatever works, right? The lovely little Lucille that we have for the SPCA also had a follow-up appointment with the surgeon.  It was time for her to have the staples taken out of her leg, and to have her first healing x-ray taken.  It looks like she's mending really well, but still has to wear the \"cone of shame\" for now, and remain crated.  I think she's okay with that.Max was happy that Lucille saw the surgeon and not him.  His turn will come next week.Another vet visit was needed for some follow up tests for our foster-boy Bo from Lab Rescue. The results will be returned in a few more days. He seems to be feeling pretty well.  I'm really happy with how he's finally settled into the routine and the household. I have to say that it seemed to start coming together when we just let him set the pace and decide for himself where he wanted to be, and what he wanted to do. When we were on our way back from the vets office the other day, I have to say, he looked so happy sitting on the back seat. I had the windows open and he was sniffing the air and to me, he looked like he didn't have a care in the world. Maybe he didn't. Another dog that doesn't have a care in the world appears to be Deizel (previous foster boy for Lab Rescue).  I got the below picture from his family yesterday.  The e-mails I've gotten from them have left no doubt about how well he's doing and it's really clear that they all adore Deizel.  And I've no doubt that Deizel would say that the feeling is mutual."},

None of the other dogs had stirred, so it was back to bed and lights out.   ~Jake, still feeling the effects of an upset stomach~Then Todd jumped off the bed.  That always means he needs to go out, or should be let out.  He quickly came back inside.  He stood there for a moment looking at me because he was expecting a treat.  But the rule is, I don't give treats in the middle of the night.  Silence once again as I again turned the lamp off.  A few minutes later, a whiny bark was coming from Sunny which is his signal that he needs out.  Of course I got up to let him out. Several minutes later, I was putting my shoes on to bring him back inside.  He didn't get a treat either.~A rare smile from Sunny for the camera~When we came back in, Charlie was awake and getting a good drink of water.  I knew to make sure he was let out.  No treat for him either....~Charlie, still not feeling 100%~Back to bed again but not before I noticed that it was about 3:45. From the living room I could hear the sad forlorn meow from Lucille.  I drifted back to sleep feeling badly that she was out there alone.I was suddenly awakened by Charlie who was vomiting all the water he'd just had. Another clean up, and I decided to wash all the towels I'd used.  As everything settled down I tried to clear my mind, but couldn't help but worry about Charlie whose cough has cleared up, but he still hasn't got much of an appetite.Then it was Josh's turn.  He was whining - His signal that he needs help getting onto his feet.   I 'd noticed that a back leg was tucked under him, and so I knew he probably needed to stand up so could stretch and get comfortable again. ~Josh~Up once more after that to turn off a light I'd left on, and finally there was silence once again. Then the radio came on, signaling that it was 4:30, and time for Carl to start his day.  I'm glad he got his sleep.  I'm glad I was off today. ~A sleepy Cissy~"},
{"title": "Shock and Disaster", "date": "Tuesday, October 25, 2016", "text": "The word \"disaster\" is one that we've been hearing a lot from one of the presidential candidates. I didn't count, but one report said that it was used 14 times in the second presidential debate, and who knows for sure how many times he has said it since then. I've gotten so I cringe when I hear the word.  But I have to say, that \"disaster\" is the word I would use to describe what happened when the family came to meet Mo on Saturday.I was all ready for them to come.  The dogs were all settled, everything was in its place. But when the family came in, to my shock, Mo got scared, and he ran off and hid in the only place he could find which was under the washing machine.  I couldn't even see him because he was tucked so far under it. I really tried to act like it wasn't a big deal, that this was no problem, and Mo was such a nice cat, and they were going to love him...If I could only get to him....  I chatted away and I kept the mood light, and joked about the whole situation as I casually asked Carl to \"please come and move the washer and dryer and get Mo out from underneath\".  When Carl was able to finally get to Mo (not an easy feat because there's not a lot of room in our laundry room), he got away from me again and with all the doors closed he ran to the only place he could find to hide which was under the couch. My attempts to inject humor into the whole situation was getting harder to do.  And I'll admit that my embarrassment in front of a couple I'd just met and their two children was also getting hard to conceal -- Also getting hard to say was that Mo was a really friendly and sociable cat. When Carl finally managed to get him out from under the sofa, he handed him to me, and Mo again got away from me and hid once more under the sofa.  The third time, I wasn't going to let him escape and I tightly held onto him and put him into a small crate, but not before he scratched me several times.  By this time we were all at a loss for words, and the husband more out of politeness than anything, slowly opened the crate and made a half-hearted attempt to make friends with Mo. Looking back at it, I guess given what had happened and seeing the scratches on my hand and arm may have made them all a bit wary of doing that. But really by this time, we all had to be honest and admit defeat and agree that Mo was not the cat for them.My mind was reeling from the whole thing, and in a vain attempt to salvage any of my dignity and make the family feel that maybe their more than one hour drive to our house wasn't a waste of time, I brought out Jake.  I thought that letting the kids meet him and put treats onto his nose for him to catch may help end the visit on a good note.  It's a good trick, but it did little to change the mood of everyone.What we all really wanted was this whole event to be over, so I walked them out and came back inside to get Mo out from under the couch. What a total disaster...I talked with the cat-director of the SPCA and she did a great job of helping me to not feel badly about what happened and to see the humor in the whole thing.  She's going to come over in a few days to see Mo, and we'll decide how to move forward with placing him into a new home then. We did decide to go ahead and bring in the new addition, who was supposed to be Mo's replacement.  Her name is Lucille and she's about 4 months old.  She was found on the side of the road, after she'd been hit by a car. Lucille has had surgery to repair a severe break in her front leg by the same surgeon as Max. And like Max, she also needs total crate rest while it mends.  The plan is for us to keep her during the initial recovery time and move her to another foster home when she gets the \"all clear\" from the surgeon.It may sound like a lot to handle, but Charlie is there to offer lots of help and support. Longtime readers of this blog will recall that for some reason he really, really loves kittens and the lovely little Lucille is no exception. Charlie is very attentive to Lucille and he's always right there when I'm tending to her, letting me know that he's there to help.  And, just in case she does need something, the last 2 nights he's been been sleeping by her crate.  Tonight, he's also there making sure she's okay.   Mo really didn't make a good impression on the family that hoped to adopt him.  But Charlie really does make a pretty good nurse."},

The bright sunshine is doing little to take that edge off.  All of our windows are closed, and I'm sitting here with a sweater on. The only one who is unphased by the sudden change in weather is Todd.  His tough Scottish roots serve him well on  the chilliest of days.  I heard from the orthopedic surgeon about Max.  He's happy with how Max is healing and wants to see him in a couple of weeks when we do the next set of x-rays.   At that time we'll decide where to go next.  It's not confirmed yet, but we're pretty positive that Max is headed towards another knee surgery.  Feeling somewhat better this weekend is Charlie.  He is getting over a respiratory infection that brought with it a deep, dry hacking cough with some sneezing, snorting and gagging to go along with it.  When Bo came to us, he had something pretty similar but not as bad.  I called Mobile Vet who was unable to come.  But he thought as I did that given the symptoms, and because of Bo, that it's probably \"kennel cough,\" and so he called in an antibiotic for Charlie to a pharmacy.  It seems to be working, and he's not coughing nearly as frequently as he was.~Charlie~We will end the weekend with maybe saying good-bye to our foster cat, Mohawk. A phone call from the cat-director of the SPCA that a family saw Mo online and were very interested in meeting and adopting him.  I knew this was going to happen, but I just expected it later, rather than sooner. If all goes well, and he likes them, and the feeling is mutual, he'll leave and we will be welcoming a new little foster girl named Lucille on Sunday. ~Good-bye to Mohawk?~ What a busy Saturday we're having!!~Cissy~   Even though it's a little chilly, I hope you're enjoying yours, as much as Cissy (below) is!"},

He traveled (via train) to visit his youngest brother in Vancouver Washington.  Even though he had been ill for quite some time, he passed away unexpectedly while he was there. As brothers they shared a unique bond.  This has made his loss a very sad and profound one, not just for him but his entire family.  It's understandable.At home, and with work, it left little spare time.  I felt like I kept up with all the work and things went pretty well.  Even if it hadn't gone well, of course I was not going to complain.~Charlie and Todd kept busy looking at who-knows-what? ~While Carl was gone, as you know, Bo arrived. He's getting along nicely with all the dogs.  However I was hoping that after nearly 2 weeks he would be a little more adjusted to the routine, but he's not.  Maybe it's the blindness, and because how he is living is so different than what he has always known.Bo is not a very confident boy, but I feel like he trusts me. Because he still \"wanders around\" when outside, I've been working on teaching him to come in the direction of my voice.  He's a work in progress, but as you can see in the video below, he's getting better. Max returned last Saturday to have his \"healing x-rays\" taken, and to also snap a picture of his other knee.  One of the screws in Max's knee (3rd from the bottom) looks like it may have drifted, but otherwise, everything looks pretty good. We're continuing with weekly cold laser therapy and acupuncture for both knees and his back which is sore.  In between treatments I've been shown how to massage Max's back, and I apply warm compresses. He loves the extra attention and the pampering!  Max is getting around pretty well and he's putting his full weight onto his repaired knee, but is still really tentative on his right knee.  We're waiting to hear from the surgeon about the next step for Max.  Until then, he's kept on a leash and is on \"restricted activity\" for (at least) a few more weeks.Yes, there's no doubt that the last two weeks have been mostly business at our house.  But there is the comic relief from \"You Know Who\" that always makes me laugh. What would I do without him? Thank-you so much for stopping by!  I've really missed having the time read blogs, but I know you understand.  I so look forward to being able to catch up with you!!   ~A late season Monarch Butterfly on Sunday~"},

This is partly because Bo comes from a \"puppy mill\" and was used as a stud-dog, until last year when he went blind.  He is \"unaltered\" and my concern about his hormones, especially around our boys has made me overly cautious. I didn't want there to be any problems, especially on the first day... and especially with Todd who you may be surprised to know can be a little bossy. (I know, a shock, right?) ~Todd, bossy?~It turned into a quiet evening. After dinner and another trip outside, it was lights out for Bo -- Even before I could get a dog bed for him, he was out for the count!  At about 3 o'clock this morning, he was stirring in the crate so I took him out not thinking I'd have an entourage following us. I held my breath as Charlie, Sunny and of course Todd all quietly met the new boy.  It went well, and soon we were back in bed, and I breathed a sigh of relief. I was feeling a little more sure about Bo this morning on our first walk, so I just let the dogs interact with him.  I was so grateful that it had gone well! Bo is understandably unsure and very tentative about his new surroundings.  Unlike Deizel who I thought could see a little, I am pretty sure that Bo's matured cataracts don't allow him to see at all.But he'll wag his tail when I speak to him or when he hears me call him from across the yard.He is really a nice boy that enjoys and eagerly soaks up attention, that I am more than happy to give. And despite some uncertainty about his long-term-health, I hope he knows he's going to be okay."},

The end of the week is in sight.  My thanks to all of you for your kind, supportive thoughts and helping to quiet \"the lady in my head.\"  I am still hearing her, but because of you, I'm keeping her at bay and not pouring (as much) guilt on myself because of Max. The Holistic Vet was here earlier this morning to reassess Max and do acupuncture and cold laser therapy.  We both feel good about the plan we have put together in moving ahead with him.  A physical therapist is coming next week to see Max for massage and cold laser treatments.  We're also adding \"Adequan\" to his list of medications.  (Adequan is an injectable medication used to control symptoms associated with degenerative or traumatic arthritis)  Next week Max will be taken for x-rays which will tell us how the healing is progressing.  Despite a few itchy ears, Todd and the rest of the dogs are doing pretty well.  For that I'm really grateful. Todd is enjoying the cooler evenings and sitting in the yard watching the world go by.  I have to wonder what Todd is thinking when he's sitting there?  Is he reflecting on the meaning of life and the mysteries of the universe?  Or is he simply waiting patiently for the deer to stumble out of the woods again?Whatever Todd is thinking, I'm thinking about the new addition that may be coming on Friday via Lab Rescue.  \"Bo\" is ten years old, and is coming to us with several medical issues. His bloodwork is showing elevated white blood cells and a low thyroid level.  On the outside, Bo has rotten teeth, and an aural hematoma. And just like our last foster boy, Diezel, he's also blind. Lab Rescue didn't (and probably won't) tell me exactly where he came from. However the foster home coordinator said he \"came from some hell hole with 40 other dogs.\"  The plan is for us to only keep him until he's well enough to be neutered.  But if he's a good fit, it could be longer.  We'll see. Finally for all of you who are and will be affected by Hurricane Matthew, please stay safe!"},
{"title": "The Lady Inside My Head", "date": "Sunday, October 2, 2016", "text": "I've decided that there's a problem with caring for dogs for the last 20 years --  It's that (when asked) I think I’ve gotten pretty good at giving supportive thoughts to people who are struggling to care for and make the best decision for their dogs. But here's the thing when it comes to my own dogs and the foster dogs --  I am not very good at hearing the same kind, reasonable, forgiving lady that lives in my head. Sure, she'll talk to everyone else, but she ignores me when I ask her to weigh in on my problems. When she does finally say something to me, most of the time all I hear is a weepy confused lady running around in panicked circles calling me names for not being a better caregiver to the dogs.  That lady really gets to me sometimes.  And I couldn't help but hear her weepy voice this week when I was discussing Max with the Holistic Vet.  I found myself fighting off those hot-tears when I had to come to the realization that Max may need yet another knee surgery.-Max after having his staples removed~Max's recovery from surgery was going pretty well.  When the staples were taken out this week, everyone commented on how well he was doing. That made me feel pretty good because we've been following the post surgical instructions to the letter.  Then it happened. Actually, I don't know what happened. All I know is that Max was holding up his OTHER (good) leg and not putting any weight onto it. It appears that he may have torn his other cruciate.  I had no idea that it's not uncommon for dogs to have the same injury occur to the other knee after surgery because they're having to compensate and shift their weight onto their good knee. I was told by the Rescue and the Holistic Vet that it was not my fault, and that I shouldn't feel guilty about it.  This is exactly what I may have told any of you if you were in the same spot. And I would have said that to myself if that weepy lady in my head wasn’t busy shouting about how I had failed Max.At any rate, that's what seems to have happened.  The Holistic Vet recommended putting Max back on anti-inflammatory and pain medications.  She did acupuncture and cold laser therapy which seems to have helped.  Max is to be kept on strict crate-rest, nothing off leash, no jumping, etc.  All this in hopes of turning it around.By Thursday, he was still tentative when he walked, but he was balancing his weight a little more. On Friday when I got home from work, the note from our dog-walker commented on how Max was \"holding his leg up really close to himself when he came back in.\"  I found out that she'd misunderstood what the staples coming out meant, and she unknowingly let Max out without a leash. The lady in my head said a lot of nice things to our dog-walker, but to me, she wasn't so understanding. Today, it appears that we're back to where we were earlier in the week.  And whatever happens, I know Max will be just fine.  He's not worried about another knee-surgery because he's too busy thinking about chasing the cat, getting some extra attention and watching what's on TV. The lady inside my head has been quiet.  At least she is for the moment. However I know she'll be back -- She never really goes away. That's just how she is.  But maybe Todd can scare her away."},

I thought they were really nice, as were their 2 dogs. Deizel responded really well to all of them, which I thought was a good sign! ~Deizel meeting his new family~I've heard from Pennsylvania couple every day, and he has settled in really nicely to his new life, home and family! I was sad at his leaving and do miss him and having a Lab as part of our household.  But I think Deizel is where he's meant to be, and I could not be happier about that. ~Deizel (middle) and his new family~I also couldn't be happier about how Max is doing.  He's now just over a week past his surgery.  I've discontinued the pain medication, and he's still on strict crate rest.  To give him a break, we take off the \"cone of shame\" and keep him leashed at our feet while we're watching tv.Going up or down steps of any kind is not allowed, so Max is lifted when going in or out.  On Tuesday he'll see the vet and have the staples removed.  Then we'll see if he's ready to move onto the rehab part of his recovery.  I think he's ready. And Todd may not look like it at the moment, but I think he's ready for whatever comes next too - He's a Scottie afterall! It's feeling like fall today, as rain falls this evening.  So, I'll end this post with a photo from a pumpkin-patch that I took this past weekend and wish you all a good week!"},
{"title": "The Foster Boys", "date": "Sunday, September 18, 2016", "text": "Our foster-boy Max had knee surgery (a TPLO) on Thursday.  I picked up a very happy Max on Friday after work. ~On the way home!~The instructions from the surgeon was/is strict crate-rest and confinement.  Max was exhausted, so following those instructions and getting him settled in that first night, wasn't difficult at all.By Saturday, Max was feeling better and more rested. So, he set about doing what all dogs do when confined with not much to do, and that was to escape the dreaded \"cone of shame.\" With skills that even Houdini would envy, he was getting pretty good at it.  So he's now sporting a \"donut\" which is connected to his collar and it seems to be staying in place. So far anyway. In the middle of the busy week, I heard from Lab Rescue about a family interested in Deizel.  I'll admit to being surprised.  For several reasons, we've (of course) thought of keeping Deizel.  But honestly, we'd just hadn't not acted on making him a permanent addition. I'll also admit that we just didn't think that with all the dogs Lab Rescue has available for adoption, someone would pick Deizel so soon.  But \"Pennsylvania Couple\" did.  They have two other dogs, (both Black Labs) and one of them happens to be blind -- Which probably explains why they noticed Deizel on the list. I've talked at length to \"Pennsylvania wife\" and I really like her.  She and her husband are really excited about meeting Deizel and are coming on Thursday afternoon.  I think they would provide a good home for him.        Todd of course doesn't care about any of this.  He's been concerned with the would be intruders or moles - He's \"made dead\" two of them the last couple of days.  He's certainly a busy Scottie!

{"title": "Simply Remembering George", "date": "Sunday, September 11, 2016", "text": "While so many are remembering the events of September 11th, I do not in any way intend any disrespect to that, but I am remembering our boy George that left us on Friday.We first met George on April 11, 2015.  His arrival story can be found here. His previous home had called him \"Biggie,\" and the rescue knew him as \"Big Georgie\". I never called him Biggie, feeling it was just a little insulting to him.  I did of course call him Georgie as a nickname.  But to me, he was simply George. George was originally a foster dog via Lab Rescue, but I knew not long after I met him, that he was not leaving our house.  I'd felt at the time that the change would be unfair for a boy of his respectable age of about 13.  But more than anything, George had quickly found a place in my heart, and our home too.  We officially adopted him not long after he came.His easy going and laid back personality meant that he got along with all the dogs. I'd long thought that if our household had an anchor, it was George.  He was steady, calm, and pretty unassuming.  He was focused, but went with the flow of the household and never seemed to mind any change in the routine.  But in true Lab fashion, he loved his mealtimes, as you can see in the video below.  It truly was his favorite time of the day! George was my shadow and followed me everywhere I went.  He slept next to the bed on my side from just about the first night he came.  His \"extra large size\" meant George was a big presence, and a great comfort in sad times.George was a dog that was not part of the spotlight.  He didn't mind that. He was perfectly content to be in the background and watch the world go by.  But that changed this past April at a rescue parade.  That day he walked around the show-ring as an audience applauded him.He received a beautiful rosette afterwards just like a \"real show dog\"  It was a fun day and is a favorite memory of just the two of us.George loved to lay in the sun on hot days and soak up its warmth.I'd say that he felt like a baked potato when he'd come back inside -- But actually he felt more like a soft warm pillow that just came out of the dryer. But in any weather and in every season, George remained unflappable, never changing, never seeming to mind anything.  Not even the bad weather.He silently soaked up every day and moment, and was always watching me and everything else so intently with his big brown eyes that to me were so wise and soulful.The lump appeared on his gums in early June.  I knew what it meant.  That our time together would be coming to an end.A friend reminded me to not see it that way, and she sent me an article that pointed out that George didn't know he had cancer. Dogs live so much in the moment, and so I tried to live each day remembering that too; hoping and praying to extend those days with George. I read all that I could about this particular kind of cancer.  I talked to the holistic vet, and tried different herbs that I'd not used before.  I feel that they did work to a point.  But sadly and unfortunately, it was not a battle that could be won. ~Un-edited photo of \"the lump.\"~Through it all George remained stoic, never wavering in his devotion, and totally focused on the moments and life.  But in the end, he could be brave no more.  It was time for me to \"be brave\" and let this boy who meant to much to me, go. It's now two days later and I'm realizing that his loss is going to take some time to get over.  Maybe it's because it's coming so close to the loss of my precious Sheba.  Maybe it's because he was our first Black Lab.  Maybe it's because of his extra-large size and personality that had a way of grabbing your heart.  Maybe it's all of those things and many more.  But I think that it probably comes down to just one simple thing...  He was just simply George and I simply loved him."},
{"title": "A Sad Good-Bye to George ", "date": "Saturday, September 10, 2016", "text": "Friday marked the end of two very long days, and a day that I truly was not ready for.  It was one that came less than a month from losing our precious Sheba.  I said good-bye to George.  He'd been doing pretty well, and silently I was celebrating because the herbs that I was giving him to slow the growth of the oral tumor seemed to be working. But a few weeks ago, I realized that the tumor was getting bigger. Unfortunately no matter what supplements and medications I tried increasing or adding, they didn't work. ~A first photo of George, April 2015~The last couple of weeks had been hard for George for several reasons that were all related to the tumor. I talked to the holistic vet, and we decided to increase the amount of pain medication he was taking, and add one more herb.  It helped, and he was able to get the rest he really needed.  But by Thursday he was getting more and more reluctant to get up and was needing more help. Friday, he didn't want to get up at all, and he didn't want his breakfast, which was a first.  I knew it was time to say good-bye, even though I wasn't ready.  Not that I ever would have been.~July 2015~I called the Mobile Vet and he came. He felt that the cancer had probably spread internally and that nothing more could be done. With a shake of his head and so much like the gentleman that he was, George quietly left this world for the next.~5-12-16 -- One year and one day after we met George~What came afterwards was truly a unique and special experience.  The service that will cremate and return George's remains to us, came to the house after we let him go.  The vet left about 30 or so minutes prior to their coming, which meant I was left alone with George.  It was without a doubt the perfect chance to say that final good-bye and not feel the rush of being at a vets office, or having anyone around.   Time truly stood still in those solemn moments and the house seemed filled with peace and calm as I said all those things to him that come only from your heart in moments of sadness.  I also allowed the dogs to see George one final time.~March 2016~When George was taken from our house, I walked with the two gentlemen outside,  I noticed a butterfly in our garage. It lazily and magically fluttered around the door of the garage going inside and out, I couldn't help but watch it as it floated around the van the two men were driving. In the Old World, the butterfly was thought to be the spirit of the dead.  Other legends say it's a sign of transformation.  I could only think at that moment of the quote that says \"Butterflies are free.\"  ........   Fly free my handsome Georgie until we meet again one day at the Rainbow Bridge.~One of the last photos taken of George 9-16~"},

The weather really could not have been more perfect!  Hurricane Hermine totally missed us.  Cool mornings allowed us to have the widows open overnight.~Deizel enjoying the morning~There was even time for a nap or two.  At least Mo, our foster cat tried to take a nap.  Todd never can pass up the chance to harass him.It really was a nice and relaxing weekend!~Josh!~I hope you are all rested up ....and that you also enjoyed your weekend!"},
{"title": "Skating into September", "date": "Saturday, September 3, 2016", "text": "We did it!  We quickly skated right through the week, and right here to Friday and Labor Day weekend!It was a full week that had me opening up my horizons a little bit and experience the wonderment that are cotton candy grapes.  Have you tried them?  They’re exactly what they sound like. Grapes that taste like cotton candy. I first heard about them from the doctor I work for who could not stop raving about them.  I was skeptical.  I'm also not a cotton-candy fan, and I was secretly thinking that the grapes were probably pumped up with some kind of chemical additive that would make my liver or stomach shrivel up in 10 years.  But I tried them anyway. Again, I know not everyone is a fan of grapes or cotton candy. And, I totally agree with what you may be thinking, that no grape should smell or taste like cotton candy -- But they really do, and (again) even though I'm not a fan of cotton candy, they really are pretty good!  They have just the right balance of sweet cotton candy and grape that has made me a fan along with so many others!  I'll also add that they are non-GMO grapes. They’re all natural and were bred by a company that specializes in breeding new grape varieties -- And they're only available for a short time, so look for them. Okay ... Now that I've got that covered, lets move on.  I think George (below) is ready!The rescue has approved Max's surgery on his knee, that I've scheduled for September 15th.  In preparation for the surgery and what will be several weeks of recovery,  I had him groomed.The groomer got a little carried away and his coat is shorter than I'd wanted.  But by the time Max will need to be groomed again, he'll be fully recovered.I'm glad that it's all approved and planned, and a busy week is done.  We can now just relax for the long Labor Day weekend that marks the end of summer.  I'm not sure where the summer went.  But it really had its highs and lows, and with it in our rear-view mirror, I'm looking ahead to the fall. I'm not looking forward to the cold weather, but I am looking forward to life slowing down a little bit, if that's possible.   And Deizel, (below) is just looking forward to his next treat!"},
{"title": "Every Day is National Dog Day", "date": "Saturday, August 27, 2016", "text": "Living in a small town that has its own Facebook page has its advantages.  Today a town resident asked if anyone would like their surplus of tomatoes and green beans from their garden. Several people have posted similar questions to the group over the past few weeks, but I've never responded quick enough to be the recipient of this freebie. Today, my luck changed and I got about 20 beautiful ripe tomatoes, and a grocery bag full of green beans.  I was so grateful and excited to have the fresh vegetables!  But I knew I'd been given more than we needed.  So, when I passed a friends house and saw that she was home, I decided to turn around and share them with her and her family.  Like me, she really appreciated the generosity of a local gardener.  There's nothing like fresh vegetables!~Part of my free veggies!~Today was also the day that Max saw the orthopedic surgeon for a consultation.~Max waiting his turn~The good news is that the x-rays showed that Max has great hips.  Unfortunately, the news for his knee wasn't that good.  He has a torn ACL on his left knee. I have to say, this doesn't come as much of a surprise.  Everyone who has seen him has agreed that he favors it.The surgeon is recommending a TPLO (tibial plateau leveling osteotomy). Since Max is a \"foster dog\" the board of the rescue will decide what the next step will be.  I have no reason whatsoever to think the surgery won't be approved. At 6-years old, Max is a relatively young dog, with (hopefully) many good and active years ahead.As this week comes to an end, as many of you may know, it's National Dog Day.  Sunny (below) doesn't care what day it is, he wanted away from the camera and back inside. ~Jake, Cissy and camera shy Sunny~But the day was created \"to celebrate all breeds, pure and mixed and serves to help galvanize the public to recognize the number of dogs that need to be rescued each year, either from public shelters, rescues and pure breed rescues.\" ~Deizel and Charlie sharing a moment~I think that description means that at our house every day is National Dog Day."},
{"title": "A Dog First! ", "date": "Sunday, August 21, 2016", "text": "Last week is in our rearview mirror, and a new week is ready to begin.Deizel had his eyes evaluated, and its been decided to not remove the cataracts. For one, surgery to remove them is very expensive.  Second and what counts the most, is that Deizel has adapted to being blind.  I was reminded in an article that I read, that Deizel is a dog first, and blind second. I've been putting his blindness first.  But yesterday when I watched him run along the fence with Todd as Carl mowed the grass on the other side, it put things into the right order -- Deizel is a dog first. This past week also has Josh on a medication that we've been talking about trying for a few months.  It's called \"Adequan\" and it's used to control symptoms associated with degenerative or traumatic arthritis -- Which is what Josh has.  It's an expensive medication initially because it requires 8 injections.  But we've been able to offset the cost because of the gifts from two kind blogging friends. I am hopeful it will help make a difference in his ability to get up by himself.Speaking of getting around, today marks a milestone. It is exactly two-hundred days since Jake left the shelter and arrived here at Golden Pines.  He could not be getting around any better, and we could not be happier for how well he's doing, and how happy he is. ~Jake, 200 days and counting!~Of course thrown into the week there's always the comic relief of Todd. I found a snakeskin in our yard a couple of days ago. It made me a little squeamish, but it didn't stop me from showing it to Todd and Charlie who were curious about it.  And well, as is obvious in the video, Todd surprised me at the end, and gave me a good laugh.   I hope you've had a good weekend!"},

{"title": "Memories of Sheba ", "date": "Saturday, August 13, 2016", "text": "Sheba came to us in the fall of 2005 She was a nearly one year old girl, given up by her family because she needed hip surgery.  Below is a picture taken the first day we met her.In looking through all the photos of Sheba, I can't help but notice what a good friend she was to all of our dogs. Sheba and Charlie in particular were good friends.  I wish I had some good photos of the two of them together. Sheba was mentored by some of the best dogs we had. Rudi our packleader was one of them. She left us in 2011 and in so many pictures of Rudi, Sheba was there with her. Below is a fun memory of the two of them rolling on a dead mole.They both loved the same games. And sometimes it could be hard to tell them apart. Rudi was clearly the \"top dog\" in our crew. But Sheba would struggle with her place in the pack. She got into several fights with our girl CarrieAnne, and often she got the worst of it.When Rudi passed away, it got worse. The fighting became a serious issue and I really considered rehoming Sheba.  I'm not sure when, how or what exactly changed but eventually the two worked it out.  Sheba and CarrieAnne became good companions to one another, and were always running, playing and exploring together.Through the additions and subtractions, Sheba welcomed each and every one. Charlie may have been her first love, but Todd also had a special place.  The two of them were often together.Sheba enjoyed a life of good health.Her love of retrieving and carrying things in her mouth, tennis balls and games of frisbee never changedPlaying tug with Josh, or chasing Todd was great fun for her too.In any weather, Sheba wanted to play. Sheba was an affectionate dog that loved \"grown up people\"as much as she loved other dogs. She was the perfect dog to take on a walk or on a road trip and to tell your secrets too. Sheba had a quiet and calming spirit that had a way of always making me feel better on my worst days.    I loved having her with me when I picked blackberries we have on our property.  Sheba always let me know when they were ripe, and it was a race to get to them before she did.Sheba also loved to eat the pears right off our tree, even if they weren't ripe. I really think she had more of them than we did.  And I was okay with that. Sheba almost always did as she was asked, and if she didn't want to do it, she would just lay there and wait for US to change our mind.  She was another dog that knew the rules didn't apply to her. I don't know when I noticed that Sheba was getting older.  To me, she had always been that young dog that I'd met so many years ago.  When I noticed her face turning white, I cheered on the inside because having a \"senior girl\" just seemed to complete our crew.I did however, notice that she was slowing down the last few weeks.  But I shrugged it off thinking it was just the heat.  But as you may have read in our last post, that wasn't it at all.  The diagnosis this past Monday of cardiac hemangiosarcoma was totally unexpected. I'd hoped for more days of grace for her, especially when she seemed to be feeling so much better. When Thursday started out as a good day for her, I never had any thought that our time together would end so suddenly. That morning Sheba was in good spirits, and she was happy as she rolled in the grass...and she carried the ball around and was wagging her tail. Below is the last picture I took of Sheba.  If I'd known it was going to be the last photo I would take of her, I would have taken a few more. But I remain grateful and thankful for the nearly 11 years we had together.  Even in my sadness and heartbreak, I am grateful for the gift of her love in our lives. By having Sheba, as well as the other dogs I have found that my fear of death has been lessened -- Because if death means finally joining Sheba and the others who have gone before her, then let it happen when it will.But until that time comes, I'll treasure all of my memories of a dog that was a great friend and family member."},
{"title": "An Unexpected Good-Bye to Sheba", "date": "Friday, August 12, 2016", "text": "You might have noticed, it has been very quiet around here for more than a week. I would love to say that we have just been on a long needed vacation, but the reality is a bit different. And I'll just say that we've had what I think, are a few more than our share of curve-balls thrown at us. The most recent one is Sheba.  I've been trying to write this very post since Monday.  But the words haven't come.  Perhaps because deep down inside I thought that if I wrote the words it would make what was happening so much more real. But now I am faced with the sad reality that today brought the loss of our precious Sheba.  It began this past Sunday when she collapsed.  I found her laying in the grass. At first I thought she was just resting, so I took a few pictures as I walked over to her.  She was so perfectly still and her eyes were closed,.Her gums were pale, and when Carl and I got her onto her feet after several minutes, she had \"waste\" all over her. We helped her back to the house where we gave her a quick bath.  After a couple of hours, she seemed brighter, and her gum-color had improved and she seemed fine. A blur of events would follow with a visit from Mobile Vet on Monday morning, who after taking several x-rays, sent us to see a veterinary cardiologist because Sheba's heart appeared to be enlarged. The EKG indicated what an ultrasound confirmed, and that was that Sheba had a tumor on her heart.  We were given the grim diagnosis of cardiac-hemangiosarcoma, or cancer of the heart. I was told Sheba could have hours, days, weeks, or maybe months, but not much more.  I tried to remain optimistic, and it helped that by Tuesday Sheba was herself.  I'd started her on a herbal supplement called Yunnan Baiyao which is a hemostatic powdered medicine famous for being carried by the Vietcong to stop bleeding during the Vietnam War. It appeared to be helping because her gum/tongue color was good, and her appetite had returned.  She was tiring easier, but she was up and around and was happy.Today began normally.  With the week we'd been having, I was looking forward to being home and relaxing.  I got the dogs out early, and Sheba was eager to play with a ball, and she rolled in the grass.~Sheba rolling in the grass this morning~I took a few pictures, and noticed how happy she seemed.  I ran a couple of short errands and came home, to let the dogs out for a 2nd walk before we settled in at home for the day.~A Last Photo of Sheba this morning~In the driveway Sheba came running towards me with the ball in her mouth, and suddenly collapsed in front of me. I knew what was happening, and did my best to calm her, and try and slow her breathing.  I gave her another herb called  'Bao Xian Zi'. that is dubbed the 'emergency', 'rescue', and 'insurance' pill to stop any hemorrhaging. But it didn't help. I'm not sure how much time passed, but finally her breathing slowed a little, and as she was able to look at me. In that moment, as hard as I was praying for more time and asking her not to go, I knew it was not to be. I also knew that if I waited, Sheba would leave this life on her own.  But I didn't want her to suffer any longer, so I called my (old) vets office, and said I was on my way with her. Shortly after 1 o'clock this afternoon, Sheba quietly and peacefully left us for the Rainbow Bridge. Our nearly 11 years with Sheba passed much too quickly.  I was remembering this week why we adopted Sheba from the rescue all those years ago -- And it was because of Charlie.  He loved her.  We used to joke that Charlie thought we'd gotten her for him because they were instant and inseparable good friends.  Keeping her for Charlie may have been true at the time, but Sheba truly became a friend to all of us. Her unexpected loss leaves a hug gap in our lives that will never again be filled. Tonight as I write this, I have searched to find the words to say how much she'll be missed.  But there are no words.  Just the emptiness because she's gone.  God speed to my beautiful canine sister, Sheba.  Missy, you were truly a once in a lifetime dog, friend and companion and we feel so lucky to have had you as part of our lives."},

Getting him to leave the kitchen is being met with a lot of resistance. Of course it goes without saying that we'll keep working at it and we'll figure it out together.But if anyone has any advice on how to make the transition easier for Deizel, we're listening!  All of us except Max -- When he's not hiding in the tub, he's busy watching television."},

It could not be more perfect.  The below e-mail that I received this evening confirms those thoughts.Hi Kim,    We have had a wonderful day with Bella! The ride home was uneventful and, after a brief mid-day walk, we all had a short nap. Then, Bella spent the afternoon either with Dick watching TV or with me in the office. She was very content to nap with an occasional raising of her head to confirm that we were just a few feet away. After dinner, she had a walk with Dick where she met several neighbors, who all fell in love with her.Then it was back to the house where she now is lying at our feet while we are watching a PBS mystery program.   All in all, Bella's first day with us exceeded our expectations.     She said to tell you and her four-legged friends that all is well and to be happy for her because she thinks she has found her forever home.      Best wishes from the three of us,          JudyI hope for many good days like this for Bella.  I will and do miss her.   Bella on the first day we met her.  She was tired and not feeling well."},

The very first morning he was totally off of a leash and not dragging one behind him, he ran off after a rabbit.  He was so beautiful as he ran across the yard and into the woods. Because I had slow-pokes George and Jake on leads, I couldn't go after him.  All I could do was stand there and watch him disappear.  Fortunately, I also worked on Sunny's recall and he came back to me, his eyes all sparkling and happy.Charlie is all dressed up.  He has a skin infection and is on antibiotics.  He's not loving the new look.  So I took off the shirt, and he's a little happier. Axel, our foster boy for Lab Rescue, went to his new home on Thursday.  I'll admit, he was another dog that I was on the fence about keeping. We were all crazy about him! But a retired couple that lives on the Maryland shore offered him a chance at a good life of fun and lots of family.  The report today was that Axel had met all the grandchildren, their dogs, and he was loving being able to play in the water.  Retired Dog-Mom doesn't think that his tail has stopped wagging.~Axel will be missed  and not forgotten!~ Axel's dog bed didn't have time to get cold.  On Friday we welcomed a new addition named Webster from Lab Rescue.  Just as a coincidence he came from the same shelter in West Virginia that Axel did.  But it's thought that all the changes and boarding proved to be too stressful for him, because he ended up with bloat, and had emergency surgery on Monday. Unfortunately he wasn't getting along well with our crew.  He was very reactive around the dogs every time they came near him and it was getting worse. All the dogs just ignored him. But Lab Rescue and I agreed that it would be best if a new foster home was found for Webster.  I'm grateful that on a holiday weekend a new one was found that he could be taken to this afternoon. I felt badly that it didn't work out.  But Webster really needed a quiet place to recover from his bloat-surgery, and as an only dog in his new foster home, he'll get that chance.~Webster, we hardly got to know him~Through the stress of the last couple of days, I was really proud of Todd.  He's always ready to rumble but did as I asked when I told him to \"go on\" when Webster was barking at him -- Even though I could tell he was hesitating and having to think about it.

Crickett had been the treasured companion of \"Flossie\" who had passed away.  When Flossie was in hospice care, her niece had taken Crickett to visit her, and she promised Flossie that she would make sure Crickett had a good home after she was gone.The Niece and I met when she turned Crickett over to the rescue.  We became fast friends, and The Niece would often contact me asking how Crickett was doing.  When Crickett passed away in January of 2015 we met afterwards and shared her loss; finding comfort that Flossie and Crickett were together again.  Knowing how loved and adored Crickett was by the entire family, I felt strongly that they should have her cremated remains, and so I gave them to The Niece.   Fast forward to Sunday, and a lovely headstone (below) has just been put into place for Flossie and her husband. We were invited to a memorial service where family members gathered to remember them both and celebrate what would have been Flossie's 90th birthday. And it took a little bit of doing, but in the same resting place as Flossie, there is also a new smaller marker for Crickett -- Her ashes are now buried with Flossie.  Beloved pet and owner truly together again.  Just exactly how it should be, and how Flossie would have wanted it.

With my eyes off the computer screen, on Thursday my eyes caught this little one wandering around our yard.  Smaller than a can of soda, I worried that he was too young to be adventuring on his own.  I called a wildlife rehab center and they told me that indeed he was. They told me to catch him (I have a net) and bring him into them if I see him again.  Fortunately I haven't, and I'm hopeful that he had just wandered a little too far away from his family and they've moved on.This weekends highlight has been meeting good friends at a nearby winery for a picnic and wine tasting.  It was an enjoyable and relaxing afternoon,It was just what we needed, and I so hope we are back on track for the coming week!~Bella~With our internet problems, I'm sorry I've not been able to drop by your blogs -- I look forward to catching up on your news! ~Our foster cat, Mo is *still* with us~"},

Then Wednesday morning came and we sat on the porch together, I asked Dusty (and the cosmos) to let me know if it was time for him to go.  In the early morning there was nothing but silence as he quietly slept next to me.  I took the other dogs for a walk a few minutes later and it began to rain.  In the west, I saw a rainbow.  Some will say that it was just a coincidence that I'd see one.  But for me, seeing it before 6 o'clock in the morning, once again confirmed what my heart already knew.~January 2016~Dusty came to us in August of 2015.  He'd been given up by an elderly couple earlier that year after a car accident left them unable to care for him.  At the shelter, Dusty caught the eye of a mother grieving the loss of her son who had committed suicide.  By late summer her heart had healed enough that she felt she was ready to move on with her life, and so she gave Dusty to the rescue.At Golden Pines, Dusty found his place in our home.  Inside he was a very quiet and unassuming Golden, that would gently nudge my arm for attention and twirl in circles at mealtime.  Outside from Todd, he learned to bark at the fence at whatever happened past. His most content times were when he was laying in the grass.  The last few weeks he seemed to gain strength from the warm sun, and never wanted to come inside.  This morning we had Dusty outside for the last time, and as he stood there in the bright warm summer sun, he raised his nose and sniffed the air before he collapsed onto the ground -- His strength to continue was gone.  I couldn't help think of the words another blogger had written about their own dog, \"He stood tall but this morning the grass grew taller.\" ~September 2015~The Mobile Vet would come shortly afterwards, and we said our good-byes on the front porch that he loved. ~Dusty sleeping on the porch in 2015~A wren landed at the other end of the porch and started singing just as Dusty was leaving this life for the next -- Reminding me that there are other worlds to sing in. He is now free and no longer in pain.  I am grateful to have had the chance to get to know Dusty and to have had him as part of our lives for 10 months.  I will look forward to seeing him again one day; he will be missed and not forgotten. Our candle has been lit all day to help him find his way to the Rainbow Bridge, where I know he was greeted by all those who have gone before him.    God-speed my \"DUSTy-Bunny.\""},

Axel has come to us from a shelter in Charleston, West Virginia.  He'd been taken there by his owners who no longer wanted him.  The shelter reached out to the Lab Rescue of Cincinnati Ohio and asked if they could take him.  Unfortunately they are \"full\" and were unable to accept him into their program.  It's not uncommon for neighboring rescues to help one another and so Lab Rescue of Cincinnati contacted Lab Rescue here in Virginia, and the trip of more than 300 miles (400+ kilometers) was arranged and Axel arrived last week. Although it appears that he doesn't know any commands (sit, etc) he makes up for it with his charm and affectionate personality and that he gets along great with the other dogs and ignores the cats.  If we've had any problems at all, it's that he's showing some separation anxiety. He is getting better making me think that it mostly has to do with the unsurety of what's happening to him, along with being isolated in the shelter and in boarding. All in all, I think he's going to be just fine until his forever home finds him.What has found us this weekend is high heat and humidity.  Summer is really here.  And from here on our front porch to yours....I hope you're having a good weekend!"},

The majority of tumors like this one appears to be, invade the bony structures of the jaw and even with very aggressive surgical measures, complete resection (removal) can be difficult.  George is about 14 years old, and so it is a lot to think about.~Bella standing, Jake, Josh and George this afternoon~And finally, just because Lab Rescue asked nicely, last evening we welcomed a 6-9 year old Lab named Axel.

In the morning she'll bark once at about 5:00 to let us know she's awake.  If we try to \"encourage her\" to get up and go outside, she'll growl.  A moment later, she's there and wants to be let out.  Once outside, you can't really tell her what to do, she is off lead, and so Cissy goes where Cissy wants, and comes back inside when she's ready.  She doesn't usually wander off, so this isn't a problem.  And today was no different.  I called her to come. and she just looked over her shoulder at me.Then she sat for a few more minutes as if she was enjoying the view.  Maybe she was.  I can't help but chuckle at Cissy's canine independence that knows that a lot of the rules don't apply to her.

Each day I marvel and am so grateful for how well he's getting around and that he's not letting his diagnosis of spondylosis slow him down.It was also a lucky day for Lady, our foster girl for Lab Rescue.  I was caught off guard by phone call this afternoon from an adoption coordinator from the rescue telling me about applicants who are very interested in meeting Lady.  I received a call from \"retired couple\" and I chatted with \"former teacher\" on the phone for about an hour.  My first impression of her is that she could not be more kind and gracious.  She has had Labs for 50 years, and got choked up telling me that they have been dog-less since they lost their yellow lab last year.  Former Teacher sounded so excited about the prospect that if it goes well when they come tomorrow afternoon, Lady would be going home with them. ~Josh, Jake and Lady~Of course it goes without saying that I'm very fond of Lady. She is a dog of great character, attitude and spark.  But she is another dog that I feel that we're the \"gateway\" to get her to where she's supposed to go.

And Retired Couple certainly check all those boxes and then some - They loved her, and as you can see in the photo below, the feeling was mutual!   ~Is love in the air with Bella and Retired Couple?~The only glitch is that the husband is having a hip replacement surgery between now and the middle of June, so they wouldn't be able to adopt Bella until early July.  I asked the adoption coordinator from the rescue her thoughts, and she is suggesting to say to them that \"IF she's still available when they're ready, I would love to place Bella with them. However, I need to remember to keep Bella's options open until its time for her adoption.\"  The Adoption Coordinator is right. I can't imagine anyone else better than Retired Couple who would be more perfect for Bella. But for now I guess we wait and see what happens.  Until we know, Bella is fine here with us, as she waits and dreams about her very own forever home. I wonder what Todd dreams about?"},

In the photo below you'll notice that Jake and Josh (on the right) ) are looking a bit like twins.At 14 years old, Josh's arthritis is starting to take a toll on him and he often needs help getting up on his feet.  Acupuncture and cold laser don't seem to be helping, but the daily pain medications are easing his discomfort.  To help him to stand up and keep him mobile he needed and I wanted a harness.  The one I have and like the best is being used by Jake, so I needed to order another one.  Unknown to me, back in January, another blogger (who I will let remain anonymous) sent us an online gift that I didn't find out about it until I decided to get a harness for Josh - And Her generous gift was the exact amount I needed to buy it -- It was meant to be!  I cannot thank \"Her\" enough for thinking of us and making a difference for Josh, as well as the others that will use the harness after him.I've no doubt Todd would agree -- But for now he just thinks it's funny that they're wearing matching outfits!"},

Sunny developed a large lump on his chin. Getting in touch with and arranging a time with our new \"mobile vet\" proved to be a bit of a challenge. We were finally able to meet him in a parking lot.  Mobile Vet doesn't think it's tooth related, but rather from an injury on his cheek that's gotten infected.  Sunny thanked Mobile Vet for seeing him by snapping at him.  Mobile Vet returned the gesture by giving Sunny 2 antibiotics that are upsetting his stomach. But the medications are working, and the lump is much smaller.~A rare photo of camera-phobic-Sunny through the window~Not to be outdone Jake also has an upset stomach.  I'm not sure what's caused it.  But after a couple of nights of letting him outside several times, along with a bland diet I can tell he's feeling better.  Usually single-parenting and dogs with upset stomachs aren't a problem.  However, I was also pretty under the weather this last week and stayed home from work.  Something I never do.However, today I am finally feeling better -- But how could I not with this kind of Scottie-comic-relief?

One day during a lunch break, they have a \"Rescue Parade.\" If you've never seen a rescue parade, and you get the chance, you need to go.  If not, you're missing out on what I think is something special.  As you can guess, the parade features dogs that have been rescued.  As their names are called, their age and rescue story is told as they walk around the show-ring. I have seen many rescue parades, and have even helped to organized them, but I've never actually been in one.  Until this week because I entered George.This parade began with the several Labs, some who were trained by inmates, and are now working in drug-enforcement.  How wonderful that these dogs that came into the rescue, who may not have been suitable for the typical home because of their energy and overactive instincts have been given the chance to truly make a difference!After the \"working dogs\" it was George's turn.  It's usually done by age, so at 14ish years old, he was the oldest in the parade.  I've decided that if George has a bucket-list, he can now check off walking around the show ring, receiving applause from a crowd and getting a rosette. In my book, George really is the best in show!  I hope you have a good weekend!!"},

At the time, the holidays were on the horizon, so I decided to wait.  Well, of course Charlie's teeth weren't getting any better, and so today was the day I'd planned to have them taken care of.  My vet that I've been going to for about 10 years is leaving the area, and I've been slowly getting to know a new one, closer to home.  Actually, this vet comes right to our house, so it works out pretty well.  \"New Vet\" is a man, which is a change -- For whatever reason, all my vets have been women, so this may take a little getting used to.   But I think there's no better way to break in a new vet than to have them do surgery on one of your treasured family members.  I'm always nervous anytime one of the dogs has to be put under anesthesia.  It was a little more nerve wracking because I was inside looking out and waiting.  From start to finish the procedure took a little more than 3 hours. Unfortunately, more of Charlie's teeth needed to be removed than we'd first thought.  But at the end of the day, he's still a bit groggy, but doing pretty well.  He ate a little dinner, and I think he'll be fine.  For that, I'm grateful.~A Very Sleepy and Groggy Charlie~"},

The water tower that the buzzards took up residence on is very near a subdivision.  And so the town council consulted with an expert to help resolve the problem.  I'm not sure who this \"expert\" is or where they found him, but they were told that turkey-buzzards are afraid of Orca whales.  Yes, Orca whales.  How they know that is anyone's guess.So, on Tuesday afternoon, despite high winds, what the town has dubbed  Operation “Fly Willy” began with the town mayor himself climbing to the top of the water tower to attach three orca whales (Humphrey, Moby Dick and of course Willy) onto the railing of the water tank to try and scare the turkey-vultures away. All that the town could do was wait and see if it would work.Well, big surprise, it didn't!  The buzzards returned that very evening, just as they always did.  And believe me, social media was lit up with jokes about the whole thing!   But it's only because I think, it's the craziest and most far-fetched thing I've ever heard of and seen.  Thank-goodness things are normal at my house....

Do you think you've answered correctly? Well, lets see.Question 1.  If you answered Todd, you would be right, he's done this before, but the answer for this week was actually Cissy.  I gave her a kiss on the nose, and she turned around, plopped down onto a dog bed and started rubbing her face. ~Cissy, a kissable nose!~ Question 2.  If you think it's Todd, you would be almost right again.  Even though he knows better, sometimes he just can't resist.  But for this week, the culprit is newcomer Jake.  He's still unsteady on his feet, but he tries to chase the kitten, so we're working on teaching him that the cats are to be watched and not chased.~Jake had no idea chasing cats could be such great fun!~Question 3.  If you answered Todd, you would be right, yet again.  He likes being outside any time day or night!  But this week, it's Sunny.  For whatever reason, he's decided that he likes to just sit outside.  I don't know if I should worry about his doing this or not.  Thoughts?~A blurry Sunny after dark~ Question 4.  If you answered Todd, you would be wrong about this!  When the clock-radio comes on, Todd is a slow-riser.  He stretches, yawns and rolls on the bed and likes to be scratched and talked to first -- But when his feet hit the floor, he's all business, fully charged and more than ready to go!~Todd, a little slow first thing in the morning, but once he gets going....~HOWEVER, Cissy is our dog-alarm-clock.  She knows when it's 5:30, and I think that we could set our clock by her internal one.  She's like Todd, always ready to go and get the day going!Question 5.  If you answered Todd, add that to your \"got it right\" column!  Todd will eat just about anything, but he doesn't like \"that raw stuff\" but he will eat raw carrots.  I did introduce Jake to fruits this week.  It's easy to see that he's a little confused about what he's supposed to do with an apple or orange slice.

It was once again Jake's turn for a follow up appointment.  The Holistic vet came yesterday to do acupuncture and cold laser therapy for Jake and Josh.  I was anxious for Dr. E to see Jake.  Last time she saw him, it had taken both of us just to get him outside because he could barely walk or stand up on his own.  Two weeks later, thanks to the medications, rest, and (especially) your good vibes and the POTP, Jake is now up on his feet and getting around pretty well!  He still sometimes needs help getting onto his feet and keeping his balance, but there is no doubt that he feels much better!  Both my vets are really pleased at how well he's doing, and how much happier he seems! The vet visit wore Jake out, and he slept through the errands afterwards. On my way home, I decided to make a slight detour.  A couple of weeks ago, I was really intrigued by a story I came across about a deserted plantation not far from where I live. From a distance, the 110-year-old mansion known as Selma retains much of its grandeur and charm.  Preservationists say the far-off view of the mansion, which is on the list of endangered historic sites in Virginia, belies what sits inside: the ravages of time. With its three stucco-covered stories nestled against Catoctin Mountain and a portico entrance with Roman Doric columns, it is a pristine picture of the Old South.Taking away from its beauty are newer homes which surround it.  However, it is on a 50-acre conservancy lot, which means the property can't be subdivided.  But unfortunately, there is no protection for the home itself. Some of the out buildings are still standing as well.The former plantation was best known as the home of Armistead Thomson Mason (1787– 1819), a U.S. Senator from Virginia.  He built the original house and lived there until he was killed in a duel in 1819. His widow and young son stayed on until a change in fortunes forced them to sell. The original house was destroyed by fire in the 1890s and the current mansion was built in the early 1900s. Despite passing through several owners and developers, nothing seems to come of efforts to bring life back to Selma.  I think this is really sad, because there's no denying its historic beauty.And because there is no doubt, that just like Jake, it's worth rescuing."},

Or maybe .....  ...He just doesn't want to wear a coat.  Maybe both! But despite the cold, there were still errands to run.  One errand we had today was to \"swap out\" one foster cat with another. Almost two weeks ago, a lovely kitty named Scarlet arrived. ~Scarlet, we hardly got to know her~Today, as she went off to her new home, a little boy named \"Mohawk\" took her place.  I don't know where they get these names from.  But I had to grin that the rescue that our cat, the lovely Ms. Yellow came from, also featured a cat named \"Mohawk\".  Is that a trending name for cats? ~New boy, Mohawk~Even with a new arrival, it was a quiet day at home.  These days, I think of winter as a restful time. ~Josh~A time to take stock, and build up some reserves.

While I was at work.... If it's still bothering him, he's not showing it.~Hurt shoulder? What hurt shoulder?~This week I had a call from Lab Rescue about Sherlock/Reggie.  Apparently someone was perusing the rescue's website, and saw his photos.  Their dog was stolen 3 years ago, and they think that Sherlock/Reggie looks exactly like their dog.  With no microchip, the only way they can identify their dog is by a lump on the muzzle.  I was asked to look for a lump and call him by the name of Sam.  I looked Reggie over really well.  I even checked for scar tissue in case a lump may have been removed.  I found nothing.  He didn't respond to the name Sam.  Of course he doesn't respond to Sherlock or Reggie either.  But I don't think the dog I call Reggie is their dog.  I feel badly that their dog was stolen, and that after 3 years, they're still looking and no doubt wondering what happened to their dog.  Lab rescue will let me know if anything more becomes of their inquiry. **As a caveat, I'll add that Lab Rescue owns Reggie/Sherlock legally.  He did his hold and \"stray time\" in a shelter, and was turned over to them after that time was up.   ~Reggie, Sherlock, or Sam?~Finally, thank-you all for your good vibes and POTP for our new boy, Jake, they are truly making a difference!  He's settled into his new life and routine nicely this week.  He's still unable to get to his feet without help.

Jake and I were up and on the road early to see our primary vet.  Jake was nervous and shaking during the whole drive.  I felt badly for him.  With his world having been totally turned upside down, I had to wonder what he may have been thinking.  Once at the vet, the fuss the staff made over him, quickly reassured him that he was going to be okay. X-Rays were taken and very soon we had a diagnosis for Jake. Jake has \"degenerative spinal stenosis.\"  It's a painful condition caused by excessive bone formation in the spine, which causes a narrowing of the spinal column and puts pressure on the spinal cord.  It's a progressive and debilitating disease, and there is no \"cure.\"  My vet, said it was the worse case she'd ever seen.  So we are going to try to relieve the inflammation along the spinal cord with a steroid, heavily restrict his activity for a month, (because we don't want to chance having a ruptured disc), put him on pain medications, and ask for you to send some good vibes for him.  Our hope is that by reducing the inflammation, it will improve his ability to get around, and give him a good quality of life for whatever time he has left.  If this doesn't work, the reality is, is that a decision about letting Jake go may have to be made.  But I do not want to think about that right now.  Jake seems happy and is settling in nicely.  So, the rescue and I feel strongly that we have to give him the chance that his previous owner wasn't willing to give him. Thanks for sending your good vibes for Jake!"},

Thankfully the vet that did acupuncture and cold laser therapy for our boy Gus last year, was coming to see Josh today -- The timing of Dr. E coming could not have been more perfect.  She helped me get Jake outside, and did a thorough assessment of his condition.  She's recommending he see a primary vet for spinal x-rays and blood work to decide the next steps to take.  Jake is now fitted for a \"Help-em-up\" harness, which is a big help in getting him onto his feet and outside.  He already seems like he's feeling more confident outside now, and was trying to play and acting silly when we had him out.  Good signs!   The rescue of course approved the vet care, and Jake has an appointment with my vet on Saturday morning.  Paws crossed for our newest arrival!"},

Then said he'd come on Tuesday.  After waiting all day, he finally said he couldn't come at all.  Frustration because of two wasted days. ~A skeptical Sunny watching the camera~More calls on Wednesday and Carl found two people who would come, but each were charging a \"trip fee\" of $250 (!!) and the other, $150.  This fee did not include the $100-150 an hour just to plow the driveway.  Needless to say, we were feeling a lot of things -- overcharged and gouged to name two.  Added to that, they both wanted cash, and wouldn't take a check or credit card.  I'd returned to work on Wednesday and Carl who was home, didn't have enough cash on hand.  So, with that, warmer temps and the snow melting, he decided to do it on his own.  He had pretty much just started shoveling when someone with a tractor and plow stopped and offered to help.  He refused any money and only wanted something to drink -- In 20 about minutes our driveway was cleared!  Needless to say, we were both most grateful for the help of a good samaritan -- Who wasn't in it for money.Today, I'm feeling relieved that our driveway is clear.

So putting that aside, I decided to keep an open mind about them.  I did like them well enough, but their house has two stories, and because of Sherlock/Reggie's weakness in his rear-end,  he's unable to do a flight of steps.  So with that, I told them I felt they weren't a good match for Sherlock/Reggie, and I'm glad that Lab Rescue agreed.~Sherlock, or Reggie as we call him~On the feline side of our household, I decided to  make \"Flurry\" available for adoption. I think that if he stayed here, he and the lovely Ms. Yellow would eventually work out their differences.     But with that aside, if I've learned anything in the past 6 months in fostering cats, is that there's no shortage of them.  I'd like to be able to help the rescue again if needed, and keeping Flurry may not make that possible.  He was put onto their website, and now the SPCA says they have three \"good\" applicants for him.  One is coming this weekend to meet him, so we may be saying good boy to this little boy. Back to the canine side, Todd doesn't care whatsoever about who may be leaving.  Today he was pretty concerned about what was arriving -- An unexpected package from our friend Sugar and her Mom that was full of treats -- What a nice surprise!  While the others stood nearby, because Todd \"insisted,\" he got to inspect the package first.Dog treats are (of course) highly valued at our house, and are always enjoyed and devoured too!  (If you don't know Sugar, the Golden Retriever, stop by her blog, (click here) she and her Mom are truly the best!) We hope you're having \"the best\" week too!  ~Charlie~"},

{"title": "Sherlock, Bella and a Ball ", "date": "Thursday, December 10, 2015", "text": "A typical week at our house, with all the usual busyness of work and commuting and trying to get ready for Christmas. Behind the scenes I've been talking to Lab Rescue about Sherlock (who's having an identity crisis because I keep calling him Reggie). I've also been discussing Bella with the Golden Retriever Rescue.~Bella~With Sherlock (Reggie?) because he's just the second dog I've had for Lab Rescue, and I've never personally met anyone from the rescue, I don't know really what to expect and how they manage dogs with issues like Sherlock has. Are they willing to provide whatever is needed, or do they have a limit as to what they will do?  Of course they don't really know me either. So, maybe we're each treading a little lightly.  The approach seemed to work in my phone conversations with them this week.  Its been decided that we'll put Sherlock on the anti-inflammatory medications and supplements to see if that makes a difference for him.  After the holidays we're going to add in either swim therapy or acupuncture. I agree with that, but what I don't agree with, is to letting him remain available for adoption while this is all worked through.  But it's a decision I can live with.   For Bella, it's a bit more complicated. It's time to make a decision about her remaining with us permanently and the rescue continuing to cover her medical expenses, or finding another home for her. Of course I would love for her to stay here. But as much as we care about Bella, we need to consider the dogs that we own and their expenses.  I personally know several on the board of the rescue and know them to be fair and always having the best interest of the dogs in mind as decisions are made.  All this will be needed when considering Bella,  Her \"diva moments\" where she lets us know that she doesn't want any dogs or even cats around her, is a concern.  Its lessened over time with us, but I worry about  her behavior unintentionally being allowed to escalate in another home.  Added to that is Bella's inability to do steps, and tripping over her back legs when she tries to run. Those things together, make her a challenge to find a home for. And if one was found, is it what's best for her?  The board of the rescue will have to decide, and I'll support that decision.  Todd on the flip side has no interest whatsoever in \"rescue politics.\"  His only concern yesterday was the early Christmas present that he refuses to share or give up.  Todd wouldn't give it to me, and kept it close by, insisting on taking it to bed with him last night. When I moved it to the nightstand, he would have none of that, and wanted it back.  Just like a kid with a new toy, he wanted it by his side as he slept.  Of course I let him have his way."},
{"title": "A Glimpse Into Sherlock's Past", "date": "Saturday, December 5, 2015", "text": "An early start on a cold frosty morning with temperatures just below freezing to take Sherlock to the vet.You may recall I've been concerned that he doesn't shift weight onto a back leg. I've not ever taken any dogs to this particular practice in Maryland, so I wasn't sure what to expect.The vet reminded me more of a drill sergeant than a vet because she was all business and no nonsense.  Getting right to the point after examining Sherlock, she told me to \"go back to the waiting area while x-rays were done, and to leave the door open to the examining room.\"  About an hour later I was asked by the Drill Sergeant Vet to come to the back and get Sherlock and review the films. The Drill Sergeant had already called Lab Rescue and discussed everything with them. She quickly reviewed everything with me, told me to return in 4-5 weeks for a revaluation, told the techs what medications to dispense for Sherlock, and said \"she needed to get caught up,\" and with that, we were done.It's said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and that's so true about the x-rays that were taken of Sherlock today, that gave us a glimpse into his past.  At some point in his life, he had a broken pelvis that was (probably) caused by getting hit by a car. Injuries to a dogs pelvis are typically allowed to heal by being confined. But as dogs age, the healed injury can lead to arthritis, and compressed vertebrae in the spine.  That's what's happened with Sherlock and caused his muscles to atrophy in his back legs. The Drill Sergeant Vet thinks there isn't anything that can be done for him other than palliative care to help maintain his quality of life.  I'm not sure what Lab Rescue does in these instances, so I'll need to discuss everything with them. But there's no rush, and Sherlock who is still sleepy from the anesthetic, isn't in a hurry either.So, while Todd is checking to see if there's more digging that can be done in a place that he's dug up more times than we can count.... I hope you're enjoying your weekend!~Sheba modeling our wreath~"},

On both Monday and Tuesday night I was up in the early morning hours letting him out and cleaning up.I was trying every remedy I have in my bag of tricks for Dusty, hoping that by Wednesday he would feel better. Unfortunately, nothing seemed to be working, and by the time I was ready to leave for work yesterday, he seemed to be a little worse. Dusty needed a bath, so I quickly gave him one, and did something I never do, and that was to call my vet and let them know I was on my way with him -- But not before I pulled over in rush hour traffic, in the pouring rain to get Dusty cleaned up the best I could and put down clean towels for him. At the vets office, because I'd already started him on a medication I had on hand (metronidazole) the vet wasn't recommending doing much more than giving him fluids. After we left the vets office, I was feeling really worn out, and so I did a second thing I hardly ever do, and that was to call my office and tell them I wouldn't be coming in.  I really just wanted to go home, but Dusty also needed another bath.  I stopped at a nearby shop and told them about Dusty, and they generously donated everything he needed for a good bath. They had done that before for Cissy, and I so appreciated their doing that for Dusty as well.Once home we settled in for a quiet day at home.  After a good nights sleep for both of us, today our weather is again mimicking how Dusty is feeling; the clouds are clearing and the sun is trying to shine.  He is feeling better!"},

I'm still trying to decide about his hearing.  I'm pretty convinced that he can't hear much if anything.  I also think that he's afraid of getting left outside because he'll go out, \"do his business\" and come back to the door to be let back in pretty quickly. This shows that Sherlock has at some point, lived inside.  He knows all about sleeping by a bed, and that the refrigerator is where the food is. Sherlock also knows about begging and how to endear himself; he'll rest his head on my leg and just look up at me with his big, hopeful eyes.  I'll pet him and tell him \"he's a good boy\"  Then he'll go and lay down.   Enjoy your weekend...  ~Another \"good boy\" at our house\"  I'm off this morning for an overnight road trip!See you tomorrow!"},

I think you'll agree that we will just have to get to know him better to hopefully figure it out.   What I do know is Sherlock really is a nice boy.  He follows us all around the house and the yard, and is interested in whatever we're doing.  He is rough around the edges, and needs (re) training on his house-manners -- It's all no doubt from being a stray and outside for an extended period of time.  He's also a bit too interested in the cats, so we'll work on curbing his over interest in them.  But all in all, I think he's going to be okay.

Found as a stray standing in the  middle of a  country road one night, he was taken to the county shelter where he was given a new name, that he totally doesn't know, and when his \"hard time\" was up, he was given to Lab Rescue. When we got home last evening, it was easy to see that Sherlock was really happy to be out of the kennel (all dogs coming into Lab Rescue via a shelter are kenneled and boarded first for evaluation).  I do not think he stopped wagging his tail or barking the entire evening.  Because he was so excited and happy, I decided against doing one on one meetings, to just let him relax and get used to his new surroundings. Sherlock is estimated to be about 10 years old.  As you can see in the photo below from the shelter, he is very thin, probably from being a stray.Sherlock, or whatever his name is, is not responding whatsoever to anything I'm saying to him.  Meetings will be done slowly and one at a time this afternoon.  Judging by the smile on his face that hasn't disappeared since I met him, I've a feeling it will go just fine.  Wish us luck, as we welcome this new and enthusiastic boy to Golden Pines."},

But then it occurred to me, sound really does travel here in the country.  And now I wonder if they're going to be bothered that there's not going to be a shortage of dogs barking that they probably will be able to hear.  *Of all of our dogs, who do you think barks the most? The lights being visible and dogs barking aren't going to change, so I'm thinking that if the new neighbors are bothered by it, maybe it makes us even."},

One friend suggested that cosmic forces were to blame, while another taking a more earthy approach thinks that the dogs could have somehow tracked it inside. For now, the story of how the ring came to be on the floor in my hallway remains a mystery. It's been a busy day for us.  It began with an early morning vet appointment for Dusty to just recheck the tumor on his leg, and refill his medications.The trip was combined with giving our foster cat \"Apple\" to her new family, who are so excited to add her to their two-cat household.I was home for nearly an hour when a text came from the cat-rescue... Despite my telling them that I wouldn't be able to take another cat, SHE asked if I would please consider it.  SHE  did say please...  So about an hour later, we were welcoming \"Flurry\" to Golden Pines.  Flurry and his brother \"Blizzard\" (very un-original names for two white cats don't you think?) are both about 4 months old, and with several other cats were rescued from a hoarding situation. Both little boys were pretty sick, and now that they're feeling better they need to learn that people are a \"good thing.\"  The brothers have been separated in hopes of their finding their own self confidence and that they can trust people.So, we've gone from a black kitten to a white one.  But no matter what color the kitten might be, Charlie is of course pretty happy about it and Todd at the moment doesn't know quite what to think.

Buddy didn't seem to be in any pain, just uncomfortable.  There were moments when I'd see a glimpse of the dog we knew, and he would bark, wag his tail, and walk in happy-circles.  Sadly those moments passed too quickly, and the last couple of days, all I saw was a dog that was not feeling well and slipping away.  I knew that letting him go would be the kind thing to do. As I drove to the vet this morning, I listened to music on my iPod and from Les Miserables, \"I Dreamed a Dream,\" played.  The line from it that says  \"there are dreams that cannot be, and storms we cannot weather\" are truly the perfect words for Buddy.  I had a dream for him that he would find the perfect forever home and have a family all to himself. But it was a dream that was not to be.  And the cancer, or the storm, was something that sadly he could not weather. Tonight, even though the other dogs are here, it seems quieter.  I will miss seeing him roll in the yard and always following me into the kitchen, watching me with those hopeful eyes that just knew there was going to be a nibble of something for him and playfully woo-wooing at me and wagging his tail if I was considering not giving him something. In the children's story book, \"Dog Heaven\" by Cynthia Rylant,  she writes; \"that in Dog Heaven, there are Biscuits and biscuits, as far as the eye can see.  ...There are kitty-cat biscuits and squirrel biscuits, Ice-cream biscuits and ham-sandwich biscuits.\"   Buddy was a dog that loved and lived to eat. Not being able to eat anything this past week I know had to be hard for him, I could see that at times he really wanted too.  More than anything, I hope that as he arrives at the Rainbow Bridge, free from what kept him from enjoying his meals, he's enjoying those biscuits.  I hope he will not forget us.  I hope that one day we'll see him again. God speed \"my handsome Air-Bud\"... as you are met at the Rainbow Bridge by all those who have gone before you, know that  like them, you will be missed and the story of your year with us will not be forgotten.  We will always be grateful that we got to know you Buddy, and had you as part of our lives."},

When asked if there was anything we might be able to do for Buddy at this stage, he said that we certainly could go for a consult with oncology, but he felt that there wouldn’t be much they could do for him at this point. He felt we were at the stage for providing palliative care.  Tomorrow I'll talk to my vet and see what she recommends. A patient in the office where I work was telling me not that long ago about a diagnosis she'd been given nearly two years ago that she was probably not  going to live through the year. But her doctor told her to \"take his words and throw them out the window because he wasn’t in charge!   Her doctor said to \"live life with joy, laughter and hope instead of under a cloud of fear and doom.\"  He also said to her that \"We all live in the ‘Circle of Life’.  Don’t waste the ‘Life’ part!\"  I remembered that advice this afternoon when I was out in the yard with Buddy and the other dogs.Watching Buddy roll in the warm grass and soak up the afternoon sun, it occurred to me that dogs are perfect examples of that advice, aren't they?"},

Yes, I know I've gotten bad news before about our dogs.  But trust me, it never, ever for a single moment gets easier to hear. Buddy has been through so much in dealing with his allergies, and we finally had them sorted out.  And today, to add a proverbial insult to injury, I was reminded by someone that exactly one year ago today, Buddy came into the rescue.  That just added a whole other range of emotions and sadness over the hopes that I had for him. Tonight Buddy is still refusing food, and hasn't eaten hardly anything since Sunday.  I am hoping that along with a good nights sleep and the two new medications on board to help with nausea, he'll feel better and feel like eating.

(Airbnb is a website for people to list, find, and rent lodging in something like 190 countries.)  In my reading about it, I found there are a lot of pros and cons to the whole thing, but it worked perfectly for me. I really felt like I was staying at the home of friends -- The homeowners, a retired dentist and school teacher, were people I had a lot in common with and I could not have felt more welcome!  I felt so lucky to have found such a lovely place to stay and hope to stay there again on my next trip to Kentucky. -My room, with a sitting area and kitchenette was more like a small apartment-My visit with my brother was a good and productive one. It included a stop by our family home.  It's now for sale by the investor who bought it in April.  He has totally refurbished it, inside and out. It's good to see it looking all brand-new, but it seems a bit lonely, if a house can be that way. Before going home, there is always a visit to the cemetery. On my return trip to Virginia the sun followed me the whole way. I've driven the same way for more than 20 years, and I am not sure what possessed me, boredom maybe, to try another route home.  The other route is about the exact same distance, with less traffic, so what did I have to lose?  The answer is \"plenty!\"  The other way had its moments of great scenery, but was boring, and seemed to go on forever.  Suffice it to say, lesson learned that sometimes it's better to not take the road less traveled. I was so glad to get home!  All the dogs had done well while I was gone, thanks to Carl's great care!  I know he was helped in part, by Todd who kept an eye on everything outside.

On a positive note, Dusty is much better.  His appetite is fully returned, and he's up and around.  The tumor on his leg isn't feeling warm like it was previously, and the ulceration seems to be healing nicely too.

Todd made me proud by (again) remembering his manners and more than once came to Sid for attention.  Our friend may have come for a dog-fix, but I had something else in mind for her visit.  On Saturday we were off to West Virginia to an Apple Festival.  It was day of apples...Apples of just about every kind -- Some varieties I'd not heard of.  and many, many more waiting to be picked.  We chatted with someone from the orchard, and he told us that for every tree that he picks an apple from, he takes a bite from one apple. That's a lot of bites!And if you wanted something besides apples, there were lots of varieties of pumpkins to choose. These \"warty pumpkins\" were interesting. You could even \"smooch da pooch\" to help a local rescue. It was a good day spent with a good friend.  The good energy from the weekend must have rubbed off on Dusty, who is definitely feeling better. His appetite seems stable, and he's up and around more. ~Dusty with Bella in the background~Buddy lost his appetite a few days ago.  Nothing I could give him, could get him to take as much as a nibble.  So I cooked ground beef, and added a couple of scrambled eggs and pasta, topped with cheese for good measure.  It worked, and he's eaten the last two meals.  But he's turning his nose up at kibble or anything dog-food.  I'm trying to stay positive that Buddy is at least eating, and I just hope we can figure this out sooner rather than later. ~Buddy, feeling a little better~"},

Of course Charlie is overseeing her recovery,and the other dogs are snickering at her having to wear a \"cone of shame.\" ~Apple, feeling better today~While Charlie is taking care of the kitten, I'm taking care of Buddy and Dusty.  At the vet, Buddy had x-rays that thankfully showed nothing. So, we're trying a few things with his diet (you may be right Tammy!) to see if it'll help. On the flip-side is Dusty.  He has a large tumor on his back leg, and the plan at the vet originally was to do a biopsy.  But our vet thinks that its gotten infected.  So, we've put him on several medications to help with the pain we think he's having and the infection.  The medication may be making him sleepy, but he seems to feel better today.

He's getting sick after eating.  You name it, I've tried everything from changing his food, to the bowl height, and medication.  None of it seems to make a difference -- He still gets sick, and there's no rhyme or reason for it and no way to predict that he will or won't. When his regular vet wasn't working, we saw a new vet that is just starting her veterinary career. I have to admit, that I felt that she was no help.  So, I've made an appointment for our regular vet to see Buddy on Saturday. What was I saying about being contagious?  Our new comer Dusty isn't feeling well today either.  I've no idea what it could be.  He was just fine yesterday, but today he's refusing food, and won't get up.  Thinking that it could be pain from overdoing it yesterday, I've given him pain pills today in hopes that he'll feel better by tomorrow. He also has a vet appointment on Saturday. ~Dusty~Todd is totally oblivious to everything that's going on inside.  This morning he didn't come when called for breakfast -- He was much too busy running around the yard barking at the gangs of delinquent deer and rabbits that are trespassing on his turf!"},

After several recommendations, we met our new vet. It went really well, and I couldn't be happier with how they handled Sunny, and he immediately liked the mobile vet, which spoke volumes.~Sunny likes the new-vet more than the camera~Since the vet was here, I decided to have George seen as well.  When George arrived here in April, because of his being overweight, he struggled on the few stairs and to get up. With daily walks, changing his diet, I've had high hopes that George was slimming down -- Because he looked to me like he was.  He seems happier, and he's up and around much more than he was. ~Josh and George~So, of course I was anxious to put George onto the scale and feel that proud moment as his owner that he's lost weight.  According to their scales, he's lost two pounds.  Proud moment gone.  But George was happy and relaxed during the entire exam, and let \"mobile vet\" do a pedicure. I guess that's what really matters.    ~George, still happy afterwards~ Todd thinks that what really matters is that he didn't have to be seen."},

He's had a hard time settling in, mostly because I was keeping him away from the other dogs, and it wasn't where he wanted to be.  But given Dusty's stress level, I just thought that I needed someone else to help with those introductions.  I was wrong.  I think they'd all looked at one another so long through the fence that meeting him up close and personal was no longer exciting.  I simply opened the gate, and with barely a second look, it was business as usual.Why was I worried?"},

He comes to us from someone who adopted him from a shelter this past March.  Dusty was originally given up in February by a elderly couple who were no longer able to care for him after a car accident. *She* was dealing with family losses, and saw Dusty at the shelter and adopted him. When I met her *She* told me that Dusty helped her through those losses, but now *She* was no longer able to care for him, and *She* felt that *She* needed to focus on herself now, saying to me in an e-mail today, \"I know I made the right decision for both of us as yesterday I felt a bit lighter in spirit and was able to get a good workout at the gym. Not worrying about Dusty is such a blessing.\"  This is the part where I don't openly pass judgment on someone....Dusty is what's important, and I think that by nature he is a nervous dog.  With all the changes he's had in the past several months, it hasn't helped for him to be that way, and it's totally understandable.  I asked our dog walker to come over to help me with the intros to our gang, that didn't go so well.  Dusty was really feeling the stress of the day, and so I decided to forgo the meetings which included Todd. Until then, he's got his own space in the house where he can relax and get used to his new life.I'll do the rest of the one-on-one meetings in a day or so when Carl returns.  I've not told him about Dusty and until then I'll be practicing the look in the photo below for when Carl sees him.I hope your week is off to a good start!"},

They are known to follow prey, such as badgers, foxes, and other vermin, right into their burrows and then try to dig them out. That is exactly what Todd has been doing.  In the last three days, Todd has dug out and \"made dead\" two moles. This morning with no one around, (i.e., Carl), it fell to me to bribe Todd into giving up his newest prize.  It was before breakfast and a weak moment and it only took a few treats to convince him.

You'd never know it, but I've a feeling that he loves his picture being taken.     Cissy is feeling photogenic these days. ~Cissy~With her allergies being managed with a limited ingredient kibble, Cissy is definitely happier and feeling much better.  She doesn't seem to be bothered too much by the torn meniscus in her left knee.

But because of the distance to my vet's office, (an hours drive each way) it's impossible to do with traffic and work.  So, I've been asking around for someone that can do it that is closer to where we live.

But I guess Bella has just decided that maybe we weren't so bad after all, or all the medications and supplements she's taking are working, because I realized that she seemed happier.  She still has her diva-moments, but they are coming farther apart.  I'm now seeing a lot more tail wagging and the scowl and hard tense look I've seen on her face so much is being replaced with a softer look and smile.  ~A much more relaxed Bella~I had to stop and wonder if the \"niceness\" was contagious and infecting Todd.  As a Scottie, he's devoted and affectionate to those he likes. However, he can take a while to warm up to strangers and visitors to our house.  Last week we had company, and I fully prepared our guest with lots of treats, and I was ready for Todd to show his displeasure of the intruders.  He didn't surprise me by at first keeping his distance from our friend.  But he did surprise me when she was allowed to pet him shortly after she arrived.  He was a true gentlemen Scottie during the entire couple of days. Then  yesterday Buddy was rolling on the grass with Todd's favorite red ball that he never shares. I had to stop and wonder if the gentleness of the Goldens or the \"cuteness\" of the kittens was getting to him?  Was Todd at 4+ years old growing up and mellowing?  Judging by the torn up dog toys, along with the barking and chasing and the holes he keeps trying to dig...I'd say no, and I'm glad about that!"},

Folklore says that small doors set into a larger wood door and requiring those entering to take one high step inside, shut out evil spirits,  On the practical side, it probably kept the interior drier and warmer.Inside you can't help but notice that the church looks like an upside down boat.  Someone mentioned to me that this was because most of the colonial leaders had experience with building boats.There are many beautiful stained glass windows, There is one window that is in memory of Pocahontas, who is said to have been christened in the church.There is a triple-level pulpit (right in photo) that was built with a sounding board attached to the ceiling which amplified speakers for court and church.

Then a third one...How did we end up with these three little ones?  Well, I first read about them on a Facebook group page for the town that I live.  Someone posted about seeing four kittens in the back of the gas station in town, and playing near the road.  Several people chimed in that they'd seen them as well and agreed that it would be \"unfortunate if one got hurt, or worse.\"  But no one volunteered to help these little ones.  Finally someone named \"Beth\" who regularly helps to trap feral cats for a rescue, said that she would trap the kittens, but someone else would have to take them.  ...the sound of crickets goes here.... I'll pat myself on the back and say that I waited nearly 8 hours for someone else to speak up and say they'd take the kittens.  But no one did.  So, I volunteered, telling myself that I'd figure it out somehow.     Then (thankfully) someone named \"Laura\" said that she would also be willing to help trap the kittens and would arrange with a rescue group to have them vetted. So, on Saturday morning, we set the traps, and by 10:30 that night, Laura and Beth had managed to trap all but one. Unfortunately, the 4th kitten has not been seen since Saturday night. We're not giving up, and the traps are still being set in hopes that this little elusive one will return and can be caught.   Laura is also going to speak to the owner of the gas-station and ask him to make a donation to the rescue to help with their expenses. (I personally think he should, and think we did him a favor in taking them.)   Because the kittens, that are estimated to be about 8 weeks old, are \"semi-feral\" Beth has put me in contact with someone who will be coming over this weekend to help me with handling and socializing the kittens, which I did for the first time this evening.   ~Being held for the first time!~My new friends and I have decided that with each of us taking a part in rescuing these kittens, asking for the donation from the gas station owner, the rescue who will be taking them, and getting someone to help me socialize them, that it truly  \"takes a village to rescue kittens.\"  However, Charlie who absolutely loves them...and is a bit obsessed with the kittens,   doesn't think I need any help because he's here!"},

His being groomed fit that perfectly. It's too bad that Sunny doesn't like to have his picture taken, because he looks great. (I will add that yes, I can and do groom the goldens, but even I have problems doing anything more than brushing and trimming Sunny).~Best photo of Sunny afterwards~However, Sunny bypassing me and going straight to the door afterwards, the looks on the faces of the two groomers and especially their short and restrained comments about how \"Sunny didn't like his nails trimmed, feet touched, tail messed with, that he hated the dryer and that he could live life happily for the rest of his life without another bath,\" said perfectly how it had gone.  There were no comments at all on how Josh did.  That had to be good news, right?Back at home, the success of the week has come with our newest addition, Bella. We felt that part of the problems with Bella and our dogs was coming from her just not feeling well. Throughout the week, it was easy to see that she was feeling better and becoming more relaxed.  So with that, we very slowly began closing the space between her and our dogs.  It took a lot of praise, a lot of treats that yesterday resulted in this...Bella is the one in the middle of the photo below. Yes, Bella is still a little growly around our dogs, in particular when she's sleeping and eating.  But I think and really hope she's going to be okay here at Golden Pines.   ~Bella on Friday~I hope you have an enjoyable, memorable and safe July 4th celebration!  ~Main Street in \"My Town\""},

There are a few here and there, but we'll let the birds, bugs and spiders have what's left.  ~Sheba--Berry picking is hard work!~This is probably a good thing since homemade cobblers like the one I made this morning are a favorite this time of year.  My favorite recipe is one that I like because it's simple, quick, and pretty good. (Recipe here) And speaking of eating, Buddy is a dog that lives to eat!  This makes getting him to take his allergy pills, a snap.  This also means that Buddy will eat anything that even remotely looks edible.  I'd noticed a few days ago some white around his mouth that looked like he'd gotten into something.  I wiped his face and it didn't come off.  A couple more times I'd try to scrub it off with no luck. Finally I took him outside to get a good look at whatever it was that couldn't be washed off. It was then that I saw what it was...  Because of his allergies, Buddy hasn't had any hair around his mouth because he was constantly rubbing his nose and face, and now, it's finally growing back!  (Sorry about all that hard scrubbing Buddy!) But it does show that the itchiness, especially on his face, has gone away and the allergy pills really are working!~Fuzzy hair growing back on Buddy's face!~I hope its been good weekend for you too!"},

I don't think I've ever seen him move that fast.  Okay, Georgie's not that fast, but given that I had Charlie and Sunny on leashes, and three others off lead, it sure seemed like he was -- Because those few moments that I needed to get everyone together were all Georgie needed to bolt to freedom and disappear. I put Charlie and Sunny inside and headed into the woods, through thorns and thick brush to find him.  I eventually found Georgie, casually sniffing a tree.  He was, of course, totally ignoring me, and before I could grab him, he started off again. No doubt about it, Georgie was in the zone. But he made a rookie mistake and zigged when he should have zagged, and I stepped on his leash--He was caught!  I slowly walked the delinquent back home. Thirty minutes later, after a little water, just like Todd was after his encounter with the toad, Georgie had moved past the whole experience.  And just like Todd and as he is every morning, Georgie was anxious and ready for breakfast.  The moral of the story is, watch out for the quiet ones.

We were just coming back from our morning walk on Tuesday when I noticed Todd vomiting. I'd taken the other dogs for a walk, leaving him unattended in the fenced yard, and he was fine 10 minutes prior to that.  I had no idea what happened. I got all the dogs inside, including Todd who had vomited again and was shaking his head and pawing at his mouth.  In between his getting sick, I managed to catch him and rinse out his mouth, and wipe his face and beard off, thinking (and hoping) I could wash off whatever he'd gotten into.  It was not an easy thing to do because even on a slow day Todd is pretty fast. Added to that, he doesn't really like being picked up, and he especially didn't want his mouth washed or wiped out.  In the end, he knew he had no choice.       I'd noted to myself that Todd had gotten sick 8 times.  But by about a half-hour, thankfully the vomiting was lessening and he seemed to be getting better.  His ears that had been laying back were now standing up, and he was drinking a little water. Good signs!After about an hour, Todd seemed to be recovered, and was taking small bites of food that I was offering him and wagging his tail.  I went with him outside and he led me right to the scene of his crime.  It was what I'd suspected -- a toad. I think we'd all agree that toads are great to have in your garden because they dine on bugs and are a natural pest control. But a dog like Todd that loves to investigate and play with anything that moves, a toad is not a good thing to have around.  I'm sure the (now dead) toad would agree with that...   It wasn't even 9 o'clock in the morning, and I was already feeling frazzled and worn out.  Todd however, was no worse for wear.  He'd moved on and forgotten all about the events of the hour before, and was back on patrol of the yard.  Something I wish I could have done!"},

A very long time for a computer who at times should have not been blamed for the faults and maladies that came with  her advancing age. They certainly don't make 'em like *HER* anymore, and that may or may not be a good thing.  By Wednesday Carl had my new computer set up and connected.Life may have come to a standstill online for me, but it didn't for the dogs.  I know that I don't mention Buddy much. Some of you may have even forgotten about him.  He came to us in November because of his severe allergies.  We've had some pretty good success in working through them with a limited ingredient diet and over the counter allergy medications.  But even with a good vet, there have been some set backs too.  Buddy is still really itchy, and if we don't watch him, he'll chew and pull out his coat.  So, it was decided to take him to the dermatologist. ~Buddy waiting for the Dermatologist~It was a productive visit, and I'm encouraged that with a change up in a few things, along with a new allergy medication called Apoquel, that has had some really good success, Buddy can finally put the annoying allergies behind him.   ~Buddy, still waiting for the Dermatologist and a treat~While I was waiting for the Dermatologist, I got a call from our dog-walker about Lexi.  She's not been feeling well this week.  On Tuesday she had gotten sick, but seemed a little better by Wednesday morning. The dog-walker couldn't get her to her feet, and Lexi had gotten sick again.  I called the vet and thankfully they were able to see her. I took Buddy home, picked up Lexi, and we were on the road again.  After all the tests, including x-rays and fluids along with nausea medications, we were on our way home, and Lexi was smiling and feeling better. ~Lexi, feeling better!~The test show nothing \"too unusual,\"  so we're not really sure what is causing Lexi's stomach to become so sensitive.  It could be her diet, so we're going to make a few changes.

This week, the Niece contacted me and we arranged to meet at a nearby school where her son was participating in a sporting event. I really enjoyed our visit and I appreciated her thoughtfulness of a gift for our crew that included Crickets favorite treats!I'd hoped the Niece and I could get together because I'd wanted to give her Cricket's remains. Knowing how much she and her family loved Cricket, I felt strongly that she should be returned to those that loved her first. I found it so fitting when the Niece told me she was going to spread Cricket's ashes at Flossie's grave-site.  We both agreed that there could not be a more perfect place.   On a much lighter note, we had our \"post adoption visit\" today from Lab Rescue for Georgie.  His adoption contract said that it wouldn't be \"official\" until the rescue was satisfied that he is settling in and doing okay. Not knowing what to expect, I made sure everything from the smallest detail on the inside and the outside was in perfect order. The volunteer came, greeted Georgie and the rest of the dogs, (Todd was tucked away in his crate) asked a couple of questions, and in 10 minutes tops, she was gone.

Yes, I've of course had those low moments yesterday and today. Gus had a really big personality and was never shy about letting me know if he thought we weren't getting his meal fixed fast enough or if he needed help getting to where he wanted to be. So instead of being focused on our house being quieter without him, I'm instead remembering and celebrating the nearly one year that Gus was a part of our lives.~Gus and Cricket~When I think of dogs that had truly been dealt a bad hand, it was Gus.  He was a six time repeat offender at a shelter in Virginia when he was found wandering in traffic. Each time his owner would come and get him, but the seventh time, he was found tied to the shelter door and they never returned for him. Thankfully Gus was given to the rescue, and unlike others before him, we at least knew his name.~Gus, the first day we met him~In looking back at the photos of our first days together in May of last year, I recall the total uncertainty that we were facing with Gus because of a tumor in his abdomen, and the grim diagnosis he'd been given of degenerative myleopathy. Added to that, not long after Gus arrived, he developed a large pressure sore on his hip that even after nearly 10 months, would never really heal. It added to my discouragement when I was told by a vet that saw him at that time, that he didn't expect Gus to live through the week and sarcastically quipped to me to \"not buy him any green bananas.\"  Of course I was taken back by those words, but they would give me the determination to prove this particular vet wrong.Thankfully Gus would become the patient of two other vets who managed his care both clinically and holistically.  They gave me the optimism, hope and support I'd need to get through some of the low moments with Gus. I will always be grateful to these two amazing ladies for their solid expertise and care they gave Gus, and for their friendship. They truly made a difference for him. ~Gus and Beau~A person can learn a lot from a dog, even a silly and goofy one like Gus.  He taught me about living each day with joy and seizing the moment. Gus taught me to appreciate the simple things in life; the cool grass, a beautiful day outside, and to remember to trust my instincts.On the days that I knew Gus may have be feeling pain from falling or tumbling down the steps, he taught me about  forgetting all of that, and to continue on by doing my best, to get up those proverbial steps no matter how difficult and insurmountable they may seem.Gus also taught me about the depth of friendship, love and selflessness.  He taught me to never give up and to remember that life can be too short and passes too quickly, so enjoy it.  Play the hand  you've been dealt the best you can, no matter what your circumstances may be. And finally Gus taught me that when some don't see your value, and tell you that \"you're not going to make it.\" don't listen to them, and buy those green bananas! Godspeed my handsome Gustavsen.  I wish I'd known you when you were younger. But I have a feeling you were just the same carefree and endearing boy as you were when we met last year.  I'm grateful to have had you as part of our lives and that I was  your caretaker at this final season in your life.  You taught me so much, and those lessons will not be forgotten.

A home could not be found for Georgie, so \"the Lady\" kept him.  A change in \"the Lady's\" life's circumstances three years later has her returning to the Philippines where she is from.Georgie has come to us via Lab Rescue. Some of you might recall that about two years ago I had a bit of a falling-out with the Golden Retriever Rescue over our boy Sunny.

However after our approval, I never heard from them.  Shortly after, a senior Golden needed a home and I all but forgot about fostering for Lab Rescue. But about a month ago, I received an e-mail asking if we would consider taking a senior Lab for them. With the recent losses we have room for a new addition so I told them I'd consider it.  Fast forward through several e-mails, phone calls, Georgie's surgery to remove 12 teeth and a couple of lumps, my trip to Kentucky, and here he is! Georgie's introductions to his new pack mates has gone pretty well. He is used to living with other dogs, and our dogs are used to meeting new ones.

There are times I feel that calm maturity and dignity from him that only comes from age and experience.  But don't get me wrong.  Todd is still the \"number one show\" to watch in our house and the one that can bring the most laughter and cause the most mischief!  I don't think that's going to change anytime soon! Even with a boy named Georgie who is supposed to arrive on Saturday. Don't adjust your screen. Georgie IS indeed a black lab.   Happy, Happy 4th Birthday to Golden Pines most special Scottie!"},

I've decided that each day with Gus is a milestone, and we're grateful for these \"days of grace\" with him. Despite eating twice as much as the other dogs, Gus is noticeably thinner than he has ever been because of the loss of muscle mass. He has increasingly more difficulty getting around than before, and needs us to help him more. A symptom that the degenerative myleopathy (DM) is progressing.

I'd also like to give a very special thanks to the blog, POTP and all those who came from there and left their kind caring words on the loss of Beau. If you've not visited there, you should. It's truly a very special blog for those who really need the POTP (Power of the Paw). Click here for the linkOur week ended quietly.  Today has been one of clouds and rain.

He loves being outside in any kind of weather.I actually don't mind so much either. So, this morning, first thing, I pulled on my rain boots and the dogs and I went for a walk.  On our walk, I found these two feathers.  A friend of mine mentioned that Native American lore says \"that when you find a feather in your path, you are on the right path.\" I've not seen these kinds of feathers before. With their bright yellow (gold?) that runs through them, I'd like to think that it's a sign that Beau has gotten his wings.

But there is not a single ounce of regret in opening our hearts and home to him.Beau lived life on his own terms and by a routine that he must have known before he came to us.  We would adapt to his routine of eating first before going out, and he would adapt to ours of enjoying plenty of treats when he came back in. And together with the specialists we went through the treatment for his severe ear infections and entropian in both eyes. ~Waiting for the Ophthalmologist~Even though these issues were never fully resolved it was enough to relieve the pain and the discomfort. Beau seemed happy and content in his life with us. Beau found a companion with Gus, and the two often slept close to one another during the day. On Monday when they were laying next to one another and I was giving them both treats, I found myself humbled by these two very different senior boys. Gus the more carefree and silly of the two, Beau the more serious and reserved. Both never let their physical limitations keep them from enjoying life.    It has been an honor to have had the chance to know Beau, care for him, worry about him and love him. I hope it was enough. God speed to our most handsome Beau who will be missed and not forgotten. I look forward to the day when I'll see him and all the others at the Rainbow Bridge."},

On the inside, we've begun what I call \"Angel Watch\" for our sweet boy Beau. You'll recall that x-rays found masses in his chest just prior to my going to Kentucky. Thankfully he was \"okay\" while I was gone.  But in the past week Beau has begun slowing down and not eating much. I spoke to his vet because we'd decreased the amount of the steroid prednisone that he's been taking. Dr. D agreed that it would be okay to go back to the original, full daily dose to see if that would make a difference.  It has somewhat, but I don't think it's helping enough. Given that, we'll do what has been done before and let Beau set the pace in this, the final chapter of his life. And when it's time, we'll do the last kind thing that can be done for Beau, and send him to the Rainbow Bridge. Until that time comes, Beau is in no pain, there is only peace."},

Looking back on our first year, things actually went along pretty smoothly as we got to know one another.  I think we had and still have a great time and genuinely enjoy being together. Of course not everything has been perfect.  There have been a few hiccups and a few things to work out along the way. But I can honestly say we've worked through it, and we share a close bond.I guess in all the time we've been together, I've just forgotten that it should be made official. I've no doubt whatsoever that some people think we already are \"official,\" and will be surprised to find that we weren't.  I'll admit, this is all my fault, because I didn't see the importance of it.  But \"the powers that be\" have insisted on it.  They are right.So, after nearly two years of living together, Cissy is now an \"official\" adopted member of Golden Pines.  Her adoption fee and contract to the rescue has been filled out, and mailed.Cissy is here to stay.  (Did you think I was talking about something else?)

{"title": "Strangers in Wrong Places", "date": "Saturday, February 21, 2015", "text": "I may have driven to Kentucky on the best day in February, but I came back in the worst. Hoping to get in front of a snow-storm, I left in the early morning hours, only to end up in the middle of it.  I pressed forward hoping the weather would improve, but the conditions of the roads and the weather only worsened. After 12 hours of white-knuckle driving and seeing several accidents I'd only covered the distance that in good weather takes about six.~Stopped for an accident~Just as I finished slip-sliding and crawling over the mountains of the West Virginia Turnpike, I became a road-side casualty with a flat-tire.  With no shoulder to pull off onto, I stopped in one of the two barely passable lanes. I'd just gotten out of my car when two young Marines from South Carolina stopped to help me. They quickly changed my tire while a State Trooper and I looked on. The officer told me where to get a new one, and even called to let them know I was on my way.  The Officer couldn't get in touch with the shop, but assured me they were probably still open. When I got there, they weren't. With nearly a foot of snow already on the ground most businesses were already closed as night fell on the snow covered roads in Beckley West Virginia.I'd not been able to make any stops for Sheba and Charley since we'd gotten on the road, and I'd run out of water for them several hours before. We were exhausted and hungry and with the spare tire on the car, I knew I couldn't (and shouldn't) drive any farther.  I had to find a hotel to stay for the night. I was turned away at two places because of the dogs and after getting stuck in deep snow more times than I can count, I got really stuck one more time in the parking lot of a hotel that had closed for the night. After trying to dig my own way out, I realized I couldn't.  I hit rock-bottom as the thought of spending the night in my car seemed to be a reality I would face. It may have been a rock-bottom moment, but another hero would arrive. A young man would come and with a shovel in hand he dug me out. I told him my story and he told me that he worked at a hotel that accepted dogs.  He'd just gotten off work, and knew that they had 3 rooms left for the night. In about 20 minutes I was checking in to the local Howard Johnson's.  Sheba and Charlie were ecstatic to be out of the car and romped and played in the freshly fallen snow. Back in our room I fed them what little dog-food I had and warmed my cold wet feet in the tub.We were soon all settled in and were asleep by 9. The next morning, I fed a hungry Sheba and Charlie oatmeal from the breakfast bar. Letting my fingers do the walking through the phone book I found an opened repair shop where we made new dog-loving friends who gave Sheba and Charlie lots of attention, and even offered to get them food.  By 10 o'clock with a brand new tire, I was on the road again with sunshine and clear roads! Three hours later, I crossed the border into Virginia....and in another three I was home! Carl did a great job caring for all the dogs while I was gone. Beau and Gus, the two I was most worried about were (of course) just fine!~Gus~Todd whined and cried when he saw us -- He's happy to have his pal Sheba back!   ~Sheba and Todd playing in the snow today~Four days later I am still grateful for the \"tender mercies\" and a safe trip.  I'm also thankful for the kindness of strangers that were in the right place at my wrong moments.~Sheba~I'm especially thankful that Sheba and Charlie were kept safe too.  They were perfect traveling companions who were always seemingly happy about the adventure...When they were awake.

It was a perfect day for traveling and unseasonably warm for February.  I would get them both settled in and my youngest brother and I were off to the hospital. A heart attack along with complications from a diagnosis given in late December of pulmonary fibrosis gave my brother who was just a little more than a year older than me, very little chance of survival. I would spend a couple of hours at the hospital and leave to get some much needed sleep at the home my two brothers shared. My youngest brother works nights, and I'd just barely gotten to bed when a call from the hospital would come telling me I needed to come back to the hospital right away.  By the time I got there 20 minutes later, they had been able to stabilize my brother. A long day of ups and downs would follow. There were numerous calls and text messages to my other two brothers who were making their way to Kentucky while my youngest brother and I both tried to come to grips with the reality we were facing. In the late evening hours of Monday February 9th, my brother John would pass away as my youngest brother and I would stand next to his bed, our arms around one another for both comfort and strength.         The arrival of my oldest and another younger brother and his wife was a reminder of the importance of family. We would tell stories, laugh and reconnect with one another and share our grief.  A blur of days filled with kindness from family and old friends along with unexpected random acts of kindness from strangers was humbling.The day of my brother's funeral was cold and gloomy.  I would give my brothers eulogy being reminded of how fragile and short life can be.  And that even though my brother had made his share of mistakes and had bumps and stumbles, he got back up and tried to persevere. I would make the joke that in going through his belongings afterwards, that \"I knew more about my brother than any sister should ever know about her brother!\"My brother John and I hadn't always gotten along.  We had our share of disagreements. Maybe because we were so different. Maybe because we were so close in age. Maybe because we were siblings. Maybe it was all of those reasons. My favorite childhood photo of my brother John and me, circa 1965But I was grateful that in our last conversation a couple of weeks ago I'd told him how much I cared about him because he was my brother and how worried I was about him. After the service, a trip to the cemetery and a blessing of my brother's final resting place next to our parents. The last good-bye.Finally an indelible image in my mind of the backs of my three brothers in dark suits, slumped shoulders as they slowly walked together and the arm of my oldest brother around the shoulder of our youngest. I felt a wave of gratitude and gave silent thanks for having four good, kind and caring men to call my brothers. I know this grief and the ache of the loss of my brother John will dull as the days pass and life goes on without him.  But I will always miss him -- Because he was my brother."},

I just don't adjust well to the changes of getting up and going to bed earlier.  I should take my cues from the dogs who never seem to notice or really mind--As long as they're being fed of course.~Charlie~ Beau is one dog that is really a creature of habit. At hour house, we have a routine. The dogs always go outside first thing in the morining, and we go for a walk.  Then shortly after, they're fed their breakfast and onward with the day we go.  When Beau first came to us last summer, he would have no part of that routine.  We would have to literally drag him outside in the morning because he refused to go. I'm not sure how long this went on, but I dreaded trying to get him outside. At some point I realized that he would go out willingly AFTER he'd eaten his breakfast. I could only guess that was the routine that he knew before he came to us in July. Life became so much easier when I didn't try to change him. Now six months later, his routine is woven into part of ours.This week Beau changed his routine and didn't want to go out at all. When he finally did go out he was struggling on the two steps to get back into the house, and not eating as much if any of his morning or evening meals. I'd hoped that it was just the strong medications that he's been taking for his ears affecting his appetite. Unfortunately,  it's not.  A trip to the vet and x-Rays show that he has 3 masses in his chest. If there is any good in this news, it's that there appears to be no evidence that he's bleeding internally. (Note: I hope I've pointed out the masses correctly on the photo below)It goes without saying that I'm saddened by this news. I hope that our plan to put him back on a steroid, discontinue the ear medications, (and treat topically) will give us more time with Beau. And our goal will be one that never changes despite whatever our daily routine may be, and that's to keep him comfortable and happy for as long as possible.~Beau and Gus~"},

For this reason, he goes to the groomer about 3 times a year. I can never decide if I like him best \"before or after.\" Todd just needed some \"tidying up\" on his coat that I could probably do myself.  But I decided to take him in anyway. We arrived to a bit of a flustered groomer who told me her assistant was home sick. With 8 dogs to be groomed that day, I volunteered to just take Todd home.  He wasn't too happy about getting his nails trimmed, but he was so excited when we left that I think that if he could have done a somersault, he would have!Today our winter weather advisory was discontinued because our temps were well above freezing and are expected to stay there.

We didn’t know that when we woke up yesterday that we would have only the day with her before she left us for the Rainbow Bridge.Saturday began early, with nothing out of the ordinary. Even though Cricket didn't eat her breakfast, I wasn't concerned because she would occasionally miss a meal.  Fast forward through the days events with her that had her settling in for the evening.  She'd gone out an hour before, had a drink of water, again refused her dinner, and settled down next to me at my desk.  Without warning she began having a seizure. Experience has taught me to check the clock to know how much time is passing. When 5 minutes had passed and she was still having a seizure, I knew we had to take her for help. The minutes in the car seemed to be in slow motion.  While I was feeling somewhat panicked, those moments were overshadowed by peace as I felt strongly that everything was going to be \"okay.\"  Everything was as it should be. When we arrived at the vets office, and Carl handed Cricket to me, I knew Cricket was nearly gone. The vets tried to revive her, but there was no pulse, no heartbeat. Our little Cricket was gone. As I reflect on Cricket's nearly 17 years of life, my mind goes back to New Year's Day.  We were all outside together.  I marveled at how well Cricket was doing, and energetic she was and how she was enjoying the day. She seemed happy. ~Cricket & Gus in August~I remember how pretty she was standing in the sunlight, and how she couldn't keep her eyes opened because it was shining so brightly on her. It was a good day not just for Cricket but for all of us.~Cricket, New Year's Day 2015~Looking at it now, it so perfectly says everything about Cricket's good long life.  In her nearly 17 years of life she was the beloved and adored companion of Flossie who passed away in May. For nearly 8 months, she was our adored and treasured family member. Thinking about Flossie and Cricket being reunited brings comfort. However it has left me brokenhearted by this unexpected loss of our dearest little companion.  The shock and the pain, and yes the guilt, feels so immense at times that it could easily fill a space much larger than this. Instead of dwelling on that, I want to instead finish by sharing with you a few of the enumerable things that I loved and will so dearly miss about our sweet little Cricket. Her big hound-dog bark.  The way she ran after the dogs and nipped at their hocks when they ran past. How peaceful she looked when she slept on the big golden sized beds. The hopeful and innocent look in her eyes when she would wait for a treat.The way she made us laugh when she would run away from Carl when he'd try to get her to come inside or feed her.   The wag of her tail. The rub of her face against my leg when she wanted attention.  The way she loved us unconditionally.  How she gave us something to smile about every day and has left us with a heart full of memories that will carry us through this time as we mourn her loss. Cricket was unique in so many ways. I know that many of you have lost beloved pets, and it helps to know that in this moment of our sorrow, many of you know what we are feeling right now.  A good friend told me today that no matter how much losing them hurts, a life lived without them is a life half lived. God-speed my little noisy Cricket.  You lived life on your terms and you left on your terms as well.  At the Rainbow Bridge, I know you have been met by Flossie who loved you first.  I'm so grateful to have gotten to know you, love you and share our lives with you.  You may have been small in size, but you have taken a big piece of my heart. You will be missed, remembered fondly and not ever forgotten.  ~New Year's Day~Thank-you Terri for trusting me and the rescue to take care of Cricket.  Your friendship and support over these past few months has meant so much as have your kind words as we both mourn the loss this most special dog."},
{"title": "The Year Ends", "date": "Wednesday, December 31, 2014", "text": "~Charlie~ Our week may be a short one, but it has been busy trying to get everything done so a couple days off can be enjoyed. Monday began with an issue in getting Gus's medication refilled when his \"regular\" vet was ill and out of the office.  The vet that was working that day didn't feel \"comfortable\" refilling them.  I didn't understand what the issue was, especially because it is an antibiotic that Gus has been taking for about 6 months now. I was told Gus would have to wait until today (Wednesday) to get the medication. Because I called on Friday (the 26th) when he ran out, not being able to get the refill until Wednesday meant Gus would be off the antibiotic for six days--Too long in my opinion because I feel that we walk a bit of a tight-rope with Gus and his health. I tried to explain all of that to the girls at the front desk, who are \"new girls\" to the practice, don't know me, or Gus, but none of what I said made a difference. They were simply following the \"doctors orders\" (as they should have). Me however, I was feeling a whole list of things in trying to explain why I *needed* to have the medication for Gus. Fortunately the holistic vet that sees Gus was able to prescribe the refill for him, and I'm extremely grateful to Dr. E for that. I've since spoken to Gus's \"regular\" vet about the mix-up, and we have both made adjustments in how Gus's medications will be refilled in the future to avoid this problem again.~Gus~Onward to Tuesday we went and it was all about Beau's visit to the dermatologist that went pretty well. ~Beau waiting to see the Dermatologist~Today, Wednesday is about Cissy.  To keep this short, and get you back to celebrating the New Year, I'll update you on them in my next post.~Cissy in early December~Until then, thank you for being here!  Your comments of support, kindness and friendship as you have shared the ups and downs of our lives here at Golden Pines this year continues to mean so much to me, and keeps me going.  I hope your 2015 will be one of good health, harmony and abundance-And maybe fun adventures too!"},

The weekend had everything. ~Gus~A chuckle at things like this birth announcement sign in front of the church on our road.  I think it was meant as a joke--What do you think?   We enjoyed a really nice dinner and evening with our friends and their family.  When we got home, we were met by a very happy and exuberant Todd outside of his crate. I really thought I'd locked the door when I put him in. Todd of course won't tell me if I actually did or not.The mild weather allowed us to spend plenty outside with the dogs.  ~Josh~But now it's time to go back to work.  Which I think is okay with the dogs.  I think they're missing getting their naps.  ~A tired Cricket~I hope your post Christmas weekend has been an enjoyable one too!!"},

No chaos. We have decided that this Christmas may go down as one of our favorites.  ~Gus~No, it wasn’t a white Christmas, but it was the right Christmas without a doubt for a lot of reasons. One was because we unexpectedly became the recipients of several generous and random acts of kindness that showed the true meaning and spirit of Christmas. During our day yesterday there were calls, texts and e-mails with family and friends who could not be with us that punctuated our day. Even though we cannot be with everyone we felt connected to them and hope that they felt the same way, too.  .~I even heard from Cricket's family on Christmas Eve~With the warm weather we spent some extended time outside with the dogs. Of course, once Sunny sees the camera, it doesn't matter what the weather is, he wants to go back inside. Our day ended enjoying dinner, and afterwards watching our favorite Christmas movies. It made things all that much more peaceful. ~Ms. Yellow enjoying her day~I hope that everyone was able to catch up with or spend time with the people who mean the most to you."},

The next two days will be spent in the homes of our friends.Whatever your plans are for this evening and Christmas Day if you are traveling to enjoy the company of good friends and family, or spending it simply at home, “May peace and plenty be the first to lift the latch on your door, and happiness be guided to your home by the candle of Christmas.”"},

Buddy is much, much less itchy these days and no longer has to wear the 'cone of shame.' His skin still needs to heal a bit more, but his new coat that is growing in is soft and healthy.  Beau had a recheck of his ears and there is some improvement, but both are still infected. He'll continue on a steroid at least until he sees the dermatologist on the 30th. With a lot of last minute things to tend to for the holidays Saturday was a busy day.  But we weren't too busy that we couldn't meet some friends who are in town for the holidays to visit family. It was an unplanned get together, and we met at a nearby winery. I'm glad we made the time, it was an enjoyable visit with them while we listened to a jazz band.It's the winter solstice, and the sun has now set on the shortest day of the year and the longest night has begun. Sheba is ready for the shorter days that take us closer to Christmas. And Todd is ready for the longer nights to recharge his batteries.Are you ready for the week ahead?"},

{"title": "The Taste-Tester", "date": "Sunday, December 14, 2014", "text": "Our week ended with my office having our Christmas party at my personal favorite restaurant. It was a delicious meal, and a lot of fun!  I work with a great group of people, even if they aren't all animal lovers. Gus's week ended with a visit to his regular vet for a check up and to refill all of his medications and supplies. For several reasons, this past week wasn't a particular good week for him.  Gus has lost about 5 pounds that he didn't have to lose in the six months that he's been with us. He's noticeably thin and both of his vets and I feel that it's a combination of two things -- One is loss of muscle, and the other is because he has a mass in his abdomen that we think is not allowing him to absorb needed nutrients from his food. Despite knowing that, it's still  troubling to see his ribs even though he's fed twice as much as the other dogs.~Gus stalking the lovely Ms. Yellow~The trip to the vet is getting to be too much for Gus. I'm able to move him easy enough with the harness.  But everything from the slippery floors in the office, his having to stand, walk, falling along with the jostling around, getting in and out of my van, really takes a toll on him.  This time it left Gus almost totally immobile the next day. Thankfully after a good day of rest, he's rebounded and he is up and around. Today Gus was feeling up to stalking the cat.  He even stayed with me in the kitchen while I did some baking, and was my hopeful taste-tester.I think it made up for the vet visit.  I know it did for me."},
{"title": "The Rule Breaker ", "date": "Thursday, December 11, 2014", "text": "~Sunrise~The week has found its rhythm as I've done some Christmas shopping and am working on getting our Christmas cards addressed and mailed.  Our boy Beau who is not one of the main characters at our house took center stage this week. I know I don't write about him often, and it's just because there's not much to tell.  Beau keeps to himself, and sleeps most of the time on a dog bed that he's claimed as his own. I think this is partly due to pain he has because of his chronic ear infections that we can't seem to clear up, no matter what is done, both at home and by the vet.  I've made an appointment at a dermatologist for the end of the month in hopes that perhaps they have a trick or two up their sleeves that will resolve them once and for all.Beau did return to the ophthalmologist a couple of days ago.  ~Watching people before our appointment~ The eye lift he had in September was a total failure and a waste of money.  The only solution to the entropian is surgery. But because of his age, (about 14), the Ophthalmologist does not recommend it.  There is good news however, the two medications are providing relief for his eyes, and they are no longer red and irritated. So we've decided to manage it with the use of medications.~Waiting for the Opthalmologist~After Beau's appointment with the ophthalmologist it was back to work for me in the afternoon. To save time, I took him with  me. You may recall how the non-dog-loving-doctor I work for is very understanding and lets me bring the dogs into the office, providing that a few rules are followed. One is that they stay quietly in our break-room. I was with a patient when I heard a \"woof.\"  Then silence.  A few minutes later, another \"woof.\"  It wasn't a distressed woof, more like a \"hello?\" Then there was another. I thought I'd explained the rules to Beau, but apparently he didn't care. Who knew that Beau was such a rebel?     -The break-room at my office-"},

(Below, another appearance of our resident Barred Owl yesterday.  I was only able to snap 2 photos before my camera battery died.)My day off on Thursday that was supposed to be a relatively uneventful one, turned out to anything but that. It ended with my making a cinnamon creme coffee cake for a co-workers birthday that I baked in a pan that was too small.  The result was a smoke filled house that the Golden's didn't seem too worried about, despite the smoke alarms going off more than once.  I think they were hoping for a bite of whatever it was that was burning at the bottom of the oven.  (recipe here)Todd however, refused to come back inside until the smoke cleared. I decided it was because he knew better than to come running back into what he thought was a burning house.  He's smart that way.  The week ended with another visit from the holistic vet to see Gus. As I mentioned last week, Gus really enjoys the extra attention and the treatments.The other dogs however, as you can hear below in the video, vocally protest to what they see as an injustice of being put into the office while Dr.E is here. Cissy echoes in agreement to the unfairness of it all!"},

I'll call him back inside if it continues too long, but I'll admit that I pretty much ignore him.  This morning however, the barks seemed different. I glanced out the window and saw that two labs had wandered onto our property.  They were friendly girls with collars that (thankfully!) gave the owners phone number. We were able to contact the owners who told us they were out of town. A call back a few minutes later, and Carl was speaking with the person caring for them, and the girls were on their way home.  Apparently the pet-sitter hadn't secured the gate when she left them that morning and Chloe and Abby were off on an adventure that took them to our place, via the muddy fields, more than a mile from their home. Now each time Todd has gone outside, he immediately starts barking, patrolling the fence, convinced the two girls are still there.He just ignores me when I try to tell him otherwise.  He'll figure it out in a few days."},

Gus literally turns into jello during treatments.  I really need to take a photo of the visible smile on his face that radiates contentment during her visits.  Dr. E is kind, caring and compassionate. Those qualities are really needed when your vet practice is solely providing supportive care for dogs like Gus, who on the 23rd passed the six month mark that he's been with us. A milestone that one vet and a few doubters didn't think possible. After Dr. E left it was time to venture out onto the snowy, wet and sloppy roads to do a few errands.One stop was the laundromat to wash quilts, blankets and dog beds. With the change machine not working, I decided to go to a bank across the street to get $10 in quarters.  The bank wouldn't give it to me because I don't bank there.  A single roll of quarters, really?  I even had a $10 bill.  The teller seemed embarrassed that she couldn't give it to me, and asked another who didn't want to break the rules, and a third that the other two seemed to defer to, didn't want to be bothered by such a trivial request-- Because after all, I don't bank there.  I got the roll of quarters from the feed store where I buy bird food. Customer service at its worst. But Todd enjoying the snow, that's not going to last, the best! To all of you celebrating tomorrow, Happy Thanksgiving!!"},

After stopping for lunch, we were finally home by late afternoon. In the warmth of the late afternoon sun, we spent some time outside with all the dogs. Cricket was having a pretty good day today, but still seems to tire easily. She has pretty much gotten over her bout with vestibular syndrome. However, she's has had a couple of days this week that haven't been the best. I think it may be her arthritis that's bothering her, because she sometimes has problems walking and staying on her feet. But her appetite is good, thanks to the added cat food! So, we'll continue to take each day as it comes for this little lady that has just less than 3 months until her 17th birthday.I hope you've had a pretty good day too."},

I also wanted to talk to my vet about a plan to resolve all his skin problems and allergies. We were loaded up with everything from eye medications to shampoos, that all together I think will eventually make a difference, and relieve all his itchiness.     Buddy is a friendly and affectionate boy with great house manners, and does what he's asked to do. Buddy may not have received his needed vet care, but it wasn't because his family didn't care about him, they simply weren't able to afford it. Below is part of an e-mail the volunteer who picked him up wrote to me when I asked her about Buddy's former family:  \"Buddy's owner was genuinely upset when he handed Buddy over to me and was crying.  It was very obvious that he loved Buddy and was going to miss him terribly.  He has actually called and texted me to see how Buddy is doing ... he lived in a rather low-income area and jobs are pretty scarce so I understand how things could have gotten to this point with Buddy.  I'm sure the he was hoping that things would turn around for him and he could afford Buddy's care again.  I think Buddy was definitely attached to his owner, he said that he loved going for walks to the park.  The morning he brought Buddy out to me he said Buddy thought he was going to the park because he was so excited. I felt so bad driving away with this man's dog that he loved.  That was my first time picking up a dog from a give up owner, and I don't think I'll be volunteering to do it very often.\"  My heart really goes out to this man that I've never met. It's a sad story, but one that in this economy is repeated all too often.  However, Buddy is going to be okay because of his unselfishness and doing what was best for him. I hope his former owner will be too."},

", "date": "Friday, November 14, 2014", "text": "Relieved.  That's how I'm feeling.  Relieved that the long week is finally over and that a little excursion with Sunny is over too. I realized about a week ago that Sunny's rabies vaccine was nearly expired. Given Sunny's history, it's best to make sure that he's kept up to date on everything.  My regular vet is about an hours drive each way. So with spare time at a premium and knowing Sunny would be stressed out by the car ride and being at the vet, I opted to take him to a practice that's closer to home. The vet-hospital is a large multi-doctor, 24 hour-a-day practice. Because of my involvement with the rescue, I've taken dogs there over the years and am familiar with a few of the vets that work there.There is only one vet that I prefer not to see for reasons ranging from his indifference, to what a co-worker and I think is just his total incompetence. What were the odds that he would be the one Sunny would be seeing?  Better than I thought they would be.  Of course \"he\" didn't remember me. I explained to him Sunny's history and asked him to please take it slowly with him because it was easy to see that he was visibly nervous. I suggested a muzzle to do the exam and to keep everyone safe. He rolled his eyes, explained to me that he was experienced with nervous dogs like Sunny, but they would muzzle him if it made me feel better.  Along with his arrogance, I'll admit that I also didn't like the way \"he\" related to Sunny when he was examining him, calling Sunny names like, baby, boo-boo, sweetheart, honey and precious. (blech!) But the exam and vaccine were given without any problem and I was relieved when it was all over.  I then offered to remove Sunny's muzzle, but \"he\" did it instead and when it was taken off, Sunny whipped his head around and snapped at him, and headed for the door.  \"He\" didn't say a word, and when I was paying the bill, I had to grin when I saw on Sunny's chart a bright yellow \"caution\" sticker. I do love a good \"I told you so\" and my good boy Sunny too.Thank-you all for your continued good wishes for Cricket and welcome for Buddy.

Late yesterday afternoon we welcomed Buddy to Golden Pines.  He comes to us from another foster home where he and the residing dog had gotten into a fight. Unfortunately, Buddy was badly injured and the two were unable to get along after that. Before coming into the rescue, Buddy was living around the city of Baltimore Maryland.Unfortunately his owner has come up against some hard times and was unable to care for Buddy who has been plagued with severe skin allergies for quite some time. His coat is really thin, and missing in a lot of places, including on his face.  Buddy doesn't feel really well, has a very poor appetite, and it's thought that there are other underlying health issues that will have to be dealt with very soon.   Buddy's introductions to his new pack went pretty well.  We took things very slowly because it can be overwhelming for a dog who may already be feeling stressed out.  But today, after a good nights sleep, he seems to be in better spirits and explored the yard and enjoyed some time outside getting better acquainted with everyone. Which takes us to Cricket.  Many thanks for all your good wishes and vibes for her which have really helped. I would guess that she's already about 50% recovered.Just as I hoped, Cricket is back on her feet, but still has dizzying moments and will stumble and fall over. We are hand feeding her right now even though she doesn't have much of an appetite because of the nausea she's feeling from everything.  It's all very tiresome for her and she's sleeping a lot.  But she did choose to spend some time outside getting to know the \"new boy\" this afternoon which judging by the smile on her face, (below) I think was a good sign and she kind of enjoyed too, don't you think?I hope you enjoyed your weekend too!"},

I'd gotten all the dogs out again, and started the day. Just as we were settling into the morning Cricket who had seemed fine minutes before was suddenly unable to stand at all.  I got her to her bed and took a good look at her. With a very pronounced tilt of her head and because she was unable to stand, I thought it was canine vestibular syndrome. Cricket had a bout of it before she came to us, but for a couple of reasons, I didn't think that was what it was.  Fast forward past my phone calls and we were soon on our way to the vet. Cricket's regular vet is out of town, but my other vet was available.  Dr. D feels strongly that it is vestibular syndrome. Cricket had gotten sick a few times by then and she was given IV fluids, and an injection for nausea.Back at home I've put Cricket on her favorite bed and she is resting comfortably. Cricket is not a gal that likes to be handled, but thankfully she has let me pick her up and move her as needed. But despite my holding her, the vet visit was stressful for her nonetheless. She is understandably exhausted from the day.  I'm hoping there will be improvement over the weekend and Cricket will be at least able to stand on her own by its end."},

I really need these days but I'll admit that I always feel a little guilty about not getting much, if anything, done.

Even though I was up and out before the sun came up, I didn't get as much done today as I had hoped, but it was enough.  I was a little tired from being kept awake by Cricket the night before. She is a creature of habit and usually after dinner, she goes outside one more time and puts herself to bed, sleeping through the night.  Last night she was uncharacteristically awake, barking.  From her bed, Cricket would bark once, and then silence for awhile, then she would bark again. A few times I got up to see if she wanted to go out.  She didn't.  She was fast asleep.  This morning I received a text-message from her previous owner's niece telling me the sad news that her father had passed away the day before.  Did Cricket know? Whether you think that it's folklore or fact, many of us believe that our dogs are somehow guided by a canine sixth sense. Another case in point was just last week.  On Friday night, Sheba refused to come inside the house, and wanted to stay in my van that's parked in the garage.  I left her there with the intention of going back for her later.  I'm not sure how, but I forgot all about her, and when I opened the door in the morning, there she was!  After letting her outside and getting her a drink, she got into my van, and again refused to get out.  So, on a whim, I decided to take her with me on my early morning errands.  It was about six-thirty, and the first stop was the laundromat. At that early hour, no one was around, except a lady who looked to be in her 70's sitting in one of the chairs, waiting for her laundry to dry.  She greeted us warmly and Sheba went right to her. She sat there and hugged Sheba as I loaded one of the big washers with all the dog beds.  I sat down at the end of the row of chairs, and when I looked at her, and I could see that she was crying a little.  I asked her if she was okay, and she explained to me that she lived by herself, and that her dog, her only company had passed away a couple of weeks before.  She told me how much she missed her dog, and having one to hug.  Needless to say, my heart went out to her.  We had a nice chat as Sheba sat next to her side the whole time. After she left, I couldn't help but wonder, was it \"personal inspiration\" or did Sheba somehow know that she should go with me?  Or was it just a simple coincidence that at six-thirty on a Saturday morning, I would meet someone who needed Sheba?  I'll never know for sure. It is a proven fact that dogs have extraordinary senses such as hearing and smelling, but do they also have some other superior sixth sense? There is no real scientific evidence, but those of us who share our lives with dogs (and other animals) will agree that they certainly do continue to surprise us on a regular basis, don't they?"},
{"title": "Traffic Court", "date": "Thursday, October 30, 2014", "text": "~On our road~My day off today has been planned for the last several weeks. I was supposed to go to traffic court for a speeding ticket that I got in the town where I live.  I'll admit, that I was on the fence about going.  This was because I didn't have a compelling reason as to why I was speeding that would warrant the ticket maybe being dismissed.  But having not gotten a speeding ticket in more than 10 years, a friend of mine who is a police officer gave me some great advice, and suggested that I go. I really appreciated the advice and felt strongly that she was right that I should go.  So, I decided that I would make an appearance in traffic-court with other highway vigilantes just like me. Then yesterday when I verified everything online about going to court, I looked at the amount of the ticket. The option to pay the less than $200 ticket online was practically glaring at me.  So, on an impulse, because I knew that court cost ($60) would be added, I caved in and decided to just pay the ticket. Now I'll never know if I would have been given leniency and if the amount of the ticket would have been lowered.   But I got to meet a friend for an early lunch.Take the scenic route back home and...Spend time outside with the dogs. I got a rare photo of Sunny (below) where he's actually looking at me with the camera. Is it possible that he's getting over his fear of the camera? And I just got to relax and do practically nothing -- All things you just can't do in traffic court."},

I always look forward to the chance to get together with a friend or two, and I'm so glad that \"she\" made time on her busy trip to get together.The week ended with my getting off work early and rushing home to get ready for the holistic vet to come and see Gus.  For some reason, this was no easy task.  It started when I gave Todd two new balls to play with. I went inside for a few minutes only to rush back out again because Todd and Gus were having a \"disagreement\" over one of them. Todd takes these disagreements pretty seriously, too seriously actually. But with such limited mobility, Gus is no match for Tod; and thankfully there were no injuries. But with Cricket and the others on the sidelines taking bets and cheering on the fight, everyone was pretty excited. The scuffle was easy enough to break up, I just picked Todd up. Even in my arms Todd was trying to continue the fight; he's such a Scottie!  It did take some doing, but I finally managed to get everyone settled down.  All that only to have Dr. E cancel the appointment after she was already scheduled to be at our house. It was okay, another family needed her more, and I understand. But even today Todd is still not willing to share that new red ball with anyone. Not even Cricket, and certainly not Gus.  Forget the other new blue ball, he wants the red one all to himself."},

Another reminder of how I love the fall and the promise of nights beneath heavy blankets with Todd or Charlie warming my feet.  The weekend was spent mostly at home finishing up chores around the house and getting things stored and ready for winter.  I decided to tackle a flower bed that went untouched this year. The neglect started when the Phoebes built their nest nearby, and I didn't want to disturb them when they were giving parenthood a second try.  Then the black snakes, that I know are harmless were seen a few times around the porch and I just didn't want to chance an encounter with them, so I let it be.The roots of the weeds were pretty deep and I was finding that with cold hands and a bit of arthritis, I was having trouble pulling them out. So I did the only thing I could do; I went and got Carl and asked him to pull them for me while I took the dogs for a walk and took some photos.I thought it was a fair trade, and the dogs enjoyed it too."},

When I got home from work we enjoyed some outside time. Cissy (below) seemed lost in thought as she just sat and enjoyed the last rays of sun in the cool grass. Cricket ends her week finally feeling pretty good.  I didn't mention it, but she was a little sick last weekend, causing her appetite to be a bit off this week. Because of her kidney issues when she doesn't eat, it concerns me.  Her eating habits can best be compared to a cats because she's so finicky, and because if I mix cat food with her kibble, she'll usually eat. So, that's what I've been doing. I don't really like her eating canned cat food, but if she'll eat, I'm all for it.  But I decided to enlist the help of one of the girls at the shop where I buy the dog's food to try to find something a bit more nutritious for her and not meant for cats.  We found something that at least for tonight fooled this little girl who gobbled down every single bite of her dinner for the first time in about a week.Finally, this takes me to Charlie.  I really appreciated all for your thoughts and view points on what happened with him last weekend in the grocery store parking lot.  I did call our local sheriff's office about it on Monday. They'd not had any reports from anyone else about this type of thing happening. But the Deputy agreed that it could have possibly been an attempt to maybe steal Charlie from my van or to get money from me for him. And just as some of you suggested, the Deputy also recommended that I leave him at home instead of in my van unattended.  So safely at home is where my blue-eyed boy will stay for now. Wherever you 'stay' this weekend, I hope it's an enjoyable one!  ~Todd and his Shadow~"},

When I came out of the grocery store standing by my van was a man talking to Charlie who was sitting in the drivers seat. As I approached my van, he asked me where I'd gotten Charlie. As I opened the door to roll down the window for the two to meet, I briefly explained to him that Charlie had come from a shelter about 8 years ago when I was helping Old English Sheepdog Rescue. He told me that he and his family had a dog that looked like Charlie, named Sammy, and that they had lost him. He asked me my name and again where I'd gotten Charlie. When I told him the name of the shelter, he told me that he'd lived with his family in that town (that's not far from us) during that time. I told him that it was a pretty slim chance that Charlie was his dog, and I asked if his dog had a single blue eye.  He couldn't really recall if he did or not, but he *thought so.*  I said to him that Charlie's eye was a pretty unusual characteristic and I asked how he would not be able to remember that detail about him.  He ignored my comment, and was pretty adamant that Charlie looked a lot like the dog he'd lost, and said that he thought he was.~A first photo of Charlie in 2005~  I will admit that (for once) I didn't know exactly what to say.  I did think to say that I had Charlie legally-- He'd done all his time in the shelter that was required by law, no one came and Charlie was then made available for adoption.  I added that I'd met Charlie on his last day when he was turned over to Sheep Dog rescue. Ignoring what I'd said, he again asked me for my name, and I said to him that I wouldn't give it to him because there was no reason. By this time I was shaking a bit, and I told him that even if Charlie was his dog, he was mine, legally and had been for more than 8 years.~Charlie in 2006~He didn't even acknowledge what I'd said and instead again asked for my name.  I tried to remain polite even though I felt like he was bullying me a little, and all I felt I could do was to say that I wouldn't give it to him and repeated that Charlie was legally my dog. I added that if he was the dog he lost all those years ago, that he could feel good knowing that Charlie had a good home with us. I thanked him for the little chat, and told him I was going to leave. As I got into my van and started it, he didn't move for a moment, but stepped back and I drove off.I find the whole encounter with this man really unsettling, bizarre, and a few other things.  I also realize that he could have taken down my license plate, so I'll admit to having been slightly concerned that I may not have heard the last of him. However today, I think it is. Just in case it's not, I found the paperwork that I have from the shelter when I got Charlie. Proof that Charlie is indeed mine, legally.~Rerun of a photo from Thursday~"},

In my opinion, his 'eye-lift' with the surgical staples hasn't been totally successful.  Some of the staples have come out, and others seem to move, causing sores along the edge of his eyes and even some swelling.  However, the ophthalmologist was happy with the results and removed a few of the staples that were bothering him. As long as Beau is no longer in pain from his eyes, I suppose that's all that counts.   ~Beau waiting for the ophthalmologist~ It really was a beautiful day. Todd didn't want to come back inside, and napped his afternoon away outside in the cool grass. For the last week or so the utility company has been removing all the growth around the power lines on our road, including at the foot of our property. They do this every 3 years or so, and while I can appreciate why it's done, it doesn't mean that I have to like it.  I'd hoped they'd not cut down the area at the edge of our property that is close to the driveway of our neighbors.  Longtime readers may recall how disappointed I was when the power-lines were put up for our neighbors that all the trees and growth that kept the dogs on our property was cleared.  For two years, the area has grown undisturbed. ~Sheba finding her way through the hedge in August~I was on the other side of the yard with the dogs when I saw the tractor starting to mow it all down again. Of course I was upset by it, and went to ask the driver to not mow the whole hedge down.  Just as the driver was going to start a second pass, he saw me coming, and before I could throw myself in front of the tractor, he stopped mowing and opened his window to listen to me.  Listen was all he could do, because he was a Hispanic gentleman and I don't think he understood a word I said.  But he did slowly drive back down the hill, leaving about 2 feet of the new hedge untouched. I guess a wind-blown gray haired lady wearing an old bulky sweater, carrying a camera with two dogs on a leash, 3 others trailing behind and two other dogs barking inside the fence makes a clear point in any language. Either that or I (we?) scared him.  Probably both.  But I'm happy about it...And Cissy?  Well, she's just happy.  I hope you're enjoying your weekend!~Gus and Todd~"},

They are crawling, flying and landing on everything. Right now our front porch is covered with 100's that are trying to get inside and find a place to winter over.  Unfortunately it's going to be this way until the colder weather comes. ~My insect nemesis~I received all the medical records and other information on our newest permanent addition, the lovely Ms. Yellow. When she came to us six months ago, unlike it is with foster-dogs, I was told very little about her. I knew that she got along with dogs, and had been in another (foster) home that couldn't keep her. Ms. Yellow was treated for chronic ear infections which was thought to be food related.  This is why she's fed a premium dry food. Now that we have adopted her, we are privy to all her secrets. The lovely Ms. Yellow was found as a stray during Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. The person that found her, named her, and took her to the vet for her ears.  The vet found a spay scar and estimated her to be about 2 years old.  The ear infections weren't getting any better and the new owner was unable to pay for the extensive treatment that was being recommended, so she told the vet she was going to take her to the pound. The vet's office contacted the rescue Ms. Yellow came from, and the rest is history.  Ms.Yellow has traveled well over 100 miles to end up here...at Golden Pines...in a group home of dogs. She really does seem okay with that. Speaking of the 'group home,' with the loss of CarrieAnne, a few of you have asked who our new pack leader is.  The answer to that is as much as mystery as Ms.Yellow used to be. I can see the behavior and the dynamics of all the dogs is changing both in how they are interacting with one another and with us.

{"title": "The Tale of Two Sisters: CarrieAnne and Lucy ", "date": "Thursday, September 18, 2014", "text": "I'm deviating from my irregular-regular posts to tell you the story of CarrieAnne.  I know that it's quite long, and I know that it's one that some of you won't have the time to read and I respect and understand that.  It's a story that I've never written or talked about much over the years.  But I felt like with Carrie's recent passing, it was time to write Lucy and CarrieAnne's story so that they will be remembered.  **Thank-you** as always for stopping by my blog, and especially for your friendship, support and good thoughts that have truly made a difference!        ~CarrieAnne 6-14-2003 - 9-3-2014~I named her CarrieAnne because of the rural county, “Caroline” in Virginia where she’d come from.  Her sister, a mirror image of her was red and I named her Lucy Fox from a character I’d remembered from a childhood story. Carrie wore a little pink collar, but it had no tags. CarrieAnne and Lucy were strays and nobody claimed or adopted either of them.  Since the girls appeared to have Golden Retriever in them, the rescue that I volunteer with accepted them.  Both girls were very frightened and would sit curled into one another and would try to get away from you or freeze when you’d try to pet them.The girls were totally covered in ticks, and so our first evening was spent removing them.  They would silently endure the contact with us, never flinching, but hardly moving or making eye contact.   They both got along well with the dogs, and were the same age as Josh, who was about a year old at the time.  But they knew nothing about being dogs, they only knew fear.  Josh would try to get them to play with him but they would sit frozen, never moving or knowing how to react.  Eventually they would learn to play and eventually they would learn to cope with their fears, but in different ways.~Josh and CarrieAnne 2003~CarrieAnne throughout her life remained afraid of loud noises.  We lived in a subdivision in 2003, and taking her for a walk was frightening for her, and challenging for me. To try and build CarrieAnne's confidence, we would walk her with another dog who enjoyed going for walks thinking that she would learn to as well.  It didn't work.  Carrie would only walk to one nearby corner, and would then turn around and pull at the leash to be taken back home.  She would never cross the road, or want to go any farther. Her world was very small.  On the walks I held Carrie's leash very tightly because if a loud vehicle passed by, even before we got to the corner, she would frantically and wildly try to get away from me and whatever it was that had scared her. My biggest worry became her accidentally getting loose and running away, and not being able to catch her. In those wild moments of chaos I started saying the words \"home CarrieAnne, home\" and we would quickly go back to the house. My hope was that despite being so scared and out of control, she would hear those words and learn to go back to the security of \"home\" when something had frightened her.  It worked. The words, \"home CarrieAnne, home\" became a phrase that she came to know and would be used throughout her life.Carrie's sister Lucy was also shy, but of the two she was the more confident and outgoing one.  The world to her was not quite as frightening.  She was however, fiercely loyal to her sister.  Anyone that she didn’t know that tried to approach CarrieAnne would be warned to stay away by an alert stance and a sharp bark.  The two were always together, and when they slept, Lucy always slept with her head on Carrie's back, keeping watch.~CarrieAnne's sister, Lucy 2003~Lucy’s guarding CarrieAnne was in part why I decided that I should split them up and place them in separate homes.  I felt that Carrie and Lucy needed the chance to blossom on their own.  So, I made them both available for adoption through the rescue.  I would meet a couple that could offer everything that I felt Lucy needed, and so I placed her with them and their dog.  It all went pretty well at first.  But then Lucy began to not let anyone she didn't trust come near her, or her family.  The behavior was \"allowed\" to escalate, and Lucy began charging at and biting everyone she saw as a threat.  A trainer felt that Lucy’s behavior was driven by her fears, and a natural territorial instinct to guard. For many (understandable) reasons, the family felt that they could no longer keep Lucy, and so she was returned to me.Lucy and I began working with a behaviorist to try and curb her behavior and help her work through her fears.  I thought we were making progress but one day Lucy ran out the door and bit a child standing in front of our house. In that moment, I knew we had failed. Lucy had no bite inhibition whatsoever.  Because we lived in a subdivision, it was impossible to keep Lucy and everyone else completely “safe” from her charging at them. So, after a lot of discussion with several experts and the rescue, the heartbreaking decision was made to euthanize Lucy.  Times were different in 2004, and no one knew of any other options. The guilt and regret of the whole experience with Lucy has always stayed with me.  But I find comfort in knowing that despite her fears, Lucy knew what it felt like to be loved and safe.  I often used words from a Byron poem to describe Lucy in that she was “A troubled stream, but from a pure source.”  ~Lucy, 2003~The experience with Lucy is why we decided to adopt CarrieAnne. I was so afraid a similar thing happening to her and I knew that if she stayed with us, I could keep that from happening to her. So, Carrie became an official member of our household in the late summer of 2004.~The \"official\" gang December 2004~CarrieAnne never totally got over her fears, but she learned to cope with them, and she learned to trust people on her own terms.  She found companionship and security both with us and the other dogs. ~Christmas photo 2010~ When we moved to “Golden Pines” in 2007 it proved to be the perfect place for Carrie.  Here in the country away from the noise of the city, CarrieAnne found peace, contentment and her confidence.  She blossomed into what she was meant to become.In 2011, Rudi passed away.  CarrieAnne became the pack leader. She had earned the respect of the other dogs, and took that role very seriously.  For whatever reason, Sheba would challenge Carrie. One year the two had several fights that would usually end with Sheba needing to be taken to the vet. ~Sheba after a fight with Carrie~Very thankfully we (and they) were able to work it out and for the last 3+ years of Carrie's life, the two truly were canine-sisters and got along wonderfully.  Outside they would always run and play together.While Carrie may have been a \"tough little street fighter\" she was also a very affectionate and delightful companion.  She would often come and sit next to me (always on my left side), lean into me and I'd put my arm around her and talk quietly into her ear, and maybe tell her a secret or two. She would quietly listen.  There always seemed to be a little bit of uncertainty in CarrieAnne's eyes, but they sparkled and I could see the trust and happiness. CarrieAnne felt confident enough to to go off on her own to explore around our property. One summer she found a place to swim and would come back on those hot evenings, soaked. I never could find where she had gone, but will admit that I never really looked.  I let it stay her secret.But when I wanted her to come home, or the loud noises came, as they sometimes did, I would call out \"home CarrieAnne, home\" and it would always bring her back to the safety of the house.The times that Carrie seemed most content was when she could just be outside stretched out in the grass in the warm sun.  A favorite place was the hay field that adjoins our property.Seeing her there, it was easy to see a peace and calm about her that I'd hardly see at any other time. Sometimes she would sniff the air, and let out a little \"yip.\"  I couldn't help but wonder if maybe during those times, Lucy was nearby, continuing to watch over her.Sadly, Carrie's time with us would suddenly end on September 3, 2014 shortly after surgery to remove a mast-cell tumor.  The tumor was larger than expected making the surgery more involved.  It was just too much for her. A few days later I received an e-mail from the surgeon, who said in-part,  \"Despite the awful outcome, I do want to assure you that surgery was CarreAnne's best hope.   ...during surgery when I could fully appreciate how far the tumor had progressed, it was clear that CarrieAnne's time would have been very short without surgery.\" The surgeon's e-mail was appreciated, but did little to ease the guilt I've felt at her loss.  Just as with Lucy, there will always be regrets. But I find comfort in knowing that CarrieAnne did have a good life.  She found security, love and a good home with us.  I know she was happy.   The morning after CarrieAnne passed away, I stood outside with the other dogs totally consumed by the darkness of the early hour and her loss. Across the hay field that Carrie loved, I heard the echo of a dog barking off in the distance. Without realizing it, I heard myself saying \"home CarrieAnne, home.\" and in that moment of heartbreak and silence, a voice from my heart said, \"I am.\""},

No time for goodbye. The dizzying numbness and heartbreak as Carrie silently slipped away.  My soul begging God to please spare her.  The moment and feeling of  helplessness trying grasp what was happening and to understand.  The feeling of heartbreak and despair takes over.  Then my mind goes back to the start of the day. Carrie was happy as we began our day.  I took her to the vet's office and kissed her goodbye.  She didn't want to go with the technician, but she was always shy that way.  Off to work, but a nagging deep inside stays with me.  The call from the surgeon telling me all had seemed to go as planned. However the mast-cell tumor was larger than they'd expected, was more complicated to remove than they'd hoped.  Carrie had awakened from surgery and was doing okay.  Someone had sat with her most of the afternoon. She was alert and \"okay.\"  A time was set for me to come and get her.  Despite the news, the uneasiness stayed with me.  Something about it wasn't right. I left work earlier than planned, for whatever reason, I wanted to just go to the office and wait until it was time for her to go home.  On my way a call from the vet asking me to come earlier, CarrieAnne wasn't doing well.  She had suddenly developed a fever and was having problems breathing.  The feeling I'd had all day literally takes over.  I couldn't get there fast enough.  Was that feeling I'd been having for days just my typical worrying, or was it an omen telling me what was to come?  I think it was both.  The loss of CarrieAnne is truly a devastating loss.CarrieAnne was our pack leader and had been part of our home since June of 2003.  She was a canine-sister to Sheba, respected by Todd and the others. CarrieAnne was very shy by nature, but when she wasn't afraid, she was a delightful, affectionate playful companion that was always happy, always wagging her tail. Always leaning into me when I would pet her.  Her big round gray brown eyes always looking at me for reassurance and security. I've never shared her story of rescue here on my blog, and at some point, I will write it.  It needs to be told and remembered here. But today is a day for mourning her loss.  CarrieAnne will be and is greatly missed.God-speed my little CarrieAnne, my little cutie-pie, my little muffin.  You taught me so much, about trust and about finding joy and happiness despite being afraid.  At the Rainbow Bridge, there is no fear, and you'll be met by so many who have gone before you, including your sister Lucy who left us so many years ago.  Let them all know we remember them, and that like you, they are missed, and that we look forward to the day when we will see you again."},

It was much too hot and muggy to do anything outside. But I decided today was the day I was going to follow the advice of some local gardening experts and pick the unripe pears off our tree instead of waiting a few more weeks. Its been a few years since we've had pears that weren't ruined by my nemesis the brown-marmorated-stink-bug, or just had enough to pick. ~Sheba, my pear-picking-companion~You may know that pears are best picked green, and are one of the only fruits that don’t ripen on the tree. The pears in the picture below are all “green,” and are pretty hard. But since fruit produces a natural ethylene gas, I've put them into paper grocery sacks to soften and ripen them. Sheba and Josh have been eating the pears off the tree for weeks now. How they have not gotten an upset stomach is anyone's guess.~Sheba and Josh, Goldens in a pear tree!~But I cannot wait to enjoy the first ripe pear. It always reminds me of an old wives tale that I've heard over the years says that the best way to eat a ripe and juicy pear is “naked in the bathtub so the juice can drip down your chin with abandon.”  I can and will definitely promise you that if I do this, you'll not be hearing about it.  How do you like to enjoy your pears?"},

The unofficial end of summer.  This morning there was a real thickness in the morning air and the heavy humidity caused beaded droplets on the windows. This afternoon there have been heavy storms.  Each day we are losing a little light and it's now dark at 6 in the morning when the dogs and I have our first walk of the day.Our last week of August was filled with work, vet appointments and single-parenting, with little time for anything else. Beau went with me to the office one day.  As you can see he was really excited to have to stay in our break room.   But we left early because he had an appointment to see the ophthalmologist, for his \"eye-lift.\"        ~Beau, post eye-lift~The procedure isn't exactly what I expected, but we're hopeful that the surgical staples will stay in place and ease the discomfort for the months ahead.  If not, surgery may be on the agenda for him. Gus also returned to the vet to have his wound checked.  He continues to get around pretty well. The healing of the pressure sore is a slow process, and the reality is that it may never completely heal.  But Gus is happy and content, and that's what matters. Finally, there's CarrieAnne. Her surgery to remove a mast-cell tumor is scheduled for this Wednesday.  I took her for a consultation with another surgeon. The removal of the tumor could be done less expensively at a clinic that has a good reputation, and does a lot of surgeries. However, a discussion with someone made me realize that something that's just as important as the surgery is the care Carrie receives when it's done. I've known for a long time that this particular clinic doesn't always provide the best aftercare.  And because in the past Carrie has had problems post surgery, I've opted to have it done at my vet's office, where she will be monitored more closely. I'm nervous for her, but am remaining hopeful that all will go well.~CarrieAnne, YES, that's a plant growing through our porch!~ I hope all is going well for you this weekend!~The lovely little Cricket~"},

Because I have to balance Carrie's care and the cost together, there are decisions that will have to be made as to who will do the surgery.  I've called for a consultation with a surgeon who did surgery on Sheba, Josh, and our boy Hamlet a few years ago, who I like and very much trust.  Yesterday the vet that is doing acupuncture on Gus gave me some good suggestions and a lot of encouragement.  I'm trying to remain hopeful and positive, but in the quiet moments, I'm finding that right now, it's not easy."},

Scottie's are nicknamed \"the Diehard\" in reference to their rugged character that is tough, determined and ready for action. Todd is fearless and feisty. He is also a hunter. Unfortunately.  Nothing in our yard gets past him.  Sadly the rabbits that built a nest right next to our fence didn't know that (and I didn't realize they were there) and two family members were lost last week, when Todd dug a hole under the fence to get to the little ones. The rest of the family remains safe as that area is now cornered off.Turning his attention to something else, for the past several days Todd has been curiously and obsessively looking at something by our barn. I thought (and hoped) it was probably a mouse. Yesterday he began barking wildly and hysterically. It was a high-pitched bark as he ran back and forth along the side of the barn. I gathered my courage and went to see what he was barking at.  I saw nothing other than the hole he had dug by the fence. I asked him to come inside, which he reluctantly did.  A few hours later, thinking whatever was there was probably gone, I let Todd out again.  All was quiet for a few moments, then the frenzy and excitement began all over again.  Taking a deep breath, and saying a silent prayer for my bravery, I went to see what it was, and it was then that I saw it. A box turtle, that was digging its way into the yard.  I breathed a big sigh of relief.   I took it outside the fence, where Sheba, being a Golden Retriever, tried the more diplomatic approach to make friends. But the turtle would have none of that and it turned to leave.   Then it changed its mind and turned back towards the fence for another encore from Todd, who gave him one. I think I saw it take a bow as it  turned around and went back towards the woods.  Hopefully to never be seen again..."},

{"title": "The Small Town Renegades ", "date": "Monday, August 18, 2014", "text": "The day started out normally enough.  I'd walked, loved, fed and medicated the dogs and left the house right on time.  Then, it happened.... On my road just before town, there was a Great Dane and a puppy in the road.  Cars were going past, and the older one knew to avoid the cars, but the little one was obviously confused as to what to do.  I honked my horn, thinking I could scare them both back into the yard of the nearby house, or alert the tenants that their dogs were out.  But instead, it startled the puppy who then ran as fast as she could into a nearby field. Without much time to spare, I pulled over to see if I could at least catch the puppy.  When I opened the side door to get a leash, the adult Great Dane ran over to me and jumped into my van.  I only had to catch the puppy, which was a little difficult because she was so scared.  But using my 'happy voice' and wanting to follow its partner in crime, I managed to get them both inside. Fortunately they were both nice and very friendly dogs. Of course neither had collars with ID tags on them.  The puppy quickly became playful and even ate my breakfast that I'd left on the seat.  The big-boy just seemed happy that the adventure was going to continue.     After stopping several passing cars, I decided to take the duo home and put them into our yard.  Of course pandemonium broke out inside the house when our dogs realized that their turf had been invaded.  I was in such a rush, and so pressed for time by now, but I decided to post on two Facebook pages for our town about the dogs.  Then I took a few more minutes to make signs to put up around where I'd found the dogs. And somehow in all of that, I managed to lose my cell phone, and even locked my keys in my van.  At least something was going right because I was able to find my phone, unlock my van, just as I received the phone call from the one person who I knew could help me--Lydia, my dog-walker.  She knows practically every dog in our town, surely she'd know these two.  Unfortunately she wasn't sure who owned the two renegades, but she told me who she thought they might belong too, and she suggested that I call them and ask. I very reluctantly made the phone call to the one person I didn't want to call, who confirmed that yes, their two dogs were missing. I was so relieved to have found their owner and I offered to bring them to their home, but she insisted that she'd have her husband come to get the dogs. I told her I wouldn't be there, so he could come anytime.  Our conversation was brief, to the point, and I was politely thanked for the call and keeping the dogs safe.  And just who was the owner of the two dogs I now had in my yard that had caused chaos to break out in my house, me to be late for work, and who'd gotten my clothes dirty by jumping and slobbering on me and who'd eaten my breakfast?  The owner was no one other than my former dog-walker -- You may recall that I had to fire her last fall after she was arrested for stealing prescription medications from (other) client's homes. What are the odds of that?  Do I live in a small town or what?"},

Surgery to correct it could be done.  However given his age, (about 13ish) the ophthalmologist is recommending a less invasive procedure that can probably best be described as an \"eye-lift\"--Something our cat, the lovely Ms. Yellow (below) certainly doesn't need --But if the rescue agrees and approves, I think will make a difference for Beau."},

It was also so thoughtful of Dr. E to be concerned about how I was personally doing in carrying the load of caring for Gus. Her advice to me was the same as many of you have given me, which was to remember to take \"time out\" for myself and have some fun.  It was well timed advice because a friend and I had bought tickets a few weeks ago to see the musical, \"The Lion King\" at the Kennedy Center. The evening began at a restaurant near the Kennedy Center with \"Nana Sue's meatloaf,\" scalloped potatoes, bacon braised green beans with sweet onion mushroom gravy.My friend and I couldn't and didn't finish our big dinner and so we had room for dessert.  I had warm fudge cake with milk chocolate caramel topped with a scoop of passion fruit ice cream.We enjoyed a nice walk back to the Kennedy Center, noticing a 7-Eleven that seemed a little out of place. We found our seats and waited for the show to begin.  It was an experience that no words can accurately depict.

On Friday Beau was taken to a vets office,where he was bathed and groomed to get rid of mats and all kinds of little critters in his coat and he received treatment for severe eye and ear infections.  Beau is unable to hear because of continued untreated ear infections.  The opening to both his ears are so small that the applicator for the ear medication barely fits into them.Beau also has entropion in both eyes. *Entropion is an abnormality of the eyelids in which the eyelid \"rolls\" inward. This inward rolling causes the hair on the surface of the eyelid to rub against the eye, causing pain --if you look at his eyes in the photos, you can see it. So Beau will be seeing an ophthalmologist for a consultation for treatment. ~My handsome co-pilot~We are now on day three that Beau has been with us.  He's an easy going happy boy that loves attention and is constantly wagging his tail.  While our crew is used to meeting new dogs, my most nerve-wracking and stressful moments always come when they have to meet a new addition.  The first meeting went really well and Beau is getting along with everyone, even Todd.  He's learning the routine, has claimed a dog bed and is settling into his new life at Golden Pines.~A comfy and warm bed at the end of a long day~"},

I'll admit to you that I'm very tired and worn out, and I’ve thought about taking a blogging break. Like you, I try very hard to balance blogging and living, and for the most part, I'm \"mostly\" doing it.  I know there are a lot of bloggers who, if they're not blogging every day, not tweeting, or not making whatever goal they feel they should be making, it causes them a lot of stress.

I prefer to not write a post than do one that was half-hearted.~Charlie's summer haircut~However, just as I mentioned, right now there's a lot going on.  One is that along with Gus's wound, I'm really struggling to keep him up and mobile. When I left for work on Monday, he was fine. He was able to walk, and get himself outside.  But something changed during the time I was gone, because when I got home, he couldn't/wouldn't stand or walk.  Each day there has been a little bit of improvement.  He can almost stand on his own, but he's almost totally dependent on us to help get him up and outside and move him from place to place. I spoke to a holistic vet on Tuesday about Gus. She'll be coming next week to evaluate him and maybe do acupuncture. Also discussed was how Gus is coping with these recent changes.  Interesting that she would bring that up because I don't think Gus is coping well at all.  I would say that he's (understandably) frustrated.  He barks and whines a lot. I'm dosing him heavily on a couple of natural remedies to help relieve his stress. It seems to be working some, and he is seemingly a little more relaxed and content.  This afternoon Gus sees his regular vet to check his wound and we'll talk about whether this is the progression of his degenerative myleopathy, or something else.  I'm hoping Dr.C will have some thoughts and suggestions. I'll admit, this has me worried. But Gus is still wagging his tail so if he's not giving up, neither am I.   ~Gus~Thank-you all for your kindness and friendship, and for being extremely supportive and understanding.  Please don't forget about \"us\" during this hectic time.  I have a three day weekend coming up, and I've got my fingers crossed that I'll get caught up on life and blogging.  But I'm frequently overly optimistic about what I can do in a weekend, so we'll see."},

The heat and humidity will start its gradual return over the weekend, but the weathermen is saying that it won't \"get its legs back\" until next week -- And we're all okay with that!The dogs are enjoying it, especially Charlie who is way past due for his summer haircut, which he'll get on Saturday. Gus's pressure sore continues to heal and I'm so happy with how the wound is starting to look underneath the bandage.  I heard from the rescue this week, and it's official, Gus will spend the remainder of his life with us at Golden Pines. As you know, the original vet that saw him said that she estimated he'd live 6 months or so.  The vet that first saw Gus about his pressure sore, saw no value in Gus at all.  But his current vet, Dr. C has become our hero for her great care, expertise, kindness and positive attitude that has restored my hope that this chapter in Gus's life, no matter how long it will be, can be one of comfort and contentment. I hope your weekend is one of \"comfort and contentment\" too.~Early morning in our yard~"},

Here are just a few things I've done this week while I was gone.Absolutely nothing was done on Tuesday evening because...  ~Charlie, doing nothing~a fast moving storm blew past us and knocked out our power in the early hours of the evening. Thankfully power was restored about 3:30 in the morning. However, it was a quiet and enjoyable evening where all we could do was sit on the porch and watch the day end.~Sunset from our front porch~On Wednesday we were playing catch-up getting done what we couldn't do the night before.  Thursday rolled around much too quickly and after work I was back at the vet with Gus. The pressure sore is slowly healing, but it still has a ways to go. Also on Thursday I guess Gus had decided that he'd had enough of being kept in our bedroom during the day with Sheba and Cricket because he chewed up the door frame and broke the door knob.  Necessity truly is the mother of invention because using a tee-shirt, I've found a way to cover Gus's hip-bandage that will keep the other dogs (namely Sunny) from bothering the wound.  He'll now be allowed to be with the other dogs during the day.    ~Gus with Cissy in the background~ By Friday, just as I always am, I was exhausted.... ~Sleepy Cricket~and we went to bed early.Today we've just been relaxing, and spending a little time at home and with the dogs.

{"title": "What July Offers", "date": "Sunday, July 6, 2014", "text": "The July 4th weekend really and truly marks summer, doesn't it?  Summer weather patterns set in and we get thunderstorms -- Some are pretty severe like the one we had on Thursday which closed our road for a few hours when a tree fell.  As long as our power doesn't go out, I love to hear the rumble of thunder in the distance, watch the skies darken and hear the pounding rain.  I enjoy watching the sun come out again--Then there are those times when there is both both rain and sunshine at the same time.In July, I think everyone slows down. After all, it’s too hot and humid to do much of anything but sit. Grab a cool glass of something to drink, put your feet up and relax. To me, that sounds pretty good, and we did just that on Saturday when we met 2 other couples at a local winery.  The setting of the winery is lovely and it was an enjoyable afternoon catching up with friends we don't often get the chance to visit.I think that every month, every season has its own pleasures. Though I like to complain about a lot of things...I’m just going to be quiet, and appreciate what July has to offer.~View from our front porch~I hope you've had a good weekend too!  ~Cissy~"},
{"title": "Gray Skies Are Gonna Clear Up!  ", "date": "Wednesday, July 2, 2014", "text": "Despite the searing heat and humidity (it is July after all) its been a pretty good week so far.  It began with the first vet visit of the day on Monday for CarrieAnne to recheck the lump on her right shoulder. It's good news for her, in that the lump is less than half the size it was originally.  I am happy, relieved, and extremely grateful for all of you who have sent good vibes that I've no doubt helped make it possible.  There is still a little ways to go, the lump is a bit smaller than a tangerine, but we're optimistic. The vet and I agree that it's probably a tumor that has gotten infected. So CarrieAnne will remain on medications (and Chinese herbs) for a couple of more weeks when we'll recheck the lump again and decide the next step. I got CarrieAnne home, relaxed for a little while, and then packed up Gus and took him to see my other favorite vet, Dr. C. The pressure sore is beginning to heal and looking healthier. We're trying a \"honey-bandage\" on the wound to help it to heal. I don't know about you, but I've never heard of using honey for anything other than for eating.  But when Dr. C was telling me about putting honey directly onto wounds, I felt that it was something we needed to try.  Raw-honey helps draw fluid away from the wound and suppresses the growth of microorganisms that can be resistant to antibiotics. When I changed Gus's bandage this evening, even though it has a way to go, it looked to me at least, that the wound was starting to heal. The other dogs are doing well too.  Yesterday when my dog-walker came, Gus, Sheba and Cricket had somehow gotten locked in our bedroom.  The door has a keyed lock that we never received the key for and despite her best of efforts, she was unable to get it to open.  I wasn't worried, and knew they would be okay until Carl got home. But I just had to grin when she told me that slid treats under the door for them--Is she a gem or what? ~Sheba~"},
{"title": "Review:  The KONG Jumbler Football ", "date": "Tuesday, July 1, 2014", "text": "I interrupt our irregular schedule of posting to bring you a product review.  To start, we never get asked to review something~I know, how could that be?  So, to be asked to just give an honest opinion on a toy by a company whose products I have bought plenty of over the years, of course I agreed. Now onto our review! About two weeks ago we received a KONG Jumbler FootBall, courtesy of the KONG company. The Jumbler Football is a recently introduced KONG product, and is available in two shapes (football and round) and two sizes (M/L and L/XL).  Because of the Goldens, I always buy \"Golden sized\" toys for Todd, so I asked for the L/XL football.This toy is different than any other toy our gang has had before and I felt they would like playing with it for several reasons.  For one, it has everything our dogs love, handles to make it easy for them to carry it, a tennis ball inside, and best of all, it squeaks, which is always a plus in a toy for them. The Jumbler didn't disappoint! ~Todd when he realized that the Jumbler squeaked~The handle on either end means that I can hold one end and play a little game of tug and it makes it easier to throw it too -- Retrieving is, of course, one of our crew's favorite games. The squeaker is loud and really gets their attention, and for our gang, it makes it more fun for them to play with.As with all toys, it's meant for supervised use, and the Jumbler is not designed to be a \"chew toy\" but I can't keep our dogs from doing that, especially Todd.  So, I did let Todd and his powerful Scottie jaws \"test-chew\" it for a couple of minutes, under strict, direct supervision.  While he was able to somewhat get his Scottie sized mouth around it, I feel it is too large to be a choking hazard for him or the others.  Like so many of the KONG toys, it feels really durable and is very sturdy.  Todd didn't manage to damage each time I have allowed him to have it throughout the week.  He takes testing \"Scottie-tough-toys\" very seriously! Charlie was a little more gentle with the Jumber.    But he did try to chew it, because that's just what he does.  He also didn't damage it.  I think it's a fun toy that ticks all the boxes from durability to fun! It has become a favorite, especially for Todd -- Here's a little video so you can see for yourself.Thank-you KONG for asking us to review the KONG Jumbler Football!  If need a review of another one of your products, I hope you'll ask us again! **If the football isn't for your pup, click here for a video on the KONG Jumbler BallI'll now return to our irregular schedule of posting.  Later today, I'l post an update on Gus and CarrieAnne's follow up vet-visits.  Enjoy your Tuesday!!"},
{"title": "The Value of a Dog Named Gus", "date": "Saturday, June 28, 2014", "text": "Another exhaustive week is coming to an end.  On Monday what I thought was an infected hot-spot on Gus's back leg, turned out to be an infected pressure sore (or bed-sore) instead. I will begin by saying that it's very rare that I can't see one of my two favorite vets.  But since Gus couldn't wait until one of them could, I decided to take him to the vet that treated CarrieAnne for the lump on her neck. He'd taken such good care of Carrie, and in similar circumstances I've taken our other dogs to see him.  \"Dr. X\" is, in my opinion a very good and thorough vet, with confidence and experience and I respect and trust his professional judgement.  It ends there.  And I will begin by saying that I know that Gus has many health concerns, some of which will never be resolved and I know that his time with us is limited.  Which is partly why I left the office feeling discouraged and without much hope that was triggered because of what I felt was Dr. X's \"attitude\" towards Gus.  When those clouds cleared, I remembered why it was that I preferred not to take my senior dogs to him.  Dr. X, in my opinion, (I may be wrong) does not see the \"worth\" of a dog like Gus. All week long I've struggled with caring for Gus's infected, open wound, feeling that he (Dr. X) could have and should have done more to help Gus. All week long I struggled because I wanted to prove to him that Gus would indeed live to see the start of next week. All week long I kept seeing the value in trying to help a dog like Gus. But by Friday, I felt like I may be losing that battle and I knew Gus needed to be seen again.  I was relieved when Cissy and Cricket's vet could see him.  There is no doubt that Dr. C sees what I see in a dog like Gus.  It truly showed in how she interacted with Gus and how she patiently listened to my thoughts and concerns.  She has come up with a good, workable treatment plan that I feel is going to help the sore to heal, which I will tell you more about later. Finally, I just have to tell you that in the rush of my week I didn't need yet another proverbial wrench thrown into it. But as you well know, you don't always get that choice.  I will spare you the details of why and how it happened, and just tell you that I tripped going down the steps at my office on Thursday and I have fractured my ankle. It's now a beautiful color of purple with no sign of an ankle bone and there is something that vaguely resembles the foot and toes I've known my whole life. Thankfully I can put some weight onto it, but the doctor told me to stay off of it as much as possible.  I do enjoy a doctor with a good sense of humor! The way it looks right now, these chairs on my porch are going to remain empty for awhile. But I do hope you are able to relax and enjoy your weekend!"},

I think the dogs were all thinking \"what is it, and what have you done??\"  ~Toby checking out the new boy~Charlie saying 'get away from me kid'  Actually, he still says that!  Sammy and Todd, \"nice to meet you sir.\" Todd to Sammy:  \"Can we play?\"Of all of the dogs that we had at that time, five of them have passed away.  One dog in particular had just come to us a few days before Todd arrived.  Her name was Reggie.  She had been confiscated by animal control for neglect.  That neglect and mistreatment didn't hamper her sweet, kind and gentle spirit.  She soon became known as \"Momma Reggie\" because she took care of Todd like he was her own puppy.  Below are my favorite photos from that first day she and Todd met.  They had an immediate connection.   When Todd would whine in his crate, she'd stand there and look at me as if to say \"we need to do something.\"  She always slept near him.  ~A tired puppy is a happy puppy!~Todd was followed her everywhere.  We had Reggie through the entire summer.  Just as Todd was getting a little more grown up and a little more independent, she left us for the Rainbow Bridge.  Her \"job\" was done...

Another sign of summer was a harmless black snake on our porch this afternoon.  He was curled up on the back of the old chair.  For some reason, I wasn't as afraid seeing a snake as I have been in the past.

I know you'll understand when I say that I'm afraid to say it out loud because I don't want to jinx it.  However, I'm really hopeful that the medications and the chinese herbs together are making a difference for Carrie. Even if the lump isn't smaller, and she's still walking with a little bit of a limp, her appetite is back, she's no longer hiding and just seems to be herself which is what's important. Our new addition Gus has settled in nicely. What a sweet, goofy and silly boy he is!  I'm enjoying getting to know him, and having him around.  Today hasn't been the best day for him because he's having problems getting onto his feet that keep curling under.  But I'm hoping that it is just a bad day, and not a symptom that his degenerative myelopathy is progressing and tomorrow is a better day for our good ole boy named Gus."},

While I'm feeling a bit down and a bit distracted by life, Todd is protecting the home-front during the day from the deer that are grazing nearby  ...And Cricket is helping him at night.  I think Cricket has got the most unusual and biggest bark for a dog her size, don't you?  I think she sounds a bit like a beagle.

I am also reminded that our crew still need care and attention.  I returned to the vet this morning with CarrieAnne who has swelling on her right shoulder that I noticed on Wednesday night.  I know I've been a bit distracted the past few weeks, but I just have to think that I would have noticed the swelling because it's so obvious. Added to that \"theory\" is that Carrie isn't able to walk that well and is in pain.  The vet that we saw today took x-rays and we at least know it's (thankfully) not bone cancer.  But it is a tumor that is probably infected, which is why there is the noticeable swelling.  So we have started Carrie on various medications and an antibiotic. Feeling a bit beaten by everything that's happened, a good friend of mine called this afternoon to offer support and give me what I know is good, solid advice on a direction to take.  She's traveled this path more than I have and more than anything, I wish I didn't have to travel it again so soon.~CarrieAnne this evening~"},

At more than 15 years old, Annie had a good long life and remained sound in spirit, but her body, in particular her kidney's had failed her. It was a good fight that she fought well and hard for more than 2 years.Annie was to me, the classic senior Golden Retriever, the real 24 karat gold and a true gem in every sense.  I felt a connection to Annie the first day I met her on a cold rainy day in April of 2012. That day her owner Steve, in the final stages of cancer, kissed her head for the last time, whispered something in her ear, and with tears welling up in his eyes as he handed me her leash, he made me promise to take good care of her. I promised him that I would.    ...I have kept my promise.From the first day that Annie arrived at Golden Pines, she was accepted by the entire crew. Annie quickly became a full-fledged member of our pack and was intertwined within the fabric of all our lives.  Her loss has left Golden Pines with an emptiness that will never be filled again.  The verse below by Henry van Dyke seems perfect for Annie and provides comfort for me as I think about her being met on the other side by her family that loved her first, and her sister Sydney, her life's companion, who died a year before Annie came to us. A friend said to me today that \"the luckiest people in the world have shared their life with a good dog.\"  I am indeed very lucky because for two years, I got to share my life with a beautiful girl named Annie.“A Parable of Immortality” by Henry van Dyke.I am standing by the seashore.A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breezeand starts for the blue ocean.She is an object of beauty and strength,and I stand and watchuntil at last she hangs like a speck of white cloudjust where the sun and sky come down to mingle with each other.Then someone at my side says, ‘There she goes!Gone where? Gone from my sight – that is all.She is just as large in mast and hull and sparas she was when she left my sideand just as able to bear her load of living freightto the place of destination.Her diminished size is in me, not in her.And just at the moment when someone at my side says,‘There she goes! ‘ ,there are other eyes watching her coming,and other voices ready to take up the glad shout:‘Here she comes!’God speed my beautiful Miss Ann.  Our time with you went much too quickly.  But I know we will see you again when our time comes to cross the Rainbow Bridge."},

I have to confess, over the years I've not spent a lot of time with my nearly 30 year old nephew, and it had been about 7 years since I'd seen him.  His parents taught him to be respectful, hardworking and compassionate, kind and generous. I found him to be articulate, insightful with a great sense of humor. I know his parents are proud of him, and they should be, I am too. I was also proud of how well all the dogs did with my nephew being here. It's always a guess as to which dog is going to turn into a show-off, and how many of them will forget everything they've been taught to do when they meet new people.Having a dog of his own, my nephew took it all in stride and really enjoyed getting to know our crew and giving them some extra attention.  Sunny never left my nephew's side, and even Todd who can be aloof and guarded when meeting someone new, didn't mind the intrusion into his territory.Even though I'm worn out from the late nights, working every day, and I'm behind on everything, I didn't mind the \"intrusion\" into my week either."},

Imagine my surprise when last night Gus attacked the lovely Ms. Yellow while she napped on the arm of the sofa.  Thankfully I was there when it happened, and prevented her from being injured.  The lovely Ms. Yellow accepted my repeated apologies by sharpening her claws on my rug.  Of course I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed that Gus is channeling the spirit of Shadow and pouncing on the cat.

Lightning bugs (or fireflies).  Longtime readers of my blog know that in the summer, I enjoy being outside as nightfall begins and lightning bugs start blinking all over the yard, in the flower beds, in the grass and against the dark sky. Some will say that it's silly that at my age I find something so small and perhaps even trivial to be both captivating and hypnotic.  Perhaps it is...  But lightning bugs remind me of a childhood filled with magic, curiosity, and joy.  Lightning bugs meant staying up late and running barefoot through cool grass.  While I dread the growing numbers of mosquitoes nipping at my skin and humidity soaking my clothing, I will graciously thank Summer for the gift of lightning bugs -- Not just because they mark a new season, but also because they remind me of a simpler, more innocent time.  Every adult spirit needs a bit of that now and again, don't you think?"},

Right on cue the breeze died down and it got sticky.  But we've had perfect weather and I had a perfect chance to get caught up and get my equilibrium back from last weeks events. For the third year, my town had an all-American Mayfest.  It was a well planned and well attended event that reminds me of  why I love the small town that I live in. Every local business, club and even the person who makes best barbecue in the county were there.    Everyone of all ages were part of the fun!  But back at home, Gus has settled in very nicely!  I think the lowering of his medication (gabapentin) has made a difference.  You'll recall that he couldn't walk at all on Friday. But each day this past weekend we've seen improvement. Today he's up and around and trying to follow us from room to room. He looses his balance very easily, and that isn't going to change.  But it looks like that at least for now, he has some equilibrium too. I don't know how quickly degenerative myelopathy progresses, there is no treatment for it.  The vets have said that they think that Gus may have six months to a year.  We'll see.  Vets have been proven wrong more times than we can all count, and for Gus it will be taking each day as it comes.  Our dogs like Gus well enough.  On Saturday I watched Cricket several times steal little sniffs of him when she thought he may not be looking. She has also settled in really nicely, and she wins the award from us as being the 'cutest' dog we've ever fostered.  However like Annie, because of the kidney disease, she has her days that she feels better than others and doesn't want to eat.  And just as we do with Annie, I use cheap dog food, cat food, anything that I think will entice them to want to eat.  So far, she's falling for most of those tricks, and I'm glad about that. I hope you've had a good weekend too!  I'm sorry I've not visited your blogs, and hope you understand why I haven't.  I've really missed catching up with you and I am really looking forward to seeing what I've missed in your world!"},

Today Gus is unable to stand on his own, and after a long discussion with the vet and the rescue, we're going to try tweaking his medication in hopes it'll ease the symptoms of the ataxia.The plan is for Gus to stay with us for a couple of weeks until the foster-family returns from their vacation.

I hope when you arrive at the bridge all brand-new that you are met by all of our-gang who have gone before you; give them my message and as you join them, know that I look forward to the day when I will see you all again.\""},
{"title": "No Words, New Words and Butterflies?  ", "date": "Sunday, May 18, 2014", "text": "Its been a busy few days and I’m fighting blog-writer’s block, just like some of you have at some point, I suspect.  My mind is spinning in circles, trying to come up with the words and articulate the things I'd like to say.  It’s enormously frustrating, because every time I've started to write a post the last couple of days, what I've written doesn't seem good enough, and I just give up entirely.~Cissy~It's not that I don't have something to write about, because I certainly have a lot of material.  If I could find the words I could write a post about how in the early morning hours of Friday morning we were hit with torrential rains. I woke up when the power was coming back on, and it was raining in sheets. Carl left to go to work around 5 o'clock, and in the darkness didn't realize how flooded the road had become and found himself in water that was nearly to the car door.  He was able to drive out of it a little, but in front of him, the water was much deeper and the driver of a Mustang, (below) became even more stranded than he was. Both sat and waited for the water to recede, which it did around 9 o'clock. ~Cell phone photo of the flooding~Of course if I didn't have writers-block, I could write an update about Cricket.  I could say how I thought that her vet visit on Thursday went pretty well, and how she was given the \"royal treatment\" by everyone in the office.  I'd let you know that Cricket's test results were all returned and unfortunately showed that she has \"significant signs of kidney disease.\"  Our girl Annie has had the same thing for the past 2 years and while I'm disappointed that Cricket does also, what's needed for the both of them at home is something I feel pretty confident about providing. Finally there is Shadow.  I think this is where my problem with finding the words comes in. His vet visit on Friday gave no definitive diagnosis.  After a barrage of tests, from x-rays to blood-work, the conclusion was that he has stenosis in his spine.  We've begun giving him an anti-inflammatory medication.  After two days, we should have seen a difference, but we've not. Of course I'm discouraged. This morning the heavy panting and his reluctance to move has already begun and is affecting his appetite.  All we can do is hope he gets better, but his seeing a specialist is probably on the agenda.  So, yesterday in my muddied mind while Carl was tinkering with trying to get the tractor to start, I tried to focus on something else. You may recall how (unfortunately) the entire edge of our property was cleared when the utility wires and poles were put up for the new home in back of us.  I've decided to turn the open space into a butterfly way-station for the Monarch butterfly.  Our county is heavily investing in this, and I decided awhile back that I'd like to invest in it too. Yesterday I purchased the needed milkweed plants to set out.  I happened to see our neighbor and mentioned to them what I was planning. There was a noticeable grimace on their faces as the husband commented about what a nuisance milkweed can be.  But I'm not going to let that deter me.  Because who knows, maybe with the work that will go into this project, I'll find the new words I need for the blog-posts that are to come, just as I hope the Monarch butterflies do."},

Right now it's relatively quiet on the weather front, but wet times are ahead to close our week.~Cricket, waking up from a little nap~Cricket has settled in really nicely this week and is getting along well with the other dogs.  During the day, Cricket is alert and will come to us for attention, and will nap in the office with the other dogs. Yesterday when I arrived home from work she stood at the fence with the other dogs and barked.  All of this a contrast to her behavior by late evening  when she wanders around the house and seems not quite sure of where she's supposed to be.  At those times I've been putting her to bed in her crate and she'll sleep soundly until around 5.  Today we're off to the vet, and I'll ask about it; I do think it isn't uncommon for a gal of her respectable age of 16.   While Cricket has been settling in, I've been noticing a few changes with our boy Shadow.  He is panting heavily even when at rest. I've gone through the check list starting with his color that looks good, even after activity, appetite is good ... But he's not himself.  I thought it may be pain from his arthritis, so I gave him pain-medication, but there's been no change.  I've no idea what it could be.  But tomorrow when his vet returns to work, I'll take him in to see her.  I hope you'll send some good vibes for this most gentle boy that joined our household about 7 short months ago."},
{"title": "Cricket Arrives at Golden Pines", "date": "Sunday, May 11, 2014", "text": "Yesterday a trip over the Blue Ridge Mountains took me to the meeting place to pick up the lovely little Cricket. The photo I'd seen of Cricket was not the best, and I knew that she was a \"golden-mix\" but I didn't expect her to be quite so small, (about 25 pounds) and so cute!The niece of Cricket's former owner could not have been any more gracious, kind and caring.  I felt like I was meeting a friend.  She told me that Cricket had been the treasured companion of her aunt, whose name was \"Flossie.\"  When Flossie was in hospice care, the niece took Cricket to visit her, promising that she would make sure that Cricket had a good home after she was gone.  I hope she felt that she'd kept her promise by giving her to me.   At the tender age of 16, Cricket is a little timid with an endearing tilt to her head and ears that stand up. Her meeting our group went pretty well, except for Shadow who got a little closer to her than she liked.~Todd's not the littlest one anymore~  By mid-evening, I could see that Cricket was really tired, and it was easy to see she was confused about where she was and she wouldn't settle down. I decided that I would set up her crate and put her to bed. The niece had stopped by her Aunt's home and picked up a blanket for Cricket which I put it inside the crate; she burrowed into it and fell fast asleep. There was something so sweet and peaceful about watching Cricket sleep.  I couldn't help but think that it must've been so comforting to her to have something so familiar on a day when her world had been turned upside down.Welcome to Golden Pines, Cricket."},
{"title": "The First Days of May ", "date": "Saturday, May 10, 2014", "text": "Our first full week of May passed much too quickly. Helping that along was the soaring mercury that told us we had the highest temps of the calendar year so far.  From the inside, the lovely Ms. Yellow enjoyed the warmth of the evening sun as she closely watched the Eastern Phoebe that has built its nest above the front window.A quick peak inside the nest yesterday showed that there are 4 Phoebe eggs, and another egg which belongs to a cowbird. (A cowbird lays its eggs in nests of other birds.Unfortunately they hatch first, grow large very quickly which allows them to command the most food which usually results in the loss of the other hatchlings in the nest.) I couldn't decide if I should remove the egg or not, so I called our wildlife center and asked them. Cowbirds are native to the US and are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and it is unlawful to remove their eggs from a nest.  Finding that out didn't change my mind about the fate of the cowbird's egg. What would you do?    The dogs are much too busy to concern themselves with trivial things like the Phoebe and its eggs. With the warm days and evenings, we've been outside more. One evening when we were out, the dogs were exploring the yard and I heard Josh bark in a high pitched tone, and CarrieAnne joined in.  They had wandered a little too far down the driveway and from where I was standing, I could see that Carrie's ears were forward as she pointed to the ground with cheerful excitement. Before I even got to where they were, I knew what they were looking at, and I was right, because this is what was there. I will just confess, that I am very phobic about snakes. When I see them, I just scream and run, and that was what I did. I frantically called the dogs to come with me, which confused them a little because they couldn't figure out what was wrong. (Although you'd think by now they'd be used to my moments of near hysteria.) But once we were (safely) inside the house, I did the only thing I could do, I made CARL go take a look at it, and take pictures.  From what I briefly saw of the snake, I thought that the dogs may have somehow managed to kill or injure it.  Thankfully they hadn't, it was only 'playing dead' which is what the (non-poisonous) hog-nose snake does when they feel threatened. I am just glad it wasn't like the turtle last week, and didn't need to be rescued. ~The snake-finders, Josh and CarrieAnne~Speaking of 'being rescued' I was more than a little surprised this week when after 10 months, the rescue I volunteer for asked me if we had room for a new senior dog. Her name is Cricket, and she's 16 years old.  Her owner recently passed away, and she has nowhere to go.  I am picking her up this afternoon, and will introduce you to her in my next post.  Enjoy your Saturday!!~Shadow~"},
{"title": "The Roadside Rescue ", "date": "Saturday, May 3, 2014", "text": "Off to an early start this morning so I could spend the day at home.~Part of the gang this evening~ As I was rounding the last corner for home, I saw a turtle on the side of the road.  It was on its back in the full sun and was looking pretty toasted.  I thought it was probably dead, but since it's my habit to always stop for turtles, that was what I did. It was just a young snapping turtle about the size of my hand.  Its neck was stretched out and to the side and his little claws were all curled in and motionless. Of course I couldn't help but feel a little sad and sorry for the poor thing.~Our road yesterday afternoon~I'll admit that I'm a little wary of snapping turtles, so I nudged him with my foot to make sure he was dead, and he didn't move. Feeling confident that he couldn't hurt me, I decided that I should at least get him off the road, and when I picked him up, I noticed his little claw move, like a weak wave for help -- He was alive!!  I took him over to the nearby pond and with an empty soda-cup from my van, I splashed him with water, all the while telling him that I thought he was going to be alright. All four of his legs started to slowly move and eventually he moved his head, pulling it back inside his shell.  I closely checked his shell and it was completely intact, with no cracks or chips, he was just fine. I figured he must have wandered out of the pond and onto the road and had probably got knocked over on his back by a car and couldn't get flipped back over again. After several minutes, we said our good-byes by the edge of the pond, but not before I wished him good luck and warned him to stay off the road. I'm glad I was able to save the little turtles life, but I'm especially glad that he didn't bite the hand that fed saved him!"},

After dinner we went to a concert at the Warner Theater that was built in 1924 as a movie palace presenting live vaudeville and first run silent movies. We were there to see one my friend's favorite British comedians, Eddie Izzard. Have you heard of him?  I'll admit that I hadn't.  ~Before the concert that was sold out~I found his comedy routine unique, creative and entertaining all at once! I'll also admit that I don't know if I would go and see Eddie Izzard again, I might.

Earlier in the day I threw the green frisbee for a very energized Sheba who eagerly retrieved the green frisbee. At one point when she didn't return, I just figured she'd lost interest in playing.  But a few minutes later, Sheba came to me proudly showing off a red frisbee. In and of itself, this isn't that unusual because we have other kinds of frisbees that can be found throughout the yard, and she or Josh will often return with a different one that catches their eye.  However, the red frisbee has been missing since late last summer. Because both the green and the red frisbees are long time favorites, and are no longer being made, I searched and searched for that red frisbee with no luck whatsoever -- And Sheba has found it.  It's times like this, I just wish I could just ask her where it was, and where she left the green frisbee, because now its missing and I can't find it."},
{"title": "Pack Leader and Follower ", "date": "Saturday, April 26, 2014", "text": "~View from the front porch~A beautiful start to our Saturday with bright sun.  The morning wind has stayed around and is a little chilly, but it's a welcomed chance to sit outside with the dogs.Pack-dynamics and how the dogs interact with one another always fascinates me. One of the relationships that I find interesting is the one between CarrieAnne and Todd.  There's no question that Carrie is our pack leader.  Yes, typically the alpha dog is the largest and strongest, and most often male.  But (believe it or not) we don't have a strong male. So Carrie, who is one of the smallest in the group is filling that role and I have to say is managing this position quite well having earned the respect of the other dogs. I think that Todd's place in the pack is somewhere in the middle. From what I can tell, he's an equal to Sheba and Josh, below Charlie, and above Sunny and Shadow.But without a doubt, Todd respects Carrie and clearly adores her. They don't play with one another, and when CarrieAnne is outside watching the world go by, Todd is never that far from her. When something catches her attention, Todd follows, but never leads.  When I toss a treat to Carrie, Todd never tries to get it if she misses it.  I can't help but think of Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier who were animated cartoon characters in the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes series of cartoons. The little dog Spike was always following Chester around, calling him, \"boss\" and saying things to him like \"hey boss or right boss?\"  I have to wonder if Todd may be saying some of those same kinds of things to Carrie as he runs along beside her.  And CarrieAnne, just like Chester, doesn't mind at all, and I think she enjoys it. I hope you enjoy your weekend!  ~Cissy~"},

And so I added a little more and that's when I saw it ....... The box I had in my hand wasn't cornstarch, but powdered sugar -- In my early morning haze, I had grabbed the wrong box from the cabinet.

{"title": "In Full Bloom ", "date": "Sunday, April 13, 2014", "text": "It's days like today when I am reminded about why I'm lucky to live not too far from our nations capital, Washington DC.  A friend of mine mentioned yesterday that she was participating in an early morning \"Ranger Run\" through the cherry blossoms, and offered to take anyone who wanted to see them with her.  In the 20 years we've lived here, I've never gone, so I jumped at the chance.  While she ran, I leisurely walked and enjoyed the blossoms along the tidal basin.   ~The Washington Monument from the Tidal Basin~If you ever get the chance to come here this time of year, it's definitely worth it.  The whole area along the tidal basin suddenly turns pink and white as the cherry blossoms begin to bloom on approximately 3,750 trees that are descendants of a gift from the people of Japan in 1912.~The Thomas Jefferson Memorial~The walk by the river under the cherry blossoms is just magical, and on a sunny morning like today, it was the most beautiful place to be! I love history and trivia, so here are a few more photos and a few more things I learned about the history of the cherry trees that perhaps you didn't know either.In January 1910, around 2,000 cherry trees arrived in Washington, D.C. About two weeks later, the Department of Agriculture discovered that the trees were diseased and unfit for planting. The department concluded that the trees must be destroyed and so they were burned.  However 24 trees were spared and allowed to grow under observation in an unspecified location.  Today there are eighteen cherry trees growing near Hanes Point.  Where these trees came from is unknown, and  proof that these trees are from the 1910 shipment doesn't exist.  But evidence supports that they are, and it's felt that they are among the most historically significant trees in the entire United States.On Valentine’s Day in 1912, as a symbol of friendship, 3,020 more cherry trees were sent from Japan. Americans haven't always been as enamored by the cherry trees. Three days after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, trees were chopped down in what was suspected to be an act of retaliation. For the duration of World War II, the trees were referred to as “Oriental” not “Japanese” cherry trees.After World War II, cuttings from the cherry trees were sent back to Japan to restore the Tokyo collection that was decimated by American bombing attacks during the war.In 1991 a few young plants grafted from the trees were gifted back to Japan, and one of them graces the front of a tombstone in a crowded Yokohama cemetery. An adjacent monument reads: “A woman who loved Japanese cherry blossoms rests in peace here.” That woman is Eliza Scidmore, the woman whose idea it was to bring the trees to Washington more than a hundred years ago.  And finally, just to end on a lighter note and because you may have thought I'd actually have a post without a dog being in it, I will add these last two photos.     Enjoy your Sunday!"},

It was 6:30 when I listened to the message, so I felt a little bit of panic because we had specifically asked for a days notice so that one of us could arrange to stay home that day to keep the dogs from barking the entire time. Carl was already gone and my schedule at work on Wednesday could not have been more full of patients.  So, I did the only thing I could, and that was to leave the dogs.  I was leaving for work just as the roofers arrived and the dogs started barking at the windows. ~Sheba~Of course I worried about their barking the whole time while at work. Our dog-walker wouldn't be able to let the dogs out, so when I was able to have someone else take my patient before lunch, and I decided to race home to check on everything.  My mind was filled with all the scenarios of how the dogs may be reacting to the noise and having people around. What if a fight began because of all the tension and excitement...what if one or more of the dogs got injured in this fight, and what if their barking at the window caused one of the windows to break....wait, did I remember to close the window?  What about Todd in his crate, what if he got so excited in his crate that he injured himself...what if, what if, what if...  When I finally got home I decided to enter the house through the backdoor.  As I quietly opened the door, all the dogs were fast asleep on the kitchen floor.  Todd slept peacefully in his crate.  I think my coming home got them more over excited.  Now why did I worry?   But the shingles match the ones on our house, and we couldn't be happier with how the barn now looks. With Carl's injuries from its first replacement last year that brought with it regrets, taught lessons and gave us a lot of hindsight, we gratefully and finally close the proverbial barn-door on this chapter.   I hope you have a good weekend!  Early tomorrow morning I'm off with a friend to see the cherry-blossoms in Washington D.C.  I cannot wait!~Josh~"},

Noticeably absent for me has been my favorite, the Eastern Phoebe. Photos taken this same time in previous years shows that had returned at least 2-3 weeks earlier.  Knowing this, each morning for the past couple of weeks as the dogs and I have gone on a walk, I've listened for this bird that calls out its own name.  I've no idea why this cheeky-noisy-bird with its plain plumage gives me a sense of peace and why I feel so attached to it.  Whatever the reason, finally on Friday morning, I caught a glimpse of it as it sat on the fence post. Today its song joined the others in our mornings that are getting brighter and warmer. Another sign that spring has begun happened this afternoon. I will often take CarrieAnne and Sheba on walks to explore the neighboring field. The two girls get along really well, but unfortunately that hasn't always been the case. So I feel that these walks with just the two of them helps to strengthen their connection and bond. It shows that it's working because they happily took turns rolling in the same-something that was mucky, green and smelly. This has happened before and they both feel differently about the baths that have to come afterwards.  The sparkle in Carrie's eyes seem to say that it was totally worth it. However Sheba's eyes on the other hand, seem to be saying something else. As for me, I say with the return of the Phoebe and wet dogs, let springtime begin!

Standing there was a middle-aged man smiling hopefully and showing us a $100 dollar bill, asking to be let inside. My friend and I looked at one another and she reluctantly opened the door and let him in.  He apologized and said that he knew the shop was closed for the day, but he was desperate and he really, really needed to buy two pies and would give my friend $100 for both and she could keep the change and consider it a tip.  I was glad my friend asked why he needed them so badly, because if she hadn't, I would have.  But he explained that he'd had an argument with his wife, and he knew that he was wrong, and to help with his apology, he needed two pies.  Of course she sold them to him, kept the change and my friend bought our dinner.I don't know about you, but I can't help but wonder what this argument could have possibly been about that caused a man to pay $100 for two pies?  ....One that knew he was wrong I guess!"},

There is no question, Shadow has found his place in the pack and in our home and hearts. One of Shadow's best qualities is his patience -- He patiently waits for the door to magically open so he can see the cat. And when he knows it's dinner time, he patiently waits in his crate for me to bring him his meal. I have to remind myself that this most gentle of Golden's has practically just gotten here.  I cannot thank his first family, who are readers of this blog, enough for trusting us to give Shadow a home. Finally this milestone again reminded me of how I've missed welcoming new additions into our home.  So we decided to step out of our little circle, and we applied to and became a foster home for Lab rescue, for their senior dogs.  I've no idea where this will take us, maybe nowhere. But one thing I do know, that if asked, we will always, always have room for a senior Golden in our home, and now, maybe, there's room for a senior Lab too. Stay tuned!"},

Like spring.  I know, there's just barely grass and nothing is blooming, but it made me think about the smells of the seasons. I think that fall has a very distinct sharp almost bitter smell that comes as the leaves start to fall.  There is a smell in summer when it's hot outside. Then in winter there's that smell when snow falls and the air is cold and crisp.  And I really became aware of how different the city smells compared to the country when there was the distinct and almost overpowering and eye-watering smell of \"natural-fertilizer\" being spread on a field not far from us. This morning the wind blew from that direction and Sheba kept rolling in the grass.  I couldn't help but wonder if it had something to do with the field?Todd spent most of today outside.  Often he would stop what he was doing...and take in and savor each breeze coming his way.     Our weekend is ending with the weathermen getting the forecast right, snow is just starting to fall.  How much we will get still remains a mystery, much like how long that fresh smell from the field will last--Hopefully that and the snow will be short lived!"},

When we picked her up, we were told that there wasn't one single nibble from anyone interested in her.  Probably because she hissed at people, slept the rest of the time, and aside from there being about 20 cats to choose from, she's just not as sociable and cute as the kittens that were there. The volunteers also running the adoption event hardly even knew she was there, and I think that may have played a part in it as well. At any rate, she's here to stay with us for a while longer, and that's okay.

It seems to be working because the dog I have gotten to know seems happy and is very relaxed, smart, vocal, gentle and a very affectionate boy.   Yes, we remain very mindful of what is below the surface.  But the dog that sleeps next to my bed, loves his head scratched and that will now go outside after dark, and plays with Todd was a dog worth saving.  He was truly a dog that did not deserve the bad hand he was dealt.  I have no regrets. If there are any regrets it's that everything that happened with Sunny and the rescue may have ended 14 years of fostering for them.  We have not been asked to take a new senior dog since this happened in September. Perhaps there just haven't been any dogs that need us, I don't know. But I do know that I have to be rescuing something, it's part of who I am.  So, on Friday, we welcomed a new foster cat, a two year old little girl someone named Ms. Yellow.       Welcome to Golden Pines Ms. Yellow...."},

On Tuesday, Dale our little foster cat went to his forever home.  The home was a single Mom with a young teen-aged son who I thought seemed to need a good friend.  I think that Dale has the potential to be that friend. I wish them all many happy years together. And yes, Shadow is still convinced that Dale is in our spare bedroom. Someone asked a couple of weeks ago about Cissy and Sunny.  I thought today I'd take a moment and let you know how Cissy is doing.  I will post about Sunny in my next post this weekend.It has been nearly a year since Cissy came to us from a rural shelter in Virginia.   In my opinion, she is barely recognizable as the shell of a dog I met last March with nails so long she could barely walk. ~Cissy: March 23, 2013~It has been quite the journey for her because it has been one filled with health challenges.  I never mentioned here on my blog but will now say that there were many weeks when I felt enormous guilt because I felt like I was failing Cissy; especially late last summer when she lost most of her coat and was having ongoing problems with her skin and ears. But with the expertise, encouragement and care of Cissy's vet, Dr. C, she pulled us through the worst of it.  Now after nearly 11 months, it is easy to see that Cissy feels and looks better than she ever has.  The ear problems are resolved, her skin has healed and her coat is soft and growing back nicely and is becoming thick again, just in time for spring! ~Cissy: February 14, 2013~Cissy loved the snow we had last week, she loves going for walks and always has a 'roo-roo-roooo' for me anytime I say something to her. And no matter how hard he tries, and he really has, Cissy still won't 'talk' to Carl. But its been humbling for me to see and be part of Cissy's transformation both on the inside and the outside. I'm very grateful to the rescue, our Vet, Dr. C who never gave up on Cissy who showed everyone not long after she arrived at Golden Pines, that she had an inner-spark that only needed to be ignited. And finally, I am grateful and thankful to you, our readers who have been cheering her on from your corner of the world."},
{"title": "Cat Person or Dog Person?

Then as we were getting ready to leave, someone named Julie introduced herself as the person who began the rescue more than 10 years ago. We had a delightful conversation about Dale, cats, and continuing to foster for the rescue. It shouldn't have been much of a surprise when Julie told us she'd had Golden Retrievers for many years, and currently has two of them. Based solely on my own experience, I think that Julie's personality indicates to me that she's like me in that she loves both cats and dogs and has devoted her life to helping one over the other.  Which is why today I'm thinking that it's really all about the individual animal and the relationship you have with it and not whether you prefer a cat or a dog. What do you think?~Dale's official rescue photo~Post Script about placing Dale in another home.  After a lot of thought, we decided it would be best to put Dale up for adoption through the rescue.  It was a really hard choice to make because all of the the dogs, in particular Charlie, get along really well with him and he would be a good fit in our home -- but there's one dog that makes that difficult and that dog is Shadow.  Shadow has many, many good qualities, but like some dogs, he has a high prey drive that we are unable to redirect.  I know that we could keep Dale safe from Shadow (probably) ninety-nine-percent of the time.  But Dale has no fear whatsoever of the dogs and that one time when the two may accidentally meet could and probably would be tragic. And as sad as I am to think about Dale leaving, I would be even more sad if something happened to him.~Shadow~"},

I have been very careful and cautious introducing 'Dale' to the dogs because I didn't know how any of them would react to a cat that wasn't CC. Dale seems to have no fear whatsoever of the dogs so the intros have gone pretty well. And Charlie, for whatever reason has taken a real liking to Dale.

I think he could easily find a home because he's a young and pretty sociable cat.

I had no idea at that time, what an important part of our household she would become. CC would grow up to become an extremely tolerant, patient and dog savvy cat.  We \"used\" her to test the reaction of more than 50 foster dogs around cats.  In the nearly 13 years of her life with us, there's no way to count how many times CC's food was eaten, she was chased, pounced upon, played with, stared at....  stalked. and searched for...Being a cat, she of course stayed above it all, and there was hardly ever a hair out of place on her soft black and white coat.  I don't think that CC ever felt like she was a member of the canine-pack, however, she was totally accepted by all of the dogs. ~Sam and CC~Of all of the dogs that CC knew in her lifetime, there were only two that she had a connection with, one was named Ben who passed in 2003, the other was Lucas.  I don't know what it was about these two in particular and why she allowed them into her very small circle, sometimes licking their faces when she thought we weren't looking.  I think that when Lucas passed last spring, she missed him worshiping her at her feet.CC was the perfect cat for our big multi-dog household.  I've said for a long time that if there was a Sainthood for cats, CC should be one. I've no doubt that there will not be another cat like her. CC's passing is the end of our cat ownership for now. I feel that with Shadow, it would be best to wait to add another.  I do not remember a time in my life where I've not had a cat, so CC will missed even more, not just by us, but Todd and the other dogs too.  God speed CC.  I have no doubt that there was a huge canine welcome at the Rainbow Bridge, and that Lucas and Ben were especially happy to see you.  We will look forward to seeing you there again one day too."},

A food bowl that usually gets licked clean by one of the dogs, became a little snack instead because she wasn't eating.  Added to that were a few very uncharacteristic \"accidents\" and CC sleeping in out of the way places.  It all led us to the vet on Saturday and a not so encouraging diagnosis, kidney failure.  We were sent home with an IV to keep her hydrated and the most tempting food we could find to hopefully get her to eat.  So far, it's not working, but we're not giving up, and I hope that this most special and unique cat isn't either."},

I finally receive my bag and when I get on the road I look inside the bag and OF COURSE, there's no biscuit, but a breakfast wrap and a hash-brown.  I decide to go back, even though I have to drive 2 blocks, sit at a light and make a u-turn to do it. I finally get back to the McDonalds, park, go inside and ask for my correct order. The lady at the counter looks totally puzzled, disappears to the back and returns with a bag and many apologies. Of course it's not really a problem -- I'm not upset at all, I'm just someone who just wants the right order.  By now I'm really running late, and I have to get going.  I get back on the road, and look in the bag, and what do you think I got?  A Sausage McMuffin with egg, and a hash-brown.  I know, why didn’t I check the bag before I left?   Fortunately Cissy's vet visit went pretty well, even though she does have a really ugly ear infection and is now on antibiotics.Afterwards we were running late (again) and it was Shadow's turn to help me do the home-visit. The family are two-time adopters from the rescue, and have a nine-month old baby and hope to adopt a young dog from the rescue.  **(NOT Shadow)**   Even though we've only had Shadow since late September, there's no doubt that he is a very, very gentle dog; but I have to admit that I was more than a little bit nervous with him around the baby, especially when they kept putting the baby right in his face. However,  I think I would have felt that way if they'd done that with any of our dogs. With the vet and home visit and other errands checked off our list, it's now lunchtime and I'm really hungry. Cissy and Shadow could use some water, and we're about 20 minutes from home.  McDonalds is right up ahead, and yes, I'm really tempted, but it's still pouring rain, I'm tired, and I think it's best to just drive past.  I just don't have the energy."},

She has really slowed down, and as is natural for a gal of her respectable age, she sleeps most of the time. And the results from her last vet appointment a couple of weeks ago showed the progression of  renal failure that we've known about since she came to us almost two years ago.  But over lunch a couple of weeks ago, my friend and mentor for the senior dogs suggested that I feed Annie raw green tripe.  With her appetite not the best, I decided to try it and she really loved it! For nearly two weeks she ate all of her meals. But I guess the newness has worn off because her appetite has started to wane again, and she didn't eat this morning.

I hope I'm ready for the challenges that this year will bring.  But ready or not, 2014 is here.~Todd on New Year's Day~Our year is beginning with record breaking cold, bringing with it snow that started falling just as I was leaving work on Thursday.  My one hour commute turned into nearly 3 hours where at one stretch along the highway I counted 9 cars that had slid off the road.  Exhausted, I went to bed early only to be jolted awake about 3 o'clock in the morning by what could only have been the sudden silence.  The high winds that had been blowing all night had knocked our power out.  Navigating around the dogs in total darkness I found my phone to report the outage to the utility company.  The dogs were of course now totally awake, and wanted to go outside to bark at the wind and maybe have a treat or two.  After everyone was back inside, all we could do put another dog *blanket* on the bed to stay warm and hope the power would come back on soon--And yes, mentally go through that list of things that we DON'T have for a power outage, and wonder why I hadn't made sure we had those extra batteries?Thankfully we didn't have to wait too long for the power to be restored.  Despite the still dicey roads and blowing snow, I did make it to work by 10:30.  Now we're waiting for it to warm up. ~Cissy on the 'forbidden chair' keeping warm~According to the weather forecasts, we may be waiting a couple of days for that. ~Shadow, who always finds a way to get his nose dirty  ~The dogs are the only ones who seem to be okay with that.  Enjoy your Saturday!"},

Over lunch that day, the conversation turned to favorite holiday traditions, memories and food.  I shared one about Christmas stollen.  (For those of you who may not know, a stollen is a traditional German Christmas yeast bread with nuts and dried fruits. The dough is wrapped around a log of marzipan before baking and the finished loaf is generously dusted with confectioner sugar.)~Shadow and Sheba~For many, many years, my Mother used to send me a Christmas stollen.  I have to admit, that I didn't always like them, but my Mom enjoyed them so much, and so eventually, I did too. Getting a stollen in my Christmas box from home each year and enjoying a slice with a cup of tea became something I looked forward too. Even when my Mom was unable to shop for herself, she still made sure that I received one (or two) at the holidays.  After my Mom passed away, I found myself that first Christmas missing having a stollen and so I bought one, and have gotten one each year to carry on that tradition.  But this year, as I told everyone over lunch, the Scrooge inside me was balking at the price of $20 for a small loaf, and so I had decided to forgo the tradition; I still had the memory after all and actually having a Christmas stollen wasn't really that important. However I have to admit, that after lunch that day, each time I saw them at the grocery store, I hesitated when I walked past, because deep inside, I really did want one.  But I was determined to stand strong in my boycott of such a high price for a small Christmas stollen -- I simply was not going to spend that much on one.     ~Charlie~Fast forward to early Christmas morning.  The day began with the dogs and I taking a walk as the sun started to rise. When we returned to the house, the sun was just above the horizon, and its brilliant rays were shining brightly and warming the air.  That was when I noticed something hanging on our gate, in a plain brown bag.  Inside there was no card, just a Christmas stollen.  There are no words to express my humble gratitude for a perfect gift on Christmas morning.  I could only make a toast with my cup of hot tea to my Mom, and to whoever left the stollen, allowing my tradition to continue.~A slice of Christmas stollen~"},

However he wasn't really happy about this though....Our end of the day was dinner out at our favorite restaurant with our two of our most favorite friends.

Carl on the other hand, grew up in Wisconsin and he got a few of those snow-days off from school.  Today for some reason he was reminded of how exciting it was for him to have those snow days and what great fun it was to “sled” and build snowmen.  Of course I did those same things.  However not all of us had sleds, so we made do with a friends, or pieces of cardboard and various items that we borrowed from summer like a zip sled (meant to be used in the water) and inner tubes.The other thing that I always enjoy about snow-days is the food.  As a kid, when we would finally come in for lunch, it was always Campbell’s (canned) soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.  Today after the dogs and I had been outside for awhile it was a creamy tomato soup and crisp grilled cheese.

There is still an overwhelming sadness as we continue to mourn the loss of Wendy on Monday.  Dog owners understand those sad moments that are dealt with after the loss of a family companion.  For us it has been an empty dog bed, the extra dog dish, the pill container full of what would have been Wendy's medication for the coming week that I'd just filled...coming home from work for the first time and her not being there--That moment made easier yesterday by a thoughtful, cheery-gift from a treasured friend. (Thank-you again Eileen for your thoughtfulness and friendship that is a true blessing in my life.)    Wendy's final resting place is here at Golden Pines.  She will be the only one whose remains will not be kept in the beautiful boxes returned to us by our vets office. Instead, it is a place that can be seen from the house, and near one of the cornerstones of our property, symbolic of what she was, our cornerstone...On Monday as we said our last good-byes to her, when we turned to go back into the house I looked up, and above us was a heart-balloon floating by.  We stood and watched it in silence until it disappeared high above the clouds. Now there are those who will say that it was a mere coincidence that at a moment of great sadness, a heart balloon would pass by.

Not only were there gloomy clouds and cold temperatures outside, but it was the same in our hearts. Today, was one that we dreaded, we said good-bye to our precious, precious Wendy.I remember so well the day we met her more than 14 years ago.  In many ways it seems like such a long time ago, but in other ways, like it just happened.  When we met her she was known as \"Amber\" and was a wild, young, crazy girl who was almost 2 years old.  I changed her name to \"Wendy\" after my favorite character in Peter Pan.  I didn't know at the time, but she would become much like her namesake.  When we started fostering for the rescue in 2000, many of the dogs that came to us at that time were from the animal shelters and were young males who had been strays.  Because of that, I began calling them 'the lost boys.'  We would have many 'lost boys' come into our lives, and she was a good mentor and companion to all of them--Just like the 'real' Wendy.   ~Wendy in July 1999~As the years passed Wendy was there for so many changes in our lives.  She knew our very first cat named Lucy.  She knew Tod, our very first Golden, and was there the night we woke up to find that he had passed away.  I remember looking at her as she sat on the bed watching us, her eyes said that she had understood what had happened.  On that same sad note, Wendy was there the day I came home to my Mom's house after she'd passed away.  How could I ever thank her for the comfort she provided then and so many times through so many losses?~August 2011~Yes, through the additions and subtractions in our lives Wendy was there, always the one constant in our lives.  She always seemed the same, never changing, always with the spark in her eyes, and that canine free spirit and independence that in later years would tell me that the rules of the house didn't apply to her--She was right, they didn't. Wendy was our equal.  She was truly my canine sister.  Her life was so intertwined within the fabric of our lives that I barely have a memory of the last 14 years that doesn't somehow include her.  Because of Wendy more than 50 Golden Retrievers found forever families.  Because of Wendy we adopted 15 dogs from the rescue and have given that many senior Goldens a place to call home for the time they have left.  Because of Wendy there is a Golden Pines.~January 2013~Because of Wendy, my heart is broken and shattered--But there are no regrets, just a giant hole in our home and an emptiness that will never again be filled.  I will miss Wendy like no other, and she will forever be in my heart and soul until we meet again.God speed, Wendy-Lady, my girly-girl.  Our candle is lit for you tonight as you journey to the Rainbow Bridge where there will be an amazing reunion and welcome from the many who have gone before you.  Please give them all my message and don't ever forget what you meant to Carl and I. You will be greatly missed but never, ever forgotten, and we look forward to the day when we will see you again, in a place like Never Never Land..."},

When we eliminated 12 hours of driving, a world of possibilities opened up. We received invitations from friends to enjoy Thanksgiving with their families, or we could simply stay home.  Having that choice totally changed the holiday for us and became one I looked forward too.  This year is no different.  We had 5 thoughtful friends invite us to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner at their homes, but we said no to all of them--This was only because its been a very busy and stressful few weeks, with the dogs, work, and everything else life has handed us and we are tired and worn out.  More than once the last couple of days, I found that being able to say those lovely words: \"we're staying home for Thanksgiving,\" sounded as good as the dinner itself...Well, almost as good!   ~Shadow~"},

Today the appointment was for Josh.  Late Thursday evening he was standing with his head down low, and turned toward his back-leg, and he wouldn't/couldn't stand straight--And when he walked, he walked in very slow circles, like a twirl.  He wouldn't move his head, so I knew it was his neck and of course I was worried that he may have slipped a disc. To make it all the more worrisome, he wouldn't lay down, and just stood there, looking at me.  I gave Josh a pain-pill, and we went to bed hoping he'd finally lay down and get some rest.  I woke up a couple of hours later to Josh's whining, and his still standing in about the same place. Of course I became even more concerned, but eventually he did find a place to lay down.  By morning there was a slight improvement. Once at work, I did a search on the internet which took me to a site that told about someone's dog who'd sprained their neck--I had no idea that was possible, did you?  A lot of my worry about Josh left when he was wagging his tail and was definitely better by Friday afternoon.  But just to be sure it was a sprained neck, I made an appointment for him to see the vet who confirmed what I thought. He's now on a muscle relaxer and rimadyl.  He's still holding his head to his left a little, but he's moving it more, standing straighter and is no longer 'twirling' when he walks.  Josh will be fine (I hope) in a few more days.  But until he is, no tugging the frisbee with Sheba.

I took her to the vet and she walked in and greeted everyone.  I was even more baffled.  We went through everything of the previous hours, did some tests, and while there are a few changes, such as she's become anemic, the vet felt as do I that it was nothing that warranted making that final decision for her.  So I brought Annie home.  I have to admit to feeling like I'm 'crying wolf' because of what happened with Wendy on Wednesday.  But I know what has been happening with Annie over the past week and what I heard in the early morning hours.  And I also know that for now and for today, that the rainbow bridge will have to wait for Miss Annie to arrive.."},

Annie's appetite has been on the decline for more than a week, and she didn't eat at all on Thursday or Friday morning.  I tried to remedy that by tempting  her with the smelliest of foods, but she wanted none of it. Annie also hasn't wanted to go for walks, and has been sleeping for hours in the same place.  Trips outside have been very brief.  The middle of the night I've been awakened by her incessant drinking, and constant barking at what appears to be nothing.   When she's not doing either of those, I've been awake just to check on her (and Wendy). Then there's Wendy.  A tumor that she has had for more than a year, started to grow a few weeks ago, and has now become ulcerated and infected.  From past experience with large tumors, by Wednesday I was so sure that the only option for Wendy would be to do surgery to remove the tumor--But at Wendy's tender age of 16, there is no way whatsoever that I would put her through that.  And so I reluctantly made a vet appointment and convinced myself that the only thing that could be done would be to say good-bye to her.  Once at the vets office, Wendy was visibly shaking as we waited to be seen, which was unusual for her--Did Wendy know what I had already decided?  Whether she knew or not, the vet didn't see it my way at all.  She feels that we should try two strong antibiotics to try and knock down the infection, keep it clean and see if that makes a difference.  I understand that this may not work, but I totally agree that it's worth a try.~Wendy~So with that new found optimism, and a twinge of guilt for the hopelessness I'd been feeling, as I was getting Wendy back into my van to go home, her hopeful and soul filled eyes looked into mine and she barked, a single bark at me--A reminder no doubt for me to stop giving up so easily.  That same reminder is what I'm hanging onto for Annie too.  She ate her meal this evening; so as I silently celebrate, I'm trying to be positive that our two very special girls, Annie and Wendy will be okay."},

That was because it depended on what was leftover in the refrigerator--Green beans or corn and just about everything else from a previous nights dinner, would all be added and served in white porcelain bowls with wide rims along with cornbread on the side.

Had Shadow seen the cat, attacked her, and Lydia couldn't call because she was putting CC back together again?  Why hadn't she let me know how it had gone?  I decided to do the only thing I could, I texted her.  I got the below response....Remember that Sunny growled at her yesterday.  So, score one point for Lydia...I received two more texts from Lydia telling me that things had gone much better today with Todd being on a leash and she'd gotten him back inside with no problem.  Score another point for Lydia. I just knew there was nothing to worry about.  ~Sheba~"},
{"title": "Todd verses Lydia ", "date": "Monday, November 4, 2013", "text": "It was not the best first day for Lydia, as our new dog-walker.  Just as I was leaving for lunch, I got a phone call from her telling me that Sunny had gone into one of the crates and was growling at her.  I told her to just leave him alone and try to avoid eye contact with him, and that he would be fine.  Sunny met Lydia like they were old friends on Friday and was really relaxed around her. However, history is showing that he gets nervous and unsure about someone he doesn't know that well, (or at all) when either Carl or I aren't around. We both agreed it will just take him some time. Then my phone rang again about 30 minutes later.  It was Lydia. She couldn't get Todd to come inside.  He'd been barking at her since she arrived, and despite the best of bribes (all of which he ate) and hardest of efforts he would not come into the house.  Lydia is an experienced dog-walker with about 8+ years of experience, but does not have much experience with Scottie's. I know she is trying really hard to be friends with the dogs, and with the exception of Sunny and Todd, today that pretty much worked.  But Todd doesn't yet see Lydia as a friend, and I think he may also see her as a bit of a pushover. It goes right along with something that I read once that said, \"when you own a Scottie, you live with a dog that thinks he's smarter than you.\"  And today, Todd showed Lydia that he was. And in the end, we decided that nothing she could do would get Todd back inside, and he would be okay left outside for the afternoon. So, with the nip Todd gave Lydia on Friday, and the events of today, the score is now:  Todd: 2 -- Lydia: 0 .  I don't know about you, but I'm rooting for the current underdog in all of this right now, and that's Lydia. And I'm hoping that tomorrow with Todd on a leash, she'll at least get on the score board.  We'll see."},

Cissy is doing just okay.  Being a girl, and an independent one at that, she has decided that she no longer wants me care for her tender ear.  She started to run away from me when she saw me coming towards her with a wash-cloth -- Who knew a gal of her unknown and respectable age could be so quick and agile?   She would also whine when I would try to put the compresses on it, or even just to move it gently for a look.  But it's easy to tell that there is some swelling. Given that, I don't think we're going to be able to avoid surgery.~Cissy styling in her cone of shame and coat~Our week ended with the firing of our dog-walker of 6 years, and the arrival of the new one to meet the pack.  Actually, 'Lydia' is not new to some of the dogs.  She used to work for 'CC' and came to our home for about 3 years, and left almost that long ago to work for another service. I really liked her, and was disappointed when she left.  But Lydia now has her own business and was more than happy to take us on as clients.  When the Goldens meet someone new, it's like they are meeting a friend, so I don't know if Sheba, Josh and Carrie remembered Lydia or not. Charlie is always a little shy when meeting someone new, however Lydia and I both thought he seemed to remember her because he was so happy when she came in, and tried several times to get into her lap.~The welcoming committee~Todd was one of the dogs she'd never met.  And like many Scottie's he is aloof by nature and he is also a bit territorial.  Despite the warm welcome from the Goldens, all Todd could do at first was bark and bark at Lydia.  And when she sat down on the steps he nipped at her, nearly tearing her shirt in the process.  By the end of the visit, when Todd was done showing off, he was still a bit reserved, but was taking treats from her hand. I have a feeling that two are going to be great friends, and Lydia is determined that they will be."},
{"title": "True Cissy Fashion ", "date": "Sunday, October 27, 2013", "text": "Off to a early and frosty start Saturday  morning for the first vet appointment of the day which was for Shadow at 8 AM.  Shadow is a healthy dog and came to us fully vetted.  But different vets offices have different protocols and looking over his records, there were a couple of things that I wanted Shadow checked for that he hadn't been. One was for lyme disease.  The deer-ticks that carry it are really a problem in our part of Virginia, and all of our dogs, with the exception of Todd have tested positive and have been treated for it at one time or another.  Shadow is now part of the gang because he tested positive for lyme disease. He's now on an antibiotic and will be just fine.  I am also a big believer that you can never have too much identification on a dog, and so I also had him micro-chipped; so now if (and hopefully never) I lose 'my Shadow' this is another way he'll be able to find his way home.The vet practice that I go to has two offices, so after Shadow's visit, we were off to see Cissy's vet at the other office.  Her appointment was only supposed to be for blood work and to talk about her skin problems.  Unfortunately it took a turn when I noticed her ear was looking a little 'wonky' and it was because of an aural hemotoma.  (For those of you who don't know, an aural hematoma is when blood collects under the skin of the ear flap).  Hopefully the drain that was put into her ear and the warm compresses that will need to be done twice daily will work and allow it to heal, and help us to avoid her having to have surgery. But Cissy shows her age at times like this and was really tired by the time we got home.  In the early evening, I found her shivering on the sofa, which was an odd place for her. A pain pill, and a warmed blanket from the dryer made a difference and Cissy slept for the rest of the evening.  This morning she whined when I began the compresses on her still very tender ear.  I found myself apologizing to her and I paused for a moment to explain to her why they have to be done.  When our eyes met, she stopped whining as if she fully understood.  In true Cissy fashion, I think she does."},

According to the report, the home owners there became aware that prescription medicine was taken from their home while they were out of town and \"CC\" was providing pet sitting services for them.  I won't go into any detail, but I have to admit that this year there have been a few instances where 'things' didn't quite add up. But I overlooked them because \"CC\" was very reliable and dependable and I thought maybe I was wrong.  This was easy to do because I trusted her and like(d) her very much.  Now that everything has come out, and what I didn't want to think about our dog-walker has been confirmed, I find all of this extremely disappointing.  So I reluctantly begin the search for a new dog-walker.  However, I will have to first let \"CC\" go, which is something I've never done before and I'm really not looking forward to doing--But who would?"},

With Annie feeling better, it was my turn to be a little under the weather. I am guessing that I must have picked up a bug on Saturday at the laundromat that probably hasn't been thoroughly cleaned since the 1980's.  But I stayed home from work today and keeping an eye on me was Todd, who, when I woke up from a nap, was staring at me. The house was totally quiet and there was something so peaceful and tranquil about that moment. Todd must've felt it too, because he didn't move a single muscle. And after I took his picture, he and I both went back to sleep.  I'm feeling much, much better, and will be back at work on Tuesday.  I hope your week is off to a good start."},

I've decided that laundromats have changed very little over the years, and this one is no exception and seems a little stuck in a time warp. But it was pretty much deserted, and I decided that I must be the only one with nothing else to do on a Saturday morning. The day has come to an end with our keeping a close eye on Annie. She's not been feeling well the last couple of days, and today she has begun episodes of trembling or shivering. You may recall that Annie has lost about 75% of her kidney function, so this may be an indication that her kidney disease is in its final stages-- But of course that's only a guess, and I may very well be totally wrong about what's causing her to shiver.  Annie didn't come into the kitchen for her dinner, but she did eat her meal, and seems content and comfortable, so I'm trying really hard to not be too worried right now.  Would you believe that in January she'll be 15 years old?  I told her she has to stay well so we can celebrate.

It was only supposed to be for a couple of months, but it has lasted nearly 8 months now.  I spoke to the doctor I work for about how I was feeling and we decided that in November I'm going to go back to my four day work week.   I think that it's going to be a welcome change.  I'm already looking forward to having a little more time at home, and a little more time with the dogs and getting a few more things done.

One of the dogs that has been here from the very beginning, as you know is Wendy.  After more than 14 years together, she knows me well.  Many times when I've been consumed with a loss, she comes into the room and starts barking at me. This time was no different.  I'm not sure when I noticed that there is something different in her eyes when she does that.  But I know what she's telling me; she is reminding me that she and the others are still here, and that everything is and will be okay.  Wendy has always been an independent dog, but during these times she stays close and follows me around.  At nearly 16 years old, it's much harder for her to do these days, but she did. This morning, for the first time since we lost Taylor, she's not by my side, and is sleeping in, I know she's tired and needs her rest.   ~Wendy after a tiring 4 days for her~  Despite the gloomy and rainy weather, and even though I'm totally exhausted both physically and emotionally from everything last week, the mood in the house is different.  Todd has already seen fit to dig a muddy hole, Sheba is carrying around one of my brand new shoes, Cissy is barking for reasons only she knows, and the dogs are waiting for me to take them on our morning walk. It's time to let that old wound opened by the loss of Taylor to try and begin to heal as best it can.I will end my 600th post with saying that no words can begin to express my heartfelt thanks for your kindness and your thoughtful, sympathetic comments on the loss of Taylor. You've shared in our loss and have helped to ease the pain I feel in my heart, and that along with your friendships means more than you know.Enjoy your Sunday! ~CarrieAnne and Sheba~"},

Dr. D believes it is likely hemangiosarcoma.  Because of her age (about 13) doing an ultrasound to learn a little more about the tumor, will not change what we would do for Taylor.  I've been sent home with some medications to attempt to settle her stomach.  Hopefully I can get her to eat and keep food in her stomach.  This evening she's been really quiet and has hardly moved since I got her home.  I'm hoping by tomorrow Taylor will feel better and get past this rough patch and that she'll maintain a good quality of life for a while longer.I've not written much about Taylor, because there hasn't been a lot to tell you.  She's a quiet unassuming girl that came to us this past summer when her owner passed away.  She has been content to quietly stay in the background and let the other dogs be the stars. But now she's front and center and in the spotlight, and I hope you'll send some good thoughts for this sweet girl."},

So many people, programs, etc., have been affected because of a last ditch effort by ultra-conservative congressional members to corral whatever leverage available. When did holding America hostage become a political tactic?  I just don't get it. Okay, enough of my rant...When I wasn't obsessed and totally consumed with the news broadcasts, listening to all the political commentators, and becoming more upset about it all, it was actually a good week.Shadow has settled into his new life and routine. He's an easy going boy that gets along really well with the other dogs and follows the crowd which makes him a great fit.  We are working on curbing his prey drive when it comes to the cat.  I remain hopeful and confident that this gentle, easy going boy that I can do practically anything to, will learn just as so many have before him, that CC is part of the pack, and not part of a meal.Until that time comes, to keep CC safe, I've set up a little crate for her to stay in. So far, she's been quite content to spend time curled up on the warm blanket inside, or to spend time outside which she really enjoys too.

We had a great time catching up, staying up too late, laughing, shopping and eating all the wrong things. ~One of the 'wrong things' I indulged in this weekend~Of course, I told \"Sid\" all about Sunny and asked her to (please!!) be mindful of him and not grab his collar.  After dinner one evening as we were clearing the table Sunny put his front feet on a chair to see if there was something for him on the table.  In that one moment she did just what the trainer said someone not thinking would do, she tugged Sunny's collar and asked him to get down. And without a flinch, he did what he was asked. She and I both feel that there's hope for him.  ~Sunny this morning, he still doesn't like the camera~Our friend left early this morning in fog and temperatures in the 40's.

{"title": "Sunny: A Bittersweet End and New Beginning ", "date": "Friday, September 27, 2013", "text": "Some of you were able to read between the lines in my post this past Saturday about Sunny.  Yes, he was supposed to be euthanized on Monday.  Because Sunny belonged to the rescue, it was their decision to make.  We all know that we unfortunately live in a litigious society.  Knowing that you have a dog like Sunny who has \"a history\" and is one that you have been told by a trainer may bite again, and cannot be safely placed in another home, is a liability to a rescue.  Having served on the board of the rescue for 4 years, I respected and fully understood why the decision was made and as Sunny's foster home, I was willing to follow through on their decision, or so I thought I was.I found that it ripped me (and Carl) apart inside. We are only supposed to be the foster home that takes in the senior dogs and gives them a good home for whatever time they have left.  We are not the ones who are supposed to have to support a decision to euthanize a dog that sleeps by the bed at night. Who is so happy to see us when we get home, gets along well with the other dogs (and the cat) and has been living with us for nearly 3 months.  I don't know how many of you have ever had to euthanize a pet for reasons other than illness or old age, if you have, you know what we were going through.  It’s hard enough to euthanize a pet when they are ill and you know that you are easing their pain.  But it is much harder to do it when it involves a dog like Sunny who has many good qualities, and you aren't totally, 100% convinced that it's the right thing. The decision to euthanize Sunny followed me around like a huge dark cloud, it was totally consuming.  And so when Monday morning came, I did the only thing I felt I could do and that was to call and cancel the appointment.  I contacted the rescue and told them what I'd done.  Of course they were not happy with me and we were given 24 hours....  (I will add that I think in doing this, I pretty much got us 'fired' from our 14 year fostering career with the rescue.)   I will skip to the end of the story and tell you that the board of the rescue voted to turn Sunny over to Carl and I.  We signed papers releasing the rescue from any and all future liability and responsibility for Sunny and he has become a permanent member of the gang at Golden Pines. It was a bittersweet moment when I unceremoniously removed his rescue tags from his collar.  Carl and I know that there may be a time when we will be making the decision to let Sunny go because of his behavior. But it will be \"our\" decision alone to make and not a board of directors. And so Thursday officially began Sunny's new life and another chance.  I feel strongly that he deserves that.  I also feel strongly that things are how they are meant to be and I am finding great peace in that.

Lynn is the person we got Todd from, so of course he accompanied me on this trip.  Despite the cold pouring rain for most of the day, it stopped just before dinner making it a perfect evening to enjoy really great food, live Blue Grass music and the chance to make new friends and see a few members of Todd's family.  Unfortunately because the darkness the pictures I took of Todd's little family reunion didn't turn out so well, but Todd (bottom left of photo below) is still the biggest in his family. It was really a great time, and Todd really loved the bed in the hotel. But it was NOT just Todd and I in the hotel room and Lynn's birthday party wasn't our only reason for our visit to her neck of the woods.  Those of you who are \"friends\" with me on Facebook know that I've been really missing having a senior-male-Golden Retriever as part of our household.  I've even been combing listings of dogs on the websites of other rescues in hopes of finding that senior boy that has been so elusive. But fate seems to have played a card because Lynn works with someone who had a 12 year old male Golden Retriever that they were hoping to rehome. To respect the family's privacy I won't go into the details about them and only say that because of the very long hours that 'Shadow' was being left alone, it was felt that it was unfair for him to spend so much time by himself.  We all know that lives change and I respect this family for making what I know is a tough choice, and trusting us to give 'Shadow' a good home.We met Shadow on Saturday and he has become the newest addition to our home.  He has enjoyed a good life and has been very well cared for and loved.  He's easy going and very affectionate. But for whatever reason he and Todd got off on the wrong foot--However they made up in the hotel and are just fine.  The intros to the rest of the pack went really well, even Sunny was fine with him.  Unfortunately in my discussions with the previous owner, I never asked if he got along with cats and we had a little incident with our cat late last night.  CC is just fine, and I think that once he learns that she is to left alone, (a lesson many dogs have had to learn) I think Shadow is going to be just what I already think he is, a wonderful addition to the gang at Golden Pines.       Post Script:  Sunny remains with us for now.  I will do an update on him very soon."},

Your heart feels a betrayal of trust by a canine that you are very fond of and you feel a rip deep in your soul. The behavior issues that Sunny has are not ones that can be solved. Yes, exercises and training could be done to help lengthen his short fuse.  But he refuses to wear a harness (believe me, we've tried) and so in the moments of every day life when his collar is accidentally grabbed to keep him from taking something, or you simply ask him to stop what he's intent on doing, it will be difficult if not impossible to avoid being bitten by him--And experience is starting to prove that will happen.  Because of this, it's the feeling of the trainer and mine as well, that Sunny cannot and should not be placed up for adoption to the general public.Based on the evaluation given by the trainer, the decisions about Sunny's future are being discussed by the board of directors of the rescue.  I've spoken at length to my contact on the board and my recommendations are also part of the discussion.  The decisions about his future will not be easy to make. But for tonight and this moment, the future seems so far away.  Right now he is sleeping at my feet.  His body, legs and eyes are twitching and there are short woofs and whines as he dreams. And I find myself so fervently hoping that in that place that I cannot see, that his fears and the scars that have become a part of him in this life are gone and that he is free."},

He's back just in time for the weekend, to clean our house, put the laundry away for me (both things he does very well!) but he will be off again next week.The weekend is going to be a busy one as well.  This morning a dog-trainer is coming to work with Sunny and I.  You may recall that Sunny doesn't like anyone to grab his collar.  Our dog walker and I have both had instances where he has growled and snapped at us when we've needed him to do something that he didn't want too. The trainer, Nancy, told me that because of Sunny's age (around 9-10) that this behavior will probably always be part of who he is. She feels, as do I, that Sunny was probably grabbed by his collar and mistreated.  It's times like this when you wish they could tell you.  But it may help to explain why he becomes reactive at those times when you touch him around his neck or collar. But the goal and hope is that we can perhaps desensitize him to being touched around his collar, and make it positive for him. Maybe we'll even solve his camera shyness along the way too. Through the break-neck pace of the past week, the dogs always provide those little moments that make me stop and pause.  Cissy provided one.  When she finishes a meal, she always puts her paw in her empty dish.  There's something so sweet about that...And Todd provided another, doing something that he does quite often, which is sitting alone in the yard.  There's always a feeling of peace.

", "date": "Sunday, September 8, 2013", "text": "I recently read an article that suggested that the type of dog breed that you own can tell a lot about your personality.The article said that owners of Labs and Golden Retrievers are friendly, good-natured, easy going, carefree, and put their families first.  And that the people who own these breeds are known to be very social, honest and very likable. ~Sheba~The article went on to say that people who own terriers are flexible and able to focus on the task at hand. Terrier owners resemble the breed in that they are feisty, brave, and often competitive. Owners can even be described as extremely talkative and with a good sense of humor. Other than my being \"talkative and having a good sense of humor\" I don't really think I fit the description of the typical terrier owner. But one thing I do know for certain as the owner of a Scottish Terrier, is that I really like the way they look after they've been groomed.  You may remember earlier in the summer Todd and I 'cheated' on our regular groomer.  He was taken to another shop and he ended up with a more 'Westie' appearance.  I personally didn't think the look worked for him, but Todd didn't seem to notice and he was happy afterwards, and so I was too.~Todd and the girls in July after his Westie-Haircut~But yesterday Todd went to his regular groomer for his fall-haircut. I have to say that I do love the iconic silhouette of a Scottish Terrier...The pointed ears, the elongated nose and body, and that bushy beard and eyebrows. Which takes me to that sense of humor.  It's one of my favorite things!  Maybe I really am more Terrier than Golden Retriever...If you'd like to read the full article about what your choice of dog-breed may say about you, click hereE-Town KY: 130 visits..."},

But just as we hoped, their moving here hasn't affected us much at all.  However today when I was out with the dogs where the driveway passes by our property, a work truck that was driving way too fast flew up their driveway, and before I knew what was happening, CarrieAnne was running after it.  With my heart in my throat I ran after her, but of course couldn't catch her in time.  As I rounded the corner of the driveway all I could see was Carrie continuing her pursuit of the truck.  When it stopped thankfully she ran back to me and was unharmed.~CarrieAnne after her chase~Needless to say, it reinforced what I've thought since the hedge was cleared by the power company, that we need to consider putting up a fence and hope that the hedge that we've let grow all summer, grows a little faster. Carrie was lucky this time, but we all know that next time, she or one of the other dogs, might not be.~Annie standing on our side of the new driveway~"},
{"title": "Muddy Paws", "date": "Monday, September 2, 2013", "text": "Our temperatures may be saying summer, but the calendar and the lack of light in the morning say that fall is on the way. This morning as dawn was approaching, the dogs ran through the wet grass following the smells from overnight.  Behind the dogs were 2 bats in acrobatic flight eating the bugs they stirred up.  I've seen a few more bats this year, and hope that their numbers are again on the rise.  Afterwards all the dogs were happy to go back inside because they knew what was coming next, breakfast!But outside, Sheba decided that she didn't want to come back in.  She wanted the adventure to continue and used her best rag-doll impression to let me know that as I tried to get her to her feet.  I even tried to pull her lifeless body down the driveway, but then I gave up and just left her laying there.And I did the only thing I could do, take pictures of her dirty feet.I used to try to keep the dogs from tracking their muddy paws into the house. I would get a bucket of warm water and clean their feet before allowing them back inside.  The look of joy they had after their walk would be quickly replaced with a look of \"how can you do this to us?\"  It didn't take long to realize that having dogs in the country usually means having dirty paw prints inside on a fairly regular basis. Paw prints in the mud and muddy paw prints in the house are all part of the joy of dog ownership, and I wouldn’t change a thing about it. Yes, there’s a hassle factor because you've got to clean them up, but the incredible happiness on the dogs' faces after they've dug a hole or had an adventure that took them through the mud and dirt is worth it. At least that's what I keep telling myself."},

I went one step farther and took Friday off work to go to a barn-sale and to meet Connie at Hartwood Roses and make a new friend, Deborah from \"Confessions of a Craigslist Junkie\".  Connie generously gifted us with 4 dogs beds, which the dogs love.  (Thank-you again Connie, for thinking of us!) ~The Princess and the Pea, or CarrieAnne~I enjoyed the barn-sale.  But I have to admit that it was a little pricey for me, so I didn't buy anything.~This broken old clock with no insides was nearly $100~But I really enjoyed looking at everything, visiting with Connie and Deborah and getting some ideas. The guineas on the lawn gave me a few ideas too...I came home afterwards, and all the dogs and I went for a walk.  Cissy continues to do well and has a steady and pretty consistent appetite.  Her coat has become really thick, long, fluffy and soft, making her look bigger than she really is.   I think it gives her a bit of a bear appearance, don't you?  Afterwards Todd had a good idea to take a late afternoon nap, and that was just what we did.  It was a pretty good day!!

It's a little drawn out story, so suffice it to say that Sonny who is really shedding, and suffering from extremely dry skin among other things was not to be outdone by Taylor's hot spot from a couple of weeks ago--He began chewing on his back leg while we weren't watching him and he ended up a pretty impressive hot-spot on his back leg.  So, we put on one e-collar.  But being a tall and lanky and very determined boy, he was able to find a way around the e-collar and made it worse, and he even added a second hot spot to other leg. We trumped his hot-spots with a second e-collar that added the perfect amount of rigidity to the first one, and it has made him unable to reach his back legs--And believe me, he's tried!!  Sonny did of course need a trip to the vet and he was given some medications and so he's on the mend and feeling a lot better!  And that makes me feel better too!"},

Sporadic cleaning throughout the week is my new tactic--This way cleaning doesn't end up taking over a whole day and I get to do more of what I'd like.

{"title": "Annie -- Clearing the Hurdle ", "date": "Wednesday, August 21, 2013", "text": "Thank-you everyone for the good thoughts for our girl Annie.  They have truly made a difference because today is the first day that she's had an appetite, and is drinking what I consider, a normal amount of water.  The periods of shivering have also (thankfully) stopped, and even though Annie's foot is still pretty swollen and continues to drain, she's starting to put a little weight onto it. While that is all of course good news, there was a bit of bad news on Annie's blood work that was returned. Some of you may recall that Annie has damage to her liver and kidney's from medication that she was given prior to her coming to live with us.  Her liver values have remained pretty stable over the past 9 months, but there continue to be slight changes in her kidney's.  I discussed what all this meant for Annie and the bottom line is that she only has about 25% kidney function.  Serious health problems occur when the kidney function drops below 25 percent. As I said, not the best of news for Annie, but I'm hoping we can maintain those numbers with the medication she's being given.  However right now, I'm just really thankful and relieved that we are almost over this hurdle with her foot."},

Annie's back foot is swollen and she's refusing to put weight onto it.  Because we live about 50 minutes away from our vet, and I only work 20 minutes from their office, I took Annie with me to work today so I could take her in when they had an appointment.  We're now doing a foot soak for Annie, giving her pain medication and an antibiotic to help get rid of the infection.  Added to this is my concern about her lack of appetite since Sunday morning and her not wanting to drink much water or munch on ice which she enjoys as much as her meals.  Also worrying me is that Annie is having waves where she can't seem to stop shivering.  I'm keeping her covered up and just really hoping that it's all related to the infection and pain she may be having in her foot, and that she'll feel better sooner rather than later.  Paws crossed."},

Wendy will have to return to the vet early next week for another test, but I think and hope that she'll be just fine. Taylor on the other hand has yet another hot spot.  This one much more impressive than the last.  Her entire neck has been shaved and she's been put on an antibiotic and given a topical medication.  Even to look at it, it looks pretty painful. We arrived back home by early afternoon, and just in time to catch a glimpse of the turkey-mom and her poults crossing our driveway.Taylor and Wendy were both pretty worn out, so the rest of the dogs and I all took a walk and enjoyed a really nice afternoon at home.  I hope you've enjoyed your day too!~Cissy~"},

Someone who is especially happy this week is Todd. Even though he is more than 2 years old (can you believe that??) he still sleeps in a crate at night by the bed and stays in one in the office during the day while we're away.  It's more out of habit than anything and the crates are 'golden size' so he has plenty of room. Todd will often just go into the crate when we're home and late at night, he'll just put himself to bed in the crate in the bedroom--When I come in, I just close the door. The other night, Todd decided he wanted to sleep on our bed.  He didn't even wake up and looked so comfortable that I didn't have the heart to move him. And he was actually really good and stayed on the bed all night. The next night, it was exactly the same thing.  He again was really good, and never moved off the bed.

The couple have no children (except for a 9 year old Golden) and live behind 2 security gates on a 116 acre estate with 5 fenced in acres just for their dogs.  The house, about 8000 square feet, had a kitchen that made my heart skip a beat--State of the art appliances with custom glass front cabinets all came together so beautifully and perfectly. The rest of the home was comfortable and decorated with layers of natural color with earthy shades of green. Going up a sweeping stair case were gorgeous landscapes in muted tones.  I can admit now that I was a little nervous at first because you never know who will be living behind the gates in such a grand home.  However the couple were very, very nice (as was their Golden) and I felt more like I was visiting with friends. I hope that a rescued Golden finds their way to them!~Annie~Once home I did things around the house.  With everything that I have put on Charlie's leg this week, I decided to give him a bath to wash it all off.  As you can see in the photo below, he was really happy about getting a bath. This summer Todd has been spending a lot of his time outside. He seems so content and will stay out for as long as I'll allow him too. At the end of the weekend we are all feeling pretty relaxed and rested and the dogs all seem to be doing well, and Josh is hardly limping.

Josh, who really needs to be groomed, is really favoring his front right leg after he jumped off the bed. He has rods in his leg that was broken when he was a puppy and I was told a couple of years ago that there may come a time when they need to be removed.  I'm hoping that time hasn't come.   Cissy's appetite has stayed consistent.  But her activity level is down a bit this week. CarrieAnne got stung by something this week too.  I don't know what it was, but it really packed a punch. And I seemed to have lost misplaced one of my diamond earrings...Aside from all of this, there have been a few lighter moments this past week...Here's one that came from a photo I took that Todd was part of. Carl has started physical therapy and he goes to his appointment straight from work. However, he forgot to take his tennis shoes with him and afterwards came home wearing his street shoe with a white sock and his now trademark boot--Todd face in the photo mirrored my reaction to his white legs and \"foot-attire!\" I'm hoping that by the end of the weekend there will be a few more lighter moments to add.  I just hope that Saturday is sunny because I could really do with some sunshine.  Or a good strong wind to blow away the blues. Here’s hoping..."},

{"title": "A Not So Sunny Moment", "date": "Saturday, August 3, 2013", "text": "Sunny, despite being a counter-surfer extraordinaire is a pretty easy dog to have around. Our dogs like him well enough and he gets along with everyone.  And I know I can say this about every new-comer we've had, but there really is something unique about Sunny--And it isn't that he doesn't like his picture taken--It's that I think he's very, very smart.  He always does as he's asked and listens really well too.  I've seen him do things like open a gate that in all the time we've lived here, no other dog has been able to figure out. Unfortunately, on the flip-side Sunny doesn't like to be handled.  I knew before he came to us that there were problems at the vets office with this.  Sunny had to be muzzled when they cleaned out his ears, and he nipped one of the technicians when she grabbed his collar to get him out of the crate.  Knowing about this, Carl and I have been very careful with Sunny and for the most part we have had no problems. The routine has been that when we have another addition I write a note letting our dog-walker Christy, know any quirks the new dog may have.  When Sunny arrived, that was what I did.  However, Christy and her children had not been feeling well, so a substitute dog-walker has been coming to our house since Sunny arrived.  On Wednesday Christy returned to work, and unfortunately she had not seen the note I'd written about Sunny and that she shouldn't grab his collar. So, when she got ready to leave our house, and put Todd back into his crate (with a stuffed Kong) Sunny went into the crate with him--And Christy did what anyone may have done in an instant, she grabbed his collar to get him out--Sunny whipped his head around and bit her. Very, very thankfully the bite was not a serious one and didn't scratch or break the skin but it did leave a bruise.  Christy was (thankfully) not upset at all about it, but of course the rescue takes these things very, very seriously.  I'll spare you the rest of the details and just admit to still being a little bit unnerved by Sunny and I'm really, really worried about safely placing him into a new home when the time comes--This is the part of fostering that is the most difficult; finding and trusting someone to adopt a dog like Sunny that has a few wrinkles that aren't easy to iron out."},

However with Cissy we are faced with her being a very picky eater. Getting her to eat can be a roller coaster ride. Some days she loves what you feed her, other days, not so much. She will turn her nose up at kibble, hamburger, chicken, turkey, liver and white or brown rice.But Cissy does like fish.  So last week after she'd eaten very little for a couple of days, more out of desperation than anything, I cooked pasta added half of a can of salmon and a cup of regular kibble, topped with parmesan cheese, which she happily ate. This became the meal of choice for the entire week; she ate practically everything each time she was fed.~Cissy's meals last week~I was feeling really good about what Cissy was eating until I discussed it with the vet who has been caring for her.  She urged me to remember to try and make her meals more \"nutritionally-balanced.\" There's no question that I totally agree with her.  But I have to admit that there is a part of me that just wants to stick with the meal that's a 'sure thing.'  Those of you who have had dogs that won't eat, know that feeling when you give them a bowl of food that you have specially prepared, and as you set it down you say a silent prayer that they'll eat...Then when they refuse it, your heart sinks.  I worry about that happening if I change Cissy's meals.  But then, Cissy has surprised me before and this may not be any different.  We'll see."},

By Wednesday evening we were all somewhat better, but I was totally exhausted from three nights of getting up more than once in the early morning hours to let someone outside and of course having to work as well.However we end the week with everyone finally feeling better. Our newest arrival, Sunny, has settled in nicely. As we get to know him, I'm finding him to be a nice dog that is affectionate and wants to please.  On the flip-side he's a pretty good counter-surfer who has a real taste for cat food, and who doesn't like us to grab him by the collar.  The counter-surfing is pretty minor and isn't really a concern.  But grabbing Sunny by the collar could be, so we are making sure he listens to us when he's asked to do something, in particular when he needs to move.~Sunny~Another thing Sunny doesn't like at all is having his picture taken. Even just seeing the camera causes him to want to run away and hide, which is what he's doing in the photo below.  I have to wonder what happened in his former home that has made him so camera shy?  And as a final note, I'll end with a little update on Comet, (the dog who over-nighted with us last week and had lived confined to a 6x9 pen for all of her nearly 13 years).  My good friend who is now fostering Comet and spoiling her rotten, told me that she's a bit of a picky eater, but she is really enjoying going for daily walks to explore the neighborhood, her very big yard, and soft bed in one of the coolest spots in the house.  ~Comet~Everyone feeling pretty good and the news about Comet is a good note to end the week.  I hope your week is ending on the same kind of note too!  I look forward to catching up on your news! ~Sheba and CarrieAnne (front)~"},
{"title": "Sunflowers and The Bucket List", "date": "Sunday, July 21, 2013", "text": "Do any of you have a \"bucket list?\" For those of you unfamiliar with what that is, it's a term made popular by the 2007 movie with the same name. Basically it's a list of things you'd like to do before you \"kick the bucket,\" as the saying goes. One of the things I have on my list is to see the sunflower fields in France. This all came about because of a sequence of blogs that I have been following that each year posts pictures of the amazing sunflowers under the warm sunny skies of southern France. This year the photos are posted on the blog, Bob and Sophie's French Adventure.This past week I mentioned wanting to see them and a friend of mine told me about sunflower fields planted by the State of Maryland near Poolesville, which is not that far from us. I looked it up and read that the sunflowers were in peak bloom.  And not wanting to miss the chance to see them, this morning Annie and I did a little road trip.   It's a nice drive that includes a trip across the Potomac River on a ferry.  At one time there used to be 100 ferries operating on the Potomac, and Whites Ferry just outside Leesburg, is now the very last one. It was just after 8 o'clock in the morning and I wasn't the only one with the idea to arrive early to photograph the sunflowers.  Many of the photographers had fancy set-ups and reflectors and other equipment that I have no idea how to use--I believe in keeping it simple. So, while Annie wandered around taking in the smells, I took photos.  After several minutes I started to wonder, just how do you get really unique shots of sunflowers?  I really have no idea...But I do know that I went a little crazy taking photos. Okay, maybe more than a little...And I was okay with that and I think Annie was too.     In the end, I decided that even though the sunflowers were not in the beautiful countryside in the south of France, they were amazing nonetheless. But I'm still keeping seeing them in France on my bucket list. Care to share something that YOU have on your bucket list?"},
{"title": "The Overnight Guest: Welcome Comet!", "date": "Saturday, July 20, 2013", "text": "Well, we've had Sunshine come to Golden Pines this week, why not a Comet too??  That's exactly what has happened.  This week I received an e-mail from Annie's former vet about an elderly lady who no longer wanted or was able to care for her nearly 13 year old Golden, named Comet. I sent the e-mail onto the rescue I volunteer with, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. Comet has lived her entire life in an outdoor 6x9 pen and has never lived indoors (while another family dog lived inside, in comfort).  But with our record temperatures and sweltering heat, all I could think of was how miserable Comet must be. I told the rescue that even though she couldn't stay with us, I would keep her until a foster home could be found.  Arrangements were made, and Comet arrived yesterday afternoon. She is very, very overweight, very dirty and very smelly, and was very happy, until ...     ...the initial meeting with our dogs...It did not go well.  As you know, our dogs are old pros at meeting new dogs, and this was nothing different than they'd done earlier in the week, and many, many times before.  But there was a lot of growling from Comet, and I of course worried about a fight starting. In all fairness to Comet her world that she has known for nearly 13 years had been totally turned upside down.  I knew that she was stressed, hot and confused.  I blocked off the kitchen, and got her inside to cool off and settle down.  Throughout the evening the dogs looked at her through the gate and I let Comet meet some of them individually and the cat too. (I'll just add right here that CC is always a good sport about my dropping her at a safe distance in front of an unknown dog to see what will happen--It's not the first time she's been used as bait, and I know it won't be the last). At 3:30 this morning Josh had to go out, and Wendy decided she needed to as well, I just opened the gate and hoped everything would be okay.  A quick sniff was all that was needed, everyone was fine.  Now that we've gotten over that hurdle I can admit that I find myself very taken by this sweet old gal who can't stop smiling and wagging her tail.  I wish she could stay so I could show her the world she has been missing her entire life.  But she can't.  Someone else will be doing that, and it will be a good friend of mine who also fosters the senior Goldens. Comet is going to be just fine."},

I think he might be around ten.  Sunny, who knows the answer is proving to be good at keeping a secret and isn't telling. Someone who is not so good at keeping a secret is Cissy.  Your good thoughts have made a difference and she's feeling much better and is telling me and anyone else who will listen to her all about it.  Her energy level and appetite have almost returned to what it was previously.

One of the things my siblings along with our friends loved to do was to play in the water.  And one of the favorite pastimes was to run through the sprinkler on the lawn. We didn't have  “Slip ‘n Slides” or anything like that, we only had the plain ole average lawn sprinkler, and if we didn't have one or if ours didn't work well enough, we would go and use someone else's.Playing in the sprinkler was so spontaneous.  We didn't worry about sunscreen or anything else for that matter.  The only thing we needed was some friends to come and join in the fun. In my  mind I can still remember rolling out the hose, twisting the squeaky faucet and watching the sprinkler come to life.  Sure the water was cold, but more importantly it was exhilarating.There were different tactics we would use: Standing in one place and getting wet, Or just running through it.... Then of course there was “stay-away.”  It didn’t really matter what you did.  As long as your were staying cool and having fun.But after awhile the grass would start sticking to our feet...And we would get tired of being cold and the fun would come to an end. But not before we took one last drink out of the hose and ran through it one more time....Good times..."},
{"title": "Getting Past the Problems", "date": "Saturday, July 13, 2013", "text": "I've had really frustrating and exasperating problems with blogger this week which has kept me from posting on my blog.  More than once I had a post ready to publish, only to be given a \"BX error message\" that wouldn't let me save, post, or preview any posts. I spent precious evening hours in what seemed like a black hole otherwise known as the 'help forum' where I painstakingly combed through posts from other bloggers, hoping to find the answer to the problem.  What I did find were some who were also having the same issues I was.  In the end it somehow got the attention of Blogger, and it now seems to have been resolved because I'm now able to post. Have any of you had any problems posting or saving your blog posts?  Knock on wood, because I'm hoping those problems are behind me as I am looking forward to the weekend.  Last evening Taylor returned to the vet for a check of her ears to see if the infections have cleared. They haven't, so another infusion of antibiotics was done. We have found her to be a quiet, sweet and endearing girl that is anxious to please and be friends. She has a great appetite and is also feeling like being up and around more than she was previously.  She fits in nicely with our dogs, and even Todd has tried to get her to play with him a few times.  All good signs. The signs are not so good for Cissy.  Unlike the Goldens she is not a gal that 'lives to eat' but rather 'eats to live.' and her appetite has been waning for more than a week.  Cissy will have a couple of days that she acts like she's not feeling well and and won't eat.  Then she seems to feel better and her appetite returns, not fully, but it does return.  We are back on the track of her not eating.  My vet and I discussed it and she recommends that she be seen for a good once over if things don't change.  I know that Doctor J is right. Last night on the way home, I couldn't help but become discouraged by it all.  But this morning I'm reminded that I should stay positive.  I was sure the problems with my blog could be resolved, and it appears that they have been. Cissy has been through so much and has come so far, I have to think that she can get past this too."},

Leaving the dogs on the porch, the nest was easy enough to find because it wasn't covered.  Not wanting to get too close, I very, very quickly snapped a photo and left.  Suffice it to say, I will worry about these little ones until I know they are safely gone from the nest. And the dogs may be spending a little more time on the front porch. Enjoy your Sunday!!"},
{"title": "Todd the Westie", "date": "Saturday, July 6, 2013", "text": "I want to preface this post by saying that I'm not by nature someone who complains about customer service.  I usually don't send food back, and I don't enjoy embarrassing or battling someone over a service, unless I feel really strongly that it's warranted, and then I try very hard to 'stay calm.'  That said, in the two years that I've had Todd, he's only gone to one groomer and I've always been pleased. Which was why when \"Irina\" (who also grooms Charlie and the other dogs) had to cancel Todd's appointment because she had to go out of town, I was fine with that.But then I decided Todd couldn't wait a couple of more weeks. So, even though we are in a serious seven year committed relationship with our groomer Irina, I made an appointment for Todd some where else. Yes, I was feeling a little bit guilty.  But I couldn't resist the temptation, especially when they told me it would only take them an hour, as opposed to leaving Todd there the entire day and it would be less expensive. They are also right next to my vets office, and where I buy dog food, and I can I just mention that the shop is also owned by the same person who ran the daycare Todd attended?  How could what seemed so right be wrong?Well, I think it kind of did end up being wrong.  I am mostly happy with how Todd looks, but I really think he has a wee bit of a West Highland Terrier appearance now--I know, I know, I'm being too particular and I shouldn't be, but I'm obsessive compulsive about these things.  Todd's neck and parts of his face should have been shaved, and his beard, eyebrows and mustache should have been shaped into that square characteristic look of a Scottie, and it's not....I guess I just really like him to look like a Scottie, at least part of the time.  But obviously the groomer is like others that gets the two breeds mixed up.Todd should have looked more like this:See what I mean??  I noticed it right away, but not wanting to cause a stir I didn't complain when I picked Todd up.  But later I did write a 3-star review online which quickly got the attention of the owner, who has offered to 'touch up' the mistakes I feel were made. I responded back that I appreciated it, but that it wasn't necessary because Todd doesn't seem to notice that he doesn't look much like a Scottish Terrier.  Plus none of the dogs are making fun of him, and he was happy afterwards. I guess that's what really matters."},

I’ve got it.I know, it's crazy because I have plenty of things I can write a post about; the dogs, my flowers, even the weather...  But when I sit down to write a post, the blank screen mocks me, practically daring me to come up with something.  And I can't......So I don't.....So while I'm waiting for clouds to clear, here's just a snippet of what we've been up to while I've not been fully with you. I made a delicious Raspberry-buttermilk cake for a co-workers birthday.  (Recipe Here)And we just passed a humbling milestone. Last week marked 14 years ago that we adopted our very first dog from the Golden Retriever Rescue.  That dog as you may know is Wendy.  At about 16 years old, I worry about her, especially when she has days that aren't the best.  But for now those days are outnumbered by the good ones and for that I am extremely grateful for what I consider 'extra time' with her. My work week has ended and last evening we went to a friends house to watch our town's fireworks.  It was a block party and I'd forgotten how enjoyable it can be to get together with neighbors.  Our July 4th holiday will be spent here at home. With a few things planned for the rest of the weekend and a co-workers wedding on Saturday, I'm hoping that those proverbial clouds will clear and my blog-writers block will pass. On a walk with the dogs this morning, and now that I'm almost done with this post, I think they just may be.  ~Cissy~I hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable 4th!  ~Cissy Rolling in the Deep...grass~"},

She has really settled in nicely and continues to get along well with our dogs.  However we've had a few storms this week, and we discovered that she's very nervous during them. Experience has taught me that once dogs are her age, it's hard for them to get over their fear of storms, and so we do our best to find something that comforts them.  So far, we've not found what that \"something\" is for Taylor, but we will.   ~Taylor~Last nights storm brought a little cooler start to the day and the dogs were quick to find a cat that had wandered onto our property.  They chased and treed it, but (thankfully) didn't injure it.  I could tell it was a young cat, and after I'd gotten the dogs back inside, I put a bowl of food next to the tree, figuring that it was probably hungry.  When I left for work, the cat and the food were both gone. Other than the cat and the heat, it has been a quiet and uneventful week.  And I think we're all okay for that.~Cissy~All of us except for Todd, of course.

She and the other dogs, really enjoy them and will eat them right off the bushes.  I actually like to have the dogs with me when I pick berries.  When I picked them as a kid, I wasn’t really worried about snakes and I never wore protective clothing.  But age has made me more than a little paranoid about snakes, so now when I pick berries, I wear socks, long pants, long sleeves and let the dogs go ahead of me  to scare off anything that may be under the brush.Todd, who I've no doubt would be great at scaring anything in the bushes away, watched from the front porch.   As you know berry picking can be a lot of work, even for the dogs and Sheba became pretty hot and tired.  I was glad when she took a break and watched me from the shade. But I did pick enough to make a very simple cobbler. (Click here for the recipe)After dinner, we all sat on the porch together and enjoyed it. Even without the ice cream to go with it, it was pretty good and a nice way to end the weekend!"},

Dr. S was also pretty adamant that Annie not be allowed in the treatment areas of the office. \"Well, okay, Dr. S.\"  ...  At the end of Annie's day in the office everyone felt that our being a part of \"Take Your Dog to Work Week\"  had been a success!  Annie enjoyed her day, and she was a great ambassador for the rescue. Dr. S agreed to let me bring Annie again next year.  Providing of course, that we (again) follow the rules."},

Taylor has a difficult time getting around, and I think the problem is her knees and hips. She has a very difficult time managing the two simple steps into the yard, and getting back inside always requires some help.  We are encouraging her to use the ramp that I set up for her, and I'm hopeful that the time will soon come when we won't have to remind her that it's there.

Her first day with us has been spent sleeping in our bedroom. But she has had quite the week.

I wasn't all that surprised, because I saw it as I was cutting down the weeds, and I just hoped that changing my clothes, washing afterwards with soapy water, etc., that I'd be okay.~Annie~The last couple of years I've gotten to be pretty good at identifying poison ivy.  Even when it's at a distance and mixed in with other plants, I've gotten a little fanatical about avoiding the dreaded \"leaves of three\" because as some of you will recall, I’m so allergic to it that I can get poison ivy almost from looking at it too closely. ~Cissy~But I've got a rash on my hands and face. One eye is so puffy my eyelid is drooping and I bear a slight resemblance to Quasimodo. I really, really, hate poison ivy!  Yes there are some people like Carl who are not allergic to poison ivy at all and instead have seasonal allergies to pollen. He'll go through periods where he's all stuffed up and red-eyed.  None of that affects me at all, and I just go about my life.  Carl says that allergies are worse.  I have to disagree with him because right now I'm really feeling pretty darn itchy and his allergies aren't bothering him at all and from the looks of the photo below, nothing is bothering Sheba either!"},

Our first dog came to us in 1996, a handsome Golden Retriever named Tod. And in June of 1999, we added our second dog named Wendy, who as you know, is our treasure, and is still with us. She was our first 'rescued' dog, and after her came the dogs we fostered for the rescue and placed in new homes.  I don't know exactly how many we have found new forever families for, but I know it's around 50. Carl and I have \"officially adopted\" 15 Goldens from the Golden Retriever Rescue, and that does not include the 11 Goldens that became \"long term fosters\" or Sam, Charlie and of course Todd who found their way to us.

When I said I would keep the chicks I had no idea everything that I would need to care for them.  Thankfully a vet-tech at the office where I take the dogs loaned me everything I needed and she even gave me chick-crumbles for them to eat.  The doctor I work for allowed me to keep them at the office, and the girls at work and I enjoyed being Mother-Hens to our chicks, and yes they were given names.      But because the office is cleaned by someone who sometimes brings his children, I brought them home for a night to keep them safe.  The dogs all loved them, and Charlie couldn't take his eyes off of them as they stayed under the warming light on top of our dryer. But all good things have to come to an end and this afternoon they were given to their owner \"Flea\" for her display at BlogPaws.  So if you are attending the conference and pass by the booth for Jones Natural Chews, stop and admire the 5 chicks there, I've no doubt that you'll be as taken by them as my co-workers and I were.  The whole experience has convinced me that I need to get chicks of our very own.

I've no doubt whatsoever that Cissy feels right at home with us.  She has even claimed one of the dog beds as her very own.  And as you can see from the picture above, she is still (of course) letting us know her opinion about everything. But interesting, at least to me, is that she doesn't feel the need to really share these thoughts with Carl, who has tried to get her to 'speak' to him.  I told him it's because she doesn't think that as a man he understands her, she may be right, I don't know.  But as you can see in the video below, she thinks I understand her perfectly, and I think she's right."},
{"title": "Why I've Hated Mother's Day", "date": "Sunday, May 12, 2013", "text": "~My Mom~Sunday is Mother's Day here in the US, and I hope you don't mind that just for today, I'm deviating from my normal posts and writing about something that's a little more personal to me. For the past 5 years, I have hated Mother's Day. My mother passed away in 2007 and every year since then when spring rolled around and the greeting cards reared their heads, I felt the resentment start to bubble up. “Tell mom how much she really means,” the signs at Hallmark told me. It felt like a mean joke and just another reminder of all I’ve lost.As an adult, my mother and I were very close. For many years we talked on the phone several times a day, relating the little details of our lives. I knew what she’d had for lunch, what she was watching on TV, and how she was feeling.  She knew those same things about me, right down to which book I was reading and what was upsetting me at work. We had catchphrases and inside jokes we’d repeat and laugh about and we shared very similar opinions on politics and life in general. The first Mother's Day after she died when I passed by the greeting cards in a store, I thought about buying her one. Maybe, I thought, I could start a tradition of getting her a card every year--a kind of “taking back” of the day. But then I thought about how I’d never actually get to send the cards and how they’d just sit in a drawer somewhere.  Then I thought about how the inside jokes will never change--My mother and I are frozen in time, like the one and only picture I have of us taken together a few years before she died.  So with that, I decided not to get her any cards and just disregard the day. This year all of that seems to have changed.  Instead what I have is the feeling I had when I would come home late as a teenager and my mother would be in bed, awake and waiting for me to get home.  She couldn’t sleep soundly until she knew my siblings and I were safely home. At the time, we teased her for it, but even then, it was very assuring and comforting.  And in thinking about it, those daily phone calls all the years after I'd left home made me feel the same way.  It's truly what my mother gave me, above everything else, the feeling that she was always there, looking out for me and cheering me on.  I'd like to think that wherever she is now, she's still doing that.  I also think that to know and remember and not doubt that on a day like today, is the best way for me to celebrate Mother's Day. Happy Mother's Day to my friends near and far!!"},

Our trip could not have been better, for us and the dogs!!  While we relaxed, the dogs barked at the horses...Since it was vacation, I ate what I wanted and the dogs did what they wanted...They barked at the horses....We had a really nice time catching up with our friends who own the cabin.  The dogs had a really nice time barking at the horses....Since Carl was limited in what he's able to do, we drove around and enjoyed the sites and scenery.And the dogs (really!!) enjoyed barking at the horses....BUT…Waking up in my own bed this morning and not having to go to work today was quite nice. Carl did have to work, and so I lounged around before I tackled mowing the lawn. I read awhile back that scientist claim that the sweet smell of freshly cut grass can relieve stress and make you feel good.  I'll admit that after spending the entire afternoon mowing, I'm not feeling any stress, but I am pretty tired.  Now I'm thinking how much I would enjoy 4 more days off and THAT makes me feel better!!***I don't usually (in fact never) advertise on my blog, but this time I am because I know how hard it can be to find a great place to stay with your dogs.  So if you or someone you know is planning a trip to east Tennessee and would like a really nice cabin to stay in that is very dog-friendly and is surrounded by beauty, peace and quiet and much more, consider staying at Autumn Dancer Llama Farm"},

{"title": "A Peaceful Wednesday ", "date": "Wednesday, May 1, 2013", "text": "Just as the work week got started it has come to an end for both Carl and I. On a cold dreary night in February as Carl was recovering from his first surgery and I was feeling the need to get away, a friend and I arranged for us to \"escape\" to their cabin in Tennessee. I planned it without Carl knowing about it, and just hoped he'd be recovered enough to go. It looked pretty doubtful when he had the second surgery, had to have the home nurses etc., but its all worked out. Cissy will be staying with a good friend who just happens to be my mentor when it comes to senior dogs; she is the reason why I felt inspired to take them in--Cissy will love her!It was Cissy's turn at the vet on Monday. Both the vet and I are really happy with how her skin has healed.  Cissy's thyroid appears to be stable for now and she has even lost about 10 pounds (4.5 kg).  But unfortunately she has an infection that is really hanging on, so she'll be returning to the vet next week for another test which will help to decide what the next round of medications should be. Cissy takes it all in stride and is even taking 'cat stalking lessons' from Todd. Today I am getting ready for our trip and my first day of vacation has gotten off to a beautiful start as I watched the sun rise slowly behind the trees as fog filled the field. The dogs were sniffing and rolling in the wet grass and the sound of the rooster crowing from the farm across the road could be heard among the birds that were just starting to sing.  In that moment I could feel the peace in the air. It was all a reminder of why I love the country and my life at Golden Pines. I hope your day is a peaceful one too!!"},
{"title": "Josh - His Place in the Pack", "date": "Saturday, April 27, 2013", "text": "Off to the vet first thing this morning with Josh and Annie.  We found out after Annie came to us last year that she has some damage to her liver and kidneys from medication that she was being given. Thankfully with a supplement we were able to stabilize them.  But Annie's last blood work results showed some changes in her kidneys so she needed to have a couple of more tests done. One was to check her blood pressure.  A laid-back-and easy going 14 year old Golden Retriever with high blood pressure just doesn't seem possible, does it?  But  apparently it can be in dogs suffering from kidney issues and if it is left untreated, hypertension can contribute to the damage done by kidney failure.  Thankfully Annie's blood pressure was just fine.   For Josh it was a yearly exam, and a required rabies vaccine.  He also has a pretty good ear infection so that needed tending to as well.  I don't write too much about Josh. He found his way to us in 2002 as 3-4 month old puppy that was found on the side of the road after he'd been hit by a car.  It took 5 orthopedic surgeries to both hips, pelvis and front leg and a very long recovery to get him back on all four feet again.Josh's position in the pack has changed little over the years.  He's a relatively quiet and very easy going dog, that loves to chase the frisbee and stays in the background, allowing the others to shine. Within the pack I think that he is probably considered one of the lowest dogs, but I can't be sure.  When he comes to me for attention, most often he is nuzzled out of the way by one of the other dogs. When I try to get him to jump onto the bed he won't if Charlie or another dog is there first.  Josh patiently waits for his turn to be given his dinner and his treats.  I have watched him interact with the other dogs and he seems to have their respect and he (thankfully) is not being bullied or picked on, which the lowest dog can be. It all just reminds me how complex pack-dynamics can sometimes be, so I guess I should just give up trying to figure it out.  But what wasn't hard to figure out is that it was really nice to spend one-on-one time with him (and Annie) and I think he really enjoyed his outing as well, even if it meant having to have a sore ear and vaccine to get it."},
{"title": "Three Milestones", "date": "Wednesday, April 24, 2013", "text": "The week is off to its usual pace and slipping past.  It's nice to be able to come home and still have a little daylight left because it allows me to get some work done outside.  Last evening I enjoyed seeing the Barred Owls that take up residence in our woods each year.  I hear them often enough, but to actually see the pair together is rare.  My camera only captured the outline of one as the sun was setting.This week we have had three little celebrations that went recognized here at home with the celebratory cookies for the dog, and a bakery treat for Carl and I. The first one was the 22nd, where we celebrated the one year arrival of our girl Annie. I remember so vividly   the first day I met her.  It was a bittersweet day when her owner who was terminally ill with cancer said his good-byes to her, and I made a new friend.  Annie was welcomed into the pack, and has found her place here.  It is truly like she has always been here, a tribute to her spirit and the good life she has had. ~Annie~The second milestone is Cissy.  Today she has been here exactly a month.  You all have followed her journey back to health and even though she still has a ways to go, your cheering her on has truly made a difference--Because I really thought (as did several others) that in those first days, that this little milestone was not going to be reached.~Cissy~The third is that Carl is finally going back to work today.  There is still plenty of healing left to occur, with a heel broken in 3 places and a fractured ankle, it's a slow process. But we hope that the worst of it is finally behind us.  Thank-you all for the good thoughts you've been sending for him as well.~Charlie~With both of us gone today, I am wondering what the dogs will do?I say catch up on the 20 hour naps that they've missed...That's what Wendy (below) will be doing.

He is feeling really well and is finally done with the twice-daily IV antibiotics.  The hope is that he might be able to go back to work next week--Paws crossed!Cissy continues to do well.  Her skin in some places is still red and itchy, (especially her feet) and other infections are still not quite cleared up, so she remains on medication and frequent baths with a prescription shampoo. She has a good appetite, but for whatever reason, she won't or can't eat out of a dog bowl and so I feed her from an old pie pan that works well for her.  I find Cissy's personality very sweet and endearing.  She hobbles around, has to be in the middle of what's going on, and with a bark that is a slightly hoarse, howling and rambling, she gives us her opinion about whatever may be happening!  She really loves attention and frequently surprises me by licking me when I least expect it.  We really enjoy having her as part of our household and I think we've become good friends. To end my week this afternoon I had lunch with a couple that I consider long-time friends.  They are the very first friends I (we) made when Carl and I came to Virginia in 1995.  We've both moved twice since that time and even though we don't live too far from one another, life takes us in totally different directions, and we only are able to get together once every couple of months or so.  My friend personifies all the best qualities a friend could be and she is one of the few people with who I can truly “let down my hair.”  She has known me in good times and not so good times.  I know I can share my thoughts with her and she won’t criticize or judge me and I trust her completely.  I only hope I am as good of a friend to her as she is to me.Afterwards we stood outside the restaurant and chatted a little more before we said good-bye and got back to our daily lives.  Just as with every time we get together, I find myself not wanting my time with her to end.  I've decided that spending time with a good friend is just like the cheesecake that I brought home to share with Carl--Why do all good things need to come to an end?  I guess it's a good thing that I bought two pieces! Finally, my blogging friends, I'm sorry my visits to your blogs haven't been as frequent as I would like.  And because the rain this weekend will keep me from mowing the grass, I'll look forward to catching up with your news! **My apology to Jo, and to anyone else I may have offended when originally in this post I referred to Cissy as 'being like an old lady.' It was not my intention, and I meant it only in the most endearing way. ~Kim~"},

For me there's just something about sitting in a rocking chair in the warmth of the afternoon sun. Maybe it's from seeing too many movies or reading too many books. Or maybe it's just because I'm overly sentimental because my siblings and I used to love to do it at my Grandfather's house when I was growing up.  Whatever the reason, for me sitting on a porch in a rocking chair and rocking is therapeutic--I find the repetition of it all soothing rather than monotonous.  In thinking about it, I guess that it's probably much the same way that runners feel with the repeated motion of their feet hitting the pavement.  My mind really benefited from just sitting, rocking, mulling over the weeks events, letting the thoughts and feelings come to the surface and be put into perspective or to just let them go.    It all really helped. And of course the dogs helped too--With a face like Todd's (below) how could it not?? But I think I'm ready to rejoin the human race. I hope you had a good weekend too.  ~Annie~"},

In the end, letting him go was the only decision that could be made.  But in my heart and mind (and in your comments) I have found needed reassurance and have no doubt that his time with us was one of contentment and happiness for him that he showed in many ways. I overslept on Friday morning and was late to work on rainy and dreary morning that reflected my mood.  I felt like I was in merely going through the motions--Even though I was reminded that life continues; I'm needed despite my wanting the world to stop if only for a little while.  To the vet with 3 of the girls.  Sheba is still trying to get over a bad ear infection, Annie needed a check up. Cissy's skin is very  much improved; the blood work taken will tell us the rest of the story.~Annie~Home again to a peaceful evening.  The earlier storms had passed and so after the dogs were given their dinner I spent some time outside with them.  I stood at the fence lost in thought as the pangs of Lucas's loss came again when I noticed the spot in the yard where Todd and Lucas dug a hole a few days ago.  My eyes went to the sunny place place that Lucas used to like to lay to soak up the sun.  I noticed wild violets were blooming there.  Perhaps it was the searched for reassurance and 'sign' that all was okay.  I know that with time, I will be too. ********************Footnote of the events that led to the decision to let Lucas go:Lucas's having laryngeal paralysis was confirmed during the first surgery to remove his teeth, and it became the chief concern during the two subsequent surgeries he would have. Many dog owners know about this, but for those who don't, in the normal respiratory cycle when inhalation occurs a laryngeal muscle contracts and opens the airway. Laryngeal paralysis does not allow this to happen and dogs like Lucas have to inhale against an obstructed airway. That airway became totally obstructed making it very, very difficult and nearly impossible for Lucas to breathe on his own. Treatment after more than 12 hours should have helped, but sadly it was ineffective.  The decision to let Lucas go was made with the help of a kind, caring and compassionate vet who I met last year when she and her family adopted from the rescue."},

Outside the Eastern Phoebe for the third year in a row is busy building its \"house\" above our garage door.  This cheeky little bird is one of my favorites.  Its return a few weeks ago was a sure sign of that spring had to be on its way--The Phoebe was right, it has finally shown up.  Warming temperatures are forecast for the rest of our week.  Blossoms like the forsythia that is just starting to bloom will be in abundance by the end of the week.Yesterday at her own choosing Cissy spent most of the day outside.  She really seems to enjoy the warmth of the sun.Today she was quieter and she chose to stay inside most of the time.  Because of her very low thyroid level, her coat is thin, and she has no coat at all on her stomach side.  With a cool breeze, this evening I've warmed a towel and blanket for her and as I write this she's sleeping soundly.  I'm just hoping it's not an indication that she's not feeling well again.I had a conversation with someone from the rescue about Cissy.  It's easy enough to see that she's not a 'full bred Golden Retriever' but a mix of something that I can't even begin to guess. But I was asked my thoughts about maybe transferring Cissy to an \"all breed rescue\" when she feels better. This would be because people coming to a breed specific rescue almost always are looking to adopt that particular breed and not a mixed breed. Placing Cissy into a new forever home via the Golden Retriever Rescue could be a challenge and added to that is her age and her health.  It was a good, frank discussion and one that had to take place. In the end we agreed that she is \"golden enough\" and will not be transferred to another rescue.  She is now an \"honorary Golden Retriever.\"  I wonder what Todd would think about being an \"honorary Golden Retriever?\""},

I reluctantly agreed with her, but it was only because of the difficult first week Cissy had with us--The thought that tough (and final) decisions would have to be made were very seriously being discussed with the vet and the rescue during those first several days.  But as this week passed, and I was seeing improvement in how she was feeling, and that her strength and appetite were returning, I couldn't (and can't) help but be optimistic and hopeful that Cissy will regain her health. There is no doubt as the video below shows, that she still has some hurdles to get over because her health and especially her skin issues are a result of long time neglect, and won't be 'cured' in just a matter of a few weeks.  But the video also shows that there is no doubt whatsoever that she is feeling better and Cissy thinks she is too--And today when she was standing in the yard, she was telling everyone about it who would listen.  I think it was her best day."},
{"title": "Good Signs", "date": "Sunday, March 31, 2013", "text": "It was a beautiful sunny Saturday that included another visit to the vet.  This time it was for Sheba and Todd.  With the exception of Sheba's really bad ear infection, both dog's are healthy.  There's no doubt that Sheba and Todd share a connection to one another.  Todd always tries to get her to play with him, and while she does, at almost 8 years old her interest in a game of chase doesn't last as long as Todd's does. But yesterday I witnessed something that I've never seen before between my dogs.  Todd took his exam all in stride and there wasn't a single objection to the good once over or a vaccine he received.  But when the vet looked into Sheba's sore ear and she whined, Todd suddenly became protective of Sheba and started barking at vet and put himself between the two of them.  I quieted Todd, but when it happened again, it was decided to do the exam in another room.  Todd is a very territorial dog when it comes to defending his home turf, I just had no idea it extended to his pack mates too. The relationship dogs within a pack have with one another never ceases to amaze or interest me. On the flip-side there is of course Cissy.  Your continued good thoughts for her are truly making a difference, and it means a lot!  As you may well have guessed, there was a really big concern early on that Cissy's diagnosis was going to be one that she could not recover from, or one that was contagious to our dogs.  Thankfully each of those illnesses have finally been ruled out. However there is no doubt that Cissy has a long way to go to become fully healthy again.  Her energy level is low, and she's still sleeping a lot of the time.  But there has been a bit of an increase in her appetite, and yesterday she spent a little time outside meeting our crew and soaking up the warm sun.  I'm taking all those things as a good sign.Happy Easter, enjoy your Sunday!!~Charlie~"},

Her blood work results were all returned on Tuesday and nothing in those results was 'normal or okay.'  The only good thing is, if there is one, and that's that Cissy did not test positive for heart-worm.  On Wednesday she returned to the vet where she spent the entire day for more testing.  Hopefully today we will find out those results which will be put it together with the blood work for a final diagnosis. ~On the way to the vet Wednesday morning~Despite trying to tempt Cissy with the tastiest of treats and smelliest of foods, I've been unable to get her to eat a full meal.  She's just not feeling well enough.  .   Cissy sleeps most of the time. She seems to really like being covered up, so I've been warming blankets and towels in the dryer to put on top of her.  But when Cissy sees me she wags her hairless tail, and also did for the girls at the vets office yesterday too.

But when I heard Cissy's story and saw her pictures like the one above, I could not \"look on and do nothing,\" and so without any hesitation whatsoever, I agreed.  So after a very, very long day on Saturday, we welcomed Cissy to Golden Pines. As you can see in her photos, she has been very severely neglected. She was turned into the shelter by her 'owner' and I will only say that I have counted yesterday among the days that I marveled at how incredibly undeserving of the label “human” some people can be. And with that I will also spare you the details of was matted within her coat, and just say that a friend met me at a 'dog-wash' where Cissy was cheered on by everyone in the shop that kindly donated everything that we needed to give her a really, really good bath.  I do not know what Cissy's story will be. Of course I am worried about her.  All the dogs, including Todd, are very subdued around her.  I know she is really not feeling well, and has many medical problems that will hamper a quick recovery, if one is meant to be. But as I sit here and look at her sleeping soundly, I am taken by her sweet old face and I'm grateful because I know that she is safe and has a warm bed to sleep on.  And because I have no doubt that for however long she is with us, her story will end with someone who cares about what happens to her.

They worked because everything went really, really well and part of the repair to his ankle that was planned did not have to be done. If there was any glitch in the day it began in the waiting room where I waited an hour after Carl's doctor spoke to me about the surgery, to find out when Carl would be taken to his room--A nurse told me a room wasn't ready yet, and I was assured they would let me know when he was taken to his room.  I really didn't want to keep bothering the staff, so I waited until the 2nd hour passed before I asked again.  I was told by another nurse that they were still waiting for a room for Carl and that they would certainly let me know when he was taken to his room.  Shortly afterwards I got a phone call from Carl asking where I was.  He'd been in his room for over an hour and had even been given lunch.  We both wondered if anyone ever tried to let me know....The day ended on a good note with Lucas as well.  Some of you may know that he has been on the 'available dog page' of the website for the rescue that I volunteer with for a year.  Of course we really care very much about Lucas, but for several reasons I felt that if there was someone else who could give Lucas a good forever home, then perhaps he should go there. But there has not been a single person who has expressed an interest in the senior dog with no teeth that is obsessed with cats. Now at about 14 years old, Lucas is showing his age just a little bit. Because of his age, the length of time he has been with us and a few other things it has been decided that Lucas will remain with us for the rest of his life.  This means that Lucas is now a 'full fledged member' of the gang at Golden Pines.On our wall hangs a large picture frame that holds the photos in chronological order of each and every dog (and cat) that has 'officially' been part of our household.  Lucas's picture is on the bottom right between Todd's and Annie's.  For whatever reason I added his several months ago.  I think this was always how it was meant to be."},

Throughout yesterday I noticed this little woodpecker as it built its new house in a nearby tree.While I was working outside, the dogs enjoyed the warm sunny weather. Afterwards Lucas enjoyed a snooze on the front porch while stalking the cat at the same time.

Yes, you know that you’re going to have to think about everything tomorrow, but the load somehow feels much lighter and the pressure is taken off of you. It’s a psychological thing I’m sure, but it's a nice feeling to say the least.~CarrieAnne~So the dogs and I spent a lot of time outdoors today.  Their muddy and wet paw-prints from the quickly melting snow were all over the house.  But afterwards I enjoyed a cup of hot chocolate and we all enjoyed the comfort of a warm nap together.  All the things that this girl who didn't get snow days growing up, really loves."},

For me, the most exciting part was baking, and lots of it.  At the grocery store on Thursday I really took advantage of the ten-cents-a-pound for ripe bananas.  And even though I gave part of them to a co-worker, I still had plenty left for us.  I made five loaves of banana bread, two different kinds of  banana muffins, and a snack cake.  I've decided that I really love when a dessert is called a snack, because I think that implies that it's just that, a snack, and you can eat as much as you want....Because it's a snack....Right?? But banana bread is another one of my 'comfort foods.'  Growing up I used to love when my Mom made banana bread.  My brothers and I consumed it like we hadn't eaten in days and it seemed like it would only last about five minutes.  Maybe it did, because we were like vultures!And then this morning I have to admit that I made banana bread into french toast--Okay, maybe that was too much, but it was really pretty good, even if it wasn't all that healthy.  Which is why it was a good thing that the dogs and I went for plenty of walks and played frisbee.   ~Sheba~ I hope you all had a nice relaxing weekend too!~Joshua~"},

Lucas returned to see the dentist on Wednesday.  And unfortunately he wasn't happy about being there.  But as expected the dentist is recommending that the sore tooth be removed along with the 3 remaining others.  The rescue has approved the procedure, and so an appointment will be made for it to be done next week.The antibiotics have done their job and Lucas is back to his carefree self, and is back to work stalking the cat.  Some of you asked about how he eats.  Lucas eats a dehydrated dog-food-mix that when water is added, becomes a porridge, and to that I add a little bit of dry-kibble. It's a very healthy diet that has worked well for him.  In the past year Lucas has gained almost 15 pounds (about 7 kg) of much needed weight. Today calm is the order of the day, and I think that Todd who was groomed this week, shows that perfectly!  And even though our house by definition can be the farthest thing from calm, I love the idea of it, don't you?"},

I heard from my Vet on Saturday about the tests that were done, and as expected, Lucas has a high white blood cell count indicating an infection. Its been decided that Lucas will be returning to see 'his' veterinary dentist to confirm that the tooth in question is the culprit and from there we'll decide on treatment options.   I wonder what Lucas thinks about seeing the dentist....."},

I should have known something was wrong when at about two-thirty in the morning I was awakened by Lucas who had his front paws on the bed and he was looking at me. This was totally out of character for him because he doesn't typically come into the bedroom.  But I put my arm around him and petted and talked to him for a few minutes.  With that, he laid down by the side of the bed and we both went back to sleep.  As if his waking me and coming into the bedroom wasn't unusual enough, this morning Lucas was really subdued and very uncharacteristically refused his morning meal, an offer of treats and even water.  Needless to say, we were off to the vet.  You'll recall that when Lucas came to us last January, he had severe periodontal disease and had to have 38 teeth removed.  My vet thinks that one of the remaining 4 teeth may have possibly become a problem and is causing him to have pain.  To say that I'm disappointed that after all that he went through, that it could possibly be another bad tooth is an understatement--But I am really, really hoping that's all that it is.  And I'm also hoping that the medications he's being given will help his appetite to return and also return the silly-goofy-cat-stalking dog that we've become so fond of.  Until he feels like his old self, we're keeping our fingers and paws crossed and making sure he gets lots of rest."},

He was running back and forth in the yard with it in his mouth, and in the darkness of the morning I could see him pouncing on and tossing his new toy into the air and playing with what can only be described as pure unbridled joy!  When I called for him to come inside, he instantly stopped, gave me a quick look, and grabbed his new toy and with full terrier-speed, he darted past me at the door to continue playing inside.  Not wanting a mess on my freshly vacuumed rug, I decided to take the pine-cone away from him.  It was only then that I realized that what Todd was playing with was not a pine-cone but a dead and very frozen mole!  Knowing how quickly the attention of a terrier can change, especially Todd's, I looked around and offered him what was closest to me, the treat jar!  I could see his mind was spinning as he tried to decide which he wanted--For the other dogs, the choice was obvious, but for Todd, it took a moment or two and he dropped the mole in return for a handful of treats.  Even in the cold, dark, early morning hours of our day, there is never a dull moment when Todd is around."},

Aside from all that has happened with Carl, (who is still on crutches), rarely in our lives are there big or grand events, rather most days are made up of the same things, only repeated in slightly different ways.  My goal is to live simply and stick to the routine as closely as I can.  Yet there are some days that my life, or anyone's for that matter, is anything but simple and anything but easy or routine. But I wouldn't trade my life for anything, because even when it's not all that easy, something inside me always helps me to really see the good and the positive.So today when Todd jumped up and grabbed a towel off the counter, that had a pan of freshly made tomato cream sauce (that was for tonight's dinner) cooling on top of it and it fell onto the floor, splattering all over my kitchen rug, I tried to not get upset--Because the rug, the floor, the stove and cabinets needed a good cleaning anyway--Yes, as hard as it really was this time, it's always a good idea to try and see the good.

Because of where our power line is, we knew about where the new one would be. But I just had no idea that when it was decided, that it would mean that the 'natural fence' that consisted of trees, blackberry bushes, honeysuckle and everything else would be totally gone, as well as the boundary that the dogs knew not to cross.The hedge is almost all on our property, and in the below picture, you can see how wide it was.  Now anyone using the new driveway has a full view of our yard and the dogs think they now have more room to explore.   From our house I could see that it was a mess, and I have to admit to being a little upset about it all.  I could see that the workers were getting ready to leave, and so I went over to talk to them about it before they left.  Even the trees had been left where they had fallen when they were cut.  I told a man named 'Evan,' who looked like he was the one in charge, that I understood about their doing their job, etc., and as disappointing as it is to lose the privacy and the hedge, I was really unhappy about the mess they were leaving.  I told him I was not going to be able to do the clean-up and stack the wood by myself and that I thought since there were more of them than me, that they should do it. With the workers already in their trucks to leave for the day, I really thought that they weren't going too. ~Josh, still with his frisbee~After they'd gone, I walked back over with the dogs and found they had cleaned up and stacked the wood. I was very thankful and appreciative that they had done what I'd asked.I guess it does pay to let someone know that you're not happy with what they're doing.    I think CC does a good job of letting Todd know when she is! Enjoy your weekend!"},

The name stuck to them, even though their weight didn't.  Bubba was the more carefree of the two, but had health and mobility issues. Toby was the serious one and was always watching over his life's companion, taking care of Bubba, washing his face, and constantly cleaning his ears.~Toby (left) and Bubba, June 2010~Into their private club the two welcomed our boy Sam. The three became 'The Chub Club' and were companions to one another. But there always remained the unbreakable bond between Toby and Bubba.~The Chub Club: Sam (left), Bubba (middle) and Toby~  When Bubba passed away on New Years Eve 2011, Toby mourned his loss. Sam kept his distance from Toby during this time, but there came a time that the two were always together. Toby then blossomed into a mischievous, carefree and comical boy who was always rolling in the grass and when your back was turned he would run in between your legs.We even found out during a power outage that he liked to chase a laser pointer. The good days for Toby had returned. But sadly when Sam passed away this past June, there was a loneliness about Toby that I couldn't help to erase.~Sam (left) and Toby, June 2012~Toby's ability to get around has been deteriorating over the last few months, but we were there to give him that boost whenever he needed it. This week, he became unable to stand and was in a great deal of pain. Despite many attempts my vet and I couldn't get Toby to stand up, even with the best of help and support. With that and because of how uncomfortable he was, it was decided that the kind thing to do would be to let him go. Making these decisions, no matter how many times you have done it, is never easy. I noticed that as my tears were falling there was one in Toby's eye too...And with a shake of his head, he quietly and peacefully left this life for the next.All day long I've been remembering Bubba and Toby on the first day we got them.  When they were turned over to the rescue I volunteer with the two weren't boarded together. When Bubba and Toby arrived here all they did that first evening was lay next to each other and lick one another's face, they were so happy to be reunited. This evening as I was driving home a beautiful bright orange glow of the sunset filled the sky in front of me. Across the horizon flew a large flock of geese. Behind the flock, two geese flying side by side were trying to catch up to the others ahead of them. I imagined the meeting of Toby and Bubba on the other side.  The two greeting one another with licks on the face, and then running together to catch up with the others that were ahead. Despite the ache and the emptiness I am feeling, thinking of their reunion gives me great comfort.  Toby will be greatly missed.God-speed 'Toby-Bunny' until we meet again at the Rainbow Bridge...."},

This week the focus has been on Humble, and our boy Toby.  For Humble, coming into a large multi-dog household has gone pretty well for her, and she's managed to get along with everyone.

Carrie as you may recall is a pretty tough little street fighter, and the two of them have had a few 'disagreements' ending with a few scratches on both of them and Todd too who can't stand on the sidelines and just watch. Thankfully its not been anything more serious. Because these kind of issues have a tendency to escalate, and I am very concerned that it is only a matter of time before someone gets really injured, I've asked the rescue to find Humble a new foster home. But as luck would have it, there is someone who is interested in adopting Humble. I spoke with her yesterday and feel that she would be the most perfect home for Humble. We're meeting her on Saturday and hoping, hoping, hoping that the two will be a good match for one another.As you're crossing your fingers and paws for Humble, I hope you'll cross them for our boy Toby too. He's totally unable to stand on his own and he uncharacteristically snapped at me this morning when I tried to get him to his feet. Toby is a big boy, and isn't easily moved.

Because of that, the daily list of things for me to do is really pretty long. Unfortunately along with work it has been zapping any extra time out of the day and taking the joy along with it. When everything falls on your shoulders it can be overwhelming.I feel so lucky in that I have good, supportive friends who have shared my load by listening, brought baked treats and even taken me to lunch.  Each have told me the truth as they see it.  And that truth is, is that no-one has a life that looks like a pinterest board. No one has a life that stays like the page in a magazine. And no one can go through life without having those days (or weeks) where the to-do list has things listed on it that should have been done last week--Like the work on our barn...~Lucas~The truth is real life, just as Charlie looks like right now, can be messy. But the beauty isn't in the perfection, but rather in seeing the beauty in the everyday ordinary things and Charlie too. I find I've been comparing and putting on the mask of perfection that led me, and can make anyone feel overwhelmed. Its been really easy for me to live in that overwhelmed place.  But I have been reminded that it doesn't change anything.So today, I've decided to remain positive in the midst of crazy. With the dogs and their antics and positive energy, I am ready to do just that.  I just need to remember to hang on, because like Todd, the ride may continue to be fast and a little bit bumpy!"},
{"title": "Does Annie Know?", "date": "Friday, January 4, 2013", "text": "Annie, who will be 14 in just a couple of weeks came into the rescue because her owner had stage 4 cancer.    He was no longer able to care for her, and wanted to make sure she would be cared for after he passed.  Since Annie came to us, I've heard from him a few times, asking how she was doing.  Of course I'd respond back and always include the newest picture of her. Knowing how difficult it was for him to give Annie up, and with his declining health, I always let him initiate the contact. I've not heard from him since late summer. A couple of weeks ago, in the middle of the night I was awakened by Annie. We keep a small night-lite on and in the shadows I could see that she was standing in the doorway of the bedroom.  She was looking down the hallway and was wagging her tail and whining.  What she was doing would have normally gotten the attention of the other dogs, but this time it didn't.  I watched her and fell back to sleep.  I'd forgotten all about that until this morning when I received an e-mail from the son of Annie's former owner, (who was always included in the e-mails) telling me that his father had passed away a few weeks ago. Coincidence?  Perhaps. But I have to wonder, does Annie know?"},
{"title": "The Glass Half Full Day ", "date": "Thursday, January 3, 2013", "text": "When I finished work on New Years Eve, I had grandiose plans for the three days that I had off work. To start, I was going to stay caught up on my blog reading, do things around the house, and then there were the 2 new shops that have opened in a nearby town that I wanted to check-out. It didn't matter (too much) that I had a spouse with a broken foot, he would be just fine....He wasn't fine....We spent an exhaustive entire New Years day at the hospital.  At the end of it, despite varying opinions that he should be admitted to the hospital, Carl and I were both on our way home. A stop at the Arby's drive-thru for our first meal of the day, we both thought the message on the cup summed it all up. We remain very grateful for all the well wishes and prayers from friends and family and we are thankful that Carl's injury was not more serious than it is.Staying with the half-theme, the roofer came on New Years day and he is now about halfway way finished putting the new roof on our barn.  We just wonder now when he'll return to finish the other half.Yesterday I received an e-mail from someone interested in adopting Humble. The family seemed like they may be a match until it was mentioned that their farm has about 15 cats. They felt that since the cats were outside, it wouldn't be an issue--Humble would have no doubt felt like she was in heaven to have that many cats around.  But with the current dogs allowed to be off lead, and the hope that Humble could be as well, I decided that they weren't a match for her. So, for now, Humble remains here with us, which of course is just fine. While Carl stays in bed with his foot propped up, with the TV remote and his computer nearby, we are looking forward to a quiet day at home--And in keeping with the theme off the soda-cup, we are hoping it's a FULL glass kind of day--If Charlie could see, I think he'd agree to one too!"},
{"title": "A Crescendo", "date": "Saturday, December 29, 2012", "text": "With Christmas on Tuesday, the week began quietly.  But its volume started to increase, and on Thursday it hit a crescendo.  Work on the new roof for our barn began last weekend.  Carl stayed home from work on Thursday to finish taking off the old roof before the roofer returned to put the new one on.  His doing this without anyone around caused me some concern, but Carl assured me he'd be 'just fine' and there was no need to worry.  However, worrying is one of the things I do best, so of course that's what I did.  Mid-morning the worries really came to the surface when I received a call from Carl telling me he'd slipped on some ice and had fallen off the roof of the barn--Three hours later Carl and I are leaving the hospital, he is on crutches with a cast on his left foot that is broken.  We are very, very grateful that this was the 'only' injury--We all know that when someone falls two stories, it can be much worse. However, unlike when you fall off a bicycle and you get back on, Carl will not be getting back onto the roof of our barn! With that, the volume on the week quieted again.  Snow has been falling off and on all day.While Carl sat with his foot propped up, the dogs and I spent time outdoors.  Wendy even came outside with us. Toby sampled  the snow... And no matter the weather, Josh is always ready to play frisbee ... It really brought out the puppy in Annie, and she chased after Sheba.  At 14 years old, Annie is such a lady and I couldn't help but enjoy watching her and all the dogs play in the snow!I hope you've enjoyed your Saturday too!"},
{"title": "Christmas Menus ", "date": "Tuesday, December 25, 2012", "text": "It feels like all Carl and I have done the past two days is eat.  Dinner for Christmas Eve could not have been more enjoyed. The restaurant was lit mostly by candles, and with an unexpected snowfall, it added more of a holiday feel to the evening. We passed on dessert because of the chocolate torte that calls to us each time we open the refrigerator door. And we'd just gotten home when a friend of ours stopped by with their entire family to sing Christmas carols for us. The day literally ended on a good note!Christmas day started early when I made homemade cinnamon rolls.  The rolls need about 2 hours of rising time, but they are well worth the wait and the work that goes into them. They are baked in my Grandmother's cast-iron-skillet (frying pan), that allows them to bake perfectly and evenly.In between eating and a much needed nap, I enjoyed chatting with all my siblings and other family members. The dogs enjoyed the day too, and loved playing in what little snow is left from yesterday. Wendy seems to be feeling better and even rolled a little in the snow this morning.  Todd has really loved digging in it and having us throw snowballs at him that he tried to catch. It could not have been a better day.  If I could make another Christmas wish, it would be to stay home from work tomorrow--Unfortunately, that wish won't be coming true.  I do hope your wishes came true and your Christmas was an enjoyable one as well!~Charlie~"},

Tomorrow Carl and I have dinner reservations at a favorite restaurant for Christmas Eve. For the holiday they have a special menu that we are both really looking forward to.Wendy has had a little set back, and doesn't have an appetite. I'm hoping that it's just the cold bothering her arthritis and the medication I have given her today will help. Her spirits seem to be 'up' so that's encouraging. Keeping our spirits up today is a win by the Washington Redskins, and a homemade chocolate torte given to us as a gift by a friend. The torte is moist, dense, and has a rich, deep chocolate flavor--What a Christmas gift! To end this post, below is a fun picture of a former foster dog named Paige that was taken at the rescue event that Humble, Lucas and I attended last Saturday. She and her owner, Carolyn, have been together about six years now and both are very near and dear to my heart.  Paige was considered 'un-adoptable' by many in and outside the rescue because of her reactive behavior.  But I felt strongly that Paige just needed the right person to give her that chance. Carolyn saw the same potential in Paige that I did and she helped Paige to realize that she didn't have to be the defender and protector of the world, that she (Carolyn) could do that. Because of Carolyn's love and dedication, Paige has become a well adjusted and confident Golden, who is totally devoted to Carolyn. Carolyn is on the board of directors of the rescue and takes Paige to the rescue events where she has become a perfect ambassador for the work the rescue does. I will always be thankful and grateful to Carolyn for opening her heart and home to Paige and making such a difference for her. And finally,  I will just add that according to Blogger, this is my 500th post.  Some of you reach that milestone much quicker and easier than I have. But it's still one for me nonetheless--So here's to the next 500 posts and a very Merry Christmas to all of you!!~My former foster girl, Paige~"},

But his ears were back--A sure sign that something was wrong and on his mind.  I started talking to him and he sheepishly stretched out, rolled onto his back and started with his cacophony of sounds, telling me about what was bothering him. I knew exactly what Todd was saying.  I got up, (noting that he wasn't following me) and I found 'what' he was talking about.  I didn't say anything, but just cleaned up his little accident.  I went back to the bedroom, and there Todd sat, on the corner of the bed, ears still back, looking at me, as if to say, \"I'm sorry, but this wouldn't have happened if you hadn't gone to bed early...\"  Todd likes it when he's right..."},

{"title": "Picky Eaters", "date": "Saturday, December 15, 2012", "text": "~Lucas~Since both Humble and Lucas are available for adoption, I took them to a 'meet and greet' Christmas event that the rescue attended in hopes of maybe finding a forever home for Humble. (Notice I didn't say for Lucas too!)  Both dogs did really well, and enjoyed the attention.  I didn't meet anyone that I thought was 'forever home material,' but that was okay--I've no doubt that HUMBLE'S forever home is out there, and it's just a matter of time before the stars and the moon all line up and the cosmos bring us all together. Back at home, things are quiet.  There are no big changes for Wendy, other than she is eating a little more at mealtime. At the moment she seems to like the addition of Lucas's food to her meal--However she still won't eat all she's being given, and isn't tempted to take the tastiest of treats offered to her.Another dog that doesn't like what she's being fed, is Annie.  I've been watching her for quite some time and notice that she doesn't like the vegetables that are added to her meal.  She will ever so lady-like, always take them out of the bowl and put them onto the left side, where they are eaten by someone else.  It makes her a favorite at dinnertime among the not-so-picky-eaters!"},
{"title": "Canine Independence ", "date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2012", "text": "Today was my last scheduled day off for the rest of the year.  And instead staying home, I spent it with someone that I've known peripherally for a few years. She and I have worked on church committees together, and had brief conversations, but it took sitting next to one another at a meeting where we struck up a conversation and realized that we have a great deal in common--One thing is that she and her husband have 5 dogs, one is a Scottish Terrier and another a Portuguese Water dog that she shows and does field work with. We decided that we needed to get to know one another better.  So, today I met her very well behaved dogs, and we were off to have lunch at a restaurant that we both happen to really enjoy and did some shopping afterwards. Interesting, at least to me, how you can think you have little in common with someone and then find out the opposite is true.  Am I the only one this happens to?Back at home the focus remains on Wendy.  The tilting of her head is not nearly as noticeable, but she still really struggles to get up and walk. The last couple of days Wendy has decided that she has had enough of eating her meals alone in bed, and hobbles into the kitchen to eat with the rest of the dogs. She's not able to stand the whole time, and won't eat an entire meal, but I think it's a good sign. Wendy has also decided that the ramp we put on the steps isn't for her, but for old ladies and has channeled her independent nature and refuses to go up or down it.  So, I stand at the bottom of the steps, and help her down. Wendy also decided today that she wanted to go with us on our walk.  I got her outside but she couldn't stay on her feet, so I left her in the garage while the rest of us went for our walk. When I got back and got her up to go inside, I noticed her tail was wagging, just a little--I've not her tail-wag since she started having problems, and so it was a good feeling to see it.  I also found myself humbled at how hard she is trying to stick to her beloved routine, and how she seems to care little for how she may be feeling. I think I can learn from that."},

She's not quite as unsteady on her feet as she was a couple of days ago, but she still needs our help to stay standing.  To try and make things easier outside, we've put a ramp by the back porch steps so she doesn't have to go up or down stairs.  Wendy is sleeping a lot more, and not eating much. She doesn't seem to be in any pain and seems comfortable. And just as she has always done, she's setting her own pace --It's how it should be."},
{"title": "A Letter to Wendy", "date": "Thursday, December 6, 2012", "text": "Dear Wendy, Like all the dogs before you, I never want you to go.  The special bond we share has not dimmed as the years have passed.  I remember your youth and your stories like they happened only yesterday.  How I wish I could turn back the years for you.  My heart has been breaking the last few days as I see you struggle to get up and walk. They say that \"the eyes are the window to the soul,\" and your eyes seem to have changed.  I really noticed it yesterday when I came home from work.  I'm not sure what it means, or if it means anything.  But what I do know is that I will continue to keep my part of the bargain and be there for you, just like you have been for me so many times. And when the time comes, which I hope and pray will not be too soon, the last thing I will do for you is to gently let you go.  I know that you'll only be gone from my sight, because I will forever keep the memories of our long life together, warm and safe and tucked away in my heart.  The thought of losing you is already bringing a lot of tears.  And when you are gone I know that out of habit I'll look for you because you are so intertwined within the fabric of our lives.  And I know there will be an empty feeling that can never be filled. But that's what real love is--And the fact that you are a dog does not and will not change any of it.  We love you Wendy.  I really hope you feel better and that today is a good day for you. ~Kim~"},
{"title": "Work and Play ", "date": "Sunday, December 2, 2012", "text": "Saturday morning started with an early morning phone call from a friend of mine. Her daughter wasn't feeling well and the two were signed up to take a Bûche de Noël (Yule Log) baking class, and would I like to attend in her place?  Of course I gladly accepted the invitation. The class was 4 hours long and its description said that in that time you were \"to learn the mysteries of a proper genoise (sponge) cake, the wonders of butter-cream frosting, and the magical decorating powers of mushroom-shaped meringues.\" However the class was described, it was really a lot of fun!  The cake was a lot of work, but I think it had a really good flavor, and so I took it to a get together last evening. But this morning I have to admit to having overdone it on the sampling and along with a late night, I woke up with a bit of a headache. The rest of the weekend has been uneventful as the focus turned to Humble who we've had for about two weeks now.  She's settled in nicely and really enjoys playing with Todd. One thing that was obvious when I first met her was that she is not 13 years old.  My friends and I and the vet all agree that Humble is probably only around 11. Her energy level and physical condition pretty much confirm that.  This week she becomes available for adoption through the rescue, and I'll list Humble on their website to try and find a forever home for her.  Of course we have thought about keeping her.  But we feel that she's just not a good fit for our household. This is only because she's a little too rough with our cat and is possessive and a little growly around food when the other dogs are around, and that creates a little bit of a problem in a multi-dog household. But even though Humble doesn't like the other dogs around when she eats, she doesn't mind sharing the dog-beds, and that is just one of her many good and endearing qualities."},
{"title": "New and Old Friends", "date": "Thursday, November 29, 2012", "text": "Today has been a busy day off work.  I met a newer friend for lunch at the horse farm where she works and she gave me a tour.  Clairvaux Farm where my friend has worked for 3 years is a hunter/jumper show stable.  Unfortunately there weren't many horses inside because with a warm sunny day, they were all outside. But I enjoyed lunch with my friend and getting to know her a little bit better. Of course I enjoyed the tour too. Back at home, it was all about 'old' friends.  In my last post I mentioned about taking Annie and Wendy to the vet last Saturday.  Both girls loved the car ride and getting to see new people. You may remember that Annie has liver and kidney damage (caused by being on a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for more than a year without her previous vet checking blood-work to see if it was harming her). For the past 3 months she's been given a daily supplement of Denamarin and a Pepcid to try and stabilize her kidneys and liver.  The good news for Annie is that it appears to be working, and her liver value is now almost normal, and her kidneys appear to be stable too. ~Annie~For Wendy, it was good news as well. Born in late January of 1997, she is rounding the corner to almost 16 years old.  I can admit that I've not taken her into the vet because she was in need of a rabies vaccine.  I've always limited the vaccines that our dogs are given--And because having a rabies vaccine is the law, it goes without saying that I've always complied with that. Because of this legal-requirement, it kept me from taking Wendy to the vet because I didn't want her to have any vaccines because of her age. But a notice from the county about it, left me with no other choice. But what I didn't know was that Virginia allows a vet to decide if an animals health could be compromised if given the rabies vaccine, so a waiver has been written for Wendy--What a relief!  Her blood work does show a few minor changes, which is to be expected at her age and she's had an exposure to a tick-borne-illness which she'll take an antibiotic for. The vet does want to see Wendy in 3 months for another check-up and that I'll comply with!~Wendy~All in all, our week appears to be ending on a good note.  I hope yours is too!"},

Not to mention errands to run, a few things to organize and put away along with some cleaning to do and a lesson to prepare for church. Even with Thanksgiving, it was going to be such a productive weekend. I did none of the above.  Instead, I took Annie and Wendy to the vet early Saturday morning, rescheduled my lunch date with my friend, and spent almost every minute at home.  I just really thought it was what I should do. And so I did.~On the road with Wendy & Annie (background)~We took advantage of the unseasonably warm weather and let all the dog's unleash their energy with long, leisurely, walks. We explored around the pond on the property adjacent to us, and played ball. ~Sheba and Joshua~Yes, aside from the Thanksgiving Day drama with Humble, it was a perfect five days, even if I did feel a bit guilty for letting a few things slide. That is, until my friend Diane helped put things in perspective.\"Who says long weekends have to be productive?\" she said in her e-mail. \"Instead, have a memorable weekend like the one you're having.  You won't remember the weekends where you run errands and clean, but you will remember one where you devoted time to those precious to you.\"And she's right. So what if the closets didn't get cleaned and my desk didn't get organized?  Instead, I enjoyed catching up with all my siblings, I got to know 'Humble' just a little bit better and spent time outdoors with the dogs.  It was, indeed, a really nice five days. Productive? Okay, maybe it wasn't. But priceless? Absolutely. ~Lucas~"},
{"title": "Post Thanksgiving Day", "date": "Friday, November 23, 2012", "text": "We had a really nice Thanksgiving day!!  I was reminded more than once about how much I have to be thankful for and I really do try to make sure that I count all those blessings often.  I personally don’t think we should include all our thankfulness on one day just because that day happens to be Thanksgiving.  However, a day set aside where everyone (at least in the U.S.) is being thankful together can be and is a special thing.One thing I am very thankful for, is that Humble is okay following a little 'incident' yesterday.  I mentioned in my previous post that she was a counter-surfer-extraordinaire.  She showed her talent by eating *8*  yeast dinner rolls that I had rising on the stove.  I really thought I had them situated where she couldn't reach them, but unfortunately I was wrong.  (For those of you who don't know, a dog eating rolls that are rising is dangerous because the warm environment of the stomach acts as an oven and encourages the dough to continue rising and that can cause a bowel obstruction, a bloated/distended stomach, or cause it to twist--And then there is the issue of the yeast because it also ferments in the stomach, and releases alcohol which may lead to alcohol poisoning--Making it all a (possible) life-threatening situation)  I tried to get Humble to vomit with hydrogen-peroxide but for whatever reason, it didn't work.  So I had to call the rescue and tell them what happened and that I needed to take her into the animal emergency.  While this was a mistake on my part, I had acted quickly enough that all the emergency vet had to do was get Humble to vomit, which they did and out came the 8 rolls, still intact and as the girl said to me 'you could put them right into the oven!'  ....NOT that I would ever do that, but it was a much needed bit of humor at the end of a stressful situation!  Needless to say it left Humble and I both worn out.  However we were still able to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner with our good friends, minus my homemade dinner rolls! Today is Black Friday and a day that dedicated shoppers hit the stores in the early morning hours for bargains and deals.  It's a tradition for many people, but for years I haven't shopped on this day.  Instead I enjoy shopping online and spending the day at home.  However I do have to admit that for some reason this year my ignoring Macys was tougher because of a few things they had on sale. But I really do much prefer our “black Friday” at home to that of standing in line in the cold. The picture below was posted on Facebook, and is a very long line to get into a 'Toys R Us' across the street from where I work.  It was taken around 10 o'clock last night and the store wasn't going to open until midnight. The store is in the middle of the photo behind the tree.  YIKES!!  Do you shop on Black Friday?"},

She's a lovely 13 year old girl, given up by her family who want to travel and don't have time for her. (Are you thinking what I'm thinking?)  Our crew meet new additions like real pros.  Even Todd after he shows some Scottie attitude is just fine!  However, as expected, Lucas is totally smitten by the fair and lovely Humble who doesn't share those same feelings for him.  One thing they do have in common is their affection and obsession with our cat, CC.  But unlike Lucas who only took a basic class in cat-stalking, Humble appears to have taken the advanced course and we are going to have to be very watchful of her interactions with CC to prevent her from being accidentally hurt.  Humble has also taken lessons in counter-surfing and has shown her talent for reaching whatever is within nose reach.With the Thanksgiving holiday I'm glad we have several days to get everything sorted out and get Humbled settled in.  She's not been to the vet in about 3 years and is very thin and underweight.  I was supposed to take Wendy in for an exam and check-up at the vet this morning, but she has graciously given up her appointment so that Humble can be seen instead.  I'm hopeful everything for Humble is going to be okay."},
{"title": "A Spanish Proverb", "date": "Sunday, November 18, 2012", "text": "There is a Spanish proverb that speaks to my soul, that says, \"How beautiful it is to do nothing, and then rest afterward.\"  When we get especially busy like we have been the last several days, I think of that proverb because after being so busy, my favorite thing that I quite enjoy doing, is nothing--But I didn't get to do that this weekend. On the positive side, I didn't have to find time to cook because on Friday I made chicken-noodle soup for a co-workers birthday lunch and we had plenty of leftovers. You may recall that in my last post I mentioned that the insurance adjuster was coming to look at our barn that lost part of its roof during the hurricane. I have to admit that we were concerned about the roof being covered under our policy because we don't know its age.  In the end that was never an issue, and our insurance will generously compensate us for repairs to the roof or a new one (we're not sure what the cost is for either one).  We are very grateful that we'll receive something for its repair or replacement.The week ahead is also going to be a busy one trying to get everything done before the Thanksgiving holiday.  I am only working two days, but there's plenty to do before Thursday.  Added to everything we agreed this morning to take a 13 year old senior girl that her owners want picked up by Wednesday.  I'll tell you her story when she is safely here.  We're trying to arrange her transport to us and I'm hoping she'll be here by Tuesday evening.~Annie~Until things slow down for me, I have a feeling that the dogs will continue to embody the Spanish proverb, and I'm okay with that--I think they area too! ~Annie and Toby~Finally, a few of you asked about the recipe for the cinnamon-sugar-bread that Todd was eyeing in my last post. He did in fact get a little taste of it as did the other dogs.  You can click HERE for the link that will take you to where I found this pretty good and very easy recipe.  Enjoy!!"},

Todd on the other hand, doesn't care about barn roofs and insurance adjusters.  He did however, care about the cinnamon bread that I made and was hoping for a little bite of it.  I hope you're having a good week!  I look forward to catching up with your news later today!"},

Because I have been so caught up in all the coverage of the election,  I decided months ago to take the next day off afterwards. My thought was to avoid people if the candidate I supported lost, and enjoy the news coverage if 'HE' won. Without saying who I voted for, I will just say that I enjoyed having yesterday off instead of today.~Sheba~On the flip-side of the week, we've been trying something new with Todd.  During the day Todd stays in a 'golden sized' crate in the office. And at night he sleeps in a little smaller crate that is in our bedroom.  But lately he's been getting more and more reluctant about going in when I tell him 'it's time for bed.'  Instead he's decided that he'd rather sleep on our bed.  I decided that this is okay, as long as he doesn't get into any mischief while we're all sleeping.  Todd has actually been really good and has been staying in the bedroom.  However I find myself waking up several times during the night to check on him.  While Todd may be happier to not spend the night in the crate, I think I would be happier with a little more sleep."},

On Monday just before the storm really hit, I was almost home when a tree fell across the road.  Seemingly out of nowhere a couple of men showed up, jumped out of their truck with a chainsaw and made quick work cutting the tree out of the way.  (By the way, who of you carries a chainsaw?)Today, a friend of ours came over and helped Carl cut up our pine tree that broke in half. We both really appreciated his help. And I have appreciated your kind words and messages on the loss of our boy Sandy.  You've shared his loss with us and that has provided a great deal of comfort.Finally throughout the stress of the week, I've been grateful for the comic relief of a little Scottie named Todd who has really, really tried to stay out of mischief.   Something Todd does really well when he's sleeping!  I hope you're having a good weekend!"},

And one of our beautiful pine trees was snapped in half.  However, there was no damage to our house, and for that we are grateful.  Through the storm, I was concerned about our foster boy Sandy.  He'd not had much of an appetite the last several days.  However, it was not that unusual, and he was up and about and was even going outside without any help from us.  Yesterday morning Sandy seemed a bit better and would wag his tail whenever I talked to him, which he always did.  I discussed everything with my contact at the rescue and together we decided that he should be seen by the vet. Tests were done and x-rays showed that cancer had metastasized throughout his lungs and his abdomen.  We decided that the kind thing to do was to send him to the Rainbow Bridge.  There wasn't much time for good-byes. As he lay there, I stroked his handsome face and as I spoke to Sandy, he wagged his tail.  I thanked him for coming to our home just 4 short months ago.  I told him that I loved getting to know the dog that ate ice like it was a meal and practically melted when his ears were rubbed.  I thanked Sandy for what he taught me, that his blindness reminded me to slow down my pace and enjoy the walk. I told him about the other dogs that we'd sent to the bridge that I was sure would be there waiting for him.  As I held his paw and he left this world for the next, I wished that we would have had more time together.  I hope that one day, when I see him again, we'll have that time.  God speed Sandy.  You will be missed and not forgotten."},

This is when I really put those annoying and trivial things (and people) that I can't change behind me, and focus on what and who are most important.Taking this time and early morning walks with the dogs is a great way to do that.  This morning I sat with the dogs as they enjoyed the newly fallen leaves. Josh enjoyed having his favorite frisbee.   Todd who wasn't with us on the walk, did what he enjoys most and that's digging a hole.  And not being one to miss a good opportunity, Todd took a moment and did another thing that he enjoys doing and that's chasing CC.  For me, it all works together to put things and life back into a much needed perspective.  I hope you're enjoying your Thursday!"},

There is also a new alliance between dogs.  This week Todd and Charlie have found common ground to dig up. The two together have excavated several places in the yard.  Both being terriers, I'm not sure who is the better digger.Todd is better at not getting caught but the last round went to Charlie who was without question the dirtier of the two!

Carl and I felt humbled as we thought about our life there and the dogs that had found their way to us during the 10 years we lived in the house.   Below: Golden Pines 2007On Tuesday, we remembered those same things.  The house we bought in the country was only supposed to be a place to give us the room we needed for the dogs and the privacy I was craving.  But along the way, it has become so much more; it has become home.  I am so grateful to have the chance to bring the senior dogs to Golden Pines that need a place to go.  Yes, we've had many losses that have brought their own sadness and heartache.  But without a doubt I wouldn't want to miss out on the joy we've had in caring for and getting to know these precious senior dogs and have the memories of them.In remembering them, today I also want to toast the dogs that came with us from our last house and are still a part of our lives at Golden Pines.  They are: Wendy, who came to us in July 1999Josh, who came to us in 2002CarrieAnne in June 2003Charlie in July of 2004, Sheba, September 2004Here's to the next 5 years and the adventures ahead!"},

Of course, I could be imagining it. But I don' t think so because this is the second time he has torn up something that had President Obama's name on it.However we really do have things in common; a shared pool of beliefs and behavior, of likes and dislikes that we use to bridge our differences and learn from each other.And it all comes together to create harmony at Golden Pines.  I hope you're having a weekend with harmony too!"},

We were back home by  11 o'clock.  And after some time outside with all of the dogs, we have settled into a quiet day at home. Todd has spent most of his day outside, waiting for his next adventure to begin. He doesn't have to wait long.

These bite-sized delicacies begin as rich cake blended with creamy icing to form a moist, decadent center. The cake-bites are then dipped in melted milk or white chocolate and hand-decorated--I think they create a great twist on a traditional favorite. All my co-workers loved them! Outside this afternoon the temperatures feel like summer and is a home run too.  We have a number of hungry migrating birds around, and I almost missed this looper caterpillar looking more like part of a stem to avoid becoming it's own little (cake) bite.   Also this afternoon while we were outside Sheba brought me a baseball she found.  I've no idea where she found it, where it would have come from or how it would have ended up in our yard.  It appears to be a home run ball that's signed by all the members of the team, including the coach.  I wish I knew who it belonged to so I could return it.  But who knows, maybe it'll be worth something some day!   I hope you're having a week of 'home runs' too!"},

We've been playing a lot of frisbee lately. We actually used to play frisbee all the time.  Our girl Rudi that passed away last year was obsessed with it, and she made the game a lot of fun with her over-the-top enthusiasm. But when she was no longer with us, I just felt that the game wasn't as enjoyable without her, so we stopped playing, despite that Josh and Sheba really loved it.  Even when I would walk to the shelf where the frisbees are kept in the garage, Josh would always follow me there and whine in hopes of my throwing one for him to chase--Even Sheba would wait patiently for me to give her one too, but I didn't.  However, a few weeks ago, for some reason, I dusted them off and the game of frisbee began once again. Despite having at least six frisbees that are the same brand and type, both Sheba and Josh have their favorites.  When they have gotten left outside and we can't find these favorites, the newer (and cleaner) ones aren't the ones they prefer.  Sheba has two that she will play with, Josh on the other hand has only one that he really, really likes.  Sure, he'll chase another one, but there is no doubt that he loves and prefers the dirty, old chewed up, hole filled green one.  It has been his favorite for several years now.  I've tried to get him used to playing with a new one, but for whatever reason, it's just not the same for him.  He's happiest when he has the old green one.  I've decided that his love for the green frisbee is like an old pair of shoes--You love those old shoes, and even though you have new ones, that same comfy and familiar feeling just isn't there and it's not the same. I hope you've had a good weekend.  Below is a little twelve-second video we made this afternoon of Josh chasing his green frisbee--Sheba is there too, and the other dog with them is CarrieAnne.  They run past Toby and Lucas can be heard barking in the background.

Today started out early, even for a day off.  Our cat, CC, got sap from one of our pine trees all over her yesterday.  I tried to get out as much of it as I could, and thought maybe she could do the rest, but when I watched her try to clean herself, I realized that she wasn't going to be able to reach all of it.  It didn't help that Todd and Lucas found her new aroma even more alluring! I decided we probably should give her a bath.  I have to admit to having never bathed a cat before--But I have heard the harrowing tales of those who survived giving their cats one, and so I made sure that Carl and I were well prepared and ready.  With latex gloves, and long sleeve shirts to minimize the scratches or bites we were sure to receive from CC, we were ready.  The plan was to wet CC with my hands and apply Dawn dish soap.  The hard part would be putting her under the bathtub facet to rinse her off.  We started and CC was so calm and seemed to like my running my fingers through her coat.  When it looked like the sap was all broken down, it was time for the rinse.  I turned on the water, gave Carl his final instructions and we were ready.  Since this whole thing was my idea, and knowing that the wrath of a wet and unhappy cat was going to be upon us, I decided that Carl should have the job of holding CC--He naively willingly agreed.  So, I poured the water on her, and CC had no objection.  We finished rinsing her off under the faucet and she continued to not struggle at all.  We dried her off, set her down and she immediately went to the kitchen and demanded her breakfast.I have to admit to being more than a little surprised by what had just happened. But in thinking about it, I realized that I should have known that CC having lived in a multi-dog household for 11 years has given her nerves of steel, and she can coolly and calmly handle anything, even a bath!   Nevertheless, it all just seems so un-cat-like, don't you think?"},

Once back home, the dogs played while I took a few pictures. Josh found his old frisbee that has been missing for some time.  It's times like that, I wish he could talk so I could ask him where he found it.I found this yellow garden spider.  Did you know, the zig-zag reflects UV light and is meant to warn birds and deer (and us) that the web is there, so it's not crashed into?  I appreciate those warnings! Sheba and Todd found great fun in a good game of ball.Afterwards, when the rain rolled in everyone found a good place for a nap!~Sheba~I hope you've found yourself enjoying your Saturday!!~Annie~"},

But just like the dogs, she didn't seem to mind ...  Trying to get everything done does take a lot of time.  We try to stick to a schedule and together Carl and I get the dogs fed around 8 o'clock in the evening. Even though they always get a snack when either Carl or I get home, it's still more 12 hours since their previous meal.  Last night they didn't get their snack or dinner until about 9 o'clock--They didn't seem to mind ... Today I'm grateful for the easy going nature of our crew.  And even though things may be out of sync this week, they don't seem to mind..."},

But I have to admit that when 4 o'clock rolled around and I'd not heard from my vet, I started to get really nervous. Thankfully about an hour later I got the call I had been waiting on letting me know that Carrie was doing  just fine; and although it was a very long surgery (more than 3 hours) she had no problems whatsoever with the anesthetic--This was because of the detailed notes made by my previous vet, the anesthesia was given differently which made all the difference.  Two hours later, I was picking up a very woozy CarrieAnne. She had a good nights sleep and after a slow start this morning by this afternoon CarrieAnne was enjoying time outside with all of us.  This evening she ate her entire meal. I do have to think that she's doing well in part due to the gift given to her by the Tooth-Fairy which was pain medications--What a nice gift! One thing I've never mentioned before is that CarrieAnne had a sister named Lucy that she was very, very bonded to and who was very protective of Carrie.  Lucy waits for CarrieAnne at the Rainbow bridge, and it's days like yesterday, that I have to think that Lucy is still there watching over her sister, making sure she's okay--With that and all of your good thoughts and prayers, there really was no way that CarrieAnne's surgery could not have turned out 'okay.'"},

To start our day, since I was already feeling guilty for not being at work, I decided that I would just add to those feelings and have a guilt-filled breakfast.  So Josh, Charlie, Sheba and I got into my van...And crossed the Potomac River into Maryland... And went to the only place that you can buy guilt on a dollar menu...Guilt or not, it's good to be home today!I'm feeling a bit more like myself already.  I hope you're enjoying your Tuesday!~Annie~"},
{"title": "Not the Best", "date": "Sunday, August 26, 2012", "text": "A busy and hectic weekend for us to get ready for company coming at the end of the week, and Carl getting ready to go out of town.  Yesterday we cleaned every area rug in the house and put them onto the porch railing to air out and finish drying.  While we were gone to church this morning heavy storms drenched every one of them.  We've used a wet-dry vac and hope they'll dry and not be ruined.On Wednesday CarrieAnne is having surgery to remove a cracked and broken canine. It goes without saying that I'm worried about her having this done--Worried because five years ago she had surgery to remove a growth and my vet at the time told me CarrieAnne had a very difficult time waking up from the anesthesia.  Of course remembering that makes me uneasy, but I don't know that there's a choice given the condition of the tooth. Sandy's weekend hasn't been the best.  Friday and Saturday he was restless and panted and paced throughout the night.  When he would lay down, he'd start a high-pitched barking that was almost non-stop.  Today he seems comfortable and has slept almost the entire day and we had to wake him for his evening meal.  Sandy is storm-phobic and I'm wondering if Sandy's restlessness could have been brought on by the change in weather the last couple of days? My own weekend hasn't been the best.  Yesterday I took a break to take pictures of butterflies that were on a thistle on the edge of our yard.  I guess my presence wasn't welcomed because something stung me making my hand swell up like a balloon.  But I did get some good pictures ...Speaking of butterflies, today after the storm there was a beautiful swallow tail that had gotten drenched and was in the grass of our yard.  I gently picked it up and showed Todd thinking that he would be curious about the insect that was crawling on my hand...Instead of being curious, he ate it--I guess sometimes you have to eat something to get an appreciation for its beauty...I hope you had a good weekend!!"},
{"title": "A Gain for Lucas and a Loss for Sandy", "date": "Thursday, August 23, 2012", "text": "I've been plagued with time consuming and very frustrating (!!!) problems with my blog all week. But I'm hopeful that the blogger-guru-gods have solved them for me--All paws and fingers are crossed, that they have. Along with trying to solve the issues with my blog's reading list, the week started off in high gear with Sandy and Lucas at the vet for rechecks from appointments a month ago. Lucas loved going to the vet!  This was only because the free entertainment in the waiting room was a cat that wasn't CC, and he got to bark at it.  Can someone tell me why you would ignore the signs posted throughout the office to have your cat crated while waiting, not sit in the 'cat waiting area' and then get upset when a strange dog starts barking and scaring your cat?  I'm afraid I just don't understand...But Lucas got a good report in that he's gained about 5 pounds and I'm hopeful that when the test results come back in a few days, that infection will be cleared up.On the flip-side there was Sandy.  At his last appointment he was diagnosed with glaucoma so we rechecked his eye pressure.  Good news for him in that the medications seem to be working, making us hopeful that no other treatment will be needed for his eyes.  Sandy also started thyroid medication when he was diagnosed with being hypothyroid--At his last appointment he weighed in at a portly 120 pounds.  This appointment Sandy weighed in at a trimmer 99.9 pounds!  Of course we're concerned we may have over corrected the problem with his thyroid, but we'll see.  To me, no matter what his size, I think he's always going to remind me of a bear.  Not only does Sandy make noises like one, but when he rubs along our fence, (photos below) I think he looks a bit like one too, don't you think? Sandy is totally confident finding his way around our house and yard and I find myself forgetting that he can't see.  Today marks his being with us for exactly two months.  When we first met Sandy, he wouldn't take any treats from my hand, no matter how good it may have smelled to him.  Now he takes everything and anything, and I find myself humbled by his trust. I'm so, so glad that my blog issues are resolved, and I'm looking forward to enjoying my day off catching up with your news and things around the house.  Enjoy your Thursday!!"},

I've just decided to just let them eat them because the stink-bugs will get them if they don't.~Josh and Sheba raiding the pear tree~This morning Josh took off in the direction of the pear tree and I immediately heard his signature howling and barking and I knew he'd seen something.  I started after him and walked right through a spider web. As I furiously swatted at the sticky threads that were all over my face, I knocked my glasses off in the process. In the darkness and tall grass I couldn't see them and decided to leave them to retrieve Josh.  His barking had stopped and with Charlie on lead, and the entourage of the others following me, I knew going after him may mean I'd lose track of them in the chase.  So I tried calling to him.  I waited, and heard and saw nothing.  I called Josh again and waited...nothing.  I called again and waited....Still nothing.I got the other dogs back inside and grabbed a flashlight.  Fortunately I found my glasses, (in one piece) but there was no sign of Josh.  It was getting light and I looked for Josh in the direction I thought he'd gone and didn't see him. I decided to go back to the house and wake Carl up so he could help me look for him--And there was Josh waiting for me in the garage.  When he saw me he stood up and started wagging his tail.  His eyes were all sparkly and there was something so innocent about him as he was smiling and munching on his morning pear.Josh, Josh, Josh....."},

{"title": "A Terrible Week Explained", "date": "Thursday, August 9, 2012", "text": "It hasn't been the best week for me or the dogs.  It all took a turn on Tuesday evening when I got home and Annie, who up to this point could do no wrong and even if she did, it would be 'okay,' uncharacteristically started a fight.  I'm not sure exactly how it started.  I only know I'd just gotten home and the dogs were all around greeting me, I saw Annie turn on Sheba and it became a free-for-all.  I was able to break up the fight, but not before one of my hands was bitten several times, causing it to become sore and swollen. (Making it difficult to type) I checked Annie very carefully to make sure she'd not been hurt in the fight because she instantly become a real grouch.  I found myself scolding her that evening when she snapped at Todd and the other dogs more than once.  Her soft and gentle eyes even looked different.  Needless to say, I was very concerned about this sudden change.On Wednesday morning Annie wasn't putting weight on her back leg.  By the evening it was even more than apparent Annie wasn't feeling well when she refused her second meal of the day.  I gave Annie a really good once over paying particular attention to her back leg and I looked closely at her foot.  It was then that I realized that one of her toes was really red, swollen and sore--It all made sense now!  I think that this is why Todd has been so obsessed with her feet, this foot in particular, and why there was such a sudden change in her disposition--On Tuesday her foot was probably feeling tender and it must have gotten stepped on, starting the fight.  Annie's continuing to snap at the other dogs, I think explains why her behavior continued. At the vet this morning we took an x-ray and her toe isn't broken and there is no visible tumor.  We're hoping that the infection has not spread into the bone and a medicated foot soak along with antibiotics and pain medication will do the trick and bring back the lovely Annie that we are all quite fond of!!"},

Case in point is that lately Todd has gotten a bit of a toenail-chewing-eating-obsession and it's NOT with his toenails, but Annie's.As you may or may not know, all of the dog's love Annie.  Lucas admires her from a safe distance because Sheba defends and protects her.  Sandy can't see her, but that doesn't matter, if she's nearby he knows it and will follow her anywhere.  Even Charlie seems happier when Annie is around.  I guess given all that attraction to Annie it may just make sense that Todd would find something else to 'admire' about her. ~The Blonde Sisterhood, Sheba (left) and Annie~ I've no idea what to do because I can't seem to stop Todd from chewing and eating them, and so I guess all I can do is be thankful that she only has 18.Enjoy your Thursday!  Its another busy day for me and at at the end of it, if I can take the heat and the wait, I'll be hearing President Obama speak at an event in Leesburg."},

Thankfully the power came on later in the afternoon before I got out the paint! I finally was able to discuss the blood work results for Lucas and Annie who went to the vet last week.  The news for Annie is not the best.  If there was any good news, it was that her kidney values are unchanged from last month.  The bad news, is that her liver values continue to change.  We've put her on a liver supplement  called denamarin which raises antioxidant levels and has silybin to help improve liver function.  Paws crossed that it works for her.  All this is a reminder that when our pups are taking non-steroidal-anti- inflammatory medication like Annie was for an extended period, that regular blood work should be done to to make sure they are not damaging their kidneys and liver.  Unfortunately her previous owner didn't do this, and sadly this is the result. The news for Lucas was mixed.  He has a high white blood cell count but where the infection is, is unclear.  He's on antibiotics for 2 weeks in hopes that will take care of it.  Lucas has been made available for adoption through the rescue I volunteer with, but so far, not a single call about him.  Even with the articles that have been written about him, no one has expressed an interest.  I know it's probably due to the limitations of his adoption.  Lucas as you may recall was a stray so he cannot be placed with young children because we don't know his history around themThen there is Lucas's never ending fascination and obsession with the cat.  He and CC still have their moments when she's had enough, but they don't occur as often as they did at first and she allows Lucas to closely admire her, which he does every chance he gets.  Our poor cat, CC, never gets a break, no matter where she is...~Todd and CC this morning~Enjoy your Sunday!!"},
{"title": "We've Got Rhythm", "date": "Thursday, July 19, 2012", "text": "~Toby~I don't know about you, but I’m a schedule person.  I like schedules, rhythms to my day and to my week.  When those are changed I end up feeling out of sync until I can get back into that rhythm.  Some people refer to this as 'balance.'  I try not to call it that because if you could see me on a daily basis, you'd know that's not what I have--Instead I go for rhythm.  Each day, each week and each month has its own rhythm.  It’s up to me to make adjustments and find the rhythm and flow. Our dogs are good examples of lives that have rhythm and they often help me to find it.  We do the same things each day, almost always in the same sequence.  This rhythm even finds its way into meal time.  When we feed the dogs, their bowls are all put down in the same order every single time.  Each dog knows where they eat, and will wait in that spot. Added  to their daily rhythm, our dog walker comes about the same time each day--On days when we're home, at around 12:30, the time 'Christy' usually comes, they become restless and want to go outside for a walk. The dogs know when it's time to play and when it's time to relax and take a nap.~Annie~I think our daily rhythm and has really helped the new comers to our household adjust--Sandy is the latest example of that.  Being totally blind he has had to make a lot of adjustments and learn a lot of new things.  THANKS to your suggestions, he's learned the rhythm of our routine.  Sandy knows by sound (and probably smell) when we're getting the meals ready.  And because we've taken him to the same place each time, he waits patiently in that spot for his bowl to be brought to him. Sandy has also learned his way around the outside yard and can now easily find his way back inside.Inside the house, Sandy easily navigates the floor plan.  Yes, he will still sometimes knock over a floor fan and get caught in the curtains or behind a door, but not as often as he did at first.When Sandy first came, I have to admit that I only focused on his being blind.  But he and I have gotten into that rhythm and I have gotten to know an endearing and affectionate senior boy, who just happens to not be able to see, and who has found a place in my heart and our home."},

So let me just show you how much fun I had and why I won't be stepping on that scale for a few days...It all started with dinner on Thursday that was deep dish pepperoni pizza.We were up early on Friday morning where we met another friend for breakfast.  As the rooster was crowing, we made our way to 'The Green Dragon' in Ephrata (in Lancaster County) where local growers, merchants and craftsman meet for one of the largest farmers markets in the area.  Most often I gravitate towards the fresh produce.  Not this time...I was drawn to the delicious and fresh baked goods offered by the Amish. Afterwards, because I'm a chocolate lover, a visit to the Wilbur Chocolate Candy Factory was a last minute addition to our agenda.All this and it was only lunch time!  This took us to the Tomato Pie Café.  With a name like Tomato Pie Café, there's a hint that there must be something really special on the menu that shares that name; and 'special' it was!  Tomato pie has layers of fresh tomatoes with cheese, that is flavored with basil and layered on a buttermilk crust that was a cross between a biscuit and fluffy bread--Delicious! I returned home on Saturday afternoon and we enjoyed a late dinner with friends. For some reason, I just wasn't that hungry......Today I'm making chocolate cupcakes for a co-worker who is celebrating 25 years with the practice where I work.  However I am finding that I just don't have the enthusiasm that I usually do for baking...I think we all know why that is...But I really hope you've had a good weekend!  Once again, I am looking forward to catching up on your news!  Enjoy your Sunday!"},

On July 3rd we celebrated 13 years with our girl Wendy, who is now almost 15 years old.  She was the second dog Carl and I got, and of all of our dogs, she has been with us the longest.  When I think of the years we've had together, and how embedded within our life she is I am humbled and grateful for that time with her.  So, today as a tribute to Wendy, I'm breaking the rules of the 'Sunshine Award' and am going to tell you seven things about her that you may not know.1.  Wendy is our only dog that will 'speak' when you ask her to2.   She never had an interest in chewing on bones, swimming, tennis balls or stuffed animals--In her younger days she was an energetic frisbee gal through and through. 3.  She is not a full-bred Golden and is mixed with Border Collie. (probably why she loves the frisbee)4.  Wendy doesn't like the other dogs (or us) touching her while she sleeps.  She'll give a single bark and a harmless snap to remind us to leave her alone. 5.  Wendy is the very first dog we got from a rescue which means she has known every single dog we have ever fostered, adopted and owned.  She also has known the 3 cats we've had too.    6.  She came to us with the name of 'Amber' which I changed to Wendy, my favorite character in Peter Pan.7.  I knew the first time I met Wendy, that I really wanted her.  We didn't get to bring her home with us that night, and I was worried that the foster home wouldn't pick us to adopt her--They did, and the rest is history! ~Wendy and our First Golden, Tod~So today, Here's to Wendy, the Jewel of Golden Pines, Cheers!!"},

Thankfully by late afternoon today the power company arrived to repair the downed electric lines.  It took them all of about 15 minutes to make the repair, and we had power once again.  YAY!!! At the end of the day, the house is finally cooling down and I'm feeling better, and I know the dogs are too! ~Annie~Even with the loss of all the food in both freezers and refrigerator, and still being worn out from the heat and the trip, I can honestly say 'it's good to be home!'It'll also be good to catch up with you and your blogs on Wednesday!~Sheba~"},

It's a slow process.  For his sake, it'll be a big help when he knows the routine and where things are.  After not eating anything last weekend, and trying everything to get him to, I added parmesan cheese to the top of his meal and he FINALLY ate on Monday morning!  It makes sense that a dog that is blind and unfamiliar with his surroundings would be tempted by a strong cheese.  As I mentioned in my previous post, we've never had a blind dog before.  So I really appreciated your advice on helping this very sweet boy learn his way around on my last post.  If there are any other tips that you would like to pass on, please feel free to leave them. The rest of the week is going to be a busy one.  Today I am off to Kentucky. All of my brothers are going to be home and I've not seen two of them in about 4 years and so I am looking forward to spending time with them. I'll look forward to catching up on your news when I return early next week! Enjoy the rest of your week!"},
{"title": "A Hole at Golden Pines is Filled", "date": "Saturday, June 23, 2012", "text": "As you know, with the loss of Sam, I've had a 75 pound golden-sized hole in my heart this week. While no dog could ever take Sam's place, the hole that was left in my heart and our house was filled with a 120 pound (!!) Golden named Sandy who arrived on Friday. It all happened so quickly.  Someone from the rescue called me around lunchtime yesterday and asked if I'd consider taking in a 14 year old boy named Sandy.  When she was reading me the information on him I have to admit that I didn't really hear much of what she said--Other than the original owner had gone into a nursing home and the daughter had been keeping Sandy in the basement and they were unable to afford to pay for food for him--And Sandy is also blind.  With all of that, of course I said yes.  Another volunteer for the rescue agreed to pick him up and meet me and by 4 o'clock I was on my way home with Sandy. It could not worked out better if it had been planned days ago. Our crew are seasoned pros at meeting new dogs, and meeting Sandy was uneventful--Even Lucas behaved himself.  I think he's in awe of his size; actually we all are, Sandy is a big boy! I've never had a totally blind dog before.  We've been showing Sandy around the house and this morning he found the water bowls on his own and his way to the back door to go outside.  He's yet to eat a meal, but I am sure that will change.  He and I are off to the vet this morning for a checkup.Afterwards I am hoping, hoping and hoping that I will have the time to sit, relax and read your news.  It has been a hectic and tiring week and I could use a little escape to your blogs to see what's happening in your world~Thank-you for stopping by to see what's happening in mine! Enjoy your Saturday!"},
{"title": "Six Words", "date": "Thursday, June 21, 2012", "text": "~Sam, left and Toby last Sunday~I would like to thank everyone for the kind and thoughtful comments that you left on the loss of our boy Sam on Monday.  It has again confirmed to me that the blogging-community of animal lovers truly understands how difficult it is to go through the toughest task many of us face—saying good-bye.  I will tell you from experience that it never, ever for a single moment gets easier to make those decisions or to lose one of our four-legged-family members.  I can also tell you without a doubt that there is so much comfort in knowing that there are people who understand how difficult the loss is, and hearing from friends and family (and even strangers) who offer their support really helps and is priceless. In trying to think of a tribute to Sam, I am reminded about a famous story where literary great Ernest Hemingway was challenged to write the world’s shortest story using only six words.  He is said to have declared his resulting creation his best work. The entirety of the story was:For sale:  baby shoes, never worn I decided to take up this same challenge and do a tribute to Sam, using only six words.  I found it to be a bit more difficult than I originally thought it would be, especially because I'm still suffering from a bit of a writers-block when it comes to him.  But below are the six that I've come up with for tribute to my boy Sam:Content, Confident, Charging Ahead, Remembered, MissedCare to share what your six words would be for that special someone in YOUR LIFE, past or present, two legs or four?  I'd really love to hear them and I think others would be interested too.So as the 'Chapter of Sam' closes, I would again like to thank-you for your kindness and your friendship!  Today as a real taste of brutal summer heat has arrived, I'm staying inside today and am looking forward to catching up on life and your news!  Enjoy your Thursday!"},
{"title": "The Battle Ends for Sam", "date": "Monday, June 18, 2012", "text": "Today dawned cool, gray and damp.  As a gentle rain fell this morning, I knelt next to Sam as he lay in the grass.  He'd been there for several minutes and was starting to become soaking wet.  My attempts to get him to come inside were met with resistance from him, but eventually he did what he was asked.  I wasn't sure what exactly was happening or what had changed because outwardly at least to me, nothing had.  But known only to Sam, something was different, because it was obvious the pain and his battle with cancer had become too much for him.Holding Sam's face in my hands I looked at him and pleaded and promised I would do whatever it took to help him, if we could just have more time together.  But another world was calling to Sam and I knew it was time to let him go--Sam had done what he always did--He chose what he wanted to do. There is so much I want the world to know about Sam.  Things that I don't want to be forgotten.  But tonight, I am flooded with emotions and as hard as I have tried, the words just won't come.  I can only give thanks for nearly 3 years full of memories with one of the most well adjusted, confident, self assured and independent Goldens I've ever known.Tonight our candle is lit to help Sam find his way to the Rainbow Bridge.  Along with being met by our pups, I am finding comfort in Sam also being reunited with his very first owner whose life sadly ended much too soon.  And as he and Sam cross the Rainbow Bridge together, I hope that Sam won't forget what he meant to us, and how much we are going to miss him.God speed 'my handsome Sam.'  You fought a good fight."},
{"title": "The Front Porch", "date": "Saturday, June 16, 2012", "text": "A beautiful Saturday morning to just sit on our front porch with our old and very slow laptop and write this post.  The door and windows are open, and it's cool enough that even the air conditioning doesn't have to be on.  The sky is clear and there's hardly a cloud in the sky.  In the yard the Mother rabbit watches over her family.  We didn't see her at all yesterday and we were a little concerned that something had happened to her--Am I the only one that worries about wildlife in the yard?  In an effort to keep the rabbits safe, we're not allowing the dogs into that part of the yard--But all of our worrying about her yesterday was for nothing because we finally saw her late in the evening.  Across the road I can hear the voices of the farmer and his sons and the mooing of cows as they move cattle into the pasture nearest to us.  Apparently the cows are not happy about the change.  The dogs really enjoy being on the front porch with me, watching and listening.  I'm glad that Sam has chosen to come out here with us.  A friend of mine who also has senior Goldens has insisted that Sam be put on more herbs--She swears that's what is keeping her 16+  year old going.  She is so convinced of it that she purchased them and had them delivered to us.  Thinking that Sam and I have nothing to lose, I started giving them to him.  I'm not sure what they all are, but I suppose that time will tell if they are effective or not. Today on my agenda is to look up blackberry recipes.  We've picked the last of them, and I have more than a gallon in the freezer and 4 quarts sitting on the counter and two more in the fridge.  There are so many and I'm worried they may go to waste.  This morning I've already baked 'blackberry bread' but would like to find something a bit more interesting to do with them. (Any thoughts?)  However at this moment the front porch is interesting enough and right now I'm not worrying about anything.Enjoy your Saturday!"},

On Saturday Carl discovered a nest of baby rabbits in the middle of our yard.  (I don't understand why the Mother chose the unprotected open space of our yard to raise her family)  But seeing the Mother rabbit sit in the rain watching over her family has a feeling of peace to it as well. The clouds and the rain even effect the dogs. After a very brief walk in the rain, they've all found a place and settled down for a nap, anchoring the house in peace and quiet.~Charlie~ Finally, thank-you continuing to remember Sam.  There have been a few changes the last couple of days, but he's still happy and going strong!   Below is a picture I took of him on Sunday, which was also my birthday. It made the day that much better to have him with us and being able to spend it with good friends. I hope you're having a good day too!I'm off work today and thought that on this rainy day it would be a perfect time to catch up on my blog-reading.  However an issue that I had about a month ago with the blogs I follow has once again started to reoccur.  I'm having a problem where some of the blogs that I follow are not appearing on my dashboard (or in goggle reader). I've posted 4 times in the help forum and get absolutely no response.  I've tried everything, signing in and out, clearing the cache, etc., and I even reloaded google chrome, re-followed the blogs that I know aren't there and they still don't appear--Nothing resolves the issue--I have to admit that I'm feeling really frustrated.  Does anyone have any thoughts about what I could do or who I could contact?  Can I just tell you how frustrating it is?  THANK YOU for your thoughts, I appreciate it!!Sheba would rather go outside and play than be inside, in any weather!"},
{"title": "Berries and a Bat", "date": "Saturday, June 9, 2012", "text": "The week ended as one of those weeks when, despite the uncertainty with Sam, things seemed right and how they should be.  With good weather this past week it allowed us to pick the bumper-crop of blackberries that are ripening faster than we can get to them.  Unfortunately many are going to waste. But I had no idea that there were so many blackberries growing on our property.  Sheba still cannot get enough of them!Yesterday Sheba and I went for a walk around our property and picked the ones along the edge of the woods.  One of the things I get most nervous about is seeing a snake, so I'm always watching where I step.  I should probably spend more time looking up because when I did, I saw a little brown bat clinging to a branch.  I backed way off and stayed just long enough to take a couple of very quick pictures. When we first moved here it was not unusual to see bats.  On a warm spring or summer night, shortly after dusk from our front porch I would watch their fluttery, erratic flight as they caught insects with the greatest of ease.  But the last few years we've not seen as many because of  'white-nose-syndrome' that is killing them in record numbers. I personally think that bats are a little misunderstood because of the myths associated with them--And I understand and respect why many don't like to have them around. But for me it was good to see this nocturnal resident, and I hope it has friends."},

A friend of mine in an e-mail asked me how Sam was doing.  I sent her a picture and said that I thought that Sam was 'riding a wave' and was doing okay. Being an avid surfer, our friend responded back that she was so glad that Sam was 'going off'  and explained that this is a surfing term used to describe a very good, consistent surfer who is surfing particularly well. I liked it, and thought it fit Sam perfectly; he's riding the wave pretty well right now!  Even though the left side of his face is swollen, and he's lost the use of his left eye, Sam seems to be comfortable and not having any pain. We're continuing to let him set the pace of this part of the journey.  He's up to going for walks with us, and is enjoying the bumper crop of blackberries that we've had every day this week. ~Sam enjoying his evening~I feel like at the moment we're in a good place with Sam.  Words cannot explain how humble and grateful I am for these days of grace with him.  I think this calls for another blackberry cobbler like the one I made for my co-workers yesterday.

{"title": "An Upbeat Note", "date": "Saturday, June 2, 2012", "text": "Our week ended with severe rainstorms. It was raining so hard at one point, the gutters were overflowing.  Just across the Potomac River from us, there were tornado warnings. I have to admit that I was a bit unnerved by it all.Todd thought he wanted to be outside while it was pouring rain, but once out, he just stood there, seemingly unable to make up his mind what he wanted to do.  He came back inside. The past week seemed to be filled with nothing but bad news.  Even the news for our newest addition Annie was not that good.  Her test results from her recent vet visit show she has kidney and liver damage that was probably caused by extended use of anti-inflammatory medication for her arthritis. A special diet will be needed for her. Needless to say, my spirits were at an all time low, my heart felt broken and my head was just spinning.  But I'm ready to begin the weekend on a more upbeat note.Sheba let me know this morning that the wild blackberries are already starting to ripen.  I hadn't even noticed them, because they're a little early this year.  Each year it has been a contest between Sheba and I and Rudi (who passed away last August) and the birds to see who will get the most.  Right now, Sheba is winning.It helps to begin the weekend with Sam acting like he's feeling a little better. He was barking and wagging his tail as we got ready for our morning walk.  He even enjoyed blackberries with Sheba and I and gobbled down his breakfast and Lucas's too.  I don't know how long we'll ride this wave with Sam, or even if it really is one. But the good notes at the start of the day has created harmony and peace at Golden Pines this morning.  Enjoy your Saturday!"},

We took Sam off of all the medications to give his stomach a break, and have restarted everything again this morning.  The tumor continues to grow and is affecting his eye even more this morning than yesterday.  The picture below was taken on Monday and seeing it today, reminds me of that.  I know that Sam's time with us is nearing its end.  But we all know that sometimes when we think that, it may not be. With the exception of what I thought was a bit heartless and a callus comment left this morning on my previous post, I have really appreciated all of your very kind, caring thoughts and support you have left for Sam and I. It helps more than you know and makes this burden a little easier to bear knowing that this journey is not being taken alone.  For those of you who think I am a 'strong person' to get through all of this and other losses, thank-you for thinking that, but you don't see me behind the scenes--The truth is, right now I am a 'blubbering mess!'  I don't know how I get through it all, I just know that I will because it's not about me, this time it's about Sam.    Enjoy your Thursday!"},
{"title": "The Sun and Sam", "date": "Sunday, May 27, 2012", "text": "Memorial Day weekend is the official kick-off for summer, and that's exactly what it is here in Virginia.  Hot temperatures and lots of sun have been plentiful all weekend.  The dogs have opted to stay inside where it's cool, only going out when coaxed and when they have too.  The only one with any real interest in being outside is Todd, especially if the water-hose is turned on.  On hot days like we've been having, I remember as a kid, playing in the sprinklers.  Where there was water, there were kids playing. At our house, it's Todd and it's just what Todd loves to do.Sam's vet visit on Saturday was not the best.  I've done a lot of reading about the oral cancer that Sam has. As I have found out, it's very fast growing.  I think that I have mentioned that the treatment for it would be a radical and very invasive surgery to remove a large portion of the side of his face, and chemotherapy and radiation.  In the end, it would (probably) only prolong his life for a few months past what he would have without it.  I cannot and will not put him through it.  So, with not many options my vet and I decided to put Sam on prednisone to try and get rid of the inflamation and hopefully shrink the size of the tumor to give him some comfort.  The side effects of the medication are outweighed by the relief that he'll hopefully get from it, but it will only be temporary.  My vet said that on the steroid he probably has about 2 months that should hopefully provide him with a good quality of life.  Without being on the medication, he probably would have those same 2 months, but would be miserable.  I'm hoping for a miracle and more time.  It's all I can do. Today Sam seems to be feeling a little better, which made me feel better too.  Its been a good day for both of us.  I hope you're enjoying your weekend!"},

While I was waiting at a red-light, an elderly gentleman was crossing the road and as he hurried across, he tripped and fell right in front of me--I watched him try twice to get back to his feet, but both times he fell again. I got out of my van to help him, and a man in the car next to me did too.  As we were helping him to his feet, the red light changed.  I couldn't believe it when the person in the car behind me impatiently started honking his horn--He also rolled down his window and started yelling and swearing at us to hurry up. The man that had fallen said he was okay (although terribly embarrassed) and he thanked us.  I took my time getting back in my car, but not before I smiled and blew a kiss to the man who was still upset that we were delaying him.  My gesture of course made him a little madder but I thought to myself how sad that he put himself above someone who needed help.I rushed in and out of the grocery store and as I was putting my groceries into my van, I looked down and there was a little Yorkshire Terrier looking at me.  I was a bit surprised and looked around to see if I could see where he'd come from.  I realized he was a little renegade so I tried to catch him but he ran off, through the parking lot.  About that time I heard a woman's frantic voice calling a name.  I went to her and found out that the dog belonged to her.  Pointing in the direction where the dog had gone, I got into my van and tried to keep track of the dog.  I caught only glimpses of him through the cars and traffic.  Because he was so small, I lost sight of him and his owner as well.  Another quick circle around the parking lot, and I saw the owner holding her dog!  I was so thankful she'd managed to catch him!  The dog was so hot (as was she) and I gave them each a couple of bottles of water and a portable dog bowl I had. She thanked me and offered to pay me for the water and bowl.  Of course I refused and started home, glad that owner and dog were reunited!   With the holiday weekend, traffic was unbearable--But I think because I'd helped 2 strangers, 'good-karma' was there and I found a way around it and got home pretty easily.  I'm hoping that tomorrow morning when I take Sam to the vet, there will be 'good karma' for him too.  The left side of his face has become really swollen this week and is affecting his eye.  I know he's in pain.  I've increased the dose of pain medication and it seems to help.  I'm hopeful there will be something that can be done.  Paws crossed...I'm overwhelmingly worried about Sam."},

And when flowers awaken from their winters sleep we know that spring has indeed sprung. But on nights like tonight, when I see the first lightning bug of the year it’s like welcoming home an old friend--One who’s been gone for months and now suddenly comes back bringing with it the feeling of summer!  As a kid there was always a feeling of wonder as I caught one of these little critters and then watched it slowly climb to the highest part of my finger, spread it’s wings and fly away.Like so many kids would do, I'd capture them and put them in an old jar (mason jars worked the best) with holes poked in the lid from the sharpest and usually my Mom's best kitchen knife.  Then I’d fill the jar with long blades of grass to contain my treasures. Of course at some point the lights in the jar would start to go out as the lightning bugs would begin to succumb to the lack of air--And with that, I’d have to release them on my Mom's demands.But it's nights like tonight when I have no interest in watching television or doing anything inside because there's a pretty good show right outside my window."},

When I finally arrived home this afternoon, I felt consumed by sadness for Sam and a few other things that have occurred.  But in a moment when I was almost totally lost in those feelings, I turned on the hose to water my flowers and Todd became excited about the chance to play.

{"title": "Todd and the Toad", "date": "Tuesday, May 15, 2012", "text": "There's a saying 'life is merrier with a Scottish Terrier.'  I have to say that I'm actually finding that 'life is hairier with a Scottish Terrier.'  I don't even know how to start in telling you what happened this morning...The day started out okay. But Todd, right away, was really interested in something by the corner of the back porch.  I just shooed him away from it, thinking he'd just leave whatever had captured his attention, alone.  I went back inside and forgot about it.  Todd however, didn't forget.  When I went out to check on him 5 or 10 minutes later, all I saw was 'foam' all over the backyard and all over Todd. I grabbed Todd and ran my fingers through his mouth to get rid of whatever was causing the reaction, but there was nothing.  I thought that his tongue looked gray and he was also coughing just a little bit.  I took him into the kitchen and shoved his face under the faucet and washed his face off and opened up his mouth to rinse that out as well.  I grabbed a towel and continued to wipe is mouth out and clean off his tongue and gums.     When I put  Todd down on the floor to get a better assessment of how he was, he ran away from me and messed all over the rug.  I had NO idea what he'd gotten into and I was really starting to panic.  I was also feeling the urgency to get him to an animal emergency clinic.  I was relieved that Todd was no longer foaming from his mouth so I gave him some ice and water and put him in his crate while I got dressed. No more than 20 minutes had passed since all this started, but Todd was looking better.  He seemed comfortable and he even ate a piece of ice.  With that, I decided to sit and wait and see what happened.  With the calm it occurred to me that he must've bitten one of the toads that we have around our porch.  I'd seen them last evening and had told Carl that we needed to watch for them because they are poisonous and Todd was taking an interest in them when they hopped. As I sat there with Todd, I looked it up 'dogs and toads' on the internet.  Sure enough, what happened to Todd was the exact thing that had happened to other dogs who had come in contact with these particular toads.  While eating them can be fatal, I really thought that Todd had only ingested their poison when he either licked one, or tried to pick one up in his mouth. Because dogs get sick immediately after direct contact, the articles said that rinsing their mouths out was the prescribed treatment.  It also mentioned that the 'episodes' pass in about  half an hour.  I was feeling much better and confident that he'd be okay, but to be sure, I called the animal emergency and spoke to a vet (that I happen to know).  Of course she told me to bring him in for a check and observation.  But because he'd eaten his entire breakfast and seemed okay I opted to take him to work with me instead.

With peace restored, Carl left for work.   However somehow in the chaos and trying to get Todd settled down, I hadn't noticed that Sam was missing. Whenever I call him he always comes.  I searched the entire house, the garage, and he was nowhere.  I turned on the barn lights and walked out to the closed gate and called him, no movement, nothing.  But when I shined the flashlight into the darkness, I saw him laying in a dark corner of the yard.  My heart literally sank and my knees turned to jello.  I went to him to try and get him to stand up and he wouldn't.  Of course I thought that he'd been injured by whatever was in the yard.  But I manged to give him a really good once over and saw nothing that indicated he may have been hurt.  What I did HEAR was his stomach really gurgling--Obviously he's eaten something that hasn't agreed with him.  He's since gotten up a drank some water.  He declined his breakfast but I'm hoping that it's just a bad restaurant review and nothing serious. He wants to be outside laying in the grass, so if it makes him feel better, I'm just going to let him. The week has been an extremely busy and hectic one with work and the county-wide food drive that I'm helping to organize. I'm really hoping that it ends peacefully with all in good health and spirits. ~CarrieAnne~"},

On Wednesday, for some reason anytime that Lucas got near Annie, Sheba began getting into the middle of the two, would growl at Lucas, and with that, Lucas would walk away from both of them.  This is something I've never seen Sheba do, and I can only conclude that 'the blonde-sisterhood' is just standing up for one another and sticking together!~Sheba and Annie, the Blonde Sisterhood~Leontien,  your friends, two and four legged at Golden Pines dedicate our first blooms of the season to you.  We send you comforting hugs and healing energy!  To send Flowers for Leontien click here"},

And what the vet and I thought was swelling from a root abscess because of a bad tooth and a blocked salivary gland is actually a mass, and given that he's a Golden it is probably cancer.  My vet and I discussed treatment options, but I was so stunned by what she was telling me, I just couldn't make a decision.  However I did decide to not do one of the options and that was to do surgery to remove the mass.  Because of its size, surgery would probably entail removing a good portion of Sam's jaw and at his age (about 13) I just won't put him through that.   To be told that cancer is going to take yet another one of our dogs that has been so healthy has me feeling really defeated.  When Sam needed to have his teeth cleaned and the 'bad ones' removed, something about it had me a bit uneasy.  But I held onto the thought that it would all be routine and that everything would heal, and Sam would be fine.  So instead of being able to put all this behind us, I'm feeling the return of a familiar ache in my heart when I think of what's ahead for Sam."},

Sadly, I don't think it's fair to Annie or Lucas if he can't get his hormones in check.  If he cannot in a couple of days, I will have to ask the rescue to find another home for her.  I hope this doesn't happen because I am totally smitten with a beautiful blonde Golden named Annie who when I look at, reminds me of my beloved girl Kasey--And whose eyes I look into and want to get to know better."},

With the confirmation that Sam needs surgery, I was feeling a bit down.  When we got home it helped to sit on the porch and soak up the warmth of afternoon sun with the dogs and recharge my batteries.

On our morning walk there was a different air about him as he lagged behind and wouldn't listen when I called to him. I lost sight of him when I entered the woods to go around the barn.  Toby took that moment to go on an adventure.  Maybe he caught the scent of the turkey that has been around, or the other animals that are everywhere.

When I arrived home from work, outside it all seemed as it should be.  But inside, it wasn't. When I went inside, the dogs seemed agitated about something, and I know it may sound silly, but I remember thinking that they seemed relieved that I was home.  Todd who is crated during the day was practically hysterical and he wouldn't stop barking.  I got everyone outside, and CarrieAnne went over to the neighboring field and just stood there and wouldn't come back. The dogs really seemed out of sync and kept coming to me for reassurance.  We played a round of frisbee and I took a few pictures.  Eventually the dogs seemed relaxed and content.   It wasn't until we came back inside that I realized that in 3 different rooms, the screens were off the open windows. With such nice weather I have been leaving them open during the day; someone had obviously tried to get into the house through one of them while we were gone. While we joke that the only way the dogs would hurt anyone is if they fell over them, they still would have all barked at anyone that came near the house.  I think this does explain why the dogs seemed out of sorts when I got home.  I called our dog-walker who said 'everything and the dogs seemed fine' when she came.  Even though there was no break-in, nothing missing etc., at her urging that it should be reported, I phoned our Sheriff's office. They said they would patrol our road and for us to take note of anything or anyone unusual.  I feel really safe where we live, but I do take this seriously and will of course make sure windows etc., are closed and locked when we're away.  But I hope that with all of our dogs, we'll be the only 'unusual' thing on our road."},

Walking in the fog is one of my favorite experiences. I think the closeness of the fog creates surprises because even on familiar paths you can see something new....This morning I noticed freshly spun spider webs all around that seemed to just glisten.  The bright yellow of the forsythia seems to glow against the grayness.    I also notice on mornings like today there is the lack of an echo. Even the sound of the gravel crunching under our feet as we walk down the drive way didn't seem to go far.The only thing that seems to have 'gone far' is Todd's favorite toy, red ball.  Its been a really tough toy that he has played and played and played with, and not chewed up. We have looked everywhere and it appears to be nowhere.  Maybe it's lost in the fog..."},
{"title": "The Day-Care Dilemma", "date": "Thursday, March 15, 2012", "text": "Incredible - There were 400 record highs set or tied across the US yesterday.  Some of the warmest weather so early in the season EVER in parts of the Midwest.  And the warmth is predicted to last for several more days.  The continued streak of warm weather means the famed cherry blossoms in  the nation's capital will now peak a week earlier than originally predicted.  All around us, trees are blooming, birds are singing, the dogs are shedding and my allergies couldn't be worse--I am really enjoying every minute of it!  -Tulip-Magnolia tree blooming near my office-This morning I took Todd for another evaluation at a second-day care.  The place I took Todd last Thursday is located in the town where I live.  Along with boarding dogs, they do have a day care.  It's an older facility, clean and well kept. They keep the dogs on a regular schedule with play in the morning and are kenneled for an hour at noon.  Weather permitting, in the afternoon they play in the outside areas. In the heat of summer, they will sometimes set up pools for the dogs to cool off in.  The day ends between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon and the dogs are crated until the owners come to pick them up.  Knowing that Todd would be crated or kenneled for 3-4 hours a day was something I didn't really like.  There were a couple of other things that I didn't like, so I didn't make a commitment about his coming there.  Where we went this morning is the total flip-side of the first.  It's a 'Pet Resort' and that's exactly what it is, a resort.  The automatic doors welcome you into the large designer lobby with a hotel-styled front desk.  There is a gift shop, a pool and an agility course.  While your cat or dog enjoy their stay, you can check up on them anytime because there are live pet-cams in each 'suite' where they are staying, and in the day-care as well. There is a restaurant style kitchen with a cook to prepare any special meals that your pet may require while there.  And when they're all worn out from playing, they can have a spa-treatment to ease those tired paws.Todd felt right at home in the posh surroundings and turned on his charm as he was 'evaluated' in the day-care.  I watched from a viewing area.  They introduced all the dogs to him and towards the end, when a Golden was brought in they took an immediate liking to one another and started playing right away.  Of course since he lives with so many Goldens, I just thought it was just because of that.  But I found out afterwards it was one of his pals from the other day care where he used to go--Who said dogs don't remember other dogs?  There's not much to not like about this place. However my reluctance is only because they have very large play-groups of 35-50 dogs each day.  While their dog-to-people-ratio is appropriate, I felt it was too many dogs, because they do not have divide groups of dogs by age or size. I have a concern about the Great Danes, Mastiff's and very large dogs being around Todd. So, onto the next day care which Todd goes to on Wednesday.  It was recommended to me by a friend, so I have no idea what to expect, other than it's a smaller facility.  But as I write this, I have to wonder, am I putting too much thought into all of this?"},

Lucas is doing really well and it goes without saying that I'm glad that the surgeries are behind him. As you may (or may not) know, a dog has 42 teeth.  People have 32 which includes the wisdom teeth.  Lucas has had 38 removed.  It's overwhelming, at least for me, to think about that number. But it had to be done, and I'm thankful that he has been able to have the treatment that he needed.  You may recall that Lucas's surgeries were not inexpensive and the total cost has been around $5000.  I was told this week that all of his dental work has been paid for from a special fund-raiser that the rescue held for him and other dogs have expensive medical needs. This weekend you'll find me basking in the warmth of the spring sun, and in the reminder of the kindness and generosity of people who have helped to make a difference for Lucas. ~Enjoy your Saturday!!~~Charlie~"},

Winter has also returned.  Today it's bright and clear but we are having a blast of cold wind and temperatures below freezing, reminding me again how stubborn Old Man Winter can be about leaving.  Yesterday we had what the weathermen call 'conversational snow.,'  I've never heard that term before but it apparently means that it amounts to nothing more than a conversation.  Where do they get these terms? I was told yesterday that Todd's day-camp where he's been going for several months is closing.  I was so disappointed to be told that.  They were a top-notch place that truly made a difference for my shy, but energetic and playful boy.  It hit all the notes as far as care of the dogs, playtime, nap-time (can you believe they had down-time for all the dogs?) and the staff was the best. While its only been open for less than a year, apparently their closing has something to do with the landlord of the building.  I've decided that he was obviously not a dog-lover, because he made it impossible and very expensive for them to continue to be in business.  I really want Todd to continue to play with other dogs and be around different people.  So once again my search for the perfect place will begin."},

In the picture below on the left, Toby is looking at Josh the moment he started running.It didn't take but a moment to lose sight of him. Carl had the dogs on a leash so that left me to get Josh.  I decided that I'd cut him off on the other side.  Of course I am not as fast as either the deer or Josh, but I caught sight of him going into the woods on the other side of the clearing.  He had been totally outrun by the deer, and he had also gone totally deaf never looking back as he started the next leg of his adventure.  I went into the woods to get him and became tangled in the briars.  As I freed myself, I kept calling to Josh and a miracle happened, he regained his hearing and came to me, all sparkly eyed and smiles!!~Josh after his adventure~Of course I didn't scold Josh for running off, but praised him for coming back.  On the way home the words to the old country  tune \"The Battle of New Orleans\" which is a traditional hillbilly tune by Johnny Horton tumbled through my head,Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the bramblesAnd they  ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't goThey ran so fast that the  hounds couldn't catch 'em On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico...Now, even a day later, I can't get rid of it...Finally my mind is focusing on something."},

Getting it away from him proved to be a little challenge. I chased him through the house, and outside. Corrections and trying to bribe him with a treat fell on deaf ears.  There's no way to catch him; Todd is just way too fast and way too quick!  Then I remembered 'blue squeaky ball.'  I grabbed it out of the drawer and Todd immediately dropped the ear, and came running to me, anxious for his treasured toy.

I don't think she really heard what I said because the scolding continued.  Toby and I politely sat there, pretending to listen, but daydreaming of what we would do afterwards. Because of scheduling conflicts, this was the first time that my usual vet was meeting Toby.  She has taken such wonderful care of all of our dogs, and also Toby's companion, Bubba, so she was anxious to meet him.  We talked very briefly about his weight and moved on, discussing how he was adjusting to life without Bubba.  She knew I had been worried about him when Bubba first passed away.  I think how Bubba felt was mirrored in how Toby felt and acted too.  But he has started to blossom in the last month doing things I've not seen him do before.

Its been my experience that Golden Retrievers will believe just about anything you say to them...I am finding that Scottish Terriers do too.

Lucas's appointment went as expected.  The dentist, who I really liked, agrees that all of his teeth should be removed.  There is so much recession, decay, bone loss and infection around his teeth that nothing can be done to save them. The treatment plan is for Lucas to have 2 surgeries to limit the amount of time he will have to be under anesthetic.  The first surgery will be to remove the worst teeth, clean everything really well and treat what will most certainly be sinus exposures from the extractions.  The second surgery will hopefully be much easier, shorter and would be done in about 4-6 weeks.  I've scheduled the first surgery for next Wednesday.  However the board of the rescue has to approve the treatment and its cost which will be around $5000. (about £3,200 or € 3,804)  I spoke to the medical coordinator of the rescue last evening, and there were a few questions from board members about alternative and less expensive ways to treat his periodontal disease.

Their little boy will quickly outgrow them, but are needed none the less.  Below is a picture from when they went to meet the puppies.   For dinner we ate a beautiful restaurant called 'Clydes of Willow Creek.'  The food is amazing and the setting is stunning.  The restaurant itself has a story to tell.  A restaurant group purchased a series of antique heavy timber structures, dating back to as far as 1780, that had been destined for the wrecking ball. These structures were photographed, labeled, disassembled, preserved, and stored for later restoration.  These four original antique buildings, have now been connected, and restored and represents the classic American Inn.  It boosts paintings of the hunt country, classic carriages and buggies and early American artwork along with other reproduced ells from the early days of our country.Included within the restaurant is a structure known as 'The Chandler Barn, which was built c.1885. This amazing Victorian beauty has two elliptical cupolas, and was originally built for hay, feed, and stock. (The below picture is taken from their website)It really is a lovely place to enjoy with our friends and spend a Saturday evening!  I hope you've had a good weekend too!~Sheba~"},

Of course there were occasional meals out, but for the most part, everything was homemade. And in thinking about it, I don't remember eating many pre-made meals  at all and when we did, it was a real treat!  But that was my Mom. And even though I enjoy cooking I'm just not an everyday-from-scratch-cook. With a busy hectic schedule, especially during the week, I rely  on frozen or prepared food and a microwave oven.  Unfortunately on Sunday, our  microwave stopped working.  I thought we'd be just fine.  But I found that when  I would open the cupboards to look for something to make for dinner, there would only be unopened cans and boxes staring blankly back at me.  I was a bit bewildered because I couldn't cook or thaw anything that required the use of the microwave.  In my mind everything in my freezer was now going to waste and collecting freezer burn.   Then there was the moment when I realized that we were not even able to have a  favorite treat--microwave popcorn. Oh the perplexity of it all.....!!...~Lucas~ But then, something unexpected happened...I rekindled my love affair  with.....the stove-top!  Yes, you read that right, in the midst of my despair over  not having a microwave, I discovered that the multi-functional stove-top can revitalize leftovers with the twist of a knob and heat up soup in minutes.  Then there was an unexpected bonus when I discovered it can even make a grilled  cheese sandwich!  Okay, I already knew it could do that--But what I did realize that using the stove-top is like so many other good things in life that just take a little time. ~Todd at day-camp this week~As you can tell, all is well here this week at 'Golden Pines' and I hope it is for you too!  I look forward to catching up with your blogs today, after I buy some 'Jiffy Pop Popcorn!'   ...do they still sell Jiffy Pop??~Wendy~"},

I don't know about you, but for me, there's something about having a name in a recipe that tells you immediately that whatever it is, it's going to be good!  At least this is what I think when I see a recipe with 'My Grandmother's' or 'Mrs ---' in its name.  I just feel like I should automatically trust the recipe, and make it right then.  I also feel this way about church cookbooks.  But this is exactly what I thought about a cookie recipe I came across called 'Mrs. Siggs Snickerdoodles.'  I don't know who Mrs. Sigg is, but she she had a pretty good (and easy) recipe for snickerdoodles!  Because I am a bit of a chocolate person, especially on days like today, it takes a lot for me to make something without chocolate in it somewhere.  But I made them yesterday and for whatever reason, we just didn't seem to have enough, so I baked them again today.  It just seemed like the thing to do.  There were no complaints from Carl. ~CarrieAnne~When I wasn't baking, I tried to spend as much time as I could outside with the dogs. They really do enjoy even the smallest amount of snow.  However, I'm really hoping for more. ~Sheba~But like the cookies, what we have will just have to do for now.  Its been good enough for the weekend.  I hope you've had a 'good enough' weekend too!"},

Each day we learn something new about Lucas.  Look closely at the below picture, and the awkwardness of what is his favorite sleeping position.   We've also learned that he must have had a career harassing cats.  His continued interest in our cat CC goes well past curiosity and is more like stalking.  Even though I don't think he would (or could) hurt her, we keep an eye on him, and she does too. A belated Christmas gift arrived from Carl on Friday, which was a new camera!  While I really love the one I have been using, I have to admit that the new one, which is my first 'DSLR' is going to be fun to learn to use. However, the lens it came with doesn't have the 'zoom' that my old one has.  So until I can save up enough pennies or sell a kidney (or both) to buy one, I'll be using them both  The pictures above were taken with my 'old camera.'

Lucas is getting along well with the other dogs and is right in with the crowd for treats (which he swallows whole) and mealtime.  It has been a bit of trial and error but I have finally found the right combination of a dehydrated food, mixed with canned that he likes and is able to eat with just a little help from me.  All in all, he really has settled in very nicely this week!  He will come and sit next to me and put both front paws on my leg, look at me and wag his tail.  Needless to say, it melts my heart.  But I think he knows he's going to be okay. ~Todd & Lucas~Enjoy your Thursday!"},
{"title": "Family Treasures", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2012", "text": "My last Uncle passed away this week at the age of 90.  Even though I'm very sad about his loss, there is comfort in knowing that he had a good long life. And even despite a few health problems, he was lucky to be able to continue living at home with his wife (my Aunt of course) of more than 60 years.  My Uncle's passing reminded me that he and my two remaining Aunts are truly a connection to other family members, my past, my childhood and my Mother.  They are what I consider our 'family treasures.'  With the arrival of Lucas this week, I have thought a lot about 'family treasures.'  He is as you know a senior dog, about 12 or 13 years old.  To many, Lucas would be considered a family treasure.  One that would be looked after, worried about and cared for.  But he wasn't...Or was he? I was contacted by someone from the rescue that Lucas's owner had come forward late on Friday to claim him.  The shelter contacted the rescue and asked about perhaps returning him.  I discussed at length with the volunteer from the rescue about Lucas's physical condition--He's almost totally deaf, thin, and as mentioned, his teeth are in terrible condition (!!), and he's also not neutered.  While he may have been loved, I don't believe that he has been cared for or worried about.  This was confirmed when the shelter manager said that the explanation given about why he wasn't looked for earlier was because he was an outdoor dog and 'would be gone for several days, but always came home.'  The owner also said that Lucas 'knew about cars and knew to stay out of the street.'  My problem with that is that Lucas came from the inner-city of Baltimore, not the safest place for anyone on the street, two or four legged.However the question remained, should Lucas be returned?  He was held at the shelter for the required 5 days.  The rescue legally owns him.  However, when there are extenuating circumstances and owners come forward afterwards, there have been times when dogs have been returned.  But all things such as the owners explanation, the condition of the Golden and the life they would be returning to are all considered and discussed.In Lucas's case, because of the extensive cost, he probably won't receive the needed vet care.  He also would probably be returning to a life on the street, or maybe even tied up outside. Taking all this into consideration, it was decided and I agree that he should not be returned to his previous owner.  I know that some of you will disagree with this decision, and may find it 'heartless.' I respect those feelings.  But I feel strongly that Lucas should have the care he deserves at his age.  He should have a warm place to sleep and good meals every day.  He should have someone who worries about him, every day.  Lucas should have a home where every day, he's treasured."},

Arriving in the quiet country side of western Loudoun County, 'Elmer' was introduced to his new housemates.  His initiation was a 'smack down' by the cat, and a nip in the face by a tough-boy Scottie named Todd.  In the end, all decided that he was okay in their book, and could stay! As the leader of the pack, I have given 'Elmer' a new identity.  At Golden Pines, he'll be known as 'Lucas.'  We think it suits him.  He'll be taken to the vet on Monday where his tired body will be given a good once over.  He is thin, has some laryngeal paralysis, and severe periodontal disease.  The smell of infection from his broken, missing, loose and infected teeth and gums can empty a room.  Lucas is unable to eat anything other than canned food. There are other things that I could tell you about Lucas, but they can wait.  Right now he's sleeping by the backdoor because he's reluctant to venture much past the kitchen.  When I've gone into the kitchen, he wags his tail.  He's a sweet boy.  I wonder what his story is?  I wonder what his story will be?"},

I know that to some, it may not be such a big deal.  But when you don't have an extra key, the office where you work is short-staffed and everyone is counting on you to be there, and the only other person who has a key, in this case Carl, works 2 hours away from home, it turns into one.  Fortunately it turned out 'okay.'  Carl made the drive back home, and I got to work only about an hour late.  He decided to take the rest of day off because of something about not wanting to drive a total of 8 hours, to only work for about 6.  I guess in doing the math, it really didn't make much sense to go back.   Todd returned to day-care on Tuesday for the first time since late November.  He was so excited when he saw where he was, and he really had a great time playing with the other dogs!  He especially had a good time with a young Rottweiler named 'Lola.'Todd was totally worn out when I picked him up at the end of the day.  I was exhausted as well and we all went to bed early.  Today will be another busy day at work.  But I have no real plans for tomorrow when I'm off work.  Hopefully I'll have the chance to catch up on your blogs and things around the house. We've also been asked to take another senior dog.  He was stray found around Baltimore Maryland.  Right now he's doing his time in a local shelter, and is estimated to be about 12-13 years old.  His owners have until Thursday to claim him.  While I hope that his owners will come, it's good to know that if they don't, he'll have a new home to go to, which will be ours.  Stay tuned."},

Todd on the other hand, continues to be stuck on his own observations.Which are the turkey buzzards that have been flying over our house this weekend.  Each time Todd sees them, he barks and chases them. He's done this so much that now Josh and Charlie are noticing them too.  When they kept coming back, and flying so low, I began to get a little concerned that they might be thinking of Todd as a meal.  Crazy thought?  Probably.  But I looked it up, and read that they won't.  So I'll just let him continue his game as they fly and soar quietly overhead looking for their next meal.   I wonder how they feel about eating healthy?"},

You can see in the picture below, that Sheba also had enthusiasm at the start of the day! It really felt good to be outside in the fresh air.  I fed the birds and took a few pictures.  Once back inside, I cooked breakfast for myself and the dogs and tackled the laundry.  I then reviewed the list of things that needed to get done.

Today outside temperatures will struggle to  gain any forward momentum and the squirrels will also struggle to get the suet at the bird-feeders. Inside, the antics of a puppy bring warmth, as have your  kind, thoughtful comments on the loss of Bubba.  I have felt comforted as I have read each and every one, and have been so grateful to receive them. I cannot thank you  enough.    Toby seems a bit 'misplaced,' which is totally understandable.  I can tell  that he's missing Bubba.  For some reason, he won't eat in the place that he and  Bubba shared.  So, I've moved where his bowl is, and we are giving him lots of  reassurance as I know he is also mourning the loss.  Todd has been snuggling up  to him, something he's not really done before.  It reminds me of what Charles Schultz  who wrote the Peanuts comic strip once said about 'happiness being a warm  puppy.'  Comfort can be found in one too.    Today I have to return to the vet.  On Friday in the midst of what was  happening with Bubba, there was another fight between CarrieAnne and  Sheba.  Sheba's leg that had just healed was re-injured more severely this  time.  The vet was able to suture everything together.  But she's not very  encouraging because she's concerned that more surgery may be needed if there is  not sufficient healing--That decision will be made today when the bandages are  removed.  Over the weekend I've spoken with several  people about the  situation.  There is a single 'trigger' that causes the fights. And because we know what  that is and when it occurs, we will enlist the help of a dog-trainer to try and change and redirect  both of them.  We are also using herbal remedies to reduce any stress--Theirs,  not mine...Hmmmmm...Maybe I should try them too...   I found out yesterday that the property that is behind us now has a contract on it.  I didn't follow the time-honored southern tradition of having black-eyed peas for New Years, and I wonder what the year will bring."},

I wish I could explain it all to him, but as I mentioned yesterday, I think he already knows.  The day was a very difficult one.  Those of you who are 'Facebook friends' may have seen my update saying that it 'was the worst day I'd ever had as a dog owner.'  It truly was. With those events and the loss of Bubba and the six others this year, my spirit and the 'fragile circle' that I live in truly feels breached and broken.  I cannot remember ever being at a lower point.  This circle that Carl and I have chosen to live in, and my broken heart will hopefully be made whole by your friendship, family, and the good memories and times of the past year.  At least as the last day of 2011 dawns, and a new year is on the horizon, that's my hope."},

Not disappointed, and that task completed it was then time to jump into my lap to play the newest computer game which is to jump at anything that moves on the monitor.

It makes for perfect weather for taking the dogs for long walks. Bubba is becoming increasingly immobile.  More and more he is having problems walking and we are helping him to his feet most of the time.  Unaware of his limitations, he wanted to come on a walk with us today, so despite my best judgement, we took him along.  Once Bubba gets some momentum going, he does pretty well.  But on this walk Carl ended up with the job getting him home after he had difficulty walking through the tall grass. I know it wears him out, so I covered him up with a blanket as he napped afterwards. The dogs and I really do enjoy the walk up the hill in back of us.  The two 10 acre parcels that adjoin our property was put back on the market to sell in late October.  With 2 significant price reductions, I wonder how much longer we will be able to have it all to ourselves without feeling like we're trespassing. I just can't get enough of the view with the pond.I always look for little treasures on these walks.  Hanging on a branch today was this little birds nest that I noticed had dog hair loosely woven into its construction.  I love thinking that the dogs hair was keeping baby birds warm this summer.  The only one not worn out from the walk and all the fresh air is Todd.  In typical terrier fashion, he just needs a recharge of his batteries and ...he's already looking for his next adventure.  I wish I had his energy."},

We got a late start getting the dogs walked this morning.  At the very back of the pack was Wendy who unexpectedly decided she wanted to come along with us.  Because of her arthritis, she very rarely goes on walks with us anymore,.  Instead Wendy tools around the yard and will roll in the grass or just soak up an incredible world of  scents that I will never know.  Eventually she'll go back to the house to wait for us to return. Carl and the other dogs were a little ahead of us, so I waited for Wendy who will sometimes decide to wander off in another direction.  At more than 14 years old, and having been with us the longest, she is the matriarch of the pack.  Because of her position, I really believe that Wendy feels that she is my equal.  Yes, she's indeed right about that.  This may explain why she pretty much goes where she wants to, does as she pleases, and returns to us when she's ready. I found that this morning was a rare, special time with just the two of us.  She and I don't have many walks alone these days.  Several times, she stopped for a moment to rest.  I told her to take her time, and as she always does, she looked at me like she totally understands what I've said to her.  After all of our years together, I think she does.  Too soon our walk was over and we were back home.  A brief time to spend with my old friend, but such a special  time, and one that we both needed. ~Wendy in November~"},

In my rush, I parked  'illegally' to retrace my steps.  Thankfully the store had my card, but for some reason it took several minutes to locate the manager to open the safe and retrieve it.  When I came out, a policeman was just walking up to my van with his ticket book in hand.  I bombarded the officer with my explanation that came complete with a plea for leniency and goodwill since it's the holidays.  He bought it, and let me go!Re-energized and feeling lucky I was in and out of the grocery store quickly and on my way home; still feeling grateful for finding my credit card unharmed and for the kindness of the police officer.  I was up late last evening, but I finished my baking, made potato soup and wrote a few Christmas cards. Too tired to do the dishes, I left them overnight secretly hoping my luck would hold and someone like Carl or the dish-fairy would do them while I was sleeping--No such luck, they were still there waiting for me this morning. It was another early start to the day, but I got everything cleaned up, put away and a few packages ready to be mailed.   Then I was off again to our little (but new) post office to stand in line. Our 7-11 was busy too.  As this video shows, Todd and I were a lot alike in our 'running' this morning, I just wish I had his speed.  But with everything done for now, I've been able to sit,and enjoy a warm bowl of potato soup for my lunch.   There's a part of me that would kind of like to just take a nap,But I really just want to do nothing, look out my window at the birdsand read what you've all been up too.I think that's just what I'm going to do..."},

Even though she's wearing a 'comfy cone of shame' she had a partner in crime that I think, somehow managed to remove all the staples in her leg.  Todd wouldn't leave her wound alone, so there really is no other explanation as to how the staples came out.  Despite this little set back, everything is healing nicely.  However, from where her skin was shaved, its become really irritated and red from the clippers.  It's really bothering her and the vet and I think that her skin will either heal, or become hot-spots.  I've got medication to try and ease the discomfort I know she's having. Today I also picked up the second printing of our Christmas cards.  Long story, but suffice it to say that my 'obsessive compulsiveness' kicked in, and I had them redone.   I am also finished with work for the rest of the week. I'm hoping to get some of my cards written and packages put together and mailed.  I feel like I'm where I was this past Sunday when I was thinking I'd be able to relax.  I'm really worn out and tired and am hoping I'll get that 'do over' and the chance to relax that I didn't get last weekend.  Stay tuned!~Something about this picture of Todd made me laugh...~"},

The two had gotten into a fight.  Sheba had a large wound on her front leg that was laying open.  She let me wash the debris off, and I then went to check on the other dogs.  Todd was continuing to bark, and I was concerned that he'd been part of the fight too.  Thankfully he was not.  Carrie's wounds were superficial and didn't require much more than being washed off.  So I put Sheba into the van and took her to the animal emergency.  Almost 3 hours later, we left with Sheba having staples on her face, and leg.  She has other wounds that will only need to be kept clean. This morning they were still tentative around one another.  I left Carrie in her crate all day and this evening they are fine. You may recall that this is not the first time that Sheba has started a fight.  A friend of mine suggested that I think about re-homing Sheba.  Needless to say, I don't know what to do. There's a lot about this that continues to tumble around in my head.  But thankfully I don't have to do anything for now, except let the mending begin for all of us."},

Trying to remain focused on the tasks at hand, and not really in the mood for a parade, I only took a couple of pictures and was off again.  I was on a mission after all!

{"title": "At Last a Happy Ending!!", "date": "Sunday, December 4, 2011", "text": "Every single soft toy that we had has been ripped to shreds.  The best and biggest rope toys that have been around for several years, have been unraveled and every tennis balls de-fuzzed and chewed up.  The culprit of this dog-toy massacre was not the puppy, but Jasmine. From early October when she arrived, despite trying to hide them, no toy was safe as she used her Golden Retriever instinct and found them.  The rein of Queen Jasmine didn't stop there.  At any given time, her bark could be heard all over Golden Pines as she would let me know that her meal wasn't being prepared fast enough, treats were not as plentiful as she wanted, and outside is where she wanted to go.     The reign of Queen Jasmine ended today. You may recall that she was supposed to have surgery this past Friday.  However, there was a change in plans when Jasmine was all prepped and ready for a spay surgery and tumor removal, it was discovered that Jasmine had other tumors in her abdomen.  Closer examination and x-rays showed that there were multiple mammary tumors that should not be disturbed because if they are the cancerous-type it may cause them to spread more quickly. So, no spay or tumor removal was done, which meant that Jasmine was ready for adoption!  I called and discussed everything at length with her new family and took Queen Jasmine to her new kingdom this afternoon.   So tonight, with Jasmine dethroned there's nothing but the most indestructible of dog-toys left behind, and a bit of a sting in my heart because she's gone. I am going to miss her.  But I'm thankful for the time that Jasmine was here with us.  And I am especially thankful for a happy ending because a good and kind family opened their hearts and home to her.     Even with all the dogs, with Jasmine gone there is a different feeling in the house tonight.  Carl reminded me that this is the first time in a long time that we've not had a foster dog for the rescue.  I wonder how long that will last?   ~Bubba~"},

But I did.  There are some who wouldn't want a dog named Jake that couldn't always make it outside in time and would have accidents in the house.  But I did.  There are some who wouldn't want a dog named Jake around that kept to himself and didn't interact much with you or your dogs.  But I did.  There are some who wouldn't notice the little endearing things a dog named Jake did like rub his head on your leg for a hug or attention.  But I did.  There are some who while holding the paw of a dog named Jake in their hands, and petting him for the last time, not be able to see that Jake was just as handsome, just as dignified and just as perfect as the Golden Retriever in the portrait above him.  But I did.  There are some who wouldn't allow an old dog named Jake to break an already broken heart.  But I did.     God speed Jake until we meet you again at the Rainbow Bridge...Thank-you for being part of our lives for 24 days.  ~~Some of you asked what caused Jake to leave us so quickly.  There was really no final diagnosis.  One vet thought Jake may have had a small stroke and a kidney infection.  Another thought it may have been Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE) because he had many of the symptoms that appeared so quickly.  Whatever it was, because of Jake's age and already compromised and weakened system it was all just too much for him to overcome."},

Both preferred vets are out of town and we'll have to be seen by the vet I like the least.  I need to remember that it's about getting Jake back on his feet and not my feelings about the vet who I have seen more than once give my senior dogs a roll of his eyes and shake of his head.

You'll recall it had to be rescheduled when I gave him a teeny-tiny training treat last week. Also spending the day at the vet with Todd is Jake, our newest addition.  He's having x-rays taken of his heart and lungs and a couple of other tests.  Results were returned on a thyroid panel that was done, and it came back 'normal.'  What explanation could there be for his baldness and very thin coat?  Could the reason be as simple as a poor diet?  I have no idea, but I do know that I'm going to have to find my dog coats for him, because he's going to be cold this winter. Following Todd and Jake will be Bubba.  He's going in later today to have follow up blood work to check the level of seizure medication in his system.  So far, he's not had any seizures, so I'm hopeful that the vet got the dosage right on the first try. ~Jasmine and Toby~Then, last but not least Jasmine's adoption has been put on hold because she's having surgery next week.  I really wanted to make sure to cross my T's and make sure she was healthy prior to her adoption.  So I called the vet to  make sure a hard and lumpy quarter-size tumor on her belly wasn't an issue.  Apparently,  it is an issue.  Jasmine's initial test results were coming in at the same time Bubba  was having his cluster of seizures so somewhere it didn't register that aspirate confirmed that something should be  done about it.  But it may explain why I was a little unsettled about the lump  in the first place if  (when) the vet mentioned that it should be removed and biopsied.  At any rate,  I dropped the ball and feel really terrible about it.  But her having this surgery will ensure that she's healthy at the start of her new life.  Which is the positive that I need to keep in mind. I'm off work today and am going to spend it catching up on your blogs, which will also help to keep my mind off worrying about our crew.  I hope you'll keep your fingers crossed and positive thoughts in mind for Todd, Jake, Jasmine and Bubba.

But later I received another call asking about Jasmine, and was a little bit surprised.  Typically there are not many calls for the senior dogs.  But it was a couple with an 8 year old daughter, and a 14 year old Golden named Sugar.  We decided to meet yesterday afternoon in Gettysburg, (a 3 day battle took place here during the civil war in July, 1863)  The meeting went really well.  Jasmine responded the family and was so attentive, going to them for attention and ear rubs.  She really seemed to connect with them.  We had a very nice visit, and when it was time to go, I told them I would let them know by the end of the week if Jasmine would be going to their home, or Marilyn's--I honestly didn't know.  As we walked to my van, Jasmine seemed a bit confused about why they were going in one direction and we were going in another.  I think she had made her choice of who she liked and wants as her  forever home. I called them this evening and they were so happy!  Jasmine will probably be leaving us by the end of the week.  It's bittersweet because I feel kind of sad for Marilyn who has no one, and I hope she will understand that it's what's best for Jasmine. Finally, many thanks to all of you who entered the drawing for the book 'Pure Gold!'  I wish I could give each of you a book, but unfortunately I can't.  We held the drawing in our kitchen, letting Todd pick the name after we tipped the hat filled with the names.

We just  knew we couldn’t imagine the world without us together in it.  Like  most young couples we schemed, dreamed and planned our way into a picture  perfect future. But life doesn’t always work out exactly as you plan.  After graduating from college in Wisconsin, Carl went to Georgia for 'Officer Candidate School' while I stayed behind in Oshkosh. He was then off to Virginia to an advanced course, and the army then sent us to Alaska.  After a year of Carl being unemployed, he got his dream job and it brought us back to Virginia. Through all the changes and lost dreams new ones took their  place. And a partnership emerged that wasn't based on a pre-scripted end state  but instead a winding journey that twists, turns and entangled us, making us stronger than either of us would be on our own.  Carl has talked me off of ledges that no one has seen me on. He's stood up for me when I felt I couldn't defend myself.  He also calls me out when no  one else will, and believes in me when no one else does.  Too often spouses are unsung heroes, so thank-you for letting me sing the praises of mine today--Happy 30th Anniversary Carl! ~Sam~"},

I knew that he wasn't supposed to have any food or water, but I gave him a small training treat before I remembered that I shouldn't.  Not thinking it would create a problem, I didn't worry about it.  Well, it created a problem and the vet wouldn't do the surgery and I had to reschedule it for next week.  As upset as I was, of course I would have been more upset if something would have happened to Todd during the procedure because of it.  ~Yet another picture of a Tennessee barn~The next problem I had was what to do with a hungry puppy for the day.  Too far from home and patients scheduled, the day-care thankfully had room for Todd that afternoon.  So I took him to work with me for the morning and the shop where I buy dog-food gave me a small sample bag so I didn't have to purchase any.~And another...~This was just how the week went.  Whenever things didn't seem to go as I thought they should, something happened and they would work out another way.  Unfortunately I didn't realize that until I started writing this post...I guess I really need to work on being a bit more flexible...   I'm really excited that Jasmine and I are going to meet someone tomorrow morning that is interested in adopting her.

{"title": "Pure GOLD--A Book Review and Giveaway", "date": "Thursday, November 17, 2011", "text": "For just today, I'm switching the channel on my blog.  Sugar's Mom, from Sugar the Golden Retriever was given a copy of a book titled 'Pure GOLD' by Holli Pfau and she thought I would enjoy reading it because it's about life with  six rescued Golden Retrievers.  I really appreciated their thinking of me,  because they were right, it is a book I enjoyed reading!  I was also asked to  review the book on my blog, and the publisher will give a copy to someone else  who would like to read it.  So today, that's what I'm doing--My very first  review and giveaway!I will start by saying that I love to read.  But unfortunately these days,  I don't have much time for it.  But when I do, a book like Pure GOLD is the kind of book I'll slow down to read because it  inspires me!  The book is thoughtfully written about six rescued Goldens and how  the direction of Holli's life was changed and enriched because of them.   However, it was not only her life that was changed, but others as well through a  hospital program of animal-assisted therapy.Pure GOLD begins by telling about Nikki who came to Holli from a very  sad 'backyard breeding' situation. Because of Nikki, Holli becomes inspired to  pursue a new career path.  Along the way, Holli finds that Nikki has a debth  of spirit and wisdom that became her inspiration and the true cornerstone of what was to come.  ~Daisy, Chatter and Holli~As you read the book, one by one, Holli tells of her journey from beginning  to end as these Goldens find their way to she and her husband Walter.  Each one  that she opened her home to, had something unique that the other didn't.  There  was Bodie, who loved adventure and provided his own brand of care and comfort to  those in wheelchairs.  Tucker came next, and after hip surgery was able to enjoy  the life he born for.  Another Golden that found their way to Holli and her  husband was named Sophie whose spirit healed as she overcame phobias and fears  of a her first year living in a kennel.  Life as we know, can take unexpected  turns and a visit to the local shelter brought Daisy bursting into Holli's  life.  Her enthusiasm for life introduced Holli to rally obedience and agility.   Finally there was Chatter.  A true diamond in the rough that was suffering from  'emotional neglect,' Holli and her husband Walter understood her needs, not only  emotionally, but physically and patiently helped her to become the gem she was  meant to be!  I will end my review by saying how much I enjoyed reading Pure GOLD! Even after 10  years of being involved in Golden Retriever Rescue, I am always touched and  inspired by those who open their hearts to a 'second hand dog' (or any animal in need) by not only giving them a good  home, but because they look into their eyes and see the potential that is there and the love  looking back at them.I recommend this book not only for those who love Goldens, but for those  who love animals or an inspirational story with a happy ending!  Don't forget, if you'd like the chance to be in the drawing for this book,  please leave a comment by the end of this weekend and let me know!  To read more about Pure GOLD, you can visit the website here: http://www.puregoldbook.com/author-dogs/"},

In the corner of my eye I saw Bubba eating the ice (which he loves). I didn't think anything of it, and just let him help himself.  After I fed the dogs their dinner,  I noticed Bubba's teeth were chattering and he was shivering.  He was laying under a window fan, so I turned it off and covered him up.  Bubba's gums were pale and his feet were also cold and we had a hard time getting him to stand.  We put an insulated dog coat on him and got him off the floor and onto a dog bed.  I added more warmed towels and blankets under and on top of him.  Eventually Bubba stopped shivering, and he felt much warmer.  He seemed so tired and fell asleep, however, his gum color didn't improve.  I checked on him through the night, making sure I could wake him, and each time I did that, he seemed a bit more alert and responsive. (Probably wondering why I was waking him up!) But I've no idea why this happened.  I wonder if it could have been the combination of eating the ice, not having eaten, then being given a full meal and all of his medications all at once.  Could it have been a hypoglycemic reaction?  Have any of you had this happen with one of your dogs before?  Yesterday and this morning Bubba seems fine...Me, of course I'm still worried because, well, that's just what I do. ~Bubba~Other than that, while just a little bit behind because of being out of town, our week is off to a good start!  I hope all of you are doing well. I'm sorry I've not been able to visit many of your blogs, but I'm working on it, and looking forward to reading what you're up too!  Enjoy your Tuesday!~Another Tennessee Barn~"},

Tomorrow we head back to Virginia.  But today our goal is Ashevile North Carolina and maybe the Biltmore Estate.  We'll see where we end up.  Wherever we go, I will certainly be taking pictures of it.  Wherever your weekend takes you, I hope it's an enjoyable one!"},

You'll recall that the trip had to be rescheduled when Todd swallowed a cap from a plastic water jug in September.  There are no water jugs in the house this time, and I'm hopeful that we'll make it out of town.  I'm hoping to be able to keep up with your news while we're away, but if not, I'll look forward to catching up when we return on Sunday. I did take Jake to the vet last evening.  We did all the senior blood-work, including a thyroid test which may help to explain his thin coat and bald patches.  Preliminary test results will be in on Friday, the thyroid test in a couple of weeks.  He has severe arthritis in all his limbs, it's worse in his front legs.  We discussed his feet and he received a really good nail trim.  The vet feels that the problem with his feet could be congenital  because all 4 feet and all  his toes are wide and spread apart.  The tendons are really stretched, and all of this together makes it difficult for him to walk because his reflexes are delayed, especially in the  back, but they are better in the front.  I have decided that watching him walk reminds me of someone with scuba flippers on.  Jake also has a 'Grade 3' heart murmur and his lungs have a raspy sound.  As expected, and as you can see, there is a lot going on.  But my vet and I have made a pact to keep Jake going as long as we can.  Not just for him, but because we've lost 4 dogs in the past 6 months, and I don't want to make it 5.  So please, keep those good thoughts coming for Jake!!THANK YOU for stopping by, I hope you enjoy your day!!"},

My 'usual' vet has finally returned from maternity leave and he'll be seeing her on Wednesday, so we'll see where we stand medically with him.Tomorrow, as you know is the 9th of November--Todd will be 7 months old.  He is growing up much too quickly and it shows.  He's learned so much...He comes when he's called.He's learned to stay out of things. And he knows to leave the cat alone.Even though he's a terrier, he doesn't dig holes in the yard...He really does seem to listen and understand me...Todd is such a good boy!!Enjoy your Tuesday!!"},
{"title": "An Upside Down World for Jake", "date": "Saturday, November 5, 2011", "text": "In my experience I have found that people give up their pets for the most trivial of reasons.  I have also found that they give them up because they feel they have no other choice.  Financial hardship, working two jobs, Jake alone for about 15 hours a day, and a daughter requiring medical care all contributed to the reasons why Jake's former owner felt like she couldn't keep him.  She had asked everyone she knew if they could take Jake and as a last resort, contacted our county animal shelter.  They were honest with her, and told her that because Jake is 13 years old, he probably would not be adopted and would be euthanized.  They provided her with the rescues number and she contacted them.This brought me into the picture on Wednesday when I was asked by the rescue if we had room for him.  The owner was getting ready to go out of town, so a quick decision had to be made.  Where Jake lived was practically around the corner from my office, so using that flimsy reason to justify taking him in, I agreed and picked him up after work.  I felt very sad for the owner and we both cried as she said good-bye to him.  I didn't tell her that I was the one who would be caring for Jake, but I did promise to let her know how he was doing. ~Jake's paw~ As I mentioned on Thursday, Jake is not the most handsome of Goldens and his care has been neglected.  He is tall, lanky and thin.  His nails are really long and curled under, looking more like talons than nails.  Added to that, there is a problem with his feet and he walks on his wrists. He has a very thin coat and his skin is visible in places including on his tail.  There is also a large cyst over his eye.  ~The trouble maker~Meeting our crew did not go as smoothly as it has in the past.  For some reason Todd had an issue with Jake. He meets new dogs practically each time he goes to day care, and I can only guess that the problem started because he was crated when I picked up Jake, and couldn't meet him on equal ground.  The 'hostility' from Todd continued even after he was let out of the crate, fed his dinner, and played with.  Of course all of this upset the entire household, making it chaotic and very stressful for everyone.  I finally made Todd a 'Kong' and put him to bed. Even with Todd out of the picture, Jake continued to be a nervous wreck.  His entire 13 years of life had been turned upside down.  He paced, panted and had several accidents.  Jake had always lived as an only dog, walking on wood floors and not being allowed in the kitchen and never having to do steps.  Our house is full of area rugs, dogs and he has to walk through the kitchen to get outside and down two steps.  You can see why he was so upset and confused about what was happening to him.~Jake~Worn out and tired, we all went to bed.  I'm not sure where Jake slept that first night.  But the last couple of days have been better ones, and even Todd has gotten over his issue with him.  We're working on getting Jake to feel more comfortable coming into the kitchen. He's still reluctant to walk on the rugs, and learning the steps is going to take some time. But he comes to us for attention and will sit next to me and and we're seeing tail-wags more and more.  The last two nights he has slept on a blanket next to the bed--I think we're headed in the right direction."},

Last evening, I picked up a 13 year old boy named Jake.  Intros and settling in have not gone as smoothly as they have in the past.  He is really stressed and very nervous and confused.  I will post his story and better pictures tomorrow.  Jake is not the most photogenic and he's also not the most 'handsome' of Goldens either.  But he is really a sweet old dog, and he has reminded me that what's in his (or any) heart is what's most important. ~Jake~"},

Jasmine is on the mend.  However the injury to her nose got a little infected and she was looking a bit like 'W.C.Fields' with a big round, swollen nose.  Thanks to antibiotics, she's looking a little better today.  Toby also hasn't been feeling well.  I'd hoped it was a 'bad restaurant review,' but I think because its continued for a couple of days and his appetite is waning, there may be something else going on. I'm hoping it's nothing too serious.~Toby on the left, Jasmine the right~ It's a wet day here and the weather forecast mentioned that there might be some snow as colder temperatures and more rain arrives just in time for the weekend.  But for today, I've gotten all my errands done, and look forward to reading your blogs and keeping an eye on the dogs.  I wonder what Charlie is able to keep an eye on?"},

Funny how quickly things can change.  Getting breakfast ready for the dogs, there was a fight between Sheba and Jasmine.  Thankfully all Jasmine has is a bloody-nose and a sore ear.  Both dogs quickly forgot about their disagreement and as I write this they are sleeping nearby to one another.  Riley was also 'complaining' this morning, but we managed to get her to settle down.  But then CarrieAnne got after Todd for something that I've no idea about.  Even though he was yelping and whining and there wasn't a mark on him, I still felt bad for him.  But things are quickly forgotten in 'puppy-dom,' and let's not forget that he's a Scottie after all.

Judging by all the pictures that were posted, Mattie's first day at camp went well and she had a good time with her new friends!  Todd's favorite place at the day care is under this block, and on top of it.    Finally, thank-you again for the continued good thoughts for Bubba.  He's had no more seizures but I was really feeling pretty discouraged earlier in the week because for some reason he was refusing to stand up on his own.  But yesterday he was up and about and today he is as well.  I think he's going to be just fine, don't you think?!"},

For more than a year, Bubba has taken Rimadyl twice daily for arthritis.  Like phenobarbital it can damage the liver and the vet felt that his taking the two medications may not be the best combination.It has been a quiet weekend for Bubba and thankfully there have been no more seizures. Although he is still pretty unsteady and needs help to get to his feet, today he seems a little more stable and was able to eat his morning meal standing up.

The vet suggested starting him on medication for them.  Not liking the effects they can have, I felt strongly that we should wait, but I knew that there would be a time when Bubba would have to be on them.  The time has come.  On Sunday he had one seizure, another on Monday, another Wednesday.  On Friday he had 4 that we knew of. I took him to the vet after work on Friday, and I was given the prescription for Potassium Bromide.  It's often considered the first choice drug for any dogs with idiopathic  epilepsy, and because it has no effect on  the liver. Unfortunately the medication has to be 'compounded' and I won't be able to get it until Monday or Tuesday. Bubba is totally exhausted from the seizures and we're having difficulty getting him to stand. But he has a good appetite, and if we can all get our rest I think we'll be okay until then.  Paws and fingers crossed."},

{"title": "A Little Jasmine at Golden Pines", "date": "Sunday, October 9, 2011", "text": "You know that an empty dog bed does not last long around our house.  Today we welcome a sweet little girl Golden named Jasmine, who is 12 years old.  Her previous owner put her on 'Craigs List' to be given away.  Many of you may be aware that dogs that are given away in this manner are many times used for training dogs to fight, or sold to research. Thankfully there are people in rescue who watch for these ads and try to prevent this from happening and so someone contacted Jasmine's owner.  Even though she was a bit wary of giving her to a rescue, she finally agreed.   The owner told me to come this morning around 9 o'clock.  I did just that, and ended up waking them. Its been a long time since I dealt with an owner first hand and I've forgotten just how cut and dry these things can be.  They came to the door with Jasmine in hand, signed the paperwork, gave me practically nothing for her, and I was gone in less than 5 minutes.  I always wonder how you can have a dog for so many years and give them up so quickly and easily and without a single item that belongs to them that you'd like them to have in their new home.  But I suppose that I should have remembered to consider their reasons for giving Jasmine up, which ranged from the owner having a skin problem, to not being to take her with them to their new apartment. Regardless of the reason, Jasmine is a very sweet, small and petite Golden, weighing less than 50 pounds.  She's had several litters of puppies, and I think has problems seeing outside because she has stumbled on our steps each time she has been out.  Meeting our gang was uneventful.  Todd was very attentive to Jasmine, no doubt hoping he had another playmate--I think our cat CC probably hoped for the same thing.

I thought I'd give you an update on Riley.  You'll recall that she's the golden that came to us and needed extensive knee surgery.  Riley had her first surgery on Thursday, and below is the update that I received from her foster home.  It's pretty good news, and I continue to be grateful that she's able to have the surgery and a chance at a healthy, active life. Here is a portion of the e-mail from the foster home:    \"I spoke to Dr Walker earlier today, he said Riley's knee was one of the worst  he's ever seen.  Her condition was allowed to go on so long that the \"fix\"  wasn't able to be 100%.  If she had come in earlier, there was a chance that  surgery would have made her \"normal\" but as it is now, we're settling for a  compromise. The malformation of the tibia was so much that he had to do three cuts  instead of one, and the groove in the front of the knee where the tendon is now  laying is very deep, a little more than expected.  Riley's patella is now back in  place and her foot placement is 80% better but there was no way to make it 100%  better because of what she had to work with.  The pain Riley will  feel is not so much what they did  to her bones, it's the stretching of the muscles in ways they haven't stretched  before.\"I hope you will all send good thoughts and prayers for Riley as she begins this new chapter in her life.  She has one more surgery just like this one and a long, hard road to travel, and extensive rehabilitation which won't be easy for her, but it'll be worth it! I hope you're having a relaxing and enjoyable weekend!"},
{"title": "Sheba's Wrinkle", "date": "Thursday, October 6, 2011", "text": "As you may know, when you bring a 'rescued dog' into your home, you are accepting some of  the proverbial wrinkles that they may have in their personality.  Our girl Sheba is a dog with a wrinkle all her own.  She came to us at almost a year old in October of 2007 when the family who had young children, couldn't afford her hip surgery. I can only think that the kids were allowed to torment her, because Sheba in no shape or form likes young children.  Knowing this, I keep her away from them.  If anyone comes to our home with kids, I put her in her crate.  When I take Sheba anywhere with me, I am always watching so that we can avoid contact with any children.  It was no different today when I took her to the vet. When we were waiting for medications and our bill at the end of our appointment.  I sat in the far corner of the waiting room away from everyone.  Someone came in with their dog, a stroller and a little boy that looked about 3-4 years old.  The little boy smiled when he saw Sheba and took a step towards her.  I stopped him and politely asked the Mother to please keep him away from Sheba, explaining that children made her really nervous.  She replied telling me that she didn't believe this because all Golden Retrievers loved children.  I told her that 'this one didn't, and it was best if she just kept an eye on her son and made sure he kept his distance.' The whole time I am talking, I'm holding Sheba very close and I have her leash cinched up very short, and my other hand on her collar.  I could feel her growling.  When the little boy started jumping up and down and hopping in our direction, I tried to be polite and tell him that he needed to go play somewhere else.  The mother looked but did nothing.  Sheba continued to growl.  The girl at the front desk said something to me and as I stood up the little boy threw a magazine in our direction.  At that, Sheba started barking and lunging at the little boy.  Thankfully I still held onto her leash and collar and so I was able to keep her under control.  The Mother unleashed a barrage of accusations and threats, telling me that I had no business having such a vicious dog in public that was out of control!  I really tried to not show how upset I had become but told her that the only thing that was out of control was her son!  The rest of the incident is a bit of a blur that ended with the office manager (who had seen the whole thing) escorting the Mother and her entourage into a treatment room, and apologizing to me for their client.Sheba, I think, is really a lovely dog.  There is so much about her that is everything that a Golden Retriever is supposed to be. So even knowing this, why am I still upset about the reminder of 'Sheba's wrinkle' and why am I taking this all so personally?"},

I'm guessing that I was a little too late because there really weren't a lot of things left that I could spend my money on.   I did however end up with this. I'm not sure exactly what 'this' is, but it was only $4, so I knew I had to have it.  As you can see, it's a pretty good size, and weighs about 20 pounds.  It does have a hanger on the back, but I've no idea what to do with it--Any suggestions will be appreciated!   Last evening we met some good friends for dinner at a place I'd been hearing about not far from us.  It's called Patowmack Farm.  It has a stunning view of the Potomac river and bridge at 'Point of Rock' between Virginia & Maryland.  We felt like VIPs with customized menus, and other special unique touches.  The food is amazing and is 'farm to table.'  I had the 'Autumn Blend' as an appetizer, and 'Farm Beef Duo' as my entree. I cannot remember when I've had a more enjoyable evening out with friends! Back on the home front, we are STILL on 'puppy-doody' as we look for the reappearance of the cap that went to the water jug.  I'm starting to doubt that Todd actually ate it.  But if it's going to show up, my vet feels like today will be the day.  I wonder if Todd knows that...It's a new month and a new feel to the weather.  Our day is starting out with cold winds and clouds and some showers.  After a couple of errands, it'll (hopefully) be another quiet day at home, following Todd around.  I hope you have an enjoyable day too!~Sheba and Todd~"},

Words can't begin to explain how terrible and how sick I feel about all of this.

We've also had another 'subtraction' in our household as Riley has been placed in a new foster home.  The rescue has decided to go forward with the surgeries, and her first one will be next Wednesday!  I was a little sad to see Riley leave us, but I am so excited for her and that she's going to get the chance at an active and pain-free life!  The foster home that has taken her, is the board member that also attended the evaluation with the orthopedic surgeon.  I have known her for more than 10 years and she has cared for several dogs with complicated recoveries, and there is no doubt that she will be able to handle Riley with no problem--She also lives close to the vet hospital where Riley will be having her surgeries and doing her rehab; it could not work out any more perfectly! I hope you're having a perfect week too!!"},

{"title": "Update on Our New Girl Riley", "date": "Tuesday, September 20, 2011", "text": "Riley was taken to see the orthopedic surgeon, who by the way is the same one who did surgeries on Hamlet, our boy Josh and Sheba too. There was a lot to digest and I'm thankful that a board member from the rescue attended with me to try and remember everything.   Riley has, 'Grade 4 Medial Patellar Luxation.'  She was likely born with compromised knee joints so this wasn't from an  accident.  What we're seeing today is a result of tendons being too tight, that has caused her knee caps to move to the inside of her legs, causing her legs to draw up.   Over time, the quadrecep (muscle of the thigh most responsible for walking) has  tightened up and the tibia bone in the lower leg has become warped. The good news is, is that she's not in any pain, and surgery can be done to try and fix it.The bad news is, is that it'll be 4 procedures done in two surgeries, and 6 to 8 months recovery at the very least. The key to success with these surgeries will be the months of physical therapy afterwards.  This includes an underwater treadmill, cold laser therapy, passive  stretching, etc.  Dr Walker (surgeon) said that if the commitment can't be done to do the therapy, there's no use in doing the surgery.  It's critical because the muscles  need to be stretched and re-trained.  As I said, it was a lot to digest.  ~Riley during the 'dirt debacle' on Saturday~I spoke to the board member afterwards about everything.  I had to be honest with her and tell her that I feel stretched pretty thin these days.  I don't know that I have the time to be able to give Riley all that she will need.  I feel like it's her one chance to have a good healthy and active life, and I don't want to short-change her.  Of course I feel guilty, but this isn't about me, it's about giving Riley all the time and the dedication she deserves.  I'm hopeful that the board member understood.  Finally, some of you asked about where the money will come from to pay for Riley's surgeries.  When we bring dogs into our home, we pay for all their food, etc.  But anything beyond that, like these surgeries, the rescue will pay for. The rescue that I work with is a large 5 state rescue that has generous donors and vets who give the rescue a discount for treatment.  Riley will be no exception.  The surgeon has offered to discount his service, and all of her physical therapy will be discounted as well.  (The rescues total cost for Riley will be around $10,000)Riley has settled in nicely here.  But I do think that she will and should be moved to another foster home.  But until the Board of Directors of the rescue decides what to do, and who should take her, she'll be just fine here, living in the 'group home!'   ~In Our Yard on Sunday~"},

{"title": "The Arrival of a Girl Named Riley", "date": "Tuesday, September 13, 2011", "text": "~Toby celebrating the return of the internet! ~As you can see, our internet (and our land-line) have been repaired and I can once again step away from my world and take a peak into yours.  I've really missed reading about what you're up to and I look forward to catching up!   It has been a busy few days and there has been a lot going on.  I was asked by the rescue on Friday if I would consider taking a new foster dog.  I have to be honest and say that I've really been trying to cut down on our expenses and decided to not take in another dog.  I'd received a mass e-mail from the rescue earlier in the week asking all the foster homes to consider taking an eight year old girl named Riley.  What first caught my attention was her having what could be considered a 'boy name' like our beloved Rudi, and Reggie.  But Riley had some 'special needs.' And as I read the e-mail about her, knowing foster homes are at a premium, I remember hoping that the rescue would be able to find a place for her.  I then forgot about Riley until I was asked specifically if I would consider taking her.  Not being able to say no of course I agreed. Riley's story is of course a bit of a sad one.  Her family lost their home.  Unable to care for her, and unable to take her to the apartment that they were moving to, they contacted the rescue. Times were really difficult for this family, and another dog that they had, a Papillon died from heart-worm.  Riley had not been to the vet since 2007. ~This is how Riley stands~Among some other issues, Riley is handicapped.  She is lame in her hind-limbs.  As you can see in the picture, she has a slumped posture and is unable to fully extend her back legs, walk or stand normally, and can't even be taken for a walk.  Stairs are very difficult.  Riley needed a home that was easy to navigate inside and out and on one level, a house like ours. I picked her up last night, and she's a nervous wreck.  She is pacing and panting and is so confused by what is happening to her that she won't settle down or eat, and has barely paid attention to the other dogs.  It's times like this that I wish I could just tell her that she's going to be okay.  But all I can do is give her lots of reassurance that hopefully she'll soon understand. At the moment, Riley does not have a lot of 'outer beauty'  like Sheba or Reggie.  She has a severe overbite and because of the poor condition of her coat, she was shaved down completely.  Her eyes and face are full of worry.  However despite what's on the outside, I'm finding is that she has a kind heart and gentle personality.  For some reason, I'm finding myself humbled by her this morning.  I am hoping that the rescue will allow her to be seen by an orthopedic surgeon to see if anything can be done to help her.  I am hoping that I can make a difference for a girl named Riley. ~Riley~"},

I could tell by the 8 page application and being told to expect to stay there for at least 2 hours, that this wasn't going to be an ordinary place for him to spend a couple of days a week. We've had nothing but rain the entire week so needless say, Todd was smelling a bit 'doggy.'  So I remedied that this morning with a bath.  How could he be denied entry into a daycare being clean and fluffy and smelling like lavender and mint?  Todd was not particularly happy about the bath, especially before breakfast--Being a terrier, he had his own opinion and I think the picture below pretty much summed up his thoughts on the whole thing...The evaluation went really well.  He did just fine with meeting everyone two and four legged.  The person doing the interview said several times how nicely he got along with the other dogs.  Thankfully there were no cats there! After an hour-and-a-half, I was told that 'they thought Todd would be a good fit there.' I knew he would be, how could you say no to that face anyway?  I know I can't!  Finally, I'll just let you all know that Reggie has eaten all of her meals today, and is up and around just a bit more than yesterday--A little golden ray of sunshine at the end of a rainy day!"},

Until she returns we are seeing a recently graduated vet named 'Chrissy Johnson.'  I think her name fits her because she looks like she's about 12 years old, and is no bigger than a pencil.  We discussed everything and I was glad that she supported my taking Reggie off the medications for now.  This morning Reggie ate a little and met me at the door when I got home this evening.  While Reggie is still not herself, and her appetite hasn't fully returned, I'm really hoping that maybe we're heading in a positive direction--Paws and fingers crossed!! .~Sam & CC~"},

I'm really hoping that's what it is and she'll perk up.  It goes without saying that since we first met in June, I've gotten pretty attached this sweet girl named Reggie."},
{"title": "Loss of Appetite", "date": "Friday, September 2, 2011", "text": "A doctor appointment took me to Reston Virginia, the place where our life in Virginia began in 1995.  We lived in what was then a 'small town,' for about a year before we moved to our last house the following year.  That small town has really grown into a large location for businesses and residences. The heart of the town is the Reston Town Center which has many upscale shops, restaurants and condominiums.  Large brand name companies such as Rolls-Royce North America and Google have offices in the town center.  I always look forward to going there and enjoying the shops that we don't have in the county where I live. Unfortunately my doctor appointment didn't go all that well because the subject of my needing to lose a 'few pounds' was brought up.  I think that's just what doctors do.  I know in our office we stress brushing and flossing more to patients who are really doing pretty well.  But the subject of weight loss always bothers me.  So needless to say I was feeling a bit discouraged afterwards and I did the only thing I could do that just seemed to make sense...I stopped at 'Einstein Brothers Bagels.'  I hadn't been there since last year and I love their 'everything bagel' with cream cheese.     Then I went to 'Trader Joes.'They have great produce and flowers!The next stop was 'Whole Foods.'They have a really nice bakery--Their cheese danish is a favorite!Finally, I went to 'Wegmans' for the rest of the needed groceries.  It's all good there!When Carl got home from work he asked me what was for dinner.  For some reason, I wasn't hungry and didn't feel like cooking.  Doctor appointments do have a way of making you lose your appetite, don't they??        \r\r~Reggie~"},
{"title": "Daycare Woes", "date": "Thursday, September 1, 2011", "text": "Those of you who have seen my posting on my Facebook page know that I had a bit of an issue with the daycare where I've been taking Todd.  When I arrived there on Tuesday to pick him up, he had on a 'no bark collar.'  When I asked why he was wearing one, the girl told me that it was because he'd  been barking constantly.  I have to admit I was taken back by their putting one  on him, but tried to not make too much of an issue about it.  The staff member told me that they'd  tried squirting water at Todd to get him to stop barking, but he just played with  the water--Which he does.  Then it was mentioned that they MIGHT use a  small shock collar on him if he continues to bark all the time.  When I was told that, I remained polite, but made it pretty clear that I really felt that this type of correction was inappropriate to use on such a young dog. I was then told that  Scotties can become  incessant barkers and that it was the only way to teach them not to  bark.  Needless to say, I was upset by this whole thing. Not having a place to leave Todd, I took him back to the daycare on Wednesday.  The whole day all I could think about was the bark-collar, and how I am Todd's owner and his best advocate, so of course I felt guilty all day and worried about him.  Last evening when I picked him up I asked if the bark collar had been used.  They told me that it hadn't but that Todd had spent part of the day alone in another room, and part of it with another terrier mix.  More guilt thinking that he was by himself.For several other reasons, I had already been considering taking Todd to another daycare, and this past Monday I set up a consultation with a new one for next week.  All of this just confirms what I've been thinking and feeling.  But it's also a reminder to follow and act on my instincts when it comes to the care of our dogs and to remember that I'm their voice when someone is trying to quiet theirs."},

The new pack leader at Golden Pines is...Todd--Young and energetic and full of confidence,he has us hopping and jumping to meet his every need!!  But don't tell Charlie, he thinks it's him!~Okay, I was kidding about Todd,but as we expected, Charlie has become the new pack-leader~ But the cat, CC thinks it's her (actually it's her, but don't tell Charlie...)  Whoever is 'in charge' of your household, whatever you're doing, I hope you're having a enjoyable day!Rain here in northern Virginia todayand just as with the earthquake this week,we may feel the effects of Hurricane Irene this weekend."},

I hope you'll take a moment and pay her a visit!   While I know they are not true awards I am  happy to accept this one because it's given me the nudge to get me started blogging  again.  This award comes with three rules which are: 1.  Thank the person passing on the  award. Thank-you Jodi for giving me something to write a post about!!  Also thank-you so much for your kind,  friendly e-mail!  I look  forward to getting to know you and your crew a bit better!!  2.  The second thing when you get this award is to: Write 7 things about yourself. I don't really  like talking about myself, so I've decided to change it up a bit, and list 7  things about where I live that you may not know.  1.  Our property is situated on 3.5 acres at the foot of the Short Hill  Mountains in Loudoun County Virginia.  2. We have no nearby neighbors and are surrounded by 30 acres of open  farmland.  3. I didn't like our house when I first saw it.  It had been empty for almost 2 years and seemed so void of life.  But what I loved was the big  front porch and the outside space which is still my favorite!  The house and I  have learned to get along.4. Where our house is now, was once a cornfield.5. One of our oldest trees on our property is a huge, beautiful maple tree.  It's one of my favorites.  I love its big, long branches.  6. I never grow tired of seeing the wildlife we have around.  The picture below is one of two deer that wandered through our yard this afternoon.  7. A favorite, a Barred Owl has just returned.  Actually, there are two. The last thing I'm to do with this award is to pass it onto 15 people whose blogs I have just discovered. I am really really bad about things like this. I have found several new blogs lately that I really enjoy but I have a hard time singling them out because I don't want to forget anyone...For me it kind of feels like having a birthday party and being forced to invite  only a few friends instead of the whole class!  So, I'd like to invite you to look on the left-sidebar and look at the blogs that I have listed there.  Find one that you're not familiar with and pay them a visit, and make a new friend, just like I did in meeting Jodi!

It was a hard decision, but was one made out of my love for her and compassion...Rudi came to us from the rescue in September of 2003.  A homeless woman who lived in her car, had seen her in a shelter in North Carolina.   Rules were different at the time, and the shelter released the one year old Golden named Sandy to her. She had been returned to the shelter 3 times for her wild and uncontrollable behavior and was considered 'un-adoptable.'  She was renamed Rudi and in a car full of other dogs, she came to Virginia.  Not knowing her history, I agreed to foster Rudi because I thought that she'd be an easy placement.  She turned out to be anything but that.~Rudi enjoying the cat-food~There is so much I could say about the first months we spent together.  Rudi was an insecure dog with very high energy and never seemed to be able to focus on anything.  It didn't take long to figure out that others had not been as patient, and had mistreated her.  There were times that I doubted that I would be able to help her find her way or teach her anything.  There were days that I felt pushed to the edge by the seemingly uncontrollable dog that barked all the time who would jump up and nip me in the face.  She was always into everything.  Nothing left on a counter was out of her reach, the cat food was her favorite.  Medications seemed to have the opposite effect on her.  She couldn't be crated alone because she'd break out of them.  When many were telling me to 'give up' I just couldn't.  It was only because in my mind I had a vision of what she could become if given the chance. I have no idea when things started to change and come together.  I guess it was me that changed.  I stopped trying to fit her into a mold and just let her be herself.  Rudi had such a big personality, was very bright and was so eager to please.  She was very sensitive and was 'in tune' with my moods.  Rudi was a dog with great character. If dogs have a sense of humor, she had one and she loved to 'show off.'  She could always make me laugh.  When you asked her to do things, she would start barking at you or ramble on in high-pitched short barks like she was questioning you.  She always seemed to have an opinion of anything you did.  Her tail was always wagging and her eyes always sparkled with mischief and she would look at you like she had a secret that she wanted you to guess.~Rudi (left) and Kasey--October 2009~Rudi found mentors in Kasey and Wendy. When Kasey passed a few years ago, Rudi became the top dog in the pack. She took Kasey's place on the bed that first night and never slept anywhere else.  Her passion was the frisbee.  She was wildly crazy about it!!  From the start it was the perfect outlet that allowed her to get rid of all her energy and just be herself.Rudi was more to me than 'just a dog.'  If I had to tell you all the things that she taught me, it would be hard to give you a complete answer.  She made me become a better person and a more understanding and patient dog owner.  To me, she was the essence of friendship, trust and pure unbridled joy and enthusiasm.  Life with Rudi wasn't ordinary, but then Rudi wasn't ordinary.  She was an affectionate dog that was my constant companion for 8 years.  I am going to miss her more than I've ever missed any dog.  Walks won't be the same.  Games of frisbee won't be as much fun.  Mealtimes will be quieter.  Life will be quieter.God speed 'my little fruitcake.'  You will have quite a welcome when you reach the Rainbow Bridge...Waiting for you there are a three Goldens, Tod, Ben and Cougar that left us before you came.  But Kasey will be there and I know she'll be happy to see you.  Also there are Scout, Tosh, Tucker, Logan, Cubby, Cowboy, Maguire, Tanner, and Hamlet.  Give them our message and know that we look forward to the day when we'll see you all again.  I just hope there will be a frisbee there too."},
{"title": "What Did I Miss Most?", "date": "Thursday, August 11, 2011", "text": "All is quiet here at home.  Carl is finally back from his 10 day trip to Wisconsin to see family.  It's kind of hard to say which I missed more, him or my good camera that he took with him, having his help with the dogs, or the good camera (did I mention that already?)  All of them I guess! The weather today could not have been more gorgeous!  There was low humidity and lots of sunshine!  I sat on the porch for awhile with the dogs and we enjoyed one another's company as the sound of cicadas filled the air, and the elusive hummingbirds which I've been trying to get a picture of buzzed around.   Todd who hasn't spent much time on the front porch enjoyed it too. Being overprotective, I've been afraid that he would try to leap off, but so far, he hasn't...At least not yet. Rudi has almost totally lost her appetite.  She wants nothing except dog-treats, which I give her by the hand-full. Tomorrow I'm going to try to remember to bring home a fast-food-hamburger.  Dogs always love them, right?  I left work early yesterday when our dog-walker called and said that she was laying in the crate and wouldn't come out.  When I got home, Rudi was up on her feet but was very quiet and seemed uncomfortable.  I've started her on pain medication which seems to have helped because this afternoon she found the enthusiasm to play frisbee. Each day that we have together is a good day!  I hope yours has been a good one as well!  (Did I mention that it's so nice to have my good camera back, and oh, Carl too?!)"},
{"title": "Just What I Needed", "date": "Sunday, August 7, 2011", "text": "The day has been just what I needed, quiet and uneventful.  It gave me the chance to get caught up on everything from the dusting to the laundry.  Todd's curiosity about everything continued as he explored the inside of the dryer this afternoon.Last night he became acquainted with a big toad on our porch.I silently gave a cheer and a prayer of thanks as Rudi reached day 50 of grace today. Each day that passes becomes more of a valued treasure, time more precious.  We quietly celebrated with a very, very brief game of frisbee.  Anytime she has one, she seems happy.  It goes without saying that I'm happy too.    I hope you've had a good weekend!"},
{"title": "Dog Tired!", "date": "Saturday, August 6, 2011", "text": "I can't begin to say what a good feeling it is that it's not even noon, and I'm home and done with all my errands.  The dogs have all been walked, fed, loved and played with.  They are all napping nearby.  Sitting here at my computer I'm watching the hummingbirds out my window at the feeder.  There is a welcomed feeling of peace and calm as we wait for the forecasted rain later today.   It was a week that started out so well, but took a bit of a detour.  With Carl gone it became very busy and hectic.  It didn't help that I got a ticket on Wednesday for making a turn in an 'authorized vehicle only' place on the highway.  Of course I have my reason for why I was turning around that comes complete with the excuses that I didn't see the sign at first and with another car behind me doing the same thing, I had no choice but to make the turn.  The police officer, who I thought was arrogant and indifferent, didn't care about any of it. The maximum fine for this horrible crime that I have committed is $250.  I can only hope for leniency.      Rudi continues to do 'just okay.'  I took her with me to the farm stand this morning.  She tries to accompany us on our daily walks, but because she wears out easily, she'll stop along the way and lay down.  I usually go back and sit with her until she has the energy to walk back to the house.  On some days she'll have no appetite whatsoever, other days she'll eat most of her meal.  For the next mealtime I try to make the exact same thing for her hoping she'll eat again, but she'll refuse it. I can only keep trying.Todd started day care this week.  He really loved it!!  One of my biggest reasons for wanting him to have this experience is because I'm concerned about Todd being so shy and reserved around people that he doesn't know. So I think that his having positive interactions with people when I'm not around will be good for him. Of course playing with 'kids his own age' is just as invaluable.  When we've gotten home in the evenings, Todd has been so worn out, he has just eaten his dinner and fallen asleep for the rest of the night.  I have had to wake him up to take him outside and he's even been too tired to chase the cat--Now that's dog tired!"},
{"title": "Your Turn to Make a Wish!!", "date": "Monday, August 1, 2011", "text": "My week is off to a winning-start and I feel so lucky today!  A few days ago I posted about a Facebook photo contest, that the shop where I buy dog food was having.  The winner would receive a $100 gift card, that I really hoped to win.  I have to be honest,  I felt a bit selfish asking for your votes, so I removed the post on the last day of the contest.  But today, I found out that I WON by a mere 16 votes!  The manager of the shop told me that 2 weeks ago I was behind by more than 40 votes--So I can  only conclude that those needed votes came from those of you who voted from that post and from Lynn at Rocky Creek Scottie Adventures who also posted it--THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!! As if that wasn't enough, a kindly fairy granted my wish when Nancy at A Rural Journal had hers granted and was given the chance to pay it forward.  The Fairy Hobmother works for Appliances Online, a web retailer of household appliances in the UK and has such a fun job, granting wishes and spreading happiness to bloggers.  And it really made my day to receive an email a few days ago granting my wish for a fun new toy for the dogs!  The toy that the Fairy Hobmother picked out was a whirlwheel and it arrived today!  It's a fun toy that flies and squeaks which are the two favorite things our dogs love!  Rudi was the first to try it out, and it really provided a nice lift for her today too!  The Fairy Hobmother has offered me the chance to let YOU make a wish too!!  All you have to do to maybe have your wish granted by the Fairy Hobmother is leave a 'wishful comment' below.  You don’t have to restrict your wishes to items that Appliances Online sell – you can wish for just about anything you'd like!  There’s no rules, no catches, and please don't be shy – just leave a wish and let The Fairy Hobmother know what your most tangible wish would be for, she'll read them all, and choose someone to sprinkle with Hob Dust.  It's as simple as that!  THANK YOU all again for voting for our picture, and THANK YOU FAIRY HOBMOTHER for granting my wish!!"},
{"title": "The End of the Weekend!", "date": "Sunday, July 31, 2011", "text": "~Bubba~I\"m so glad this weekend is over!!  Carl left on Saturday to take my brother back home to Kentucky and is leaving from there to go to Wisconsin on Monday.  But it does mean that I'm a 'single parent' for a week.  We got off to a rocky start when I had another, yes another flat tire on my van.  I've no idea how it keeps happening, but I'm glad that we bought the warranty that went with the tires! This morning at about 3:30, Todd woke me up whining.  He'd been playing in the water, so it was only right that he would need an extra trip outside during the night.  Just as things were settling down Bubba started having a seizure. I sat with him and waited for it to end, knowing he would be disoriented afterwards and need some reassurance.  I'm not sure what time we finally got back to bed.This direction continued when Rudi's day didn't start out well.  Her unwillingness to get up and seeming so tired and worn out, convinced me that today would be our last day together.  I sat with her for along time as she slept so soundly with her head on my lap.  I finally decided to let her be, because I had to tend to the needs of the other dogs.  I'd left the door open when we went for our walk and when we returned, there Rudi was, standing by the garage, just as I'd hoped.  As the day has continued, she has rallied to be with us another day.  She ate part of her meal this evening.  I can feel her spark dimming, but I marvel at her strength and determination to take in as many moments as she can.I don't know what the week ahead will bring for Rudi.  But for Todd it will be a busy one because he starts 'day care' on Monday.  I hope he gets along with the 'other kids' and makes as good of friends with them as he did with the broom he dragged into the office this evening!"},
{"title": "What I Did on My Summer Vacation", "date": "Thursday, July 28, 2011", "text": "I've always been intrigued with old empty buildings and abandoned homes.   So the chance to visit Waverly Hills, which is a closed sanatorium in Louisville  was something I just couldn't pass up.  In the early 1900's, Jefferson County  where it's located, was full of swampland making the area a perfect environment  for an outbreak of tuberculosis.  The sanatorium was built to accommodate 400 tuberculosis  patients and opened in 1910.   During the thirty five years of its existence it  was reported that 63,000 people died at Waverly Hills.  However, the county puts  that number at around 10,000.  Either way it is an eerie place that sits on a hill over looking the city of  Louisville Kentucky.  To me it looks a little like a reigning fortress of gloom.  But it has been given the reputation of being 'one of the most haunted places in  the United States' by those in the paranormal field who have visited there extensively.Over the years, Waverly Hills has been totally vandalized.  But the structure remains sound and work is currently being done to restore it and make it into a hotel for ghost-seekers.  As a way to make money for this undertaking, all kinds of tours are given from 2 hour tours to overnight stays.  The two-hour tour that my brothers and I went on Saturday night is touted as being a 'paranormal ghost tour.'  While most were there hoping for a ghostly encounter, I was there out of curiosity and to see the inside of this historical building.~Down one of the hallways--If the walls could talk.~One of the most talked about and famous aspects of the Waverly Hills Sanatorium  is the Body Chute or Death Tunnel.  At the  peak of the TB epidemic, many patients died everyday. In order to keep morale up  and not upset patients, the hospital administration decided to use the  Body Chute to discretely send bodies away from the hospital by the use of a rail-car wench-type system in the tunnel that transported the bodies of deceased TB patients to waiting hearses or trains.  Due to the lack of electricity, there is total darkness inside of the tunnel  after about thirty feet down. The acoustics  are interesting and there is a strong echo when you talk.Waverly Hills was a state-of-the-art facility. The rooms were very nice, and  many lead out to porches so the patients could get plenty of fresh air; many spent as much as 15 hours each day on these porches.  Electric blankets were used in the winter.  Patients even had radios with headphones on the porches and in the rooms so they could listen to music. The sanatorium had a chapel, a school for the children,  and special housing for the hospital staff also.Here's a picture of what the porches used to look like: The tour takes you to all the floors and you're told many stories including being able to hear voices of children chanting \"Ring Around The  Rosy\" on the roof top terrace.  There is even said to have been encounters with an apparition of one of the two nurses who died  in room 502, and of visitors who have crossed paths with the shadow people of the fourth floor. One story is told of the spirit of a child that haunts the third floor who has been known to play with toys and roll balls.  With this in mind there are balls placed around each floor because they've been known to start rolling with no explanation.  In complete darkness we waited for a ball to roll...It didn't move until.... I walked past and nudged it with my foot!  I don't know what made me do it--But those behind me on the tour thought they were having that awaited encounter with the paranormal because when I glanced over my shoulder and watched them with their flashlights, and heard their exclamations, I realized they hadn't seen me bump the ball as I walked past.  I didn't have the heart to tell them anything differently and it gave my brothers and I a really good chuckle afterwards! Next year, my brothers want to do the 'overnight stay.'  We'll see...Would you visit Waverly Hills?"},
{"title": "Tuesday at Golden Pines", "date": "Tuesday, July 26, 2011", "text": "I'm back from Kentucky with my youngest brother who will be here until the end of the week. Rudi and Charlie went with me, and are great traveling companions!  Both don't seem to mind the almost 11 hour trip as long as they get their turn at sitting in the front seat. The mishaps from the trip were a flat-tire on Saturday morning and on Sunday a fall at a gas station. I was so thankful that the flat didn't occur during the drive home, and that I'm only bruised and skinned up from landing practically face down on the pavement--Both could have been so much worse! Carl did a great job taking care of the dogs including Todd, who I think grew while I was gone. On Wednesday I'm taking Reggie back to the vet for the x-rays of her chest.  She's doing well too, and I really think she's feeling better.  Her skin has really improved and is healing.  Her ears have cleared up nicely as well, all good signs!  There is a content feeling about Reggie and she seems happy. Today is 'day 38 of grace' for Rudi.  She has good days and like today, some not so good ones. She's very quiet and subdued, but still seems to be 'okay.'  Whatever kind of day it is, I continue to cheer her on and hope for more, and I thank-you all for doing the same!"},

Accompanying me on this trip will be Charlie, of course.  I am on the fence about taking Rudi.  She didn't eat yesterday and I worry that something may happen on the way.  But she seems to feel 'okay' and there's a part of me that thinks this trip would be a good one for both of us to share because it'll be our last one.  Time together, even just in the car is always good.I was going to take Todd with me too.  But I've decided to leave him at home.  I'm really going to miss him.  I'll be back at the start of the week, and will look forward to catching up on your news when I return."},

{"title": "Justice for Reggie", "date": "Saturday, July 16, 2011", "text": "Off to the vet this morning with Reggie.  Her last blood work results showed some abnormalities and it needs to be rechecked now that she's finished a long course of antibiotics.  Also on the list are x-rays to see if there are any changes in her heart and lungs since June. As you know, she's doing well.  I find her to be endearing and it's not just because of her attentiveness to Todd.  I think it's just in how she looks at you; her big, brown soulful eyes draw me in, she is gentle with great character and heart.  A reminder of why I love senior Goldens.Among the paperwork I received with Reggie are all papers related to the neglect charges that were filed against the owner and their name.  Thanks to all court cases in Virginia being online I was able to find the case and its result.  It appears that the previous owner spent 15 days in jail, paid all fees relating to the case, (which hopefully included Reggie's surgery), a fine, and they are not allowed to own a pet for two years--I personally don't think they should ever be allowed to own one, but that's just my opinion. But I do feel like an amount of justice was served in Reggie's case, and I hope 'they' are feeling regret over how she was neglected, and maybe, just maybe, they realize the treasure they've lost.     Today our beautiful and cooler weather continues ahead of what will be another heatwave predicted for next week.  On the list today is the hopes and goal of catching up on your blogs--I so appreciate your stopping by and keeping up with us, I really enjoy reading your comments and hope you enjoy your weekend!!~I just cannot stop taking pictures of butterflies~"},

But whatever the reason, I am  glad the week is coming to an end!Rudi is doing just okay.  She has been quieter the last couple of days and continues to not have much of an appetite. We are able to get her to eat a little, but I'm wondering if she eats because she knows we want her too.  However she still has that spark and will follow me around.  She seems comfortable enough and content and that's all that matters.     The only one whose not worn out this week is Todd.  He's been so good at work!  I think that Reggie misses him because she seems happy to see him and plays with him when we get home. But Todd being crated all day shows when we get home. He's energetic and into everything!  We're finding that socks are making their way outside.....But it's all okay...They're Carl's socks! I hope your week is going well!  I'm really trying to get caught up on my blog visits and look forward to reading about what's going on in your world.  ~Sammy~"},
{"title": "Dog Days of Summer", "date": "Monday, July 11, 2011", "text": "A quiet weekend.  Well, as quiet as it can be when you have a puppy around!  Todd is finding his place and forging relationships with all the dogs.  He and Charlie had a real bonding moment when the two of them worked on digging a hole next to the barn.  I think Charlie was probably digging it so Todd could escape never to be seen again, and Todd was just digging for the fun of it.  Whatever their reasons, it seems to have helped them to almost work out the differences Charlie felt they had.Today we are at day 23 of grace with Rudi.  I have remained a bit humbled and grateful for each day, because I don't know if it'll be our last.  There has been a different look in Rudi's eyes the last week or so and I've noticed her watching me.  I even wake up at night and she's there on the bed looking at me.  I can't help but wonder what she's thinking or if she's trying to tell me something; I've always felt that if Rudi were a person she'd never be able to keep a secret.  Her appetite has decreased over the last few days, and we try to tempt her to eat with baby food--Sometimes she'll eat, other times she won't.  She sleeps more and wears out pretty easily.  Yesterday evening she hadn't eaten all day and didn't want to go outside with us for a walk, but I insisted.  She was laying in the driveway and on a whim I threw her, her most favorite toy of all, a frisbee--Suddenly she came to life and wanted to play.  A couple of very small tosses for her was all it took to lift both our spirits.  When we came back in, she ate her whole meal. Mother Reggie is also doing well, and continues to watch over Todd.  I see a spark as she now anxiously goes for walks with us, never looking back towards the house.  She doesn't even mind being outside alone and is much more relaxed.  I take all this as an indication that she's feeling secure and has found her place here with us--Wait, wasn't she only supposed to be here temporarily?I hope your week is off to a good start and you're getting some relief from the heat. Our news is reporting that the Washington D.C. area has been named the 6th hottest city in the nation--What an honor as we are currently in the dog-days of summer!"},

{"title": "Off to the Dentist!", "date": "Wednesday, July 6, 2011", "text": "Socialization as you know is really important for any puppy.  And since we are gone from home 2-3 days a week, I've been trying to find a day care for Todd during those times.  However I'm running into an unexpected problem in that while he has 'age appropriate vaccines' he is still missing a couple like rabies, which he is not yet old enough for, and bordetella.  The daycare that I really wanted to take him to  allowed puppies to come without their rabies and 4th distemper vaccine.  But 2 weeks ago they changed their requirements and now all dogs regardless of age must have ALL vaccines and must be immunized for canine influenza, which I won't give him--I learned from an 'insider' that they'd had a couple of dogs there that had it, so this was why it was added to their list.  (My vet doesn't give the CIV vaccine, and since I'm trying to limit the vaccines the puppy gets, he wouldn't have gotten it anyway.  Do you have any thoughts you'd like to share about this or any other vaccine, I'd be interested to hear).   Finding another day care has been trickier than I thought it would be because of his age.  However I knew before we got Todd that this might become an issue.  So with a little bit of convincing, the doctor I work for agreed to my bringing Todd to the office.  However there are a few rules, one being that he must be kept in his crate in the break-room, and cannot be taken out (except by me and only to be taken outside) and is not allowed in other parts of the office--Of course I agreed, and I will be the model employee during those times--Wish us luck at the dentist!"},
{"title": "Tod and Todd - What's In a Name?", "date": "Monday, July 4, 2011", "text": "A few of you have asked where we got the name 'Todd' for our newest, and youngest addition.  Today I thought I'd share with you where the name came from.Carl and I got our first Golden Retriever in June of 1996.  Of course we wanted to pick out the perfect name for him.  I wanted to name him 'Fox' but Carl and the person we got him from, balked at that. Then I remembered a favorite Disney movie called 'The Fox and the Hound' which you may recall tells the story of two unlikely friends, a red fox named Tod and a hound dog named Copper--The name Tod means fox, so Tod it was! Tod was as all Goldens are supposed to be, handsome, friendly, playful and easy going...Sadly though, he was diagnosed with lymphoma and died just before his 6th birthday.   ~Tod and our cat Drifter~Being the sentimental person that I am, I thought of naming our first Scottish Terrier, Tod, after our first Golden Retriever, adding the second letter 'd' to the end, but I just wasn't sure.  Then when I was researching Scottish names, I came across a website that explained that Tod is a Scots word for fox. (In Scotland and the north of England a todhunter is a fox hunter.) While the doubling of the final letter is a 'corruption,' it's the more common spelling, and most of the 'Todd's' are Scots.  With that, I decided that Todd was to be the name of our new puppy!  It has been a long time since I've called a dog named Tod.  And I  have to admit that at first its use brought back a lot of sadness because of its connection to a life that ended much too soon.  But now I'm finding that a name that was connected to heartbreak is changing with the antics of a little Scottish Terrier who shares the same name."},

On the flip-side we are of course enjoying the energy that only a puppy has!  Todd had his first vet appointment Friday, and our little growing boy weighed over 10 pounds!  There are also very brief moments when Charlie doesn't seem to mind Todd--Progress!!Around us the fruit and vegetable stands are opening up for the season.    And just as I decided that I liked the overgrown field next to us, it was cut for hay.  Life, like Todd keeps moving on in our little corner of northern Virginia.  I hope you're having a good weekend!"},
{"title": "The DMV and a Lesson Learned??", "date": "Friday, July 1, 2011", "text": "I knew in May that I needed to renew my drivers license.  But I did what I  always do, and I put off renewing it because I had plenty of time.  In Virginia  you can do it online, so there just didn't seem to be any hurry.  But on the  evening of the 29th I decided the time had come to renew it.  It didn't take  long to realize I was unable to renew it because my license expired on my  birthday and not at the end of the month like I thought it did.  That meant that  for 19 days I was unknowingly driving around on an expired license.  The punishment by the  DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) for not renewing on time is that you have to  go into one of their main offices to renew it and bring with you proof of 'legal presence' which as  you may know means that I need to show that I'm a U.S. citizen and legally  authorized to be in the United States....Thankfully Carl is organized and gave  me my birth certificate and on an impulse gave me our marriage license too.     Many of you may know that any trip to the DMV typically means long lines  and endless waiting.  I came prepared with magazines, my camera and cell phone and I wondered why the Virginia flag was at half mast...Was that a sign?  I was about to find out as my odyssey began with standing in line waiting for a number.  It was mid-morning and with the long line and people waiting I happened to  notice there was practically no one at any of the counters.  Why was that? My turn in line to get a number to wait and I told the person at the  counter that I was there to renew my expired drivers license.  She looked at my  license and told me it was expired...Of course she mentioned that I had to be  able to show that I was a US citizen.  I gave her my birth certificate which was  met with some skepticism because it's not notarized.  I told her that it was the  one given to my Mother; however it still needed a supervisors approval and I was  asked to give proof of my married name.  Thank-you Carl for thinking that I might  need that marriage license.  Both were approved and I had my number and was now  going to get to wait...again.   ~Rudi~Finally my number was called, and I repeated to the DMV employee my  reason for being there.  She looked at my license and told me it was expired and  I needed to show that I was a US citizen.  I gave it to her and mentioned  that my birth certificate was an original but wasn't notarized but had been  okayed by the other clerk and a supervisor and I gave her my marriage license.  She told me that she  would have to get an approval from a supervisor because my birth certificate  wasn't notarized...There was something that I really wanted to say to her, but I  thought it best to just let it go.  Finally after several more minutes everything was approved--I am now able to drive legally again!!  The punishment and fine, or rather the fee for coming into the DMV and not doing it online  was increased by 5 dollars and my license will arrive in about 10 days. It'll  be good for 8 years.  I wonder if I'll remember next time to renew early or wait until the  last minute?"},

Rudi seems to like them, and that's what's most important.  But I know that may change at any time, so the next trick I have up my sleeve to get her to eat is all ready, which will be baby food.  This is the tenth day of grace with Rudi.  She seems to be feeling pretty well, because last evening she got the cat food bowl off the kitchen counter.  I know it may sound silly, but it's the little things like that, that I've missed her doing the most.  Yesterday for the first time she grabbed a frisbee off the work bench in the garage and wanted to play a round.  But knowing she would overdo it, as she always does, and with the heat, I reluctantly told her no.  I've decided that at times like this, it all comes down to the small and sometimes trivial things, that you didn't think meant much at the time, you suddenly realize you miss them the most. I really do love the little things...And this 'little thing' too!  Enjoy your Tuesday!"},

Reggie has adjusted the routine and has made herself right at home.  She continues to always wag her tail and does seems to be happy and content. There seems to be a connection between Reggie and Todd.  Any noise that he makes, Reggie is right there checking on him.  When we're outside, she is never that far away keeping a watchful eye on him. Todd is always close to her too and when he sees her he'll run over to her.     We decided that we're going to keep Reggie here for now.  And when her medial issues are all resolved, which won't be for a  few more months, we'll try to find her another home through the rescue, (does anyone really believe I'll do that??) Besides, I think she and Todd might miss one another."},

That however has changed.  Today Todd is trying to get to know his new pack just a little bit better and is either following them around or....  ~Reggie & Todd~laying around with them...~Sam & Todd~And really trying to make a friend out of Charlie who is, as expected, non too happy right now and is just trying to stay a few steps ahead. We are keeping him away from Rudi, who is mostly ignoring him, which is just fine--In fact as our first day together is coming to an end, I think everything is just fine!"},

Thank-you all again for your sending all your well wishes, good thoughts and prayers for Rudi! They have meant so much!!!  She is doing okay.  We have moments where she seems like herself, other times when she isn't.  Right now I am struggling with getting her to eat something--anything.  I thought I had fooled her when I got her to eat a meal out of the cat food bowl.  But she only fell for that twice.  Rudi has always been a real chow-hound--She's always been fed last, and finished first.  So this is really hard to see.  If any of you have any suggestions on how to get her to eat, that would really be appreciated.I'm really sorry that I've not been able to visit your blogs very often this week.  It has really been a busy week with Reggie arriving and a few other things behind the scenes.  I will look forward to reading your news when I return on Friday.  With a new puppy, I'm sure I'll have time!!  Right??!!"},
{"title": "The Arrival of a Girl Named Reggie", "date": "Wednesday, June 22, 2011", "text": "We have a new addition at least for now, that arrived on Monday.  At the beginning of June I was asked by the rescue if I would consider taking a 13 year old senior girl named Reggie. At the time, Hamlet was doing okay, and after really thinking about it I agreed. Because of some 'issues' and because she was 6+ hours away, it took some doing to bring her in this direction.  I was contacted on Sunday and told that everything had been arranged and she was on her way to me.  With everything that has been going on, I didn't think it was such a good idea for her to come here.  But with no place for her to go I agreed to take Reggie and see how it went.  I know that with Rudi not feeling well and the puppy arriving in a few days, the timing for this gal to become part of our household is not the best.  I think that she needs to perhaps go to another foster home. Reggie was confiscated from her owner by Animal Control in the county where she lived because she was found lying on her owner’s porch with a ruptured dinner plate sized mass on her back that was infected with 'fly larva.'  Other sores on her body were infected as well, and understandably she was not feeling well and was having problems walking.  The owner was charged with animal cruelty and neglect andhad to surrender Reggie.  While the case is pending, the judge is NOT tolerant of animal abuse and neglect and they most definitely will be held accountable for their actions--Thank-goodness!!   Reggie has had the surgery to remove the mass.   Because of the condition of her coat and the other sores, she had to be shaved down to the skin.  She has a large mammory tumor but the vet felt it was too close to her heart to risk removing it. She is also thought to be in the early stages of heart failure.  Reggie gets along nicely with our crew who don't mind her at all because they are seasoned veterans with dogs coming and going from our household.  Rudi is also un-phased by her and ignores her.  Reggie does seem a bit bewildered by what's happened to her.  I don't think she understood my taking her on a walk with us yesterday morning.  She was tenative and nervous the whole time and kept looking back towards the house.  When we let her into the backyard she hurries back onto the porch and stands with her head pushed into the door to be let back inside.  She is following us everywhere and I don't think her tail has stopped wagging.  I think she's grateful and happy...Yes, there is no question about it, she's a sweet old girl!  But as I mentioned, the timing of her arrival is not the best and she may have to use her charm to win a place in someone else's heart besides mine, which she has already done."},
{"title": "Days of Grace", "date": "Tuesday, June 21, 2011", "text": "We took Rudi to see our vet on Monday who looked at the x-rays, examined her and agreed with the diagnosis of  hemangiosarcoma.  We talked about the very few options that we have, and have decided to let nature take its course.  More than likely Rudi only has a matter of days left with us, weeks maybe, but nothing more.  Yesterday was a good day.  Her gum color is good, but we struggle with trying to get her to eat.  I'm hoping that putting her on an antacid will help because we think she may be feeling nauseous.  She remains really quiet and subdued, so we're letting her set her own pace and decide what she wants to do (she pretty much did that anyway).  But Rudi's days of wildly chasing the frisbee, running laps around the house and getting the cat food off the counter are behind us.When some of you have been given a grim diagnosis for your own dogs, and they exceed the time a vet has predicted, those days have been called 'days of grace.'  I've never really known personally just how precious those days can be until I was told on Saturday that Rudi probably wouldn't live through the night.  It's Tuesday morning and she's still with us.  Knowing that this can change at anytime makes me realize just what a treasure each day (with Rudi) really is.   ~Rudi in May, playing frisbee~"},

I'm sure that her system is absorbing some of the blood that's in her abdomen which is why there seems to be an 'upswing' in her mood and attitude.  I'm just hoping that we can make it through another night and to my vet first thing on Monday.  Many many thanks for your continued good thoughts and prayers that are at the moment putting us on top of the wave, and helping me come to grips with what I know is coming."},
{"title": "Another Loss At Golden Pines???", "date": "Saturday, June 18, 2011", "text": "To start, I cannot begin to express how much your kind words on the loss of Hamlet have meant to me.  Your remembering Hamlet on your blogs, sending an e-card, and lighting candles for him have left me feeling humbled and grateful to all of you, my friends--You've made a difference and made his loss easier to bear, because you have shared it with me.Yesterday on the way to the vet with Hamlet I didn't want to listen to the rambling on the radio, so I plugged in my iPod and the song by Israel \"IZ\" Kamakawiwoʻole, Somewhere Over the Rainbow - Wonderful World started to play.  I thought it was an appropriate song to listen to.  I replayed it a couple of times and I held Hamlet's paw as I drove and sang along.  Last evening we were standing on the porch after a storm and over my house was a rainbow. I stood and marveled at the rainbow because I knew that it was a reminder that everything was 'okay' and everything was how it should be.  I said a prayer of thanks for knowing that and felt that inner peace. ~Charlie & Rudi (right)~The past week as you know has been an emotional one.  One of our dogs, Rudi, who is about 9 years old has always been really sensitive to my moods, when I'm upset she'll be upset as well.  Her refusing to eat during those times is not uncommon.  I'd noticed during the week that she was not quite herself and I attributed it to everything that was happening with Hamlet.  I thought that a fun outing would be good for her (and me) so today I decided to take Rudi with me as I visited a friend over in West Virginia.  Rudi hardly wanted to do anything but lay around.  When she had problems walking up a hill I checked her gums and noticed they were pale and her stomach seemed bloated...I took her to the animal emergency and x-rays were taken and the vet gave his diagnosis of Hemangiosarcoma   and thought that I should let her go because he thought she only had hours to live.  To say that I felt like I'd been hit in the stomach was and is an understatement.  I explained to the vet that I'd just let a dog go the day before and I wasn't ready to do it again.  However he felt that I should because he doesn't think she'll live through tonight.  I took Rudi outside and talked to Carl who had met me there.  Whether it's right or wrong, or selfish of me, I felt I just couldn't go through with it and so I've brought Rudi home.  Her gums remain pale and she's very quiet and I don't think she's in pain.  I'm just praying that she lives through the night and that somewhere and somehow I find the strength and the courage to let her go when it's time.Just as a caveat I'll add that I know that you don't know Rudi that well.  She came to us in 2003 from a shelter in North Carolina.  We were her 4th home, and she was just over a year old.  Rudi is our undeniable pack leader.  She is very bright, active, sensitive, mischievous, into everything and always acts like she has a secret she wants you to guess.  She is truly a once in a lifetime dog that is one of the cornerstones of our pack Rudi has a way of always making me laugh and her loss will leave a huge hole in our pack and in my heart."},

{"title": "We Wait", "date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2011", "text": "I stayed home from work today and spent it with Hamlet who is not doing so well.  I sat on the front porch with him and the other dogs enjoying a beautiful sunny morning where there were birds singing and a breeze.  Hamlet who was sleeping on the porch lifted his head and closing his eyes, sniffed the air that was blowing on his face.  As I watched him, the wind seemed to whisper in my ear that his time to leave us is drawing near.  Of course I don't know when that will be. So I wait for this most un-welcomed guest and pray for more time and peace.   With my 'milestone birthday' behind me, we had another 'celebration' here at Golden Pines.  Some of you may recall that back last fall I was upset when the property behind us was put up for sale.  A couple of attempts by us to purchase part of it from the owner were turned down.  While the property was priced well with the current market, over the last 6 months we've noticed very few people looking at it.  I was contacted by our Realtor on Monday and told that the property had been 'withdrawn' from the market and yesterday the sign was taken down. I have to admit that I'm relieved that it didn't sell.  But the owner is a Realtor, and so I know at some point the property will once again be put back on the market to be sold. CarrieAnne decided that she wanted to celebrate on her own and so she went for a private swim.  The water level must be up after the rain from this past weekend.  She returned very happy! The celebration was short lived however because as we were getting the dogs in the house, Carrie was nowhere to be found.    We looked for her for almost 2 hours.  I called and called, and blew the whistle for her to return, but she didn't come.  I asked Carl several times if he checked the house for her and he assured me he had. This was so unlike her because CarrieAnne always, always comes when she's called...It was starting to get dark and so we came back into the house and when I came in I called her and there she was--She'd been in the house the entire time.  Once again, relief and celebration and the reminder to never ask Carl to find something for me!"},

This is the second 'Dodge Caravan' I've owned, and I know it's not the sportiest or the coolest thing to drive.  But the biggest reason I have it is because after Hurricane Katrina people said they had to leave their pets behind because they didn't have a way to take them with them.  It started me thinking and I realized that if something were to happen and we needed to leave our home, I want to be able to take all of the dogs with us.  I know this may sound silly....At any rate, it has been pretty dependable.  In the nearly 5 years I've had my van I wonder how many days and how many times I've sat in traffic in it?Watching some drivers do some pretty dumb things.  Like this man yesterday morning.  I saw him a few times and each time his head was back and his eyes looked like they were closed--Sleeping while driving??!! I notice a lot of people on their cell phones too.  In Virginia you don't have to use a 'hands free device.'  But I'm seeing more and more drivers texting while driving which makes me nervous!   Then there are the vanity plates that I often see while driving.  Some, are simple in what they say. Some I have to think about for a minute or two...Do you know what this says?  It's probably easy for you to figure out...Carl has mentioned getting me another van and we chuckle at this persons approach to try and sell his car. But I think that for now, I'll keep my van.  Besides, I've gotten used to finding it in a parking lot.Are there any milestones for you this week?  If so, I hope they are good ones, and your week is off to a good start! ~The field next to our house~"},

The bottom line is that it's treatable with the antibiotic Augmentin that we'll put him on for 6 weeks.  I don't know if it's because I'm still worn out, but I found myself feeling humbled and thankful for this news.  I know it doesn't mean that this will be the end of the problems with this tumor--I know it is going to continue to grow and be an ongoing problem.  But I feel like right here and right now now, we've won this round against it."},

They are defining it as \"a congressionally authorized process of the Department of Defense to reorganize its base structure to more efficiently and effectively support our forces, increase operational readiness and facilitate new ways of doing business.\"   Whatever that means...All I know is that this week Carl started  a very long commute to his new office, where the building is said to be the length of an aircraft carrier.  Fortunately he has been able to get into a 'van pool' so he only has to drive about 30 minutes to the meeting place.  But another downside to all of this is that to get there he's leaving home by 4:30 in the morning.  I'm getting up early too because it leaves me to get everything done before I go to work. I have never been very good at change.  And this change, at least this week has left us both worn out, and exhausted.  When I get this way, things that wouldn't ordinarily bother me, do.Things like what happened yesterday when we noticed that the Phoebes that built their nest just more than a week ago are no longer around.  We really tried to stay away from the area of the nest as much as we could.  But it really bothered me that they were gone.  I checked and was glad to see that there were no eggs. I was also upset when Hamlet chose a couple of times this week to not go for a walk with us and hasn't wanted to come outside.  I know he's been really sensitive to the heat and just have to hope that it was because of that and nothing more.  I've not yet heard back from the vet about the results of the culture, hopefully I will in the next couple of days.  The ulcerations on the tumor, while still draining a little bit, I think, aren't nearly as 'angry' as they have been.  As I write this, Hamlet is laying on his left side, which is the side of the tumor--I've no idea if that means anything, but I am a tiny bit encouraged by that.Another moment came at the groomers when I dropped off Charlie this morning. I met someone who was bringing in two Scottish Terriers to be groomed.  Of course I mentioned that we were getting one at the end of the month.  I was totally unprepared for her telling me that she didn't think that anyone should get puppies when there were so many in shelters that needed homes.  I tried to tell her that I've devoted the last 12 years of my life to rescue, in particular the senior dogs, but it fell on deaf ears and ended in my feeling on the verge of tears.  I left the shop and was called a few minutes later by the owner who apologized for what happened.  She gave me some very kind words of encouragement which I appreciated. As I said, typically these kinds of things don't bother me, at least not to much.  Which is why on my day off it has been so nice to just be home, eating all the wrong food, watching reruns Project Runway, relaxing and catching up on your blogs.  I hope you're having a nice day too!"},
{"title": "We're Having a Heat Wave", "date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2011", "text": "Searing heat here in northern Virginia the last several days.  I was reminded yesterday by a co-worker that we didn't have air-conditioning when we were growing up.  We wondered how we managed and decided it was because we were younger then. The dogs of course are feeling the effects of the heat too.  The seniors, Wendy, Hamlet and even Toby go out, and quickly come back inside.  The younger crowd (the 9 year olds) still want to play a round of frisbee, but it's short lived because we put the brakes on. ﻿ ~Josh~﻿ Sam loves to just lay in the sun and bake...Charlie is having the hardest time in the heat because of his very thick and heavy coat.  He goes to the groomers on Thursday which will be just in time for the weather to cool off.   The one dog really finding relief in it all is CarrieAnne.  Last evening she once again did her thing, and slipped away to her private little swimming hole.  The water level must be a little low because after several minutes she returned all wet and muddy and quite happy with herself...And this time, not even the bath afterwards caused her to have any remorse.  Do you mind the extreme heat?  How do you stay cool in it?"},
{"title": "Memories for What's Ahead", "date": "Sunday, May 29, 2011", "text": "Some call them fireflies, I call them lightning bugs. I think they're summer's mascot and they're back. The memories I have of them is like 'magic.' Even now seeing them is kind of like a mini-fireworks show . As I stood on my porch watching them last night, I remembered something I read about how each minute of our lives is unique unto itself and how connected we can be to what came before and what will come next. I wish I knew what will come next for Hamlet. He was taken back to the vet on Friday. His appetite is really good, but there is a lingering cough and the tumor is still draining.  (We're doing our best to keep it very clean). I don't think that he's feeling all that well, but despite that his tail still wags and the spark is still there.  We have had a culture done to see what bacteria is present and will hopefully be able to find an antibiotic to treat the infection. Prior to Hamlet having his 2nd surgery, one of the bacteria that was identified from a culture was e-coli. The medication to treat that particular strain of it was very expensive (about $1500 per bottle) required his being hospitalized for several days, and had an arms length of side effects which included kidney failure. It was then we opted to do the surgery and hope all the bacteria and infection were removed. I knew going into it that there was a chance it may not be. As far as doing surgery again, right now I don't feel like that's an option. His recovery from the 2nd surgery was a little more difficult than the first one, and a 3rd would no doubt be harder for him. Hamlet is an old dog (we guess about 13-14) and I think it would be too much for a dog his age. We've had a wonderful and memorable year and-a-half together; the past six months, the best. He had times where he would make little running dashes on our walks, manage a single bark and we'd get a 'snorty whine' from him when we come home. I know those days are now gone.  But like the lightning bugs, I have the memories of them.  I think they've given Hamlet and I a connection and the courage for whatever will come next."},

{"title": "Coming Soon--A Rocky Creek Scottie!!!", "date": "Thursday, May 26, 2011", "text": "We have been keeping a secret here at Golden Pines for several weeks now.  The secret? We are getting a puppy! No, it's not a Golden Retriever (a shock I know) but a Scottish Terrier!Just over a year ago, I became acquainted with 'Lynn' from the blog Rocky Creek Scottie Adventures. Our cyber friendship began when Angus, at Wilf the PON Discovers France posted about our both losing 4-legged-family members, Java and Cowboy, on the same day. Lynn sent me an e-mail and a friendship began. We marveled that a blog in France would introduce the two of us who both live in Virginia.  (Thank-you for that Angus!!!)I've known for a long time that I wanted to get a puppy. And I knew that if and when we added one, the timing of it was really going to be important.  I also knew that for several reasons, I didn't want the puppy to be a Golden Retriever. Because of Lynn and her blog, I became smitten with Scottish Terriers and started to do more reading about them. It didn't take long to realize that I wanted to add a Scottie to our household. When Lynn told me that her girl, Carrleigh was expecting a litter in April, the timing seemed to be right. This week, I picked the puppy, a little boy, whose name was Jock, and we have re-named Todd. Being a 'sentimental old lady' I will tell you in another post how and where this name came from. But 'Todd' will be coming to Golden Pines in about a month. Carl and I are of course really excited! I know some of you may be wondering why in the world we would want to add a puppy when we already have so many dogs. The answer is a very personal one that has to do with knowing that the loss of some of our dogs will be coming way to soon. Last year, we said good-bye to three of our pups, not including Doris's boy Sam. With our dogs getting older, I feel this need to 'bridge that gap' and begin a new generation. I feel strongly that there's nothing like a puppy to liven up a laid-back quiet crowd, especially a spirited Scottish Terrier!! (The picture below are the little boys, 'Todd' is the one on the far left)I hope you'll take a moment to stop by and meet Lynn and her crew at Rocky Creek Scottie Adventures, and Angus at Wilf the PON discovers France."},
{"title": "Lost and Found", "date": "Wednesday, May 25, 2011", "text": "On Monday on my way to work, I saw something in the road that at first I thought was something that had been hit by a car--As I passed it, I glanced down and saw what I thought looked like a wallet. I turned the van around, and went back for a better look. It was indeed a wallet. I picked it up and even though it was soaking wet, there was a little more than $80 in cash, a credit card, drivers license, all the usual things. The wallet belonged to a young man who was 19 years old, and had just celebrated his birthday on Sunday. Off the drivers license I was able to get the address which led me to a phone number and I called and left a message. At the end of the day was a call from the grateful father of 'Andrew' who had lost the wallet. He said before they got my message they had been out looking all down the road trying to find it. Andrew was a little frantic at losing it. They didn't live far from me, so I offered to drop it off on my way home from work.  I met a relieved and very grateful Andrew along with his dad, who thanked me several times and even offered me a reward. Of course there was no way I was taking a reward and I told them I was just glad I was able to return the wallet and its contents to the owner. Tuesday morning when we had the dogs out, we lost track of our boy Josh. Josh at 9 years old is just now being trusted to be off lead. However, we always keep a really close eye on him because he will wander off and that's what he did. It was a moment of panic when Josh didn't come when we called him and he seemed to have disappeared. We decided to get all the dogs inside and go out and look for him. We had just gone back outside when a truck pulled into our driveway. The driver got out and so did Josh! He'd seen him on the neighboring field, called to him and he came. He looked at his tags and realized where he belonged and brought him back. I was so very grateful that he'd found Josh that I offered him a 'reward' for his trouble, but he told us no, that he was glad to be able to bring Josh back to where he belonged. I thought later Josh's being returned was kind of like the wallet, both owners relieved and very thankful for the kindness of strangers. Finally, again I am grateful and so appreciate for all your good thoughts and prayers for Hamlet.  He's doing well, and there are no changes--The below picture was taken on Saturday where he's doing what he always does, taking everything in stride."},
{"title": "A Phoebe for Good Luck", "date": "Sunday, May 22, 2011", "text": "I love birds.  I love to watch them, hear them, take pictures of them, and feed them.  The first summer we were living where we are now, one bird in particular drove me a little crazy.  I'd never heard it before and was able to identify it as the 'Eastern Phoebe.'  The bird gets its name from its distinctive but rough two note call, 'whee-bee,' reminds me of a dogs squeaky toy. Above all the other birds that summer, the Phoebe is all I heard, over, over and over again....When the end of summer came and it left, outside seemed a bit lonely without it.  However, it returned the next year and I'd listen for it each time we were outside.  Last year, I hardly heard it at all and found myself missing the constant 'whee-bee, whee-bee, whee-bee.'  This year, it's back and has built a nest above our garage door.  I hear it first thing in the morning and during the day. Below is a video I took of the Phoebe and you can decide for yourself if hearing all the time would drive you to the edge...﻿Finally, many thanks again for the good thoughts for Hamlet.  For now, he seems to be feeling pretty well.  Unfortunately, last evening the tumor on his shoulder 'broke' open. The tumor feels warm to the touch and the tissue is very 'angry.'  I am heartsick that despite all the efforts and with so much optimism, and feeling like we'd done everything right, we couldn't prevent this from happening again.  We've cleaned it the best we can, and he's once again sporting a tee-shirt to help keep the debris out of it, and the other dogs away from it.  I've taken this path before and so I know where this is leading. However because it's considered good luck to have a bird nesting around your house, I continue to have hope and wish for good-luck to be on Hamlet's side."},

He has a little bit of a temperature, so we've put him on antibiotics. We both don't think that the cancer is encased in the tumor alone and think that it probably has spread elsewhere, but we've no way of knowing.  But what I do know is that given everything, Hamlet really does to seem feel pretty good.  He has a great appetite, he still wants to go on walks with us, so we're just going to ride the wave and be thankful for each day! On the way home, I saw this little pedestrian crossing the road alone, where there was no crosswalk.  I knew he would never make it across 4 lanes of traffic, a median and survive in a construction zone, so I stopped and picked him up and brought him home. This makes 4 terrapins I've moved off the road this year.  This little guy was in a hurry to be on his way, so we let him go at the edge of our woods and of course wished him 'good luck!'"},

Yesterday Carl took his car into a body shop in Maryland (where he'd taken it previously) to have it repaired.  You'll recall that it was hit by a stray bullet a couple of weeks ago.  We've no idea where the bullet originated from, only that his car was struck by it when he was leaving his 'old' office to come home.  I drove in a torrential downpour to pick him up. (I know I shouldn't have been taking pictures as I drove)In an effort to save money when possible, I planned a stop at a grocery store in Maryland that was having a pretty good sale.  But when I went into the store, nothing in the flier that I had brought with me was on sale.  When I went to customer service and asked about it, the manager looked at the ad and pointed out that the flier was dated exactly a month ago.  We both had a nice little chuckle and I've decided that I've got to clean my car out more....It was good to get home where the dogs never point out my dumb mistakes! ~Hamlet~  ~Josh~I don't think Charlie would notice anyway...~Charlie~﻿"},

She has so many people that look out for her, so I'm sure she'll be just fine. Our weekend was relatively quiet because of the weather.  Carl did try to catch up on the mowing.   I'm thinking we may need to get the cows across the road to help if he's not able to get ahead of it.  Problems with mice in our barn have been resolved by the arrival of a black snake that's about 4 feet long.  I know it's supposed to be a 'good snake,' which to me, is a contradiction in terms, but I asked Carl to evict it, which he did.  I also asked him to take a couple of pictures for me, because there was no way I was going any where near it.  I'd much rather be sitting on my porch taking pictures of the deer.... The butterflies....The flowers...And of course the dogs.  Thank-you all for the good wishes for Hamlet.  The pain medication seems to be helping.  He is up and around a bit more, which is a good sign.   He's even smiling...Which is also a good way to start our week!  I hope yours is off to a good start too!"},

The errands that I ran afterwards were made easier when I threw a handful of crackers behind me and the dogs forgot about wanting to jump out the door when I opened it.  It was good news for Sam. Some of you have seen on Facebook where Sam has lost 14 pounds since his last visit.  He contributes his weight loss to healthy eating, lots of exercise and not snacking too much in between meals!  He makes it sound so easy! The other two pups, Sheba was there to have her eye rechecked and Bubba for blood-work so he can continue taking the Rimadyl for his arthritis.~Hamlet~The other pup I had with me was Hamlet.  I've not really mentioned anything about him lately and thought I'd give you an update since I know that there are some of you who are pretty fond of him. I don't quite know where to start.  As you know, he had his last surgery in late November.  Since that 2nd surgery he's been taking Chinese herbs to slow the return of the tumor.  In comparing the time that has passed when he was taking the herbs verses when he wasn't taking them, I really feel that they have worked pretty well and have given him some good time.  But the tumor has returned, just as we knew it would.  What was once the size of the palm of one hand, is now the size of both hands, and is growing relatively quickly.  There has been a change in Hamlet in the past week.  While he still has a great appetite, is very much a part of the group and my shadow on our walks and around the house, his energy level has dropped.  When he's resting, I notice him breathing heavily, and sleeping more soundly.   The vet recommended we put Hamlet back on pain medication, in case he may be having come discomfort.  I don't know what any of this means, and don't feel that another surgery is an option...I just hope that when the time comes to make any decision on the path to take, we'll both know.  Send some hope and prayers for Hamlet if you think about it, okay? ~Hamlet~ ﻿﻿ ~Hamlet~﻿﻿Carl returned to his old but new job this week.  On Thursday he called my office and I was unable to come to the phone.  But he left a message asking me to call him back, and said that there had been an incident at work, but he was okay.  Of course since 'worry' is my middle name, I was worried.  The problem with calling him back was that he hadn't given me his new work number.  Carl and I don't work to far from one another and just as a coincidence I noticed a helicopter overhead in his direction--which didn't help.  I did know that he wouldn't answer his cell phone because he's not allowed to bring it into the office--that didn't help either.  Carl finally called me about an hour later and told me what happened; two suspicious packages found in an unmarked, unattended van on the outside gate of the building where he works--Police and trucks everywhere....He asked why I didn't call him back.  I told him it was because I didn't have his office phone number.  Carl said it was the same number he'd always had (before he left on his 'year long assignment.')  Now I ask, how was I supposed to know that he would return to the same desk and have the same phone number?  I guess there are some things I'm just supposed to know...﻿ ~Toby~﻿"},

(I'm really thinking I should run a contest to see who can guess how many times I'll have gotten it by Labor Day in September!)  Thank-fully it's starting to clear up.  But it didn't stop an 11 year old patient from joking about it--He asked me, 'what do you get if you cross a four leaf clover with poison ivy?

However, that may be changing.  When I came home today I found a package in our mailbox, from The Rocky Creek Scotties!  I'd guessed several weeks ago when a litter of Scottish Terriers would be arriving--There were 2 winners in the puppy-pool, and I was one of them!  If you want a real moment of cuteness, hop over to Rocky Creek Scotties (click on the name) and pay them a visit--The puppies are now almost a month old and are growing and changing so fast!  I've really become smitten with them, and while I think the girls are adorable, for some reason, I'm drawn to the little boys.......But the package is full of lots of tasty treats for our pups, a couple of new toys and a few fun things for me too!!  Thank-you Rocky Creek Scotties for letting us be part of your puppy pool and for the fun package!! Finally I'm looking forward to a quiet weekend of catching up on things around the house, your blogs and just relaxing.  After a year, this is Carl's last weekend at his current job assignment, and he returns to a regular job with the Department of Defense on Monday.  We're really excited that he'll no longer be working a rotating shift that included nights and weekends.  I hope whatever you are doing this weekend, that it's an enjoyable one!!~Hamlet~"},

I had so hoped that the news would have been better for her.  Blood work that was done last week, showed significant changes in all the wrong places this week; her blood pressure was so low that the techs had problems drawing blood.  An x-ray taken showed a mass in her abdomen the size of a small cantaloupe and she was bleeding internally.  The kind thing to do, was to let her go.  Carl brought her home and spent the day with her.  I was at work hoping for a miracle.  I'd hoped Sandy would be able to enjoy the warmth of the sun on our front porch.  I'd hoped she'd be able to enjoy the walks around our property and the chance to lay in the green grass.  I'd hoped to be able to take more pictures of her.  I'd hoped we'd have more time to get to know one another...But it was what I wanted, and not what was meant to be.  We sat with Sandy as her sweet, quiet soul left this world for the next.  This evening after we left the vets office, we saw this rainbow.  God speed Sandy.    Even though we hardly knew you, we won't forget you. I'm at work, and just thought I'd post an update on Sandy.  Blood work, x-rays all point to a diagnosis of hemangiosarcoma  Those of you who have had dogs with this, know how suddenly it can and does occur, and that there is sadly nothing that can be done.  After I speak to the rescue and get the needed 'approval' we'll say our good-byes and send her to the Rainbow Bridge.Thank-you all for your positive thoughts and prayers for Sandy.  I know she has just come to us, and we hardly know her, but I'd hoped for more time..."},

{"title": "Blogging Friends - Among the Best!", "date": "Monday, May 2, 2011", "text": "A busy and tiring Monday was forgotten about when I came home this evening and found a package waiting for me.  Inside the box, a very special gift from Tina from the blog One Wild Swan  ﻿who so thoughtfully and without my knowing, painted a portrait of our beloved Tanner who left us in March.  I've been following Tina's blog for some time and each time she posts one of her portraits, I am in awe of her talent and how each piece she creates is brought to life.  I think this is what she did in her painting of Tanner; she captured his sweet spirit and kind soul.  I have found myself drawn to Tanner's eyes in the portrait and remembering how gentle they were...I am so touched by Tina's thoughtfulness for a gift that has become a treasure.  Thank-you again Tina for your beautiful gift that has truly touched my heart and soul.    Tina's gift reminds me of how blessed I am to have her friendship and yours.  Even though I've never met any of you, I feel like I have because of your blogs.  You have given me a glimpse into your lives, told me about places I'll never get to visit, and shown kindness that I'll always be grateful for--Thank-you for that!  If you'd like to visit Tina's blog, here's the link:http://onewildswan.blogspot.com/When I agreed to let Sandy come here, I was told that getting her to us wouldn't occur until at least the middle of the week.  But the sun and the moon lined up perfectly and I think before I could change my mind, a ride for Sandy to my neck of the woods was arranged.I met the transport in Frederick Maryland at a local McDonalds.  I was told that Sandy hadn't eaten the night before and very little that morning.  She's on medication for an intestinal problems, so it was thought that this might be the reason for the lack of appetite.  However I had an appetite and decided I would grab something to eat on the way home. Sandy had been laying in the back of the van, and went I pulled up to place my order, suddenly Sandy was standing there wagging her tail, ready to give her order.  Obviously she's been to a drive-thru before!  I shared a little of what I had with her and she and I are now good friends! Introductions were met with a few growls from Sandy, but otherwise its been a quiet evening.  Sandy is used to being an only dog and living in the group home will no doubt be a little of an adjustment for her.  But she's a sweet little lady with spark and a continually wagging tail!Medically, I don't know what will happen.  Sandy has cancerous tumors called 'epulis,' in her mouth.  That's why her upper lip and teeth look a little uneven. She also has some other ongoing health issues and last year the vet and the previous owners were going to euthanize her, why they didn't, I don't know.  But what I do know is that Sandy doesn't feel well.  She's very slow moving because she does seem to have a bit of arthritis in her hips--So when she did something she never had done before such as snapping at a child that fell right on top of her, was that a reason to send her away?"},

The birds were feeling industrious too.  Each year as the dogs start to shed, I collect some of their hair and put it out for the birds to use in their nests. Yesterday the 'Titmouse' was collecting some.  I like the thought that the hair from my dogs will be keeping baby birds warm. While a couple of the dogs watched from the porch, I also got some weeding done. Readers of this blog may recall that poison ivy and I don’t mix well.  I know that it's growing in my flower beds and I 'think' I know what it looks like.  While I avoided what I 'think' it is, I know that there was no way to not come in contact with it. I used a special soap to wash off the oils afterwards, and this morning despite a few blotches, I think I've avoided getting it....This time...Afterwards we took a walk up into the field in back of us.~Hamlet~Today is supposed to be a quiet one. We 'might' be getting a new addition to our crew in the next couple of days.  A senior Golden, who is about 13 years old, named Sandy needs a hospice-home without stairs for the time she has left. The rescue was unable to find a place for her to go and asked us. For once, I really, really resisted because our lives will be undergoing some changes over the next few months (I'll write about them very soon).  I asked them to work and find another place for Sandy.  The family from the rescue that has her, decided that they did not want her to stay with them, and the rescue was unable to find another foster home. The rescue communicates almost totally via e-mail.  So an unusual step was taken and an actual phone call was made to me to ask again.  I'd had a feeling this might happen and I'd already given it a lot of thought and discussed it at length with Carl.  So after talking to this volunteer about it and discussing how to get her here from the state of Delaware, I agreed.  Sandy is not in the best of condition right now.  But in my heart I knew that I couldn't say 'no' to a Golden Retriever that needs a place to go, especially one that's not feeling well.  Below is a picture of Hamlet this morning on the back porch.  As he stood there looking so relaxed and was sniffing the air, the feeling came over me that bringing Sandy here is the right thing to do."},

I delayed the morning walk with the dogs until Carl got home from work and the storm passed.  In our yard we found this cow-bird.  My guess is that it was a casualty from the storm.  When we tried to catch it, it did fly some, but not much.Carl finally caught it and we put it into the field next to us to keep it safe from the dogs until it can regain its strength.  I have to admit to not liking cow-birds.  They are actually the very reason why I've cut back on feeding the birds.  They come in flocks, gobble down everything and chase the little birds away.  But as it sometimes is with  people, you put all those feelings aside and do what you can to help. Running errands this morning, I saw that the creeks are full and some of the fields are flooded.  Water was across the road in some places as well. On my way home, I found this little terrapin trying to cross the road. I don't know if this little guy wanted my help or not, but it got it, because I always stop and and pick them up. I think it knew it was safer in its shell because it never came out, but looked at us from the inside.   Maybe a couple of the dogs thinking I had a snack for them was the reason....When I was a kid and we would see a terrapin on the road, my Mom would stop the car and either me or one of my siblings would pick it up and either set it well across the road, or we'd take it to a place where it would be safe.  My Mom always told us when we let it go to wish it good luck...Afterwards she'd always ask us if we did that. So, of course when I let this one go in our woods, I wished it 'good luck' Funny what you can remember from so long ago...I hope if any of you have been caught in these storms, that you've had 'good luck' and are safe too!~Sheba~"},

So you can imagine how my interest was peaked when I read in the paper a couple of weeks ago about a 'new' Easter tradition, deep fried Cadbury Creme Eggs--I could tell in reading about them that they are an important part of a balanced diet and are a terrific source of sugar, calories, and saturated fat.  I could also tell that they greatly reduce the chances of avoiding a heart attack. I knew I had to try them.  So, with Carl working, I decided today was the day to give this nutritional goodness a try.  They weren't too bad--I think the secret is to eat them while they're still warm.  They tasted a little soggy when cold.  But I have to wonder just what'll they think of next? ﻿ ~Bubba (left) Toby (right)~﻿ I'd like to thank everyone for the good thoughts for Bubba. He didn't have any seizures last night. But he did have one mid morning today. If I saw the clock correctly, it lasted 6 minutes. His seizures seem to come in 3's, so I'm hoping that'll be the last of them for now. Amazing how afterwards he continues on like nothing has happened. If only I could do the same! Sheba's eye is much better too.  The swelling on her eye as you can see is almost totally gone.  So I think our day is ending on a good note, with the help of deep-fried Cadbury Creme eggs!HAPPY EASTER!!"},

A good thing since Bubba has had 2 seizures this evening.  I looked at the clock when they started and noted that they lasted 3 and 5 minutes.  When Bubba has a seizure to keep him  from injuring himself, especially if he is on the wood floor, I  place a folded towel under his head to cushion his thrashing and catch the drool.  He also loses control of his bladder and so I put a towel on top of him because I don't want the floor to be slippery when he tries to stand.  If there's a lot of noise or light I'll turn down the lights and turn off  any music or the television.  While he is still lying there I pet and  talk to him and reassure him (and me!) that everything is 'okay.'  I think it might help to give  him something to focus on.  Of course I hope he doesn't have any more, he's exhausted.  Thankfully Bubba always sleeps on the floor on my side of the bed and I'll hopefully know if he does.  It may be a long night..."},

{"title": "Will They Stay and the Stray", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2011", "text": "﻿﻿﻿Another non-eventful but busy work week coming to an end. I thought Spring was going to remain, but Old Man Winter remains tough and determined and is threatening us with snow flurries for the weekend. ﻿ ~Toby~﻿ I've been waiting to hear back from the rescue about our foster boys, The Chub Brothers, Bubba and Toby. No, we've not officially adopted them and so they are still 'owned' by the rescue. I've known since they got here last June that they probably weren't going anywhere, but I just never did anything to make sure they would be staying.  Then when I wasn't asked for several months about them, along with all that was going on with Hamlet and Tanner, it just was easier to put it all on the back-burner.  But I came back onto the rescues radar a couple of weeks ago when I was asked about them, and if or when they would be put up for adoption, since that's the goal.  However we're facing a dilemma with Bubba. For one day about every 2 months or so, he'll have 2-3 grand-mal seizures. I've spoken to my vet about them, and I don't feel like it's time yet to put him on medication for them; but I know there may well be a time when the seizures will become more frequent and he will need to be. Along with Toby he is also unable to do flights of stairs. ﻿﻿~Bubba~﻿﻿The 'adoptability' of both dogs in my mind is in question. The Chub brothers are a bonded pair and so one cannot be adopted without the other.  Can anyone be found (beside me) willing to take on a pair of 11 year olds that can't do stairs and one that has medical issues?  Add to that the expense of nearly $100 monthly for Bubba's medication for arthritis.  Having placed dogs for about 10 years now, I have my doubts about someone being found that will fill the needs for both these boys.  Thinking ahead, I know that we can't incur the expense of both dogs.  But I have offered to adopt Toby and take on his expenses if the rescue will allow Bubba to remain in our home as a 'long term foster dog.'  Meaning that he would remain in our home for the rest of his life and all his medical expenses would be paid for by the rescue.  I felt it was a fair offer.  However I know how the rescue sometimes operates and I know that 'politics' always goes along with this type of thing (which is why I prefer to stay on the sidelines) so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I've heard from no one.  In other news, the 'stray cat' that I last saw in January sometime has returned.  I was so happy to see it!!  It came close to the house so this is the first time I've gotten a really good look at it.  I think that it's a pretty cat and a relatively young cat too.  And while this picture doesn't really show it, it's a little on the thin side as well.  The poor thing was eating the bird seed and stalking birds--So guess what I did?  Yes, even though I knew it would run off, I sent Carl out right away with a plate of food for it.    Paws crossed for 'it' to find the food and that the Chub Brothers can stay with us..."},

{"title": "From Darkness to Gray to Light", "date": "Thursday, March 17, 2011", "text": "I know that it's natural that it has been a sad week for me as I've come to accept the loss of Tanner--Times filled with the realization that I'll never see him sleeping in the hallway, hear his 'woof's' as I get dinner ready, keeping track of him when we're all out for a walk, picking up his medications from the pharmacy...In the quiet times filled with grief, I've been comforted by the very kind thoughtful, encouraging e-mails and comments left by you on my blog, yours and others on Facebook.  Thank-you doesn't seem like enough as I've read and re-read them several times, feeling your friendship and support.  Through it all, I've looked for that sign that everything was okay.  That Tanner was okay.  I've waited and watched and hoped that I would know it when and if it came...On Monday evening I was fixing dinner for the dogs, and as I was lost in a moment of silence and sadness, outside I heard a single goose honking as it flew over the house...The next morning I saw a fox pouncing and playing in the field.  When I stopped and watched it, it also stopped and looked at me...Then there was the cardinal singing so loud and beautifully at the end of the day, was that the sign?  I thought maybe it was a single daffodil that is blooming...Then again, maybe the sign came from Wendy, who always came in right before Tanner after our walks.  On Tuesday as I was getting everyone inside, I was thinking of him and Wendy hesitated and stared at me for a moment, cocked her head, barked twice, then went up the steps. Then on my commute this week the words of a song from 1984 that I've heard 3 times on the radio says,  \"After my picture fades and darkness has turned to grayWatching through windows you're wondering if I'm okay. Secrets stolen from deep inside, the drum beats out of timeIf you're lost you can look and you will find me, time after time...\" ﻿Could that have been it?  Is all of this 'the sign' telling me that Tanner is okay?  Finally, today when Carl and I had all the dogs outside this afternoon, we took a walk up to the field in back of our house.  I marveled at what a warm, beautiful spring day it was.  In the distance across the field at the edge of the pond was a blonde Golden Retriever.  It was unusual to see a dog because we typically don't see other dogs--However the people on the other side of the field have them too.  But I became caught up in the beauty of the moment and how stunning the golden looked as it stood there peacefully sniffing the air.  The thought again crossed my mind about Tanner and the hope that he was okay...I continued to watch the golden as it explored...Then I realized the dog that I was watching was actually our girl Rudi...She'd taken a moment and wandered off...That little sneak...Back to reality, home and our life that goes on without Tanner, but with good memories of him that cannot be taken away."},

As you know, we had been giving him medication to try and control his laryngeal paralysis. Last evening when we returned from Tennessee, in the excitement he had problems breathing, but I was able to get him to relax by taking him for a ride in the van. This evening, he again had problems catching his breath and something told me that this time it was different. I put him in the van and I drove the entire distance to the animal emergency clinic; his breathing had not improved. After what seemed like an eternity a vet called me back and rambled on with a grim diagnosis, treatment options and possibilities. I'm not sure of all that he said, but I totally understood that when Tanner was taken off the oxygen for even a few minutes it again made it worse for him. In my heart I knew that the kind thing to do was to let him go...There was little time for a good-bye as I held Tanner thanking him for being a part of our life...He quietly left this life for the next taking a part of my heart with him and leaving part of his with me.  Tanner was with us for almost 3 years and was about 14 years old. Our time with him wasn't nearly long enough--But I know that when we see him again, we will have all the time together that we didn't get in this life. I hope he will be met at the bridge by our pups Tod, Ben, Cougar, Kasey, Tosh, Tucker, Scout, Cubby, Logan, my beloved Cowboy and Maguire...When I returned home a candle was already burning...Did Carl know before he went to work?   God speed Tanner..."},

Today, it feels like February again and there may be a rainy snow mix at the start of the work week. The high winds that have been wreaking havoc around us the last couple of days toppled our nation's live Christmas Tree. It had stood on the Ellipse since 1978, and had been through five different presidencies in its time. Thankfully here, we've not lost our power and had no damage to any of our trees, other than a few small branches.   This morning, it was our cat, CC's turn to go to the vet. She was one year past her yearly exam and needed a rabies vaccine. My thought to get her to the vet was put on the front burner when a couple of nights ago, she was outside growling at something. This afternoon, I did spot this visitor. Although it's February and it's a skunks-month for finding romance, I'm hopeful that it will want to be alone and not stay around--As you know, nothing says I want to be alone quite like an atomized sulfur cloud does!  The dogs however don't know that.  They are still rolling on the exact spot where the dead mole was picked up 3 days ago.

Winning 'Best In Show at Westminster' has become the most-coveted award in the dog show world. I've always enjoyed watching the show, and seeing and hearing about all the different breeds of dogs. It always reminds me of another dog show that I attended a few years ago in Gettysburg  Pennsylvania. The Golden Retriever Club of America was having their national event. Golden Retrievers from all over the United States came to compete in everything from conformation to obedience. One of the events held during the week was called 'The Rescue Parade.' Since our Golden Retriever Club was hosting 'the National' as president of the rescue, I was asked to take charge of 'The Rescue Parade.' For those of you who have never attended one, I find it to be a very touching event. It is one where rescued dogs have their moment to be the star and in the spotlight.  As they walk around the center show ring, their story of rescue is told. We start with the oldest Golden and end with the youngest.  When I did the parade, each dog was given a rosette (ribbon) with their name and a toy as they left the ring. Ed Rendell, the Governor of Pennsylvania even participated by bringing his 2 rescued Golden Retrievers.~Sheba~﻿At the start of the parade, the gentleman, named Bob, who was announcing the event said something, that to me, was so poignant and I've never forgotten it. He said that 'the dogs that were about to enter the show-ring will never win best in show. But what they had won, was a place in our hearts and home.' Bob was so right. No, the dogs that most of us have never will compete for the coveted title of Best in Show at Westminster or win any other dog show.  But to me, my dogs and I will always have something better than that, each other.

The whole incident, that is so trivial, sophomoric and ridiculous has left me again stunned and hurt by their actions towards me. I'm worn out from it all...But in the quiet moments of the morning I really do try to remain positive and remember the good things in my life. I received an unexpected note yesterday from the son of a co-worker.  He's in his last year of high school and had a class assignment to compare two of the newspapers in the area, The Washington Post, and The Washington Times. He was a bit frantic because despite looking everywhere and calling everyone, a copy of The Times could not be found.  But I happened to be at a local store, saw the paper and bought a copy for him.

These sounds are more pronounced and prolonged when he's excited or stressed. On Wednesday as the storm was starting to roll in I got the dogs outside, and something caused Tanner to not be able to catch his breath.  After several minutes of nothing more than a squeak from him as he tried to inhale, he started foaming from the mouth, his tongue and gums turned gray, and he collapsed. You know as well as I do that time is critical and I knew I had to get him to the animal emergency.  He was totally limp and I somehow managed to get him in the van.  Typically the drive would take about 20 minutes but with the storm, the road conditions were quickly deteriorating.  I tried to not panic but I have to admit that I really thought he was going to die before I got there--Along the way the sounds stopped all together.  I pulled over on the side of the road opened Tanner's mouth and pulled on his tongue and I heard and saw him take in a breath.   In just a minute or two he had his head up and by the time I got to the animal emergency Tanner was fine...The vet, no bigger than a pencil and looked to be about 12 years old, did an exam and x-rays.  She gave him an injection of a steroid in case he aspirated fluid or irritated his vocal cords.  Within the hour we were on our way home with the instructions to keep him quiet.  Other than his bark sounding a bit hoarse, he's been just fine.   Yesterday afternoon Carl and I finished clearning out the last of the snow from our driveway.  We had the dogs outside with us and someone stopped by. Tanner became excited and just as a precaution I got him inside and away from the commotion--I figure that it's better to be safe than...well, you know...   All in all a quiet weekend for us.  Another storm is predicted for Tuesday, but there won't be a snow-dance for this one.  I think we have enough snow, at least for right now.  I thought I'd end this post with a picture of Hamlet.  I thought he looked a bit regal standing in the snow."},

So with another snow fall predicted we decided to take matters into our own hands (and paws) and get that snow to come.  Since we all know that there is often some amount of truth found in legends, we have decided to put the student rituals to the test. It started with the ceremonial snow-dance.  Sheba excels at this, so we had her do it. One of the most popular ways that is said to get the snow to come is that you should wear your pajamas inside out.  Since Hamlet is the only dog that wears clothing, we put his shirt on inside out...Yet another way is to throw ice-cubes down the toilet...Well, I improvised on that one, and I just put them on the ground... The dogs promptly ate them...I hope it will still count... It is also traditional to put a spoon under your pillow...I put one under a dog bed but Tanner found it...And finally Charlie dug a hole...Okay that wasn't one, but he had a good time and we all figured that it couldn't hurt...We'll see if it works!But if you know of something else we should try, let us know, okay--We're game!Stay tuned!!!"},

I really appreciate your friendship and have enjoyed following your blogs!~ The rules of the award are that I'm to tell you 7 things about myself that you may not know, and pass it on.  I'll tell you my 'seven things' but I'm going to break the rule and not pass it onto any of you in particular--This is because I know some of you are suffering from 'blog-writers-block' so (please) take this award and use it for your next post until your inspiration returns!   Here goes my seven things you may not know about me...1.  You may not know...that dogs were not my favorite animal growing up, cats were.  We always had a family dog, but our cats were what I adored and couldn't get enough of.   ~My brother John and I--I was about 5 years old~﻿﻿﻿2.  You may not know...that I can be obsessive compulsive.  I constantly change and redo things, trying to make it perfect.  Even when I make comments on your blogs, I often rewrite my comment several times before I actually post it--Sometimes I just have to hit 'publish' and close your blog and not look back even when I know there may be a mistake, it's how I keep my 'OCD' in check.3.  You may not know...that I collect rocks...My Mom used to paint them. 4.  You may not know...that I am six-feet tall.  5.  You may not know...that I have never been to Disney World.  My sister-in-law has worked for Disney for more than 30 years, and I could get in for free and have a place to stay, but I've never gone.   6.  You may not know...that I love secrets.  However since I was a kid, I've had a hard time keeping them, and still do...But I think this is why among my favorite books are the 'Post Secret' books where people create a post card and send in their secrets anonymously--I'll let you in on a secret, on an impulse, I did this, and mine was published in the last book.       7.  You may not know...that I really enjoy being with friends, but my favorite place to be is at home--I'll bet you already knew that!There's no snow in sight for us in Virginia, just more hand-freezing temperatures!  If it's cold where you are, I hope you're doing what my cat CC is doing and staying warm!  Or, if you are enjoying your warm weather, send some in this direction, okay?"},

However, some states also honor other men in history as well. The Commonwealth Of Virginia (where I live) on the Friday before, celebrates Lee-Jackson Day, a state-holiday to mark Robert E. Lee’s birthday and Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson. Both of these men were natives of Virginia and served as Generals for the Confederacy during the Civil War. Lee-Jackson Day became more of a controversy when, for a time, it coincided with the celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s birth, during that time (only in Virginia) it was called Lee-Jackson-King Day. When I first moved to Virginia the idea of Lee-Jackson-King Day seemed, to me anyway, to be a bit of a contradiction. While Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson may well have been honorable men, they fought on the side of a nation founded principally on the idea that one race of man was inferior to another and that human beings could be owned as property. I thought 'combining' it with the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., for some reason, just didn’t seem right--At least not to me.  ﻿ ~Toby~﻿ ﻿﻿﻿So if you are observing 'Martin Luther King Day,' and got the day off, or if you are like Carl and I and it's 'just another Monday,' and have to work, I hope your week is off to a good start!  I think mine may very well be--Snow is in the forecast! ﻿ ~Toby and Bubba~ ﻿"},

I don't know if the cold is affecting his mostly bare skin, but I don't want the area where he had surgery to become irritated and sore.)     ﻿ ~Hamlet~The week has also had me thinking just how useful our dogs are. While much of what they do is obvious to those of us who share our lives with them, a few things they do are sometimes overlooked and taken for granted.  Aside from serving as guardians of our home, our dogs have  expanded their duties to include barking at trees or anything else nearby that may be a threat.  They are also the greeting committee.  This afternoon when a UPS truck pulled into our driveway, 3 of the dogs jumped right into the truck to greet the driver, who thankfully wasn't afraid of them.  Our crew are also my companions when we go hunting--Even though I don't know what we're hunting for when we go on our walks, they usually let me know when they've found it by rolling in it, or eating it. ﻿ ~Carl and Tanner returning home~﻿ ﻿But the most valuable role they have played, at least today, was helping me to find a couple of things that were lost.  This morning when we had the dogs out for their morning walk, Carl thought I was keeping track of Tanner.  Since I had my camera to take pictures, I thought he was. Needless to say when the walk was over, we realized neither of us was. Typically Tanner will follow the route that we always take on our walks and is easy enough to find. But this morning he must've gotten distracted by something because we couldn't find him. A bit of a frantic search was helped by Rudi who has demonstrated more than once that she seems to understand what 'find Tanner' means because I followed her and she found him for us. ~Tanner~﻿As if that wasn't enough, a little later this morning as I was putting on some earrings, I dropped one--it was not just any earring I dropped, but one of my diamond earrings that belonged to my Mother. A careful search on hands and knees for several minutes turned up nothing. Just as I was about to give up, Charlie started sniffing at something buried within the down-filled dog bed, and I realized it was my earring.  I felt another huge sense of relief!Now that things have settled down this afternoon, and evening is approaching, I'm wondering if with all of the dogs we have, if there is one or two among them who can help me find more time?"},

According to southern folklore, the first food to be eaten on New Year's Day for luck and prosperity for the year ahead are black-eyed peas. From grand gourmet dinners to small casual gatherings with friends and family, these legumes are traditionally offered. The practice of eating black-eyed peas for luck is believed to date back to the Civil War. They were first planted as food for livestock, and later as a food staple for slaves in the South. The fields of black-eyed peas were ignored as Sherman's troops destroyed or stole other crops, giving the humble, black-eyed pea an important role as a major food source for surviving Confederates. However it got started, traditions change and morph over the years. But there is no doubt that eating black-eyed peas is a truth held sacred by many southerners who may never touch a black-eyed pea at any other time of the year. But a little luck never hurt anyone, right? So here’s to 2011!! (And it’s still not too late to go get your black-eyed peas!)"},

I started the day by making cinnamon rolls in a cast-iron frying pan. The pan belonged to my Grandfather, and my Mom gave it to me more than 20 years ago. I'm starting to see more recipes using cast-iron, (the one for the rolls called for one) and I've even seen pans for sale at Macys. I'm wondering if like everything else, they are bringing back the old ideas and calling them new ones--They do that with everything else, so why not with cookware?    I'm sure most of you have heard of the Christmas myth known as \"The Night the Animals Talk\". Supposedly, on Christmas Eve, for a time, the animals can speak. My Mom told me about this many years ago and about how her numerous attempts to sneak down to the barn to find out if this was true was foiled by her parents. This time of the year always brings this back to mind.  I have thought that it would be interesting to hear what our dogs and the cat would say if they could speak to us.  Yesterday I think I was given this chance.  The mornings for Hamlet seem to be the time that he is the most playful.  Christmas morning was no exception. He seemed to have a bit more of a spark as he pranced around me for attention. As I was talking to him and giving him pats and scratches, Hamlet quickly turned around and with a wagging tail, he looked at me and barked.  It was just a single bark and because I've never heard him do this before, of course I was a little surprised.  But just as the myth had said, I understood what he said perfectly."},

But if anyone knows the solution to this problem, or what has caused it, I'd so appreciate your letting me know.  ***After I posted this, my blog crashed and I lost 10 posts and ALL of the comments.  I've been able to get the posts back up, but the comments are yet to be retrieved...What was that I said about frustration?!*** The second plague is the weather.  We've been hampered by wind, cold and snow this week.  Not much snow is needed to make 'real' Virginians miserable.  Even though we lived in Alaska for 10 years and Wisconsin before that, I am now like the rest of the people here in the 'Old Dominion' that has difficulty dealing with the smallest amounts of snow.   The third plague that I've dealt with is just lack of time.  Carl is working nights this week, leaving me as a 'single parent' in the evenings.  The crew loves that someone is home all of the time and they can spend more time outdoors.Hamlet (pictured with Toby) continues to do really well!  I can tell he feels good too.  The staples have been removed and he has healed up just fine!   Finally, despite all of the rush and frustration something has happened.  I'll start by saying how very grateful I am to those of you who understood what I tried so hard to articulate in my last post.  I have read your comments several times from that post.  You all were right in what you said.  I just needed to hear it. One of my favorite Christmas stories is Dr. Seuss's 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas.'  You'll recall in the story after the Grinch has stolen every last thing, the Whos wake up on Christmas morning to sing in the town square despite having nothing.  This causes the Grinch to question the basis of his nefarious plan. He then realizes that Christmas is not about the gifts or the decorations.  It is not about the amount of food on the dining room table. It is about friendship and love for all. This is what has happened to me.  I realize that this Christmas season I have been given the extraordinary gift of friendship from people all over the world that I've never personally met, but feel like I know.  Your gifts have come via e-mail and the postal service and I find myself humbled and grateful for the Christmas spirit that you have brought into my 'Grinchy heart' and our home."},
{"title": "Where Are You Christmas?", "date": "Monday, December 13, 2010", "text": "This morning I have something to say that has nothing to do with the dogs...It's all about me...I'll start with telling a secret that I don't tell very many people. It's that I love Christmas. It's my favorite time of the year. I love sending and receiving Christmas cards and little packages in the mail. I love the magic, and the glow that everything has, and that for one small part of the year, people are willing to give and to create joy for others. But here it is, less than two weeks before Christmas, and I'm not feeling it. I have looked within myself to find that inner child who loves the lights and the songs and the giving and you know what? She seems to be sleeping. Or maybe she wandered off.I don't know quite why it is, but I am just not excited about Christmas this year. I've not put up a single decoration, we don't have a tree, and I haven't done any of my shopping yet. I've not even baked anything. And while I've enjoyed reading about the traditions, plans and memories so many of you have, deep down, I'm just not enjoying the season this year.Maybe it's because I'm tired. I feel as though I've spent the last few months running, filling every spare moment of my time. I have been better about saying no however--I actually turned down taking in a 13 year old Golden last week. But my free time seems to be packed full. I keep telling myself it's only for a few more weeks, and then things will calm down. But I'm starting to realize that there is no calm. Finding some 'extra' time right now will get to be a little more difficult because for the rest of the year to I'll be working every day because another co-worker will be off.  Carl is also working nights, which includes Christmas Eve and day. I know I'll continue to be in a mad rush.   So I don't know if any one of these things, or a combination of all of them is keeping me from getting in to Christmas this year. But really, if we were to skip it all together, I kind of think I'd be okay with it. But I'm really hoping that I'll get into the mood this coming week. I pick up my cards today and I have some plans to do a few things. Maybe that'll help. We'll see.I really hope that you're getting ready and waiting for Christmas morning, with better spirits than I am at the moment.  However, being the eternal optimist I have to believe that for me this will all change.  Stay tuned..."},
{"title": "Mismatched Week and Mismatched Socks", "date": "Friday, December 10, 2010", "text": "It’s officially winter here in Virginia! Last week we were enjoying seasonably warm weather but fast forward to this week and the cold winds have been howling and we even had a little bit of snow today. I've been enjoying the last couple of planned days off work.  I've not been feeling well, so it's nice to have a break.  Yesterday I was all set to take Tanner to see the opthamologist for a 4 month check up.  For once I was running on time, even taking him beforehand to the groomer for a nail-trim.  I called the office to confirm the time and was told that Tanner's appointment was today...So much for the good planning...We arrived today a little late.  Tanner's eye pressure is unchanged and the exam showed everything was fine, good news!  Today Tanner was seen by 2 Opthamologist, one was a man I'd never met before--He was a very tall, husky man that I figure was in his mid 50's.  He didn't introduce himself, so I'm guessing he was an opthamologist.  But when he sat down I noticed that he wore mismatched socks, one was light green, the other was dark brown.  He also wore a wrinkled white oxford shirt that had streaks of gray running through it. I really tried not to stare, but I know that I was.  He was such a contrast to the crisp white coat and neat appearance of the 'lady opthamologist' and the assistant that I couldn't help myself.  I had to wonder if he needed HIS eyes checked...  On a final note, Hamlet is feeling really well and I feel like the last couple of days we have the 'old' Hamlet back!  The drains have been removed, and he's finally leaving the surgery site alone so for now he's not wearing the e-collar.  I do think he'll continue to wear a shirt and shoe for now.  But he is up and around much more and has returned to our room at night to sleep. Notice in the last picture of Hamlet that he is laying on his 'surgery side.'  It was the first time I'd seen him do that, and I think it has to be a good sign. I've started him back on the Chinese herbs in hopes that perhaps they will do some good this time. I know it's doing us 'some good' to see him feeling like the Hamlet we so very much adore!"},

{"title": "A Final Decision for Hamlet", "date": "Saturday, December 4, 2010", "text": "Cold and wind has arrived in Virginia bringing with it temps just above freezing.  Areas to the south of us are having a bit of snow.  We have blue skies and sunshine, at least today.  I took Hamlet (pictured with Wendy on the right) to the vet this cold morning to have the drains removed.  We have decided to wait to do that on Monday because there's still draining.  The final culture results were returned on Wednesday and my vet called me and discussed the options.  Today we discussed everything again.   While the surgeon removed the area of infection, because he couldn't remove everything (without removing Hamlet's leg) there is concern that the bacteria might still be present in Hamlet's system after this surgery.  We wonder if this is why there was a recurrence of infection after the first surgery, because we didn't use the right antibiotics to get rid of the bacteria--But this is just a guess...The culture that was done before the surgery identified 3 bacteria which are immune to most antibiotics.  One medication that Hamlet is currently taking (zenquin) will get rid of 2 of the bacteria.  The 3rd one however is a strain of e-coli and the only medication that will work to get rid of it is an antibiotic called Amikacin. It is a very strong medication that has a lot of side effects that could occur such as kidney damage, hearing loss, vestibular (balance) disorders. There may also be facial swelling, pain at the injection site, allergic reactions, vomiting, diarrhea, blood disorders, or liver disorders...It goes without saying that Hamlet would have to be monitored very closely by the vet during treatment because old dogs are particularly susceptible to the side effects.  I've thought a lot about all of this the last few days.  I've thought of what my goals are for Hamlet and what my hopes are for him.  At the top of the list is for Hamlet to be able to enjoy the days he has left and be comfortable and free from pain.  I feel strongly that he's been through enough.  I think Hamlet needs to rest and enjoy the time he has left with us in peace, not be poked and prodded and ill from the side-effects of medications.  So I've decided to continue with the one antibiotic that will get rid of two of the bacteria, and not risk putting him on the Amikacin.  I don't know what's ahead for Hamlet.  But tonight for the first time this week while I was eating my dinner in front of the tv, Hamlet came to me looking for a small bite of what I was having.  I think and I so hope I've made the right choice."},

Nothing unusual about that, but in the moments when no one was around, she pick up a sample or two, quickly turn around and eat them.  It gave me a grin and I quickly snapped her picture with my cell phone when I walked past. The next stop was to a jewelers to have my watch repaired.  As I stood there waiting, a young gentleman who looked to be about 25 named Jared was picking out a diamond engagement ring for his 'significant other' named Lindsay.  I overheard his conversation with the sales person and couldn't help but glance in his direction.  As the sales-girl ooooo'd over the ring, and assured him that 'she would just love it!' I looked at him again and couldn't help but smile--At that he said to me that his mother couldn't come with him and asked me to give him my opinion of the ring he'd chosen. (I wondered if I reminded him of his mother).  I assured him that it was absolutely stunning!  The ring was a 2.5 carat center stone pave set with round diamonds on the band...At least that's what the jeweler said...I just know it was gorgeous!  He really felt that this was the ring he wanted, but also wanted to think about it.  It cost over $5000, so I told him I was glad he was going to--I think that's what his Mother would have wanted me to say.  I can't get over that it cost more than our first and second car combined!   After a couple of other stops I came home and got the dogs walked.   (Sheba) My day has come to a close with the mailman bringing me a new purse that I ordered from Macys...I was feeling some stress a few days ago and ordered it.  Carl can't understand why I need a new one when I just got a new one (on the left) a few months ago...Men... Its been a pretty good day!  I hope yours has been too--I look forward to catching up on your blogs this evening!"},

I heard from the surgeon a little while ago that Hamlet has come through the surgery and was resting. He said it went as well as could be expected, and he had removed as much of the infected tissue and tumor as he could. Hamlet still has a few hurdles to get over, but I'm hopeful that we have cleared the biggest one with the surgery. I'm to call in the morning because he may be able to come home.  As I mentioned earlier today, I met a friend for lunch whose dog was also having surgery. (Bella did just fine too!)  We met at a place in Purcellville called \"Magnolias at the Mill.\"  The mill was built in 1905. It served in the production of pasture seed for the Contee Adam Seed Company, and was operated by the same family for three generations. In the middle of the last century, Loudoun County Dairy Business was booming and the mill filled the need for grass seed. During the second World War, much of the Virginia Orchard Grass seed produced here was shipped to Europe as packing for artillery shells and armaments. 'Magnolias' was also a flour mill in the 1940s.  It's a lovely place that still retains the original woodwork and equipment for the decor.  Lunch was delicious (a roasted pumpkin bisque to warm me up and flank-steak caesar salad) and the company of a good friend was enjoyable too.      Afterwards I stopped by \"Southern States\" and once again admired the chicken houses...I still think I need chickens.  But I think (or rather I know) I need to get Hamlet home and back on his feet first. THANK YOU all again for your kindness, support and your friendship; it has provided so much comfort!   I hope you're having an enjoyable weekend!!      I dropped Hamlet off this morning for his surgery.  I'm feeling a sense of calm this morning, but am (of course) nervous and worried.  I know that there are many of you who are keeping him in your prayers today, and I so appreciate it!   I'd planned on just staying home with my cell phone attached to me today.  But I received a call just as I was getting home from a friend whose dog is having knee surgery today at the same place, by the same surgeon.  We have decided that we both could use some company and are meeting for lunch.  She was on the board of directors of the rescue when I first became involved and was the one who talked me into taking our boy Josh to foster.  It'll be good to see her. I'll post an update when I hear from the surgeon.  Many many thanks for your thoughts and prayers for Hamlet!"},

I took Hamlet to see the surgeon last evening.  Before I tell you what was decided, I want to say how very much I appreciate all of you who have taken a moment to send your best wishes for Hamlet and share your thoughts and experiences.  It really does help to have them.  This has been a very difficult time trying to decide the direction to take.  Hamlet has been through so much.  Right now he enjoys a pretty good quality of life.  He's got a good appetite, his energy level and attitude are good too. The only difference is that he's uncomfortable.  The tumor is huge--Bigger than both my hands put together...Dr. Walker (surgeon) agrees that it looks worse than it did originally.  The open area of the tumor is about the width of my index finger and getting bigger; it's red and angry with infection...I would post a picture, but you understand...But if you're curious and would like to see it, let me know...Having said that, we have the option of course of doing nothing.  The tumor will continue to grow, and eventually Hamlet will probably lose use of his leg.  There's not enough skin to heal over the open area, it'll remain open and get worse.  Antibiotics aren't effective because the blood supply is very limited to the tumor (that's why it's not getting better).  The risk of doing surgery is that it may not work--We have known that all along.  We take the chance that de-bulking the tumor (not removing the whole thing, only part of it) may leave us with all the same problems and more as doing nothing.  But then again, if it works, it buys Hamlet some more time.  I think that 'luck' has been on Hamlet's side.  It was a rough recovery last time, but I feel like I owe it to him to at least try.  He'll have surgery on Saturday.     The rest of the dogs are doing well.  I find great comfort in their company.  This morning the house is filled with the smell of bread baking and a turkey breast that I cooked overnight in the crockpot.  It's part of a Thanksgiving meal that I'm taking to a good friend today.  There is a peaceful feeling as a few of the dogs, including Hamlet are snoozing nearby.  A couple of the other dogs are in the kitchen hoping that the Food-Fairy will come and magically give them a bite of something.  The silence of the morning is broken by the sound of CarrieAnne and Sam barking at something in the darkness.  I always wonder what they see?"},
{"title": "What to do about Hamlet", "date": "Saturday, November 20, 2010", "text": "I'm home from the vet with Hamlet.  Parked on our road when I drove past were a couple of cars with several people looking at the adjoining property--At least I guess that's what they were doing.  For some strange reason, known only to our dogs, we discovered purely by chance that the words \"chop-chop\" always send them running to the far side of the yard barking--So, when I let the dogs into the backyard, I said those words and off they went running to bark at the people--It just made sense to do it.  One couple had a dog with them, so 'maybe' they wouldn't be so bad to have as neighbors.The news for Hamlet continues to not be good.  The vet feels that the infection is worse and the antibiotics aren't working.  As I've mentioned, I can't tell because I look at it everyday.  I had thought that it was improving but in my heart I knew that it wasn't.  The option of surgery came up again.  Dr. DeSantis (my vet) thinks that surgery to 'debulk' the tumor, removing the area of infection may be an option to consider.  Then we would use IV and oral antibiotics to get rid of any lingering infection.  The only thing I've discussed with the surgeon was removing the entire tumor.  There are some risks.  One being the loss of the use of his leg.  Another is that there may not be enough tissue to close up the wound.  Dr. DeSantis said that even though surgery was 'not really' an option we may not have a choice but make it one.  There are so many things to consider in doing this.  The last surgery took so much out of Hamlet because of his age (about 13-14).  Another is that the infection could be so deep within the tissue that surgery and antibiotics may not even make a difference and could make everything worse for him. This is why I'll have to talk to the surgeon again and see what he thinks about a less invasive surgery.  It'll also take about 5 days to get the results back from the latest culture that we took of the wound which may give us a whole other picture.  For some reason the quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet came to mind today, \"that it should come to this!\". But I don't see that \"this\" may have other choices--Unless someone else has a suggestion?  Today is our 29th wedding anniversary.  We were planning to go out to lunch and enjoy the day. Carl and I both don't feel much like celebrating, but think that getting out for a drive may do wonders to clear our heads and get a good perspective on everything.    I do hope you're having an enjoyable day!  It's really a lovely day here in Virginia with warm temps and sunshine.  This kind of weather always has a way of lifting the soul!"},

He's really gouged the tumor and it bled for a long time. I almost thought I was going to have to take him in. But it did stop and today it does look a little better.  I'm hopeful that it'll be okay, but I just don't know.There has been no contact from Fred's realtor about our buying additional property.  I do think they're going to see if they can sell the entire 10 acres and not break up the parcel; I guess I don't blame them.  The easement was finished on Monday evening.  Let the selling traffic begin...I can't wait...Another issue with my sister threw me into a tail-spin last evening.  I'll spare you the family drama and just say that I picked myself up, and was reminded of the kindness of friends both that I've met, and those who come to me from cyber-space.The dogs always have a way of providing a much needed lift.  We enjoyed a walk, and Sheba and Rudi shared a stick.  It was good to be outside enjoying the fresh fall air and I felt better about everything.    The day stayed on course when the mailman drove into our driveway while we were outside.  I wished I'd been able to take a picture as the dogs mobbed his truck!  He stopped mid way up the drive, leaned out of the truck and handed me a package.  I was excited to see that it was from our friend Sugar the Golden Retriever and her Mom   I have been admiring the tasty and healthy treats that they bake up and was so excited by a gift of them for our crew.  We did a couple of rounds of treats because they're healthy after all--Carl said they smelled so good that he wanted to try one--The dogs LOVED them, and I did too because they were baked with love and given in kindness!Thank-you Sugar and Sugar's Mom!  We so appreciate your thinking of us, and sharing these wonderful treats!!  You can find out more about them by going to their blog.  Sugar and her Chef-Mom are on a little Thanksgiving break for now, but you can still stop by their blog and take a look around.   Finally, I will end this post with this picture that I took of  'my boys' Tanner (left) and Hamlet while they were waiting on their treats.  I so love the look on their sweet white faces."},

I think Charlie tried to be optimistic when I accidentally locked him out on the front porch this morning.Hamlet did seem a little better today, although he's sleeping quite a bit. He did want to go out with us this afternoon, but opted to sit in the garage while the other dogs played frisbee.  ﻿Overall, it was a nice quiet day.    I hope your day was an enjoyable one too!"},
{"title": "Hope for Hamlet and a Better Tomorrow", "date": "Saturday, November 13, 2010", "text": "If you're looking for a 'feel good moment' from me, I'm sorry you but you won't get it from this post--Although maybe you will from this picture of CarrieAnne taken today.  But I'm sitting here discouraged and a bit depressed about the day.  As you know from my previous post I took Hamlet to the vet.  The news was not good.  The tumor is feeling warm to the touch.  Because of the infection the vet said we can't use steroids because they can suppress the immune system that he needs to fight the infection.  We discussed doing surgery again...She wanted to talk to the surgeon who did the surgery.  She called him and he happened to be working today and he asked us to come over and he would see us.  He and I discussed everything.  The tumor is totally wrapped around the tendons in Hamlet's shoulder.  Dr. Walker told me that the only thing that he felt could be done would be to remove Hamlet's leg, which he did not recommend because he thought it would be very difficult for a dog Hamlet's age.  So, in a nutshell, nothing can be done.  I was in tears and I left forgetting to pay the bill.  (I called them back and was told it was 'no charge').  I called my vet and returned to the office to pick up 2 antibiotics.  I feel like Hamlet has been given a band-aid fix for a gaping wound.  But I know I need to be hopeful and optimistic--I know those feelings will come, but right now it's difficult.When I arrived home there was a large truck full of gravel and a Bob-Cat sitting in our driveway.   My heart sank just a little lower as I realized that they were probably there to put gravel on the grassy access to the 10 acres in back of us. I got out of my van and asked the man what they were doing--He confirmed what I already knew, but told me that they were making an access on the OTHER side of the property and not at the top of our driveway--He asked if it was okay to use our driveway this one time.  He told me that Fred had asked them to not use our driveway any more than needed.  Of course I agreed.  It was the only good news of the day.  I hope tomorrow will be a better day.Just as I finished my post, I looked up as the moon appeared--It didn't stay around long, but I was so taken by how beautiful it was, an omen perhaps?  I'm so glad that the weekend has finally arrived! The week started out with a neighboring dental office enjoying a catered lunch that was meant for the office I work in--I'll end the story there and just say they felt it shouldn't be an issue, since \"we\" didn't pay for it...And the week ended with a visit to the Loudoun County Office of Land and Development to find out the zoning for Fred's property. (See the post, Paradise Lost) This then sent me traipsing the halls of the county court house (pictured) to see the plat information.  The good news is, is that the zoning (AR-1) only allows 1 house to be built on each lot.  So, the most we would see would be a total of 3 houses built.  The property in back of us that we are interested in, according to the plat information is accessed via, our driveway.  This is what we thought.  But if we're able to purchase 2-3 acres, it would include the access that would be changed.  We did hear from Fred's realtor yesterday and he wanted to know how much we were willing to pay for 2 or 3 acres, if Fred would do it. Our realtor told him we hadn't discussed that and did Fred just want to name a price?  She told them she didn't want to divide the 10 acre price because it was unlikely the 2 or 3 acres would be a buildable lot so it would have less value.  I guess this is why we have a realtor because the amount we were thinking was the price divided into the cost of the 10 acres and a little more...I wish I knew where all this was going to end up...Today I do know where I'll end up.  The vets office.  Hamlet continues to be a concern.  The tumor as you know is very large, and became sore from Hamlet scratching it.  He continues to wear a tee-shirt, but is now sporting a shoe on his back left foot to keep from further aggravating it and a 'soft-lamp-shade' or e-collar to keep him from licking it--He looks like he's dressed for Halloween...I'm sure you understand why I'd rather not post a picture of him...But I'm going to ask about steroids today to see if that will help in reducing the size and providing some relief.  I know that there are side effects to taking this step, but something has to be done.I'm also worried about Wendy.  I noticed on Tuesday she has somehow broken a lower tooth that looks like it may be becoming infected.  It was actually her that had an appointment this morning to see the vet.  But I had to change that because Hamlet needs to be seen a 'little' more than she does, and unfortunately they didn't have enough time to see both of them.  She doesn't seem to be in any pain or discomfort, but I feel just awful having to make her wait.  Whatever your Saturday brings, I hope you're having an enjoyable day! I look forward to reading your blogs later this afternoon!"},

{"title": "Paradise Lost?", "date": "Thursday, November 11, 2010", "text": "As you know for many years I craved being in the country, out of town. I didn't want to have neighbors. I no longer wanted to live in a crowded subdivision with people in front of us, in back of us, and on the side of us. I no longer wanted anyone watching to make sure we followed 'the rules' of cleaning up after our dogs and noticing how many we had.  For ten years this was how we lived and it was okay.  But I longed for solitude and privacy. We got that when we moved to where we are now. The house we live in was not what I dreamed of, but the property is.  For three years we've enjoyed the privacy, peace and quiet of the country. We've enjoyed walking the dogs on the 30 acres of open fields that surround our property. But in the last couple of weeks, we've noticed some changes. It all started the morning I had the encounter with the bow-hunters. Later that morning a truck that I didn't recognize pulled into our driveway. It was Fred, who owns the land around us. I guess it was an omen because of course I wondered what his appearance after 3 years meant. Added to that last week I noticed fluorescent tapes on the trees marking property lines.  I'll keep this part of the story brief and just say that my fears were confirmed, Fred is selling the property that surrounds us.If you stand on the road facing our house to the right of our driveway is 20 acres of Fred's land.  Directly in back of our property at the top of our driveway is a second parcel of 10 acres that he owns which is partially cleared. Our house is situated in the back of our property, very close to the 10 acre property line which is wooded.  Of course my worry is that someone will buy the 10 acres and clear all the trees. I asked our realtor (who is also a long-time friend) inquire about the property and they're asking a whopping $225,000 for the 10 acres. (Actually, it's a reasonable price for property in this area). Needless to say, we can't afford that. But yesterday I had our realtor, MaryEllen inquire if they would be willing to sell us 2-3 acres of those woods, (pictured below) creating a buffer between us and any new neighbors. It would be wonderful to have this part of the property so that for me and of course the dogs, our paradise would not be lost."},

Well, as the sun rose this morning it was evident that this crime has been replaced with another. This criminal has struck twice in the last couple of nights in the western part of Loudoun County Virginia and is leaving devastation to those who are unfortunate enough to be in his path. Nothing is immune to this criminals cold and merciless brutality. Although he is difficult to see as he commits his crime, if you are brave, you can listen carefully in the cold of night and hear the echo of his contemptuous laugh at the feeble attempts of protection. While some of these attempts to slow his rampage and killing spree will be successful, unfortunately he cannot be stopped. If you were prepared and managed to escape him one night, I promise you he will be back on a night that you are careless and your defenses are down. You may indeed know this criminal whose first name is Jack. Below is a sketch artist's rendition of him followed by pictures of the crimes he committed right here on my road!  But be warned Jack can and does have many faces--He also has many weaknesses but his partner in crime and mentor known as Hard Freeze will be coming and is much more brutal--Then comes the 'Godfather,\" Old Man Winter!  Here are some pictures of the devastation found in Jack's wake this morning...The poor and innocent honeysuckle.  ﻿Even this 'unknown' was not spared.Jack showed no mercy to the already dead leaves...There was no place for the Teasel to hide. Jack's spree didn't end with the defenseless plants.  His wrath was felt in the fields both high... and low.  There was nothing that could be done to stop him.  Jack struck every where.      All I can do is warn you and wish you 'good luck' in keeping Jack Frost at bay for as long as possible--I hope you are more successful than we were!"},

{"title": "Trick or Treat!!", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2010", "text": "Halloween always brings back lots of fun childhood memories which for me mostly revolve around trick or treating! I think kids look forward to Halloween as much as they do Christmas and their birthdays! My siblings, friends and I would of course get all dressed up in a Halloween costume, grab a pillow case or a plastic pumpkin box to collect candy in and off we'd go! The air was so clean and crisp on those October evenings, and I never remember it being cold. We would walk from house to house and would giggle when we were given treats that we really liked. I remember coming home after trick or treating and smelling the sweet scent of my candy bag and dumping it out to sort it into piles: chocolate in one pile, suckers, hard candy, chewy candy and gum in another and then there was the pile of “other” stuff- raisins, or small coins that a few unusual neighbors gave out. My sister always wanted to be the last one in the house with candy so she would somehow manage to save hers, barely eating any of it.  I don't know how she did it, but she would have candy long after ours was gone and of course I envied that!  But even as I got older I enjoyed trick or treating--I remember taking my youngest brother when he was about 5 years old (I'm 14 years older than he is). Determined to get as much candy as possible, and despite his being too tired to go much farther, I wouldn't take him home until I was sure he had plenty of loot to share!  What a good sister I was!!Once married I would hand out candy, buying only what I'd like so I could still enjoy it! When we had our first house, I would sit on the porch with our first Golden, Tod, and hand out candy. He would be dressed in a tie or something simple I'd found for him.  Since we live in the country, we have no trick-or-treaters, but lots of memories and some candy, just for old times sake!  I hope your Halloween is a fun and memorable one!**In the picture is Charlie, the evil one, Hamlet in the pink t-shirt, and our boy Sam with Sheba's nose on the bottom right."},
{"title": "Positive Thinking Through Hamlet", "date": "Wednesday, October 27, 2010", "text": "To start, THANK YOU for the kind thoughts on my post yesterday!  They really did help!  However, for some reason I have to admit to still feeling a bit of discouragement and to being a little self conscious over this latest bout of poison ivy.  I did switch my day off to today and have to work tomorrow, so hopefully it will be better.  I do consider myself a positive thinking person, and have tried to not complain.  I decided this morning to help me through this, I needed a positive example of 'someone' who doesn't complain--I didn't have to look far, I found it in Hamlet.  Those of you who have been following my blog for sometime know Hamlet's story.  Those of you who don't, I will give you a shortened version of how he came to live with us.  He was found nearly a year ago in the garage of a house that had been foreclosed on.  Estimated to be about 13 years old, Hamlet was so ill the first time I saw him, he couldn't even stand up.  Not even my determination to not bring another dog into our home could keep me from wanting to help him.  Hamlet came to us as a foster dog, and became a permanent member of our household shortly after that.  He had surgery this past spring to remove a large tumor on his shoulder.  Sadly it has returned and surgery is not an option because of the amount of tissue that was removed the first time.  Chinese herbs were ineffective, and the tumor continues to grow. I don't like to take pictures of Hamlet that show the tumor, but in this first picture, you can see it on the right.  Most of the time Hamlet sports a tee-shirt to keep the tumor clean and from getting scratched and becoming sore.  He now walks with a slight limp and I can tell it bothers him when he walks.  Through all of this, Hamlet remains in good spirits and never seems bothered by any of this.  When he first came to us, he didn't seem to have much zest or enthusiasm about life.  That's all changed.  He 'prances' around when we come home, nudges us for attention, a bite of whatever we're eating, and to hurry up so he can go for a walk.  He is my constant companion.  We've never heard him bark, but this quiet, gentle soul has a tail that is always quietly wagging, speaking volumes.  I really think that I should follow his example which is to \"bark less and wag more.\""},

{"title": "The Deer Hunters", "date": "Saturday, October 23, 2010", "text": "The day started out pleasant enough with walking the dogs as the sun was coming up.  Carl walked the dogs around the front of our property, and I took the more scenic route in back.  I had our boy Sam, and Toby on a leash and Hamlet tagging along behind us.  Sheba, Rudi and CarrieAnne are always excited about our walking in this direction and ran ahead and out of site into the open field at the top of the hill.  In the next moment, chaos erupted.  I was about halfway up the hill when I heard voices and Sheba, and CarrieAnne came running back towards me, tails tucked underneath, both were looking back over their shoulders.  Knowing something was wrong, I hurried up the hill and saw 2 bow hunters--One was picking up an arrow.  I'm not sure what came flying out of my mouth next, but I can assure you it wasn't pleasant!  They told me they were aiming at the deer, and not the dogs who had scared them off--I didn't and still don't believe them.  It was a pretty heated 'discussion' in which I told them they were on private property and to close to our house.  One informed me that hunting on private land is only illegal in Virginia if the property is posted with no trespassing or no hunting signs. I have to admit that I've never heard that.  I then told them that I was going to check with the owner of the property who had given me permission to walk the dogs there.  Not even the echo of my very raised voice could convince these two that they were doing something wrong or make them apologize.   With wobbly knees, my heart in my throat, and my blood boiling, I walked back towards the house.  All three dogs had returned--I have to admit I'd forgotten about Rudi--Sheba remains unusually subdued and quiet.  I'm not sure how serious these two hunters took an old lady in gray flannel pajamas with Golden Retrievers in tow, but I have a feeling the word might be out about the crazy lady on Mountain Road!    **As a final note, I will add that I am not against hunting, just against those do it irresponsibly--Like the two this morning."},
{"title": "My Daily Commute", "date": "Thursday, October 21, 2010", "text": "According to a United States Census Bureau survey, Americans spend more than 100 hours a year commuting to work. For those of you who commute, wouldn’t it be nice if your office or workplace was just a few steps away from home? Think about it...No traffic to deal with and no need to buy gas for your car. It isn't even necessary to wake up early because you don't have to allow time for commuting--Whatta life, I would love that!! But given what I do, and because I really love the office where I work and where I live, I have chosen to be a commuter.Come along with me, and I'll show you what my daily commute looks like.  I try to leave the house around 7:15 in the morning.  It all starts out nice enough.  But when I get to the main roads (after about 20 minutes), it all changes--It's back to \"real life!\"  This morning it was foggy and overcast, making it a bit more hectic.   Off one highway, and onto another...It's bumper to bumper, stop and start for at least half the drive.   Finally after about an hour, I get to the office.  At our office, the doctor allows us to be late 14 (yes fourteen!) times during the year without an excuse.  If we're late more than that, he will deduct a day of vacation from the next year.  There are days when it can be a sprint to get into the office on time.  I have a co-worker who is typically running in the door at the last minute.  If we're in the parking lot together, because she's younger and faster, she'll run up the stairs and clock us in!  If she's not there, and I've gotten there before her, I watch for her to pull in, and clock her in.  We have had some lates counted against us, but we're doing okay because we're watching out for each other--She's a good co-worker that way!  This is the view out the window of the operatory I work from.  At the end of the day, usually about 5:30, it starts all  over again.  At least the sun is out now.  On my drive to and from work, there are some lovely homes to look at, like this one. Of course I have my phone with me, so I'll chat with friends on the drive home.  The closer I get to home, the scenery starts to change... At the bottom of our drive way, I pick up the mail and look up towards the house.  Usually the dogs start to bark because they hear me.  I've left everything behind and I feel like I'm entering a totally different world.  It's so good to finally be home..."},

Three years ago to the day we moved into our house here in the country.  We never thought of naming our property.  But the neighboring farmer told me that it was bad luck not to.  Knowing that the wife of the previous owner had died here, we took that advice.  Lacking creativity, we named our new home \"Golden Pines\" because of the pine trees, and of course the Goldens.  But it's been three years. Where has the time gone? So much has happened and there have been so many changes, mostly with our dogs, me on the other hand, I won't admit to having changed or aged!    We moved into our new home with our dogs, Wendy, Kasey, Josh, Rudi, CarrieAnne, Sheba, Charlie, Logan, and Cubby, and of course CC, the cat.  Just as a caveat I'll add that I continue to marvel that we managed to sell our house without the new owners knowing that we had any dogs at all--It was quite a feat that I do not want to go through again anytime soon!  But if you'd like to know how to get rid of dog-odors, just ask, I am a 'self-proclaimed' expert! During the three years since we moved here, we have fostered and placed Peyton, Daisy, Tucker and Patch.  As you know, we are currently fostering The Chub brothers Toby and Bubba. Cowboy, Maguire, Tanner and Hamlet were also dogs that we fostered and adopted, making them permanent members of our household. Young Sam was given to us by a family at church. Did you keep up with all that?  Not including \"Old Sam\" from last week, in the 3 years we have sadly had to say good-bye to: Logan who left us in March of 2008.  His claim to fame is that he was the least photogenic of any dog I've ever had!  Try as I did I could never get a good picture of him. Kasey left us in October 2008.  She's the only \"girl\" we've lost Cubby left us in September 2009.  He was only supposed to live a few months and lived 2 years  Cowboy left us in March 2010--By far, the goofiest dog I've ever had!  and Maguire left us in May 2010 such a tenderhearted soul! In thinking about our 3 years here at Golden Pines it reminds me of the saying \"Home is where the heart is.\" For me its truly become the place where I have around me so much life and so many things that represent me as an individual because they hold memories of my own history--This includes our dogs past and present who will always be such a big part of it."},

I think others are feeling it too--I'm seeing corn stalks and scarecrows and plenty of apple cider, pumpkins, crafts and fall decor in all the stores. I was thinking last night on my drive home from work about the smells of fall, and how much I enjoy them. I love the smell of rain and wet leaves. Another is the smell of burning wood. I think you can tell when it’s the first fireplace or stove fire because to me it has a wet smoky odor.  The smell is even in the air this morning.  Pretty soon it’ll be time for the smells of winter. But I'm not thinking of that — Today the dogs and I (Carl is working) are just going to enjoy the day.  I've been plagued with internet or computer problems here at home, I don't know which, but I keep losing my internet connection.  I hope I'll be able to catch up with my blog visits today--Paws crossed!  Do you have any favorite smells of fall?"},

Not unexpected, it's the routine.  CC is again sitting on the counter looking at me like she's had nothing to eat.  I always feed her a little more.  Then I go to the backdoor, and help Tanner up the steps...It's all mundane and routine.This morning from the porch I can see Carrie sitting by the barn yipping into the air.  I really liked the way the barn looked in the light so I decided to take a picture.   This is the picture that I liked without the flash. Below is the first picture I took and didn't like because the flash picked up our satellite dish.  But I didn't realize it until I saw the picture on my computer, that the flash also picked up something else.  Can you see the glow of the eyes on the bottom right of the picture by the door of the barn?  Since CC was inside waiting for seconds I wonder just what it was.  I guess it was what the barking was about.  Any thoughts?   A nighttime ninja perhaps?  Probably just a cat, that would be welcome to stay if it wanted too.    The light of the day has brought with it rain and cold and the quiet song of a bird I wish I could identify.  The day feels sad as I remember that today would have been my Mom's 73rd birthday.  If she were still living, I would have called her first thing, waking her up to wish her a happy birthday--However she would have said that she \"was already awake\" because she knew I'd call--How did she always know?"},
{"title": "A Wooly Worm Wednesday", "date": "Wednesday, October 13, 2010", "text": "Do you have wooly worms where you live? In Virginia we do.  I can't look at or even say the word \"wooly worm\" without smiling. You have to admit that even if you dislike bugs and insects in general, it's hard to not like them. Wooly worms don't fly around and they don't make a racket at night. They don't bite you, scare you, and they don't get tangled in your hair and cause you to scream or jump. They're fuzzy, unassuming, and non-threatening. I think of them as the Zen of caterpillars. If you mess with them, they curl up and play dead. I don't like being crawled on by anything buggy, but have to admit that I'm okay with letting a wooly worm meander across my hand. Wooly worms are famous for foretelling the length and severity of the winter season. If they're light-colored, the old folks say, it's supposed to be an easy winter. The darker they are (or the broader the dark section of wooly fuzz) the harsher the winter will be. The other day I saw a black one, and then last week while Carl was painting we saw this one that we \"think\" was a wooly-worm or its cousin.  But I guess like the two legged weather men, they can't make up their mind either.  Right now in Virginia, there are a few really warm days left.  When you are driving down the road on those days, you'll see the fuzzy little guys crawling across the pavement in front of you. This time of year wooly worms are always in a big hurry, searching for a warm place to hibernate for the winter. They race across the road at breakneck wooly-worm speed. I have to admit that I sometimes swerve to avoid them. I mean, who wants to run over what I consider the teddy bear of caterpillars? But no matter how fast they go, sadly they're never fast enough and I end up running over my share of them. I think it's kind of sad that these poor, peaceful little creatures, no matter how hard they may try, are no match for my speeding down the road--When you come to think of it, life is kind of that way. You can't outrun it, can't get out of the way of it, and inevitably there are times that no matter how hard you try, you end up run over and flattened by it...On that note, I'll end by saying that I hope you're having a good week, I've been \"flattened\" a couple of times, but I'm getting across the proverbial road and doing okay..."},
{"title": "The Final Chapter--Doris and Sam", "date": "Saturday, October 9, 2010", "text": "Sully Plantation, built in 1794 was the home of Richard Bland Lee, Northern Virginia's first congressman, and was the place I chose to meet Doris and Patti this morning. I have to start by telling you that Doris's body is 87, and is showing the effects of her recent hip replacement and small heart attack--However her mind is perfect and sharp as a tack. Doris told me that she reads a book a week and does a crossword puzzle everyday. Wow...I've heard people say that dogs don't remember people and places. I've never believed that, and today reminded me of why I don't. Sam recognized Doris right away and responded to her. While she spoke, he had his head up and his eyes fixed on her, he did the same thing with Doris's daughter Patti. When I saw Sam's face, there was a look that seemed to say \"is it really you, are you really here?\" There were some very touching moments between the two that I wish I could have caught with the camera, but some moments happen so quickly that you just can't. As Doris sat, she retold stories of her life with Sam; the holidays, the adventures, the walks and their life together. The love and devotion she has for Sam is so evident when she speaks.We spent about 40 minutes together and it was time for us to leave.  Doris cried some more, expressed her love for Sam, and kissed him good-bye.  I drove him to the vet and sat with this old soul as he quietly left this life for the next...A sad moment.  Afterwards when I kissed Sam good-bye and my head was next to his, the thought came into my mind that I was only Sam's caretaker for this last part of his life's journey; at the Rainbow Bridge he'll wait for Doris. Even though we hardly knew Sam we have no regrets whatsoever in his coming to stay with us. It was a privilege to have him as part of our household.We have a candle lit for Sam to help him find his way...God-Speed sweet-Sam. We will never forget you.~Doris and her daughter Patti~Thank-you all for your friendship and kind and caring thoughts today!  When I returned home, your words provided me with so much comfort.  I know it was those thoughts and prayers that gave me the strength to get through a difficult day and have the peace that I had hoped for. I look forward to catching up with you and your blogs on Sunday.  I have just reread all your comments from the last couple of days.  I cannot begin to tell you all how touched and humbled I am to once again be the recipient of such kind thoughts, prayers and support.  It means so much and helps more than you know!!  I'm starting out the day emotionally drained, but as ready as I can be for the events which lay ahead of us.  My biggest hope is that the timeline comes together as I've planned it.  I spoke to Patti, (Doris's daughter) and she said that Doris couldn't stop crying when she was told she'd be seeing her beloved Sam today.  Patti had not yet told her that this would be the last time she'd see him, and I don't think she is going to.  We are planning the visit for 11 o'clock this morning.  I am to be at the vets office by no later than 12:30 because they close at 1 PM.  I know it doesn't give them much time together, (only about an hour) but I'm hoping that it will be enough.  Sam continues to rally.  He managed to bark at the cat, which I thought was a good sign.  However he refuses food of any  kind--I've tried to give him everything and anything, including cat food, (the canned kind, not the actual cat) but he wants nothing to do with it.  He will drink a little bit of water, which I'm glad about.  My hope for Sam is that he has enough strength for the visit and Doris won't notice how worn out he is.  We've tried to leave him alone and let him get his rest in preperation for the day.  I will try to post later and let you know how it goes.  Thank-you again for your prayers, kindness and your friendship--It is truly making a difference."},
{"title": "Update on Old Sam", "date": "Friday, October 8, 2010", "text": "To start off my day, I see that blogger has once again seen fit to change the dashboard...Or is mine the only one that has changed?  I can no longer see all the new posts from the blogs I stalk--Only a few of them.  I'm wondering how I can go back and read blogs that posted yesterday that I didn't get the chance to look at last evening--Is there a way to get back to the \"old dashboard\" that showed updates on blogs for several days and NOT just hours?  I really hate change, especially at times like this.  Sam remains unchanged, there is still a lot of blood mixed in with his urine and he has become almost totally incontinent.  (I've put a \"male wrap\" on him to help keep him clean).  But this morning he was still laying in the same place as he was last night when I went to bed.  I did get up and check on him several times, and he was very quiet and sleeping.  Quite a change from the night before.The other dogs have all been very sweet around him.  I've noticed our boy Sam, Charlie and a few others laying by him.  And when I've knelt down to talk to him (and change him) I've noticed more than once several of them standing behind me looking on...They know... Yesterday I decided that I should e-mail Patti, Doris's daughter, and let her know about Sam and tell her that if she wanted her Mother to be able to see Sam, that it needed to happen in the next day or so.  Patti responded back to me that her Mom had spent the day at her house and had wanted her to call me.  Apparently Doris, who is still very much missing Sam has been worried about him and felt that he may not be doing well--How did she know?  Actually, I know how she does...But Patti felt that there was something to that and didn't make the call.  I assured Patti that if they'd called I would never have told Doris how Sam was without telling her first--I'd never want to upset Doris.  Patti said she was going to have to think about it--I hope she doesn't think about it too long.  I've decided that with Sam's not eating and drinking very little water, and having trouble standing on his own, I cannot and won't let him continue, there is now no quality of life for him, and I think he feels miserable.  I made an appointment with the vet for Saturday morning--I will change that if Patti decides that she would like Doris to see him.  UPDATE:  I just heard from Patti, she wants me to bring Sam to see Doris on Saturday..."},
{"title": "Another Corner Turned for Old Sam", "date": "Thursday, October 7, 2010", "text": "We've turned yet another corner with Doris's boy, known to us as Old Sam. He had a really restless night. I was up every hour or so with him because he was stumbling around and whining. I kept trying to help him find a place that he would find comfortable but I couldn't. Finally at about 4 o'clock this morning I sat on the floor with him, with his head in my lap, petting him and he finally went to sleep. I have to say, it was a sweet and tender moment with him. It was so quiet and peaceful in the house with the only light coming from small nighttime lamp on the mantel and the only sound was the tinkling coming from the wind chime on the front porch. I stayed there with him for a long time (then my behind started falling asleep) and I went to bed. The other dogs let me sleep until 6:30 and Sam was still fast asleep when I checked on him.This morning when I let him out, I could see that there was a lot of dark red blood in his urine. He has also refused breakfast and water. I don't know what all of this means but I do know that it means that I can't let him continue to much more, especially if he's in pain. The old wound in my heart has once again been opened and the lump in my throat has returned because I know that Sam's time is close. I know some of you may think that because I've traveled this road several times, and because I've only had Sam a couple of months that this decision may be an easy one. I can tell you that it's not. I take my responsibility as caretaker of these precious old dogs very seriously, and the choice to let them go, never, ever comes easily or quickly for me."},
{"title": "The End of the Happiness Makeover!", "date": "Monday, October 4, 2010", "text": "Today was the last day of my \"Happiness Makeover.\" We woke up to cold temps in the 40's and drizzly rain.  Why is it that the dogs never seem to notice? I really didn't have any plans but did have errands to run. But at one of my stops I ran into a friend of mine and her children that are not old enough to go to school. They were going to be going to lunch and asked me if I wanted to go with them. I had several things to do, and really didn't have the time. However one of the girls said to me, \"Kim you have to come, you make everything gooder and funner!\" I guess to some that comment doesn't make much sense, but when a 5 year old says it, it does and so I went to lunch with them. On my way home I realized that an unplanned lunch with a friend and her 2 kids was a \"gooder and funner\" way to end my Happiness Makeover! I hope your week is gooder and funner too!"},
{"title": "Anaplasmosis & The Reality of Healthy Dogs", "date": "Saturday, October 2, 2010", "text": "I know that we are lucky (and very blessed) that our dogs enjoy good general health. Vet visits are not that all that frequent, although experience has taught us so much! But I contribute most of this to the healthy diet that we feed our crew. However every once in awhile we're dealt a card or two that give me a reality check and I'm reminded that the dogs and I are not invincible.  That's what has happened yesterday, I was reminded of how frail life and especially health can be.  The vet visit for CarrieAnne and Charlie was pretty uneventful. But our vet, Dr. DeSantis did mention that she'd like to be seeing less of Charlie...We'll both work on that. (The picture is Hamlet & Charlie)For CarrieAnne (pictured on the right) there was a diagnosis of anaplasmosis which is a tick-borne disease. I've noticed the last several weeks that she hasn't really seemed like herself, but I have contributed it to her age (8 years old). While it could very well be age related, it could possibly be symptoms of anaplasmosis. The good news is, is that it's very treatable with antibiotics, and she should be fine. My vet and I again discussed the use of \"Frontline\" for the ticks. Carrie is one of the dogs that I apply it to, but I use it very sparingly.Hamlet, (pictured above with Charlie) you may recall was taken to the holistic vet about a month ago. The tumor on his shoulder is inoperable because of the extensive surgery he had on it in the spring. The hope in starting the Chinese herbs was that it would reduce or slow its growth. Sadly, it hasn't worked and the lump that a month ago that was the size of one of my hands, is now about doubled. I'm continuing the herbs and continuing to have hope.Doris's boy Sam (the 15 year old & pictured on the left) has also turned a bit of a corner. His health has deteriorated a little, and we have increased his medications in hopes of keeping him comfortable and maintaining a good quality of life for him.  I hope and pray that Sam hangs on long enough to see Doris again and she's able to say the good-bye to him and have the closure that she is so desperate for.On the flip-side, the other dogs are doing well. They are enjoying the chance to be out running in the fields and enjoying the fall.Me, the Happiness Makeover continued yesterday when I enjoyed lunch with a former coworker in Millwood at the foot of this old grist mill. It was nice to sit outside in the breeze and catch up. I hope that whatever makes you happy, that you have the chance to do it and have a wonderful fall weekend!"},
{"title": "Happiness Makeover--Eating Frogs", "date": "Friday, October 1, 2010", "text": "A patient come into our office this week and was telling me about a book he was reading called \"Eat That Frog.\" I think that the title was inspired by a quote by Mark Twain that goes \"Eat a live frog every morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” Okay, I cannot begin to imagine eating one of the frogs from my porch (pictured here) but I like the basic idea of the book which is that if you stop procrastinating and do the thing (or things) that you dread the most, quickly and efficiently the rest of the day is a cake walk.Yesterday was the first day of my \"Happiness Makeover.\" However, it had to begin with my eating more than one live frog. Since Carl is working nights this week that left me to get all the dogs walked, in the pouring rain. When I got everyone back inside, dried off, and fed I walked on the treadmill for about an hour. The next live frogs I ate was deciding that I should tackle cleaning and vacuuming my van. I've really been putting that off, and Carl hasn't had time to do it for me. But I was going to be picking up a friend for lunch and if you could have seen my van, you would have agreed it REALLY needed to be done. You may recall that I love fast-food cheeseburgers. These are the prizes that I've collected when I've ordered a childs meal from McDonalds or wherever I happen to stop--I've got quite a collection going, don't you think?With a clean van and an empty stomach I was off to lunch! I had steak and chicken fajitas that I very much enjoyed! After I took my friend home, I stopped off at the office where I work to get something I'd left there. Someone had dropped off a cake, and I had a piece (with ice cream) and chatted with a coworker for a few minutes. When I left the office I did some grocery shopping (at Wegmans of course). Afterwards I decided to pick up frosted-chocolate-peanut-butter-blondies at a local bakery for later. I really love their rich chocolate and peanut butter flavor. I couldn't resist, so I ate one on the way home. Later I fixed dinner for Carl and I. For some reason I wasn't that hungry... The rain continued to POUR down all day, but as Thursday ended there was a break in the clouds. This morning I'm taking Charlie and CarrieAnne to the vet for their yearly visits. Carrie, being extremely shy around people she doesn't know, doesn't like going to the vet, so it'll be her frog for the day. Charlie's will be, becoming totally traumatized by having annual blood-work and a rabies vaccine--He's such a terrier! I'm meeting a friend later for lunch. I don't think there's going to be any \"live frog eating\" today but it's still early. What are your daily-frogs or the thing(s) you resist and put off doing? Laundry? Vacuuming? Going to work? Getting out of bed?"},

Well, I'm going to start by catching up on my my blog visits, (I've really missed reading what you all are up to!) have lunch with friends, goof off, and then goof off some more; all things that make me happy!As you may guess, I'm really looking forward to it --Just like the dogs look forward to their dinner!

{"title": "Confession Time", "date": "Thursday, September 23, 2010", "text": "Some of you have known me for some time, so I'll make a confession. One thing that I sometimes like to do, late at night when all is quiet is watch an infomercial or two. Late last evening when I was taking pictures of the beautiful Harvest moon, this is what I did afterwards. I know, it's crazy, and Carl doesn't quiet understand it. But I have found that it's not the products themselves that intrigue me. I’m drawn to what it does for the people who use them.Think about it. Wouldn't it be great to make your life perfect with the use of one single product? To be able to improve your overall health by simply taking miracle pills, make a complete gourmet meal using only one pan and have a knife that will cut through a broom handle and thinly slice a tomato afterwards? I think this is what keeps me glued to the screen. There’s something compelling about the belief that a supplement, pan, utensil or a single piece of exercise equipment will somehow drastically change my life for the better. So just why do people spend their hard earned money buying things like Colon Cleanse and the X-Press-Redi-Set-Go? After all, it's not as if these are must-have items which we need in order to survive. Mankind has endured for thousands of years before the invention of the Kangaroo Keeper and will most likely endure long after the last order for the Garden Groom has been placed. I realize that some of these products really do work and are quite handy. But at three o'clock in the morning and under the spell of a full moon while some of these might look like a good investment, in the light of day and when the credit card bills come, these maybe won't look so good after all. Okay, I've confessed. Now it's your turn to admit if you've ever bought anything from a late-night infomercial--What was it, and did it work?"},
{"title": "The Renegades of Golden Pines", "date": "Saturday, September 18, 2010", "text": "Nothing strikes fear into my aging heart quicker than four renegade dogs who don't have their leashes on when they are outside the fence--This fear is what surfaced this morning when I opened the door inside our house to let the dogs into the garage to get ready for their morning walk. I opened the door and as the dogs went past me I quickly saw it, the garage door that had been left open last night! Panic and pandemonium erupted as the siren of my voice broke the silence of the beautiful fall morning. I immediately called to the dogs about going for a car-ride which brought back renegade number one, Charlie, who would rather go for a ride than a walk (sucker!!). Captured inside the van we left Charlie and we turned our attention to the Big Boy gang called the Chub Club. Toby and Bubba who have been corrupted by their newest member Sam (our boy Sam, not Doris's Sam) quickly realized they were unleashed and made their run to freedom and liberation, never looking back! Toby and Bubba not being experienced at the art of escaping and who are a bit slower were easily caught and returned to captivity. However the lead renegade Sam, (pictured) is a bit more seasoned. He knew better than to believe my story about giving him a treat--I even think I saw him roll his eyes at me when he looked back for just a moment. With distance quickly coming between us, it was becoming clear to me that given the direction and roughness of the terrain that Sam was going to make a successful getaway and we may not see him again...Then suddenly the inevitable happened--Sam had to stop for a potty-break and he was nabbed by the tail--Thank-you Mother Nature!Even though it was a few hours ago and all residents of Golden Pines have been counted and recounted and there have been several role calls I still feel like someone is missing..."},

I know there are many that love the hustle and bustle, the noise and all that comes from being in the city. But for me, I'm soothed by a chorus of birds, frogs, crickets, and cicadas and being able to see the deer grazing in my yard. I also enjoy this time of year when I can have the windows open and enjoy the cool breeze and hear the wind in the trees and other nighttime sounds.Living in the country means that I can get up at dawn and walk the dogs in my pajamas, dance in the driveway and sing out loud and off key and never worry about a neighbor seeing or hearing me.This is our third year living on Mountain Road. Last night I was reminded of a sound of the country that I do not enjoy hearing and that is the sound of a cow who has been separated from her calf. Each year about this time the farmer across the road takes the calves away from their Mothers to be weaned. Last night after I went to bed, and the dogs were all settled in, above all the other night-noises, the sound that drifted from across the road was the bellowing of the cows crying for one another. It is such a sad mournful cry and it went on all night and is continuing this afternoon. I know it's a part of life, and as Lynn from Rocky Creek Scottie Adventures said on my Facebook page that weaning \"is a rite of passage to becoming an adult,\" and I totally agree, but I think it's kind of a sad one too.

Many thanks to all of you for your encouragement and positive thoughts! Its been a nice quiet weekend and I'm feeling rested and a bit more optimistic. Carl was so nice and taught my Sunday school class for me, which I really appreciated! I did notice this weekend that glimpses of fall are starting to show.  Most of the Black-eyed Susan's have only their black-eyes left... Unfortunately the 'stinking-stink-bugs' are coming back in masses just to make my life miserable!  The Hydrangea looks a little low...Another sign of Fall are the the Canadian Geese overhead who are pointing the way to warmer weather!  But I'm not sure that was south, or is it? Our resident groundhog is \"hogging\" whatever he can find--Notice his cheeks have food in them.  The change of weather also means the shedding-begins for the dogs--Actually it's in full swing and I brushed (or Furminated) all this off Rudi this morning.  I can feel a hairball coming on! Another sure sign of Fall is that football season has started!! My favorite team, the Washington Redskins play the Dallas Cowboys tonight!! I hope you've all had a great weekend--Are you seeing the start of the change of seasons too?"},

We lived here in the Washington DC area and Carl was working not far from the Pentagon. While we were not directly affected by those events, we knew people who were.As you know there are many heroes and stories of that day. One story in particular that really touches my heart is the story of 2 Golden Retrievers in New York City (not far from Ground Zero) named Hope and Darwin who survived that day. Eric and Nan now live just down the road from us here in Northern Virginia. We became friends when they adopted one of our foster dogs named Abby. I heard from Nan this morning and like so many of us, she wonders how it could be 9 years.Today I'd like to share Nan's very compelling story with you.

{"title": "Mental Health Wednesday", "date": "Wednesday, September 8, 2010", "text": "I've felt it coming on and this morning I woke up in a somewhat depressed state of mind. I am not entirely sure how or why it has happened. But I had to go to work and I felt like I should just keep going and see what the day brought and maybe I could shake the feeling. It didn't help. This morning at work I felt like I was being painted into a corner and all I could feel was an avalanche of negativity and moody-grouchy patients didn't help. With no patients scheduled after lunch, I asked the doctor if I could leave for the afternoon. I thought that if I could just get away I could focus on trying to lift my mood. I had a few errands to run and I thought that would be a start to figure it all out.Just as I left the office I decided that today was the day I was going to raid an apple tree across the road from where I work. It's located next to a closed pre-school and the last few weeks I've been noticing that the tree is full of apples. With no one around I decided it would probably be okay to just go and pick them. I realized in looking at the apples that they are overripe and you can see that they are not the best looking apples--I should have gotten them when I first noticed them. I picked a grocery bag full and I think that I'll cut up some for the dogs and feed the rest to the deer. At least they won't be going to waste. There are still a lot more and I think I'll get the rest on Friday.During my errands I kept mulling over everything that was bothering me. But I realized that trying to sort it all out was like trying to solve a complex math problem while trying to keep myself from drowning at the same time. So I just stopped trying to figure it all out.Once home I was greeted by the dogs who were happy to see me. We did our afternoon walk and played frisbee. Afterwards we all took a nap. To fit the mood and the direction of they day, I burned the dogs dinner. They didn't complain or act like they even noticed. I appreciated that. Afterwards we sat on the porch and as the sun set, geese were flying over. It was so peaceful and quiet sitting there with the dogs, and as night fell, I realized that things seem a bit brighter."},
{"title": "The Pecking Order and The Chub Club", "date": "Monday, September 6, 2010", "text": "At our house there is an interesting pack dynamic. We are so lucky in that all the dogs get along with one another and fights are very rare. If they do occur it almost always involves Sheba who is the youngest at almost 5 years old and who is the one I consider our \"problem child.\" Sheba is very affectionate, she listens really well and is easy going, but around the other dogs she can be the most moody and short-tempered of any of them. At times she will challenge those above her in the pecking order and they very quickly put her in back in her place. Despite this, I really think that the reason all the dogs get along has to do with their ages and that they all are Goldens, with the exception of Charlie of course.Within the pack there is what I call the \"core group.\" This group consists of Wendy who is the Matriarch, Rudi, the top dog, CarrieAnne and Josh, They have been together for more than 7 years and Charlie and Sheba joined about 4 years ago. They are a pretty tight-knit group. I think it's because they really grew up together. But they seem to have a respect for one another and they are almost always together in the same room. It's interesting at least to me, that none of the new comers have been given a \"membership\" into this club, and I don't really know why. However I think that as long as all the dogs know they have a place with us, there is a harmony and balance within the pack.This brings me to \"our boy\" Sam, (pictured on the right with Rudi). He arrived here almost exactly a year ago. While he gets along with all the dogs and they get along with him, Sam really has wanted so much to play with Sheba and the others. They pretty much ignore him and he has stayed on the outside not really having another dog to play with. (Kinda sad I know)That all changed with the arrival of he Chub Brothers, Bubba and Toby. Sam instantly connected with them and was accepted into the club of this dynamic duo. The three of them have formed what I have been calling \"The Chub Club.\" Sam will even wash Bubba's face. The 3 of them are almost always together and I have to admit Sam seems a bit more content. I think Sam even looks like he belongs with them, don't you? (The below picture is Sam on the left, Bubba in the middle, Toby on the right). But wait, I got this e-mail from the rescue the other day...Hey Kim,How is the swimming going for Bubba and how is Toby?Its been awhile that they have been with you and am wondering if they might be ready to have their sweet faces on the web and put on the available dog list? Or not yet? Let us know. Back to reality and remembering that \"The Chub Brothers\" are here to find a new home. However I have to be honest, because I'm wondering when and how do I tell the rescue that these boys aren't going anywhere, and it's all Sam's fault?!"},
{"title": "The Weekend and Sam and Doris", "date": "Saturday, September 4, 2010", "text": "It's Labor Day weekend here in the US and Canada! Labor Day is great for a lot of reasons because there are so many possibilities of things to do on a long weekend! One thing a lot of people use a long weekend for is to finish up summer projects--That's what it is for us--We've FINALLY finished painting our barn and the trim on our house, which by the way I hate to admit was started LAST fall! The weather certainly does have a fall feel to it! We've turned off the air-conditioning and opened up the windows. The dogs really loved being able to be outside in this great weather, especially Charlie who has been out in the yard most of the day.When we were done painting we sat on the porch for a while, read magazines and relaxed with the dogs. As usual, its been another busy and long week for Carl and I, and we just love to be able to relax and just take it easy.I did hear from \"Sam's sister\" Patty this week. She called me on Thursday to tell me that her Mom, Doris was still really missing Sam and wanted her to call me and find out how he was doing. Apparently Doris's transition into her new home is off to a bit of a bumpy start because during her first week she cried quite a bit and hardly left her room. Patty admitted that despite how her Mom was feeling, she'd been putting off calling because she didn't want to bother me. Of course I told her she could and should call anytime, and that I was going to e-mail them that evening, but she had beaten me to it by calling. We had a nice chat and I promised her that I would send her weekly updates for her to pass onto her Mom and when she felt her Mom was strong enough, I would bring Sam to see her. I have to admit that I felt a bit guilty for being out of touch and I was again a bit sad for Doris.Just before bedtime that night, I'd let Sam out into the yard with the other dogs. He usually doesn't go far. In his old age, Sam has pretty much transformed his walks into a simple process of elimination—a dutiful, head-down trudge. When finished, he walks back to the porch, seemingly oblivious to his surroundings, absorbed in the task of placing foot before foot before foot before foot....But I guess I'd left him out there longer than I should have or he got disoriented because when I went to let him in he wasn't with the others. I realized that he'd wandered into the back part of our fenced yard and into the pitch-darkness. As Sam and I slowly walked back towards the house, I couldn't help but think about he and Doris. The thought occurred to me that Carl and I are merely Sam's caretaker of his physical well being. He appears to be content, he seems happy to see us when we return, eats his meals, and will rub his head on your leg when you talk to him and pet and scratch him. But I know that his heart belongs to Doris, the one he grew old and frail with. How I wish they could be together."},
{"title": "Highway Robbery?", "date": "Tuesday, August 31, 2010", "text": "Would you like to see what \"highway robbery\" looks like in Loudoun County Virginia? Well, here it is. Doesn't it look so innocent? Well don't be fooled. Under the country exterior of this farmers market there is a crime being committed...Let me tell you how I uncovered this little local scandal that is happening right under the nose of all of us who pass by this stand every day...It all started with my buying produce from a farmer down the road from us. His prices were very reasonable; under a dollar (.75 cents) a pound for vegetables. I've enjoyed stopping by there the last several weeks buying whatever they had, squash, green beans, cucumbers and tomatoes. It's all done on the honor system. You go inside this little shed (below) and pick out what you want. There was a scale, you weigh what you have, and put your money in an old cookie tin. A lot of times I left more money than I spent. One day I was so appreciative of the beautiful produce that I left a note thanking them...Corny I know, but I was just so grateful to find a good place to buy fresh veggies. I even bought free range eggs, that were really pretty--Most were brown, some were kind of green in color. But I could tell the garden was about \"done\" when the counters that were once full of fresh produce and eggs were looking a bit bare. I really wanted some fresh tomatoes so I decided to stop at the place whose picture is at the start of this post. I was stunned at the prices. The tomatoes were $3.50 a pound (£2.27) cucumbers were $2 each (£1.29) and a dozen of the free-range eggs were $5 a dozen (£3.24) and don't get me started about how much the apples and cantaloupes were!! Those prices are nearly doubled than the ones at \"the fine grocery store (that I love) known as Wegmans\" and I left the little roadside market with my bag clutched tight and a new commitment to have my own garden next year!I really want to support the local growers and farmers, and I know I shouldn't complain.  I know it's hard work to grow a garden--But am I the only one who thinks those prices may be a little steep??"},
{"title": "A Prize to Start My Week!", "date": "Monday, August 30, 2010", "text": "At the end of a long, busy day at work it was a real treat to open my mailbox this evening and find a package from blogging-friend Sharon of Life with Jack and Jill Sharon ran a contest last week where we were asked to come up with a caption of a picture of her pup Jill.  The followers of her blog voted for their favorite caption, and I won!     Sharon always keeps things interesting on her blog and added a twist to this contest by not telling those of us who entered what we would win, so I was excited to see what my surprise package would be!I have to admit that I thought it would be something \"dog-related.\" It wasn't--Sharon you really did surprise me!! When I opened the package I found these really lovely coffee spoons! Sharon told me that they are \"Frank M. Whiting, George III pattern that was patented in 1891.\" They really have very pretty detail on them!  Coffee spoons bring back memories for me. My Mom used to have them and my siblings and I used to use them for everything from cereal to hot chocolate. I think it was partly because they sit so comfortably in your hand. Eventually the ones my Mom had became lost, so I really am excited that I now have my own to use!  I don't know about all of you, but I really love trivia! My head is filled with it, and I'm going to finish this post by asking you if you know why coffee spoons are used? It's because usually tea is served hotter than coffee, but it is not drunk in its hot stage. In order to be able to start drinking tea shortly after it has been served, a wider cup is used, than those cups used for coffee. To help reduce the waiting time, a spoon is used to cool the drink and the larger the spoon, the quicker the tea will be drinkable. Coffee is typically drank differently so it requires a different role for a spoon. A spoon is (supposed to be) only used to stir the milk and the sugar, without a need for cooling. So the coffee spoon is smaller, so it will have less effect on the temperature of the drink. And if you are NOT like me and follow the rules of etiquette, always make sure to serve a coffee with a coffee spoon. ~And I'll bet you thought I only knew about dogs!!~ I hope you'll take a moment and stop by Sharon's blog!  Sharon has a really fun sense of humor, and I've so enjoyed her posts from the chapters of her life, and getting to know her!!   Thank-you so much Sharon for the nice prize!!  It's a great way to end a Monday and to start my week!"},
{"title": "Weekend in Picture Review", "date": "Sunday, August 29, 2010", "text": "We had a nice quiet weekend!! I really needed some down-time and wanted to spend time with the dogs before the week goes into high gear. We didn't do too much.Carl mowed the grass... I tended my dying flowers, however I'll leave these cone flowers for the birds to enjoy.The dogs watched from the porch. (Hamlet on the left New/Old Sam on the right) But unknown to the dogs, something else was watching from the porch too--Do you see it? I am quite sure this Praying Mantis saw me--It looks like its smiling, doesn't it? That ended working on my flowers. So we went for a walk. I'd much rather see this Swallowtail butterfly! We walked up to the top of the hill in back of our property. It really has a nice view of the Short Hill Mountains. Sheba and Rudi love going to the top of the hill too--It usually means some new smell for them to roll in!  Even Hamlet made the walk. He never looks like he's out of breath. On the way back down the hill, I did see a \"fatality\" that was caused by one of our dogs--I've no idea how it got there or how long it had been there (Yes, it's a stuffed squirrel minus its head). After church today I took Bubba swimming. If you've not seen it, below this post there is a 40 second video of him.When I got back the other dogs and I played a round of frisbee. It doesn't take much to wear them out. (Sheba top, Josh second picture)   Afterwards we sat on the porch, relaxed and watched the sun go down. It was a nice way to end the weekend.  I hope you've had a good weekend too!! (Josh)This is just a quick 40 second video that I took today and it shows what swim-therapy is like for Bubba. He is now on his 12th session and while it's not very exciting it gives you an idea--Pretty much all I do is lead Bubba around the pool and he quietly swims with the ball in his mouth. It's quite boring I'm afraid, but of course very good for him and I think he likes it! I'm really noticing a difference as he is picking up the pace a little bit when he walks and has even managed a little bit of a gallop--A good sign!"},
{"title": "A Wild Week and Sam", "date": "Wednesday, August 25, 2010", "text": "A typical crazy, hectic start to the week has, as always, put me behind on all the things that I enjoy doing; including reading many of your blogs. With my day off on Thursday, I hope to get caught up--I've missed reading what everyone is up too.Sam continues to settle into his new life in the \"group home.\" This evening he was in the crowd to meet me when I came home. It's always a good sign to see these pups up and about and part of the crowd. The only thing I've not seen from Sam is a tail-wag...I hope I see that soon...I did hear from Doris's daughter, Pat. She was supposed to be there on Saturday when I picked up Sam, but she just felt that she couldn't, so her husband met me instead. Pat did e-mail me on Monday and asked about Sam. I responded and sent her a picture. Below is a response that I received from her today which again confirms how much Doris treasures her boy Sam.Hi KimThank you for the lovely e-mail with Sam's picture, and for being so understanding about Saturday. I just didn't think I could handle seeing him go. I printed your e-mail and brought it over to my Mother to read and see Sam's picture. I can't tell you how much your care of Sam means to my Mom, she loves Sam so very much and tried so hard to care for him. Mom is going through so many major adjustments with losing her home and moving into an Assisted Living Facility, and her knowing that Sam is happy means more than you can imagine.I appreciate your kindness and compassion for our situation, please give Sam a big kiss and hug from his Sister.Thank you again for everything, please let me know if you need anything further.Please stay in touch.Blessings,Pat, Sam's SisterIsn't that a nice e-mail? It all continues to pull at my heartstrings.By the way, someone asked about how we're dealing with having 2 Sam's in our household. It's really not a challenge at all because neither one of the Sam's listen, and at least \"old Sam\" who is hard of hearing has an excuse!I hope you all are having a good week!"},
{"title": "Sam Arrives at Golden Pines", "date": "Sunday, August 22, 2010", "text": "In his much younger days Sam was said to be a maniac. He was a bit territorial, leash aggressive and didn't get along that well with other dogs. He chewed everything and anything including doors and trim and even a garage door. He got into the trash and stole food off the counter. The dog that is laying on the floor in my living room is no longer this dog. He days of bolting through an open door and running off are now memories for him. He has problems walking because of arthritis and may even have a slight problem with incontinence. He is also a bit confused and I know he doesn't quite understand what has happened to him.  But there is still a spark there. He tried to chase the cat and even tried a little bit of 'dominance' over Hamlet...He fell to the floor...twice...Poor Sam...Poor Hamlet. But there's no question that Sam has been well cared for. His coat is neat, nails are trimmed and his teeth look good too. When I spoke with Doris last evening, I promised her I'd let her know how he was doing, and that when she got all settled, we'd arrange something where she could see him. I know that the rescue won't approve of that, but I doubt I'll even let them know. Doris was there when Sam needed someone and made a difference for him. She dearly loves Sam and I know is very concerned about him. I can't and won't be heartless in this whole thing.Tanner's vet visit went well. His eyes are just fine, pressure is normal in his good eye, and not able to be measured in the eye he has no site in. We're just to really watch him for any dramatic changes and not to vary his routine. My vet thinks he's in pretty good shape.Hamlet on the other hand...I've been in a bit of denial about the return of the tumor. But it's time to face the reality and that's that it is bigger than I thought it was. It's not bigger than it was originally, but it is pretty deep within the tissue of his shoulder and extends up under his front leg. My vet doesn't think that doing the surgery again is going to work. So much tissue was removed in the first surgery and if we do the surgery again, because it came back so quickly, it would no doubt return and we'd be having the same discussion. We both agree that it's a good idea to be proactive and so I'll be making an appointment with the holistic vet to see what she has in her bag of tricks for us to try. Hamlet otherwise is healthy.It was a very busy day. Carl worked on getting our barn-doors ready to be repainted and after Sam was settled I did some late afternoon errands. The day ended on a very quiet note, everyone was worn out from a game of frisbee and a couple of good long walks. All was quiet and then I heard Sam harassing the cat...Yes, that spark is still there and there are a couple of things he's going to have to learn--Can you teach an old dog a new trick?"},
{"title": "A Dog Day", "date": "Saturday, August 21, 2010", "text": "I'm getting behind, and I'd hoped to have a day to get caught up on things around the house and with my blog reading too. But it doesn't look like it's going to happen. At least not today.Hamlet (pictured) has a vet appointment this morning. Unfortunately the huge lipoma that he had removed in April has returned. I'd hoped that it wouldn't and if it did, perhaps it wouldn't be as big. While it's not as big as it was, it is growing and with the tightness of the skin, it's bothering him. I don't want to put him through another surgery, so I'm going to discuss with my vet about Hamlet seeing a holistic vet. There's one in this practice that uses Chinese herbs. I've used them in the past and one in particular shrunk the tumor of a senior boy that I had at the time. We'll see. Tanner is also coming along for a check up as well. He's had a good week and no \"senior moments\" that I noticed. Finally, I received a bit of a frantic phone call yesterday from the rescue. There is an 88 year old widowed lady named Doris that fell and broke her hip. She adopted a dog from the rescue in 2001 and is now unable to care for him. She has been in the hospital for 2 weeks and is now going to be moved to a senior care facility that doesn't allow pets. He has been left in her house alone, and of course she has missed him terribly and is very worried about him; so much so that she's been calling her home several times a day and leaving messages on the answering machine so he could hear her voice. (Someone has been coming to her home twice a day to let the dog out). No one in the family wants the dog and they all feel that he should be put down, but Doris doesn't want to do that. Doris and her vet think that he may have some quality of life left. Can you finish this story? Yes, we (or should I say \"I\") agreed to take him. I am going to be picking \"Sam\" up today after our vet appointments. There is no question and even I will admit that we are truly (!!) bursting apart at the seams, but I always have room for another...I called Doris and spoke with her. To say that she's heartbroken about giving up her precious Sam is an understatement. By the way, did I mention that her treasured Golden is 15 years old? The life expectancy of a Golden Retriever is 12-14 years. I know we won't have him for long. But this is so sad for Sam and Doris to lose one another at a time when they need each other most."},
{"title": "A Terrible Way to Start the Day!", "date": "Thursday, August 19, 2010", "text": "It was bound to happen. I should have known it was only a matter of time. But I've felt that we were a bit invincible and it couldn't possibly happen to us. I was wrong and it almost cost Rudi her life. What could I possibly be talking about? Well, let me tell you...It all started with our pear tree. For several reasons we won't be able to enjoy them this year so I've been letting the dogs eat them as they find them on the ground. They are really small this year, a little smaller than a tennis ball and the skins are very rough. But each morning a couple of the dogs go to the tree and find the pears that have fallen off. This morning was no different. When we were done with our walk I saw that Rudi had found another one and was carrying it around in her mouth. I never let the dogs bring the pears inside but today I went ahead and let Rudi bring it in with her to eat. Sheba and Josh immediately noticed that she had one and were quick to try and get their share of it. Rudi was prancing around making all her noises and was doing what I can only describe as showing off that she had something that the others wanted and something that she knew wasn't allowed inside.I don't know how it happened all I know is that I heard this noise in the living room and saw that Rudi was struggling to breathe and I immediately knew that she had swallowed the pear! I don't know how many times I grabbed her to try and help her, but she kept getting away from me. I couldn't really see the whole pear when I opened her mouth but I could see enough of it to know that it was beyond reach of just grabbing it and pulling it out. Another problem was that she kept locking her teeth as she kept trying to swallow it. I can't begin to tell you the panic I was feeling. In my head I did the quick math and knew that with the morning traffic it could take me at least 25 minutes to get to the vet. I could see that her gums were already starting to turn pale and I felt that she probably wouldn't make it if I made the trip. I knew that I had to find a way to remove the pear.I do know how to do the Heimlich maneuver on a person and I know that can be done on a dog, but I don't know exactly how to do it. So I straddled Rudi and put my hand on the outside of her neck. I could feel the pear and so I tried to work it back up her throat. I felt it move and come back up part way, but at that moment Rudi forced herself away from me. I grabbed her again and got her down onto the floor; I think I was practically laying on top of her to keep her from getting away from me. Her teeth were clamped shut and I wished that Carl had been there to open her mouth. I don't know if I have ever felt so panicked, scared and as alone and in such despair as I did at that moment. I pleaded with God to please help me to know what to do, to please not let my precious Rudi die because of something I had so foolishly thought would never happen. I remember the dogs standing there watching and I recall saying something to them about how afraid I was, that I didn't know what to do because Rudi wasn't letting me try to get the pear out.No sooner had I said all of that than all those feelings were gone and there a sense of calm that came over me and Rudi became very quiet and still. Laying on the floor I again tried to push the pear back up her throat. SLOWLY but surely it rose up her throat. Rudi let me open her mouth, so with that hand I held it open and with the other I held the pear and I was able to grab it and remove it from her throat!! We both laid there on the floor for several minutes as I cried and said prayers of thanks--Rudi also laid there quietly, panting and trying to swallow. When I stood up the dogs came to me and gave me what I felt like was a \"congratulations\" because they all started barking, and some of them were licking Rudi's face--It felt like a real celebration! Actually come to think of it, it was.There was blood on the pear and I worried that something in Rudi's throat could be torn so I took her to the vet. It took me 30 minutes to get there. The vet checked Rudi out and feels that she is okay, but she's been given some antibiotics just in case. He told me that I'd saved Rudi's life. He also told me that this happens most frequently with tennis balls. Most people he said take them to try and get help and the dog sometimes dies on the way. I am very humbled and thankful beyond what any words can say that today that didn't happen."},

Carl is again working days this week and left the house this morning around 4 AM and will get home after I do this evening. (I think Carl likes to leave early because he doesn't have to make the bed!) So before my day goes into high gear, I wanted to thank those of you who took a moment from your lives and shared your thoughts, experiences, and gave support as we wade into the unknown with Tanner. After reading your comments, and also a link provided by \"Shelia and Bob\" I do think that a bit of dementia has set in for him. Since he's due to have his eyes checked again, I made an appointment for him to see the vet on Thursday. Whenever there's a change in one of our dogs, I think it's a good idea for the vet to see them to make sure nothing is being overlooked.As you know, we have cared for several senior Goldens. But each one as they have reached this tender age and their years start to show, their path becomes unique and different from the one before. I can't help it, I always find myself a bit bewildered as we begin what we know is our final journey together. Of course I don't know how long it will be until it ends. However for now, I don't have to think about that; I firmly believe that despite these \"senior moments\" Tanner is happy and healthy. We will continue in the direction we've been taking with him and when he unknowingly veers off course we'll be his guide and his compass to help him get headed back in the right direction--Thank-goodness he doesn't drive or cook!"},
{"title": "Concern for Tanner", "date": "Sunday, August 15, 2010", "text": "Today I'm finding myself once again concerned about Tanner. Some of you know that he's a 13+ year old Golden that we've had for just over 2 years. He had treatment for glaucoma, and at the end of May had a bout of canine vestibular syndrome. While I think that he's about 98% back to where he was, I have my concerns about him since this occurred. Sometimes Tanner doesn't seem like he knows where he is--This has just started happening since he was hit with that. When I got home from church, I left the backdoor open so the dogs could go in and out. A little later when I went to shut the door I found Tanner laying in the grass in the pouring rain--When I called him he seemed a bit startled, but got up and came back inside, tail wagging like nothing was wrong.  It was like all the sudden he clicked back into reality. This isn't the first time this has happened.  We watch him very closely outside because he will sometimes wander off or just seem to walk aimlessly and end up in the bushes. While I know that he has limited eye-site because he's blind in his right eye, he still has vision in his left. I find it all a bit unsettling and a bit sad too...Is it maybe just old age or could it be as a result of the vestibular syndrome--Any thoughts?"},
{"title": "A Lazy Saturday", "date": "Saturday, August 14, 2010", "text": "Its been a pretty quiet week at Golden Pines.Carl who has been working his month of nights was changed to days this week. This means that I'm playing the role of \"single parent\" and having to do everything in the morning and in the evening with the dogs which doesn't leave me time to do much else--I'm not complaining, it just keeps me busy. (Sheba above)It's great that the weekend is here. Carl was nice and made the bed this morning. Didn't he do a good job?We decided that we would go and look at pavers at one of the nurseries today. I really want something besides dirt and grass around our back-porch. We just have to decide on the size and kind of stone, concrete or flagstone--Who knew there were so many choices? Then we went to Wegmans grocery store. For those of you who have never heard of Wegmans, I'm not quite sure how to describe it. But I think that it's a name that strikes fear in the hearts of supermarket owners from New York to Virginia. They offer specialty shops and in-store cafes for whatever you may be craving. There's also a seafood bar, deli, cheese shops with around 300 different varieties, and even a French-style pastry shop, and a flower and gift shop too--They even offer gourmet cooking classes. With the exception of valet parking, you name it, and they will probably have it. Can you tell I love Wegmans? (By the way, Wegmans policy is that you can't take pictures inside the store, so I copied this one from their website. But we have this same view from our stores mezzanine where you can sit and enjoy lunch, dinner, coffee or whatever...Did I mention that I love Wegmans?)After my culinary outing we came home. The dogs are good. I asked for and got permission from the rescue to continue the swim-therapy for Bubba. YAY!! He was supposed to have gone swimming on Thursday. But Bubba and Toby both needed their nails trimmed (or sawed off) because they were so long and I couldn't do it myself. I had it all worked out. I'd take them in, let the groomers at the vets office that the rescue uses do the job and off I'd go. It would have all worked out if the person who did the nail trim would not have nicked the quick of Bubba's nail or his toe or something that had him sporting a bandage on his foot the last couple of days. They were vague about what they did, but the vet wasn't about his not going swimming. I took it off today and saw that the nail has been cut pretty short.We did a little bit of yard work--Carl pulled off \"bag worms\" from one of our trees. We weren't paying attention and quite a few of them attached themselves to one of our pine trees. I'm hoping the tree will recover and the caterpillar that you can see emerging from it's \"bag\" and its friends won't. While Carl was collecting caterpillars I played frisbee with the dogs and we just hung out. Its been a nice afternoon. All the dogs are worn out from playing and I think I'm going to join them in a late afternoon nap. (Top photo Rudi--Middle is Sheba--Bottom is Josh)   I hope you're having a relaxing weekend too!!

{"title": "Serenity on Saturday", "date": "Saturday, August 7, 2010", "text": "It's a beautiful start to the day at Golden Pines! The temps are cool enough that I've turned off the air-conditioning and opened the windows to get in some much needed fresh air. When I was walking the dogs this morning, there were Canadian Geese flying overhead--There has been a feel in the air that summer is coming to an end.This morning I'm taking Bubba for his 6th session of swimming. I can tell the difference in that he's so much more stable on his feet than he was previously. He can still be a bit \"tippy\" but not nearly like he was. I'm going to ask the rescue if we can sign up for 10 more session--Swimming is so much easier for him verses taking him for a walk. I did weigh him the other day to see if he'd lost any weight and am proud to say that the scale said he weighed 10 pounds (about 4.5 kg) MORE than he did when he came to us--I'm hoping that was wrong and it was because he was soaking wet...When I get back I need to find a place in my already crowded kitchen for the set of dishes I brought back from my Mom's. This will mean that I have 3 full sets of dishes to use for 2 people. I really don't want to pack them away. I think dishes should be used and enjoyed. I bought them for my Mom who put them away and never did. I also brought back embroidered linens, dessert cups from when I was a kid and a picture that was hanging in my Mom's bedroom--It once hung in my Grandfather's house (of course!) Since I've been feeling rather philosophical lately, I'll end my post today with this:May today there be peace within. (CC)May you trust that you are exactly where you are meant to be. (Hamlet)May you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith in yourself and others. (Sheba)May you use the gifts that you have received, and pass on the love that has been given to you. (Chub Brothers)May you be content with yourself just the way you are. (Charlie)Let this knowledge settle into your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, praise and love. (Rudi)It is there for each and every one of us.  Enjoy your weekend!!"},
{"title": "Part 2--Trip Down Memory Lane", "date": "Thursday, August 5, 2010", "text": "Its been said and I agree that we are as human beings the sum total of our experiences and memories. Our memories make us almost more than our genes as they give our lives meaning. We become what we have seen, done, tasted, etc...if that makes any sense. But this is how I feel about my memories and \"going to Grandpa's.\" I knew that this place in the country that I'd loved growing up would be changed. The road you turn onto to get to the house is now paved, and the old farmhouse that my Grandfather lived in for many, many years is gone and there are a few homes that have been built. The barnyard has changed. There used to be an old barn and a corn-crib; they've been torn down and replaced. The pine trees that surrounded the barnyard are gone too. However, this view which is the one we used to see from the front porch seemed to me very much the same. My Grandfather loved trees! Around the old farmhouse there were pecan, walnut and oak trees that were over 100 years old. There was one tree that was Grandpa's pride and joy, and that was a Mimosa tree. We were allowed to climb any tree that we wanted, however, climbing the Mimosa tree was forbidden! The words from 40+ years ago of him telling us many (many!) times \"that you can't climb on my Mimosa\" are as vivid in my mind if they'd been said yesterday. Its smooth soft branches and delicate pink blooms were really lovely and may not have withstood the weight of kids climbing on it.On Monday when I pulled up to where the house used to stand, the first thing I saw was a Mimosa tree. I couldn't help but be taken by that because there were hummingbirds around and one sat on a branch nearby. As I looked around there were several other Mimosa trees growing too. I wondered how Grandpa would feel knowing that there was a new generation of Mimosa trees growing from the single tree from so many years ago.  As I looked at the rest of the property I could pick out the direction we used to take to get to the creek and the woods. A little ways down the road at this corner I knew that the road led to the creek where we used to wade so I decided to drive down it.  I had the dogs with me and once at the creek I let them out to wade.   While I couldn't find them, I am relatively sure that this tree is the one where my siblings and I once carved our initials. The one lane road leading to the creek left no room for me to turn around so I decided I that I would drive up the road to find a place. I found a driveway and turned into it. Sitting in the yard in lawn chairs under a tree were two men probably in their 70's drinking their morning coffee. Both were clean-shaven and one wore faded overalls with a red hat. The other had on dark faded blue work pants with an old light blue shirt with his name on it and a green hat. Sitting in between them tied up was a hound dog. Of course they eyed me suspiciously--I suppose a gray haired lady in a van with Virginia license plates and a Golden Retriever in the front seat doesn't pull into their driveway everyday. The man in the work clothes stood up and walked towards me. I got a glimpse of the name \"Sammy\" on his shirt and realized he was someone that used to work for my Grandfather and someone that I had worked with when I packed for a moving company in college. What are the chances of that??!! The other man could be no one else but his brother Leroy. I told them who I was and of course they remembered me and my family. Sammy and Leroy are confirmed bachelors partly because I think were just too shy to talk to women--This really hadn't changed as Leroy hardly made eye contact with me when he talked and sat there trimming his fingernails with his pocket knife and petting the dog. It was a nice visit and I left saying a prayer of thanks that none of this ended like something out of the movie \"Deliverance!\" I just wish I'd thought to get a picture of them--You'll just have to use your imagination.On my way back from the creek I again stopped where the house had been and remembered one more time...I decided that I really wanted a Mimosa Tree, but I couldn't find one small enough to dig up, so I settled for seedpods instead.My last stop would be the small cemetery where my Grand Parents and other family members are buried. When I got there I wasn't really sure where to start looking but as I stood there trying to decide I noticed a big Mimosa tree that was near where I was standing. One of its branches was hanging over a headstone and underneath the shade of this beautiful tree was the headstone of my Grandparents. I was so touched to see this because it could not be a more perfect final resting place. As I drove back home it occurred to me that we all need our memories and our roots. Without them we are incomplete. And from my trip to Short Creek I realized that my memories and my roots and who I am is partly found in and under a Mimosa tree."},
{"title": "Memories and a Trip Down Rural Route 54", "date": "Wednesday, August 4, 2010", "text": "I returned home from Kentucky yesterday evening. It was a wonderful visit!A true highlight for me was a trip to where my Grandfather used to live. Growing up my siblings and I spent many, many days there fishing in the pond, (with a cane pole) playing in the woods and wading in the creek. I really do think that this is where I found my love of the country and the desire to live away from it all.My Grandfather lived in a microscopic town called \"Short Creek.\" But you have to go through the town of Leitchfield (pronounced Litch-field) to get there. I've not been in this direction in many years and wasn't sure I'd be able to find my way there. The road is now 4 lanes and looks very different. Eventually it became the 2 lanes that I remembered...Along the way there were many memories...The first one was this little drive-in called \"Lakers.\" We sometimes would stop here on the way back from my Grandfathers. They had the best fish sandwiches! They also used to wait on you at your car--I suppose getting out of your car to eat is okay too! I always marveled at the height of this bridge that the trains crossed--I wonder if they still do? (YIKES!!!!)I was glad to see this company still in business. I remember asking my Grandfather what they did there, and he told us \"they put the stingers in bees.\" Of course I believed him and marveled at their ability to do such a thing! This became a family joke for years. I arrived in Leitchfield. In the south, many of the old towns have their courthouses in the middle of them. Once out of the \"big city\" it quickly gave way to old barns.Farmed fields of soy beans... Tobacco (pictured in the front) and corn...and more tobacco... A final stop before getting to my Grandfathers was this little general store. It was owned by an elderly lady named \"Tula\" whose home was in the back of the store. She had small-circled wire-rim glasses, always wore a flowered-cotton dress with a full apron, and her hair was always kept in a bun with a hair-net. We would stop here and enjoy bottled soda and Cracker-Jacks that were usually stale and stuck together. Tula wouldn't allow us to take the bottles (the bottles were worth 5 cents each) so we had to quickly drink them there. I will end today's post on that note. Tomorrow I will post about my visit to the place where my Grandfather's house used to stand. For me, it was an amazing and touching visit as I recalled many memories from my childhood and chatted with a few people that I'd forgotten about. I hope you'll come back tomorrow, I'd love to share them with you. I am glad to be home, back to all the wagging-tails of our crew, and high-speed internet!  I am also looking forward to catching up on your blogs!"},

Charlie, Rudi, Sheba and I will be driving him back home on Saturday. Which also means I'll be taking a break from blogging for a few days. My brother Jeff and another brother John live in the home that was owned by my parents.

A little later I went into the bedroom and saw this sticking out from underneath the bed. Who said cats don't have a sense of humor? The rest of the day, which included a trip to the swim-center with Bubba and a very nice chat with Roger the owner, were all uneventful.

{"title": "Lessons from a Storm", "date": "Monday, July 26, 2010", "text": "A powerful storm with high winds, sideways rain, that caused a 20 hour power outage Sunday afternoon is behind us.Here are a few things I learned during it...When you totally depend on electricity for everything, including water, don't take the dogs for a walk after the storm because they may roll in something and need a bath.Hang out on the porch and notice the life around you instead.  When you have 2 hungry and tired travelers and no way to cook for them, take them out to a quality place to eat to make them feel better. A full moon and internet withdrawal don't go together.  In a power outage remember that popsicles don't refreeze, so to keep them from going to waste, you should eat them all.No electricity is the perfect excuse to just relax and enjoy the company of those around you that you care about.I hope you're all having an enjoyable start to your week!"},
{"title": "Sorry for Sam...", "date": "Sunday, July 25, 2010", "text": "One of my favorite characters is Peter Pan. There's a scene in the movie \"Hook\" where Peter Pan (played by Robin Williams) is telling the older character Wendy (my very favorite!!) the story of how he came to Neverland. He relates to Wendy how he used to visit the window of the home of his parents. He explains how he felt when he looked into their closed window and saw that they had forgotten all about him, and had another child. This part of the story has really been on my mind lately.Some of you may recall the story of how our 10 year old Golden named Sam, came to live with us. You can read it here if you'd like. The short version is that he came to us via a family at the church we attend who, for several reason found that couldn't keep him any longer. While they asked for Sam to be returned back in February, in the end it was decided that Sam should remain with us.Well, a few weeks ago they got another dog. I have to admit that this has bothered me. Postings on Facebook (my other addition) have been glowing accounts of what a wonderful dog their new addition is. While I'm sure this is true, for some reason I was bothered by a posting of his picture and these words from Sam's former owner:\"This is Kodiak, AKA Koda. He joined our family yesterday after we met him at an adoption event. He is absolutely wonderful in every way. He just needs to gain a little weight to be where he needs to be. He is an absolute love and seems thrilled to have a family who desperately wants to give him the love and attention he deserves! My Kodabear!!\"I know that Sam has a good life with us, and I shouldn't feel this way. But in my heart, it doesn't keep me from feeling sorry for him. I'm sorry that they seem to have forgotten all about Sam and closed that window. I know that life does continue. I know that lives and circumstances do change. I also live in the real world, (at least part of the time), and I know that many families who have given dogs up, do end up getting another. But I guess this is different because I just didn't know about it."},
{"title": "Road Trip to Mount Vernon", "date": "Saturday, July 24, 2010", "text": "A heat advisory was issued because of the blistering temperatures but it didn't stop my friend Sid and I from taking a road trip to Mount Vernon, which is the plantation home of the first President of the United States, George Washington. The 14 room mansion is built of wood in the neoclassical Georgian architectural style and is situated along the shores of the Potomac River. It is beautifully restored and furnished with original objects dating back to the 1740's. It is one of the most scenic attractions in the Washington, DC area.You're asked to not take pictures inside the mansion, so I found the below photo online to give you an idea of one of the rooms. This is the formal dining room. The paint color is said to be the original color it was when George resided there. I personally don't think it's the most appealing color and it kind of makes me lose my appetite. One thing that I found interesting was a key from the Bastille. In 1789, a Paris mob sparked the French Revolution by storming the Bastille, a political prison and symbol of absolute monarchy. The next year, Lafayette ordered its demolition and sent an original key to the Bastille to his former commander. They key is still where George Washington displayed it. (I probably would have just put it in a drawer and wondered later what it went too). Washington added a stunning two-story porch, or \"piazza,\" overlooking the Potomac. Here family and guests would gather in warm weather to enjoy the breeze off the river. We sat and were cooled by the breeze too! Another Washington addition to the house was a cupola which served as both a decorative rooftop element and a practical device. With windows open, the cupola helped to cool the house on sultry summer days like the ones we've been having. After the war, Washington added to the Mansion its final crowning touch, a dove of peace weather-vane atop the cupola.It's an amazing view to sit and enjoy! That's Virginia on the left and Maryland to the right. I'll let these next two pictures speak for themselves...  The gardens are amazing! There are flowers for every season: hollyhocks, peonies, primroses, heliotrope, larkspur, and dozens of other specimens, all of which were grown here by the Washington's.  There were butterflies everywhere!  There are also many varieties of trees. Some of these magnificent trees were planted by George Washington himself. This Tulip Poplar tree was planted by ole George in 1785. I really love old trees and if this one could talk, imagine the tales it could tell!I wonder if this little fella had ancestors that lived here when George Washington resided here...The heat left us exhausted, so we needed a place to cool off! Upon arrival at the Krispy Kreme the \"Hot Doughnut\" sign was not turned on, so there were no freshly made doughnuts. However, this was okay; there's nothing nothing like a COLD Krispy Kreme Doughnut on a hot July day!  I think George Washington would have thought so too!It was an enjoyable visit with my friend! She left this afternoon and my brother arrives tomorrow. He comes every year, and as always, I'm looking forward to his visit. Carl is too because that means he'll be getting dinner every night! I hope you've had an enjoyable weekend too!!"},
{"title": "Round Two for Bubba", "date": "Friday, July 23, 2010", "text": "The second swim-session for Bubba was on Thursday. It went so much better than the first one, and he was much happier and so was I! I've taken dogs swimming that haven't enjoyed it at all, and I've felt like I'm mistreating them because I know how difficult it is for them; especially when you look into their eyes which are asking you why are you making them do something that they simply do not enjoy? But we all know that therapy of any kind is never easy...Bubba did \"graduate\" to the big pool and we doubled his amount of time in the water. He didn't seem to mind at all. He continues to have problems getting out of the pool, but it was made easier because the ramp to help them get out is not nearly as steep. Bubba's second session ended with him smiling and wanting to go back into the pool, but this time it was us telling him he'd had enough for the day. I'm looking forward to taking him again on Sunday. This morning for the first time he was playing with a couple of stuffed toys. Maybe the endorphins from the exercise is making him feel better? Or maybe it's because Sheba wasn't playing with them. It's a beautiful but very hot day here in Virginia. But my friend and I are going to brave the heat and go to Mount Vernon, which is the home of George Washington. It's a beautiful place and not far from Krispy Kreme Doughnuts--Do you think George and Martha would have liked that too? ~~Enjoy your Friday!!~~"},

However, it's all winding down now as I'm done with work for the week! Bubba has his second session of swimming on Thursday and I'm excited to see how he does. Our friend Sid is also coming to visit us from Pennsylvania for a couple of days. She'll be here until Saturday and then my youngest brother comes on Sunday to spend a week with us--I can't wait!

{"title": "Swim Therapy for Bubba!", "date": "Saturday, July 17, 2010", "text": "The Northern Virginia Animal Swim Center where Bubba swam today is nestled in the middle of what is known as the Hunt Country of Virginia. It's an area rich in the history of Virginia and the heartland of the Virginia equestrian industry. The Swim Center is a place where horses and dogs swim for both rehabilitation and conditioning.In my much busier and active days with the rescue, I rehabbed many dogs that had orthopedic surgery at the swim center. Roger, the British gentleman that owns the center is someone that I've known for about 8 years. His dedication and kindness to the dogs and his friendship has truly made a difference! I just can't say enough good things about Roger and how much I love his accent!!Okay, back to Bubba...He has arthritis and has trouble standing up and doing steps. My hope in taking him to swim is that he can rebuild lost muscle, get a better range of motion from it, which will allow him to get around better and easier. As I said, I've taken many dogs swimming, and believe me, not all dogs like to swim. Just because you have a Golden Retriever or another breed known to enjoy water, it doesn't mean they are lovers of the water. I've had some dogs that if they never saw another body of water again, they would just fine with it! Thankfully Bubba is not one of these dogs. He was just fine in the water, which makes it so much easier! We started Bubba in the small lap pool just to see how he would do, and get him used to the water.  Pretty soon Bubba was getting the hang of it, but he still didn't look like he was really enjoying it. As expected, because of the lack of strength in his back-end, the biggest problem Bubba had, was getting out of the pool. After about 10 minutes, a couple of breaks, and a few more laps, for a total of about 25 minutes, Bubba told us that he'd had enough, so we ended the swim session for today.And so I took a wet and very tired Bubba home. We go back on Thursday and maybe he'll be ready for the big pool, we'll just have to see. If you'd like to read about the benefits of swim-therapy, here's a link to the Swim Centers website that has a little bit of information: http://www.animalswimcenter.com/dog_rehabilitation.html"},

But some of the crew doesn't always come back right away when they're called and will sometimes wander off. Rudi?? Sheba?? Tanner??  3. Just like kids, they sometimes leave their toys outside...  4. But CC (the cat) makes sure they pick them up and bring them inside. 4. They are not too picky and pretty much all like the same things. 5. They also like new friends like Toby and Bubba. 6. But they don't like friends like Patch that don't share. 7. And at the end of the day the crew likes hanging out together. Finally, Saturday is going to be a busy day for us. Bubba is starting swim-therapy to try and build muscle in his rear-end and hopefully improve his mobility. I'll try to take pictures and let you know how it goes. I hope you have an enjoyable weekend!!"},
{"title": "The Terrible, Horrible, No Good Very Bad Day", "date": "Wednesday, July 14, 2010", "text": "I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: dogs make everything better. They are like moms who can kiss any boo-boo and make the pain go away. When I was a kid, one of my favorite books (that I still have) was one by Judith Viorst entitled Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. It’s about a little boy who experiences a day where everything goes wrong. He wakes up with gum in his hair, he goes shopping with his family for shoes and gets stuck with plain white ones, instead of ones with red or blue stripes, his lunch bag is missing dessert, there are lima beans for dinner and he witnesses kissing on television--He resolves several times to move to Australia...Today I thought the same thing--It was a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day for me. I won’t go into all the details, but it began with our lights going out late last evening during a storm. Those of you who live in the country know that when this happens it's total darkness and you cannot see your hand in front of your face. I'll admit that I do find it a bit unsettling. However Tanner (pictured here) for some reason has developed what seems to be a fear of the dark. I don't know if it has to do with his being blind in his right eye and limited vision in the other, but he paces and pants and won't settle down in the darkness. We lit candles and a couple of lanterns in hopes it would help to calm him. I was also afraid that I might oversleep so I kept waking up and checking the time. The power was restored around 4 AM. And despite a restless night and a headache from it all, the day started off okay. But then it took a turn…On my way to work I realized I’d forgotten my breakfast and lunch—Then I remembered something else I’d forgotten. We used to have set days when our dog-walker Lydia would come to let the dogs out. However, with Carl’s new work schedule, we now just call her several days ahead and are added to her schedule as needed. But I remembered that I’d forgotten to call her about coming today. Of course I called Lydia and couldn’t reach her so I left a message. I also called the business owner Christy and asked her if we could be added to the schedule—Again, I had to leave a message, and once more asked for a return call.When I got to the office the air-conditioning in our office wasn’t working, and neither was our internet connection so there would be no blog reading or checking e-mails. Add to that a couple of grouchy patients, and the request from a co-worker asking if I could work for her on my day off. To summarize, my work day was miserable and I because I’d not heard from my dog-walker, I dreaded what destruction I would find when I came home. Would there be an “accident” or two in the house? Would Rudi have found something to get into? Would Carl have remembered to close the door of the spare-bedroom, pick up the soft-toys and make sure the cat was inside?I couldn’t get home fast enough this evening. When I got home there was barking on the other side of the door, but I didn’t hear them all—so imagine my pleasant surprise when I opened the door and I was greeted with wagging tails and smiling faces. There was no destruction, there were no “presents” on the floor, the cat was inside, and Lydia the dog-walker had come. Once outside for the evening walk and romp, the dogs were very attentive and kept coming to me for pats and attention. I don’t know if they knew I’d had a bad day, but it doesn’t matter, they really did make everything better."},
{"title": "A Friday Fiasco!", "date": "Friday, July 9, 2010", "text": "Our day started off with a heart-stopping moment here at Golden Pines! The morning started off as usual. I let the dogs out, fed the cat (she'd not eaten since last night so she was starved!) and I sat down to read blogs and check e-mails. It was not unusual to have the dogs barking at something because there's almost always a rabbit having breakfast nearby. There was also a little barking inside the house, again it wasn't nothing unusual. Sheba did seem a little nervous because she came to me a couple of times and I noticed that she was a little wet around her neck, but I wasn't concerned since we'd had a some rain yesterday.Promptly at 6 o'clock, just as he always does, Sam came into the office to announce that it was time to get moving and go for our morning walk. I walked into the living room, and in the darkness of the room, I stepped on something cold and wet. I quickly turned on the light saw the wet lifeless body of a young opossum and I had stepped on its tail!!! My screams of shock, surprise or whatever you'd like to call it were no doubt heard throughout the county! They also brought about bedlam and confusion as the dogs began running to me and away from me! I yelled at all the dogs to get outside. Knowing that it was probably safer to listen to a shrieking crazy woman most of the dogs did exactly as they were told. However, Sheba who is always compliant found herself torn between wanting to do what she was told and rolling on the poor lifeless body of the opossum, which in all the commotion she managed to do a couple of times. Carl emerged from the bedroom and told me to get a towel because it was moving its mouth and appeared to still be alive. I couldn't look, I'd already seen and felt enough of it. Carl said there were no visible injuries, and maybe it was \"playing possum\" (or pretending to be dead for those who don't know the phrase) We decided that we would put it in a small dog crate from our barn and find someone to care for it. I chose going to the barn to get the crate and chance the spotting of a mouse over staying with a possibly injured, wet and wild animal. Carl took it outside and laid it on the grass where it promptly \"woke up\" and casually walked into the tall grass and safety of the woods.......Well okay then.....Lets get this day started!**Postscript to post--We both checked all the dogs thoroughly including their mouths and thankfully NO injuries were found on any of them. I however, have a little bit of a sore throat ***"},
{"title": "Just another Day at the Office", "date": "Wednesday, July 7, 2010", "text": "This post comes to you from the front desk of the office where I work. My stint as the \"front desk girl officially ends today around 5 PM. I have to give a lot of credit to our Office Manager for putting up with all she does from patients. Today is a classic example of what I know she deals with quite often....We had a patient come in this morning that I didn't recognize. The conversation with her went like this:ME: Can I have your name please so I can check you in.Patient, \"NO!\" I don't want to tell you who I am.I was a little taken back by this, and said to her, \"Well, I can't check you in unless I know who you are.\" In which she loudly replied, \"I don't want you to know who I am!\" Okay, I have to admit, I was a tad bit irritated by the tone of her response, so I didn't say anything else to her. I knew that any patients that would be arriving would be early for their appointment, so I just let her sit in the waiting room while I did some filing. After about 10-15 minutes I walked over to the computer, checked the schedule and saw that we weren't expecting an older lady, but I noticed she had a boy with her, so I thought maybe it was for him--But the age didn't fit. So, I finally said to her, \"You have to tell me your name because I don't think either of you are on the schedule for today.\" She had another snotty reply saying to me that she had an appointment at 12 o'clock! I told her she had to give me her name so I could check what time her appointment was, which she finally did. I looked her up in the computer and found that she has an appointment--But it's NEXT week!! At which she replied with a meek and a bit humble, \"oh...\" Of course I was very nice, but inside I was really smirking and gloating as I handed her another appointment card with next week's date and time--Maybe that'll teach her to not be sarcastic to the front desk girl!!"},
{"title": "The Red-White and Blue of Golden Pines", "date": "Sunday, July 4, 2010", "text": "Today is July 4, 2010 - On this day in 1776, the Declaration of Independence was approved by the Continental Congress, setting the 13 colonies on the road to freedom as a sovereign nation. As always, this most American of holidays will be marked by parades, fireworks and backyard barbecues across the country.We've had a couple of invitations to view fireworks and come for dinner but have declined. I really just want to stay home. However, we are not without patriotism at Golden Pines. I have found that we have \"Red, White and Blue\" which symbolizes the American flag all around us to help us mark and celebrate the day...To start, the red of the wine-berries that are all over our property. (By the way, does anyone know anything I can do with these?)  And in the Redwing Blackbirds -- I know, they look a bit orange...We also have what are considered \"red\" Goldens like Sam The white is symbolized in the Queen Anne Lace that's growing in several placesAnd on my daisies. It is can also be found in the sweet white faces of our senior Goldens like Tanner... And our Cat \"CC\" as well--Yes, I know it's hard to believe that we have a cat amongst all the Goldens and Charlie!  Finding blue at Golden Pines was a little a little trickier, but it was found on my hydrangea that is blooming. It has been the \"crown jewel\" in my flower garden this year as I've watched and enjoyed each bloom. I am so glad it forgave me my mistakes that I made with it last year.  There is also the blue sky that we saw this morning at the start of our day. And finally the feeling of \"blue\" that comes from the pups like Sheba and myself when I have to leave them behind. Whatever you are doing, if it's a day you do or don't celebrate, I hope you have a wonderful, fun and safe July 4th!!!"},
{"title": "FINALLY It's Friday!!!", "date": "Friday, July 2, 2010", "text": "I cannot begin to say the relief I'm feeling at it being Friday! It has been a really long and busy week, especially at work. While I love my job, working at the front desk brings its own challenges that I don't know that I handle as well as our office manager. The issues this week ranged from a co-worker who didn't show up (long story, she called from Disney World), letting myself get schmoozed by a charming, handsome scrap metal salesman, brownies and sushi from the \"masseuses\" in our building, (a story for another day) yet another key problem when my office key got stuck in the door, and I couldn't get the office deposit to balance today, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Needless to say, it's all left me exhausted, behind on everything and not feeling really well.On the flip side, the news from Patch's new home is all good! He's settling in nicely and the family totally adores him!It is good news for the Chub Brothers too! They are doing wonderfully! They have settled in so nicely, and have not been a moment of trouble! When I think of a bonded pair of Golden Retrievers, they are exactly what I think of. The two are always together, licking one another's faces and sleeping side by side. Toby, on the left, has a sweet and a goofy personality.Toby is now going on our morning walks with us and he loves going as much as he loves rolling in the grass! Mobility remains an issue for Bubba. He can't get up the 2 steps on our back porch. The picture below shows what happens when he attempts them...But we have remedied that by putting a ramp up, which has really helped. Bubba is a bit more \"serious\" of the two, and each time I've helped him up the steps, he's tried to lick my face--It's like he's thanking me.  But how could you not love that?With July 4th, I have a 3 day weekend. I think I'll take my cue from the dogs this evening and just relax and maybe catch up on a few things. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend!"},
{"title": "If I Only Had a Brain!", "date": "Tuesday, June 29, 2010", "text": "It has been a crazy week already for me! I can't believe that it's \"just\" Tuesday! I have to work every day this week because our office manager is off for a week. It's not a problem to work at the front desk. But it means that I don't get my day off this week, and I have to get to work early to open the office and stay late to close it.Carl is working a late schedule this week so of course I was in a rush to get out of the office and get home. But this evening before I could head home I had to stop and get food for the dogs. I glanced at my watch and knew that if I didn't chat with the employees in the shop like I usually do, I could be home by 7:00. So, I rushed in, picked up what I needed, and didn't even wait for the offer to carry my bags of food to my van. I had a spot right up front so I was going to quickly be on my way...At least that was the plan...When I pushed the button on my key to unlock the door, nothing happened. I tried it again, and again, and again, and nothing happened. I'd noticed the last week or so that it hasn't been working that well, and so it didn't take long to conclude that the battery for the key must be dead, giving me no way to get into my van. I tried to get in touch with Carl, but was unable. I was really trying to keep my composure. But I have to admit that it was getting increasingly difficult because all the stress I've been feeling the last couple of days was finally starting to get to me. I know they could see me from inside the shop because \"Jon\" who is the manager came out and asked me if everything was okay. I was nearly in tears as I explained to him about my dead key battery and not being able to get into my van. He looked at my key and very kindly and carefully paused for a moment and then asked me if I'd tried putting the key into the door to unlock it....Oh...I guess I forgot that it works that way too...I'm sure they're having a good laugh at my expense at \"Whole Pet\" and you can laugh too if you'd like--It's really okay because I deserve it! Besides I really needed a laugh today as well, even one at myself is okay because it has made me feel better! Laughter really is the best medicine!!"},
{"title": "A Forever Home for Patch", "date": "Saturday, June 26, 2010", "text": "When I tell people that I foster Golden Retrievers for the rescue, it is not uncommon to hear the response that they couldn't foster because they would keep them all. While I know I've gotten good that, those of you who have fostered dogs know that there are some that come to you that are not a fit for your home. This was true of our foster dog Patch. (You may recall that he came to us in late April. He was given up by his owner because the neighbors complained about his being left outside alone for 14 hours a day).Patch has many good and endearing qualities, but he did not particularly get along with our dogs. He never started any fights with our crew but he was always growling at them if they got too close to him while he had a tennis ball or another toy that he considered his. He would also growl at them when they had something that he wanted--I really think he had all the tennis balls in the house named. He seemed to know exactly how many we had and where they were and if another dog picked one up. Thankfully the reaction from our dogs was the equivalent to rolling their eyes. They would drop whatever they had so he could have it. I guess they figured it was easier.I know I could have kept Patch and just put up with his growling at the other dogs, but that would not have been fair to him or our dogs.  What Patch needed was a home where he was the star and could have a family and toys all to himself. This is exactly what I found for Patch. The family we met with last week really fell in love with him and Patch and I fell in love with them too. They are perfect for him!So, this morning, it was another 2 hour road trip down the crowded Capital Beltway, through the toll booths to take Patch to \"the family.\" Patch was happy to see them. He played with their 6 year old son, ignored the birds, and followed the Mom around the house. He hardly knew I was there; what was I saying about their being perfect? When I left they walked me outside to my van and at first Patch wanted to go with me. But the son called to him and Patch looked at him and then looked at me, and then back to Jack...I quickly said my good-byes, and Patch and the Mom walked back into the house--Patch was wagging his tail and unlike me, he never looked back. It was a sad moment for me, but it's how it should be.I now enter what I call \"Foster Home Rehab\" for Patch. To help me recover and let go of Patch, I get to make allotted phone calls to the family to find out how it's going. And to help with my emotional needs, I again stopped at Krispy Kreme and had 2 very fresh-hot-doughnuts and a Diet Coke.When I got home the dogs were already celebrating Patch's being gone. Josh was carrying a tennis ball in his mouth, Charlie was laying in Patch's spot and Sheba (who had the hardest time with Patch) started singing my praises that I didn't have him with me--I guess I'm the only one that needs rehab."},
{"title": "The Looks of Charlie", "date": "Thursday, June 24, 2010", "text": "Like many places across the country, we've had record breaking heat! The Goldens seem to take it all in stride and being Goldens they have not complained at all--In fact, Sam as you can see is soaking it all up!Charlie on the other hand is not so \"heat-tolerant.\" Being a Wheaten Terrier his coat is a very thick and heavy continually growing one that doesn't shed. The last few weeks Charlie has been laying on top of the air-conditioning vents and any other place where \"cool\" can be found. Even short walks have left him hot and panting. This has all signaled what I already knew, that its been 4 months and it's time for a trip to the groomers for a summer haircut!I can never decide which of Charlie's looks I like the best. I really love when his coat is all grown out and fluffy and he has hair in his eyes. I do wonder how well he can see though. The other day I tossed him a treat and he couldn't see it coming towards him.However, when Charlie returns from the groomers like he did today, he is totally transformed into a whole other dog with a totally different appearance. It's so easy to see that he's happy to be rid of his heavy coat. I like this look because I can see his eyes, especially his very bright blue one. When we first got Charlie, I used to think it was a bit \"spooky\" looking because I was so used to the brown eyes of the Goldens. Below is another one of Charlie's looks that I'd forgotten about. I was looking through some papers for the dogs today and I came across the paperwork with this picture that I received from the shelter where Charlie came from nearly 4 years ago. He came to us via Old English Sheepdog Rescue, and we \"thought\" that he was a sheepdog mix. Very soon I'll tell you Charlie's story of rescue and his lost chance at stardom--But as you can see, 4 years has made a difference for him. And in return, he's made a difference for me too--I love my \"little man\" no matter how he looks!"},
{"title": "A Road Trip & Krispy Kreme Doughnuts", "date": "Sunday, June 20, 2010", "text": "On Saturday I took our other foster boy Patch to meet with a family interested in adopting him. They have birds and we wanted to make sure that he would leave them alone, and not consider them a snack. I am happy to report that despite a peck on the nose, Patch pretty much ignored the birds. But the family is meeting a second time with another family as well, so we'll see where it goes. The trip to their home took about two hours and meant a trip down the Capital Beltway, which I hate to drive on!! I don't know what's worse, the 10 lanes of traffic, or having to pay the tolls which total $5.30, and that's just one way--It's highway robbery!!!But at the end of the drive making it all worth while is something that I grew up on and has been a favorite of mine my entire life, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts!If you say the two words \"Krispy Kreme\" to the next person you see, they'll respond one of two ways. You might get a blank and puzzled stare, or they'll smile and start telling you a story about when they last had one of the south's divine foods: the fresh hot glazed Krispy Kreme doughnut.Founded in 1937 by Vernon Rudolph in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the company was just a regional delight with the glazed goodness not reaching beyond the Mason Dixon line. But times have changed. Krispy Kremes appeared in New York in 1995 and now you can pick up a dozen or two just about anywhere.However, buying them in a store is not the same. If you are lucky enough to be near a shop that makes them, the air around a Krispy Kreme parking lot, beckons you to come inside. And when you do, the fragrance of hot dough-meets-sugar envelopes you in warmth and then guides you over to the room-length windows to watch the wonderful Krispy Kreme doughnut-making machine at work. Doughy circles journey up a bicycle-chain like series of platform chambers where they gradually grow and puff to become full-sized doughnut rings. Then suddenly they dive into hot oil and their transformation from dough to Krispy Kremes speedily takes place.Like swimmers in a backyard pool, they ease down their lanes of hot oil then quickly flip over to brown their undersides. They trundle up a conveyor and finally parade through a grand sugar-glazing waterfall. For me, the taste is beyond compare to any other; a doughnut so airy and light that a mere finger-touch leaves a dent. And no matter how many times a person has eaten a Krispy Kreme doughnut they'll have that same joyful response when biting into a fresh hot one, something along the lines of \"WOW, AMAZING, INCREDIBLE!!\" However you say it, it all translates to the same wonderful, magical, scrumptious thing: \"I love Krispy Kreme!!\"I bought just two of them because like \"The Chub Brothers\" I am working on shedding a few pounds. I thought I could eat just one and bring the other one home for Carl. And just like when I agreed to take \"The Chub Brothers\" I just couldn't say no to just one; however this time he didn't notice."},
{"title": "The Chub Brothers!", "date": "Saturday, June 19, 2010", "text": "We have affectionately nicknamed them \"The Chub Brothers\" (thank-you KT & Lady for the suggestion) and they are doing really well! Bubba (left) and Toby (right) are real gentlemen and are settling in nicely and getting along with everyone here at the \"group home!\"I looked through their paperwork and found that they came from Indiana which makes them \"Hoosiers!\" (pronounced hoo'zher the name refers to an inhabitant or native of the state of Indiana). They are not related and became companions for one another when one of them, I don't know who, was about six months old; both are now close to 11 years old. The original owners lost their home and gave them to rescue about 2 years ago and they have been living at a Golden Retriever Sanctuary since then.Right now the only issue I can see that these boys have is their weight. Bubba is really having problems coming up the 2 steps from the backyard because he's so heavy, and he has problems getting to his feet. Both are now on joint supplements which I'm confident will make a difference.I guess the other problem is that Bubba also has an ear infection. This is where you can see the relationship between the two because Toby who appears to be the caretaker of Bubba continually cleans out his ears and washes his face, making the ear problem worse. But I have to admit that it makes me smile to see Toby taking care of Bubba...Bubba's face after Toby was done cleaning him made Carl and I both a laugh! The plan for these two boys is to get some of their weight off, which will improve their stamina. As you can see in the picture below of Toby, walks through our big fenced yards have them both huffing and puffing and foaming at the mouth; of course the heat and humidity is not helping. We are fostering them for the rescue which means that at the moment they're not going to be permanent additions to Golden Pines...Yeah, that's it, they're not staying...I've totally lost track of how many times I've said just that, because out of the last 12 dogs we have fostered, 10 have stayed...Who am I fooling? I'm totally smitten with them..."},

I'm happy to report that I'm among the living and not being committed to the loony-bin by my kind and extremely tolerant husband!!I decided the best way to handle Carl was to just be up front and tell him that I'd agreed to take Bubba (standing in the above picture) and Toby (laying down). However, there was a glitch when I couldn't reach him on the phone. Yeah, that's it, I couldn't reach him--And by the time I did reach him, it was too late and the boys and I were on our way home....Does that sound believable to you? It did to Carl. I do have to admit that that it did take a little bit of convincing that adding 2 more dogs wasn't going to be any more work than if we still had Cowboy and Maguire. Fortunately Carl bought that point, hook, line and sinker, and he just smiled at me, shook his head and said they could stay--Like it would have mattered if he said they couldn't and as if he would have said they had to go! ;-)Intros to our group were uneventful. Our crew is so good at meeting new dogs that they just give them a once over and it's back to whatever they were doing.I don't know what the story of rescue is for these two boys. I was given a lot of paperwork that I'll sort through which may tell how they ended up with the rescue in West Virginia. All I know is that they are both about 10 years old and have been together their whole lives; I don't know if they are related. But both boys are healthy, but very overweight and have problems getting around. You can't help but smile when you watch them together licking one anothers faces and following each other around. Both didn't eat their dinner, which is understandable with all the evenings events. As I write this, they are both sleeping on the same dog bed; no easy feat for these two big boys! I am sure they are no doubt worn out from the days events--I am too, do you have any idea how much energy it takes to be nice and use the cosmic powers of persuasion?Would you like to know what a person looks like that is \"too stupid to live?\"  Well, just look at the side bar for a picture of me, and you'll see one.  Once again, I've let myself get talked into something that I really shouldn't have...What have I gotten myself talked into you might be asking?  Committing a crime?  Doing something that my Mother wouldn't have approved of?  Buying a brand new sports car?  No, it's nothing that simple...I've let myself get talked into taking a new foster dog from the rescue.  I know, I know, I am supposed to be done fostering, and volunteering with the Golden Retriever Rescue in my area.  And, I know, I know, we already have one foster dog--But he will hopefully be going to a new home next week--So just how did I let myself get talked into not just one new foster dog, but TWO???!!!  Yes, that's 2 foster dogs--I have no idea how it happened.  But \"Bubba and Toby\" are a bonded pair of ten-year olds coming from a nearby rescue in West Virginia who can no longer care for them.  They're coming this evening.  I've not told Carl, who just happens to be working tonight--Do you think he'll notice 2 new dogs?  Do you think he's going to kill me when I tell him?? Stay tuned...Or if I never post again, you'll know what happened..."},

Carl has been bugging me for quite some time to do something about all the things I have packed up in boxes in our garage--So, when our friend Sid said she was going to have one, I thought the time had come to part with the treasures I haven't laid eyes on since we put our last house on the market nearly 3 years ago.I've only done one yard-sale in my life. It was prior to our leaving Alaska. I sold enough to pay for our plane tickets to Seattle and pay our expenses for coming to Virginia. I didn't have this kind of expectation going into this one because I know from others experiences that it's really hit or miss, and I didn't have that much to sell. But things that you think will sell right away don't, and things that you think you will have forever are gone right away. My friend Sid did pretty well. But me...Well, here's a rundown on how the day went and my profits:To start the day, from our barn, I opened a box of two never used camp-chairs and found where mice had made a home...I was once again reassured that our barn is indeed a \"mouse-free zone.\" Of course I threw everything away--Profit...zero-dollarsI did not a single nibble on an entire basket of vintage cookie cutters that I had priced at 50 cents each--I would have even taken a quarter for one. Profit...zero dollarsA buyer of a \"Precious Moments Collectable\" who also finagled a lower price on a couple of table cloths was caught by my friend and I trying to take a few things that she didn't pay for. Profit...$4.00 and skinned up shins and black-eye from when I tackled and wrestled the 80 pound elderly lady to the ground--Just kidding, I didn't tackle her! ;-)Miscellaneous knick-knacks, cat related items, and an unused wedding present bought by non-descript buyers...Profit $15.00Questions from several people if we were selling jewelry...Response: No--But wait a minute, where's that bracelet and the kleptomaniac senior citizen from earlier in the day? Profit...zero-dollarsInquiry by various people who asked how much I was selling Hamlet for. Response: He's priceless...Profit...beyond measure."},

It has been a busy week for me. Along with working, Carl has been assigned to a \"detail\" at another government agency, which has him gone from home long hours. It has left me to take care of the crew alone; I don't know how single parents do it.On the flip side my poison ivy is almost a bad memory now. It's all gone from my face, however it did end up spreading onto my hands. For those of you who've never had it, imagine having the feel of thick itchy sand in between your fingers--It's really miserable, I'll be so glad when it's all gone!! With your help I \"think\" I have it identified and am \"leaving the leaves of three, be\" because I do not want to go through this again anytime soon!!In between my scratching, I did notice a few things that are happening around me. The first is Tanner. I would say that he's about 95% recovered from his bout with vestibular syndrome. I took these pictures on Tuesday evening and you can see that the tilt in his head is gone. The stagger to his walk is almost gone as well. Of course I'm thrilled and so relieved!! Tanner is now about 14 years old and looking at his pictures, I am reminded that he's been through so much in the 2 years that he's been with us. We've dealt with his having seizures, separation and storm anxiety, laryngeal paralysis, allergies and glaucoma. ALL of which I'm happy to say are things of the past for him. I really hope that the time that he has left with us can be quiet happy and healthy times for him.Something else that snuck up on me is the ripening of the wild blackberries. For some reason, it seems early this year. But I guess since the strawberries have all but completed their task for the summer, it's their turn. We are lucky enough to have them growing in several places on our property, and unlike the poison ivy that we have all around, I couldn't be happier about it!There is nothing like the sweetness of blackberries fresh from the patch! I remember as a kid when we would pick them for my Mom. The thought of her blackberry cobbler was incentive enough to brave seeing a snake and being scratched by the bushes. While I of course worry about seeing a snake, I am however in competition to pick the berries before our 2 berry EATERS Sheba and Rudi get to them. I'm not sure how they acquired their love for them or even realized they were there. It may very well have come from seeing me snack on them during a walk. Our boy Maguire who recently passed seemed to have been acquainted with them on his own because he knew exactly what they were and would so delicately eat them. Rudi and Sheba being girls are not nearly that graceful. They are bulldozing scavengers and their sharp sense of smell has enabled them to quickly find and polish off the ripened ones.I did manage to get enough for a cobbler which I'll bake later and will celebrate my birthday at home before I'm off to Lancaster Pennsylvania for a visit with our friend Sid. As I write this, the sun has come out, my day lilies are in bloom, the birds are at the feeder, the pups are around my feet snoozing after their breakfast and a walk, it's a good start to a birthday. I hope you have a good day too!!"},

Maybe it's the thought of my birthday coming up and turning a whopping 49, that has made me reminiscent about my life and summertime. Last night I went out to the edge of the yard to look at the stars and try to video the lightning bugs (fire-flies) for those of you who've never seen them. For some reason it didn't work, but I'm not giving up. But as I stood there with 3 of our not-so-fearless dogs I also remembered that I'm afraid of being outside in the dark, so before it all turned into something from \"The Blair Witch Project\" I quickly got back inside.Maybe one reason why I'm feeling this way is because this week I've also had the return of a summertime foe that has not been a part of my life for many years, and that's poison-ivy!! This week its very (!!)itchy-arrival has reminded me of all those summers when as a kid I was plagued with it. I don't know how I got it. The only thing that I can figure is that I must've come in contact with it while weeding my flowerbeds on Monday. That'll teach me to do yard work! But I have a \"poison ivy rash\" all over my face and near my eyes, which have been swollen from it for the last 2 days. I also have it on a few places on my hands. Thankfully medication is helping to ease the symptoms.It's always good to \"know your enemy\" and I do think that I could have avoided all of this if I only knew what this \"plant\" called poison-ivy actually looked like. Everyone always says \"it has 3 leaves.\" Okay, that's good to know, but do you have any idea how many things have 3 leaves or come in threes around here?   Do you see my point?? I know we need to get rid of it. Anything that has the word \"poison\" in it can't be good anyway.  But since I have no idea what the enemy looks like, for now I won't be evicting something that wants to grow in my yard--I'll just sit on my porch or stay inside and scratch."},
{"title": "Inspiration and Nature on Mountain Road", "date": "Monday, May 31, 2010", "text": "Borrowing a quote from the blog Inspiration for Your Day I thought the quote posted today by Benjamin Eisenstat, \"Inspiration comes from nature itself. I am enamored of nature, and that admiration has only increased as I age\" really said what I was feeling today. As I drove down Mountain Road today, I couldn't help but feel the inspiration that comes from so many different things that there are to see, if you just slow down for a moment and notice. For instance, I just love this hay field! Each time they bail hay on it, I'm in awe of this beautiful rolling green field that meets the \"Short Hill Mountains.\" I think belongs in a painting. There are 2 wineries on our road too. I love to drive by and see them harvesting the grapes in the fall. Driving down our road it's easy to notice the mix of all kinds of animals from chickens all the way to these bison. Each have a place and a purpose.But of course there's no place like home and I don't have to go far to find something to enjoy.  Just from the front porch we have...A good view the place I call home...Of the birds this morning taking dog hair that I'd put on the feeder pole. Can you see the Titmouse on the left in the picture? A groundhog looking for his breakfast...There was a time when I may not have admired the simple beauty of even a snail that we saw this morning...  I didn't expect to see the bloom of a day-lily today or... A bloom from a daisy either--That's one thing I love about nature, sometimes there are those unexpected surprises... It was okay that Hamlet didn't notice...Maybe he did later--But you can see that he's healed nicely from his surgery.I really do try to appreciate everything around us. I've noticed this tree every year--I'd love to see its value in nature as well, but I've no idea what kind of tree it is--Is it a Huckleberry tree? Are the berries edible? Finally there is one sad thing in nature that we can't always understand and that's the loss of a pet. Several of you have lost your precious dogs lately. Today, someone that I'm particularly feeling badly for is John at Going Gently who unexpectedly lost his girl Maddie today. Losses are never easy, even when they are expected, but when our four-legged-family members are taken from our arms so suddenly, it makes the loss that much harder to take. With his birthday being Tuesday, I hope you'll take a moment from your busy day to think of him. ~God speed Maddie~Thank-you for stopping by & I hope you have a good week!"},

It was formerly known as \"Decoration Day\" and it commemorates U.S. men and women who died while in the military service. It also means a 3 day weekend for me!! I'm looking forward to being off and catching up.The weather is feeling like summer. Along with the arrival of lightning bugs we've had hot and humid weather here in Virginia which has brought with it evening thunder storms, which has made everything so green and lush. The honeysuckle is blooming everywhere too. I love its sweet smell which is filling the air all around us. While there doesn't seem to be a shortage of bugs, I'm not seeing very many honey-bees, and have yet to see a bat this year--I worry and wonder what's become of them...We did take the dogs for a walk last evening. They love exploring and being able to wander around, especially after a long day of our being gone. Our \"little CarrieAnne\" who is a golden mix, disappeared at the end of our walk. I knew where she'd gone; she had decided she wanted to cool off. Her wandering off isn't a problem because she never goes far and returns when called. But for the last 2 years she has gone to a place that only she knows about and takes a swim. I've no idea where her private swimming hole is, and by looking at this picture, she's not going to tell!Finally I'll let you know that Tanner continues to improve. He's now feeling confident enough to go down the 2 steps outside on his own. He head is still tilting to the left, but I'm hopeful that given time this will go away. His stubborness has returned though, because when I reach down to grab his collar to lead him back inside, he tries to run off--A good sign that he's feeling better!! I hope you have an enjoyable weekend!!"},

Tonight I stood on my porch and excitedly watched for the first time this year as a few of them lit up the darkness around me!! Seeing them always reminds me of my childhood, when I would catch lightning bugs and put them in a Mason jar with holes in the lid.  I have to wonder if today’s generation of kids do this and do they feel the same about lightning bugs that myself and others my age did? And was capturing things and putting them in a Mason jar a \"Southern thing?\" Because I remember when my Mom would give me two or three Mason jars, and I would punch holes in the tops with a dinner-knife or whatever else I could find and put things like lightning bugs and grasshoppers and yes, even snails in them. Forty years ago, (YIKES!!) we \"kids\" called this kind of thing fun! My Dad was in the army and I grew up on an army post. For me summer was a time when we looked forward to being outside playing and going barefoot. We went swimming, to the movies on Saturday afternoons and rode our bikes all day without any worries. But when evening came and you could see the lightning bugs, we didn't need a watch to tell us that it was getting late and we'd better be getting home!"},
{"title": "Good News for Tanner", "date": "Tuesday, May 25, 2010", "text": "Monday was a bit more of a difficult day than I thought it would be. But the last couple of days have been made easier by the kindness from so many who took a moment out of their busy day to think of us and send best wishes for Tanner. I took Tanner to see \"his vet\" on Monday morning. I really wanted to make sure that the medications that the veterinarian at the animal emergency put him on were the ones she would use to treat vestibular syndrome. Of the 3 medications I was given, we are taking Tanner off 2 of them (weaning him off one) and he'll continue to take one to help with any nausea and dizziness. At the end of his fourth day, I would say that Tanner is probably 70% back to normal. He's now walking in straight lines, and not so much in a circle. His head is still tilting to the left but I'm encouraged and am so hopeful that he'll fully recover. I've told all the dogs that we're done with trips to the vet and sick dogs--Of course they all listened and did exactly what they were told because they ate 2 suet cakes left on the counter for the birds and someone peed on the floor--Good dogs!!"},
{"title": "The Day After", "date": "Sunday, May 23, 2010", "text": "Many thanks to all of you for your kind and caring thoughts on the loss of Maguire, and for your concern for Tanner!On Saturday night I left a candle burning in the fireplace for Maguire. I have to admit that with the downpour of rain we were having, it was comforting to see its glow when I woke up during the night. This morning the mood in the house matched the gloomy weather. Our morning walk in the rain without Tanner was quiet and subdued. For a change there were few birds that could be heard singing. Added to that was my feeling of guilt over a lack of preparedness for a Sunday School lesson I was to teach to a class of ten-13 year olds. Of course I went and have to admit that I felt good about the participation and how the lesson went.As our day progressed, the mood in the house became lighter and even playful at times. I had a nap with the dogs, a late afternoon walk and we played a game of Frisbee in the rain. Tanner's condition is improved. He's able to focus and stand little better than yesterday and doesn't need as much help drinking and eating.As I do with all our dogs that have passed, I hope for a sign letting me know that they are \"okay.\" I wonder if its come because there's an undeniable feeling of peace and comfort all around us, just like the quiet glow of a candle."},
{"title": "A Candle For Maguire--But No Time to Grieve", "date": "Saturday, May 22, 2010", "text": "When we started fostering the senior Goldens for the rescue almost 7 years ago, I knew that our time with them would be limited. But I felt strongly that these dogs that had been dealt a bad hand at the end of their lives, and who had so much wisdom, dignity and courage, should have a place to live out whatever time they had left, and leave this life with someone who truly cared about them. These Goldens have broken my heart when they left us. But I have never looked back and regretted for a moment taking in any of them, in fact, if given the chance, I would do it all over again. I feel that we have been given an extraordinary gift to love and be loved unconditionally in return. Maguire was no exception. I have no regrets in opening my heart and our home to him just a year and-a-half ago. While I've no idea what his life was like before he came to us, how old he was, or what his name had been, I know that the last part of his life, was one where he was cared for and loved. Letting him go today was a difficult choice. It was a lonely journey at times trying to decide what was best. But today, as I looked into Maguire's eyes and saw that love and the trust, my doubts left me, and I knew we had made the right choice and the best choice. I know that Maguire is now in a place where he can enjoy those things that he was no longer able to in this life. I have a candle lit to help him find his way, and I so hope he was met by our Goldens, Tod, Ben, Cougar, Tosh, Tucker, Scout, Kasey, Logan, Cubby and Cowboy and he has given them our message.We left the vets office and decided to have a light lunch. As we sat there with Maguire's collar on the table, our waiter politely asked us about it. When we told him, he joined us in a toast to Maguire and our memories. Carl and I then had our lunch and recounted stories of him and the others that have gone before him.We were feeling a bit uplifted although worn out and tired, and I was so looking forward to getting home and spending time with our other dogs. But it was not meant to be. When we got home, we found that one of the dogs had gotten sick several times while we were gone. We quickly realized it was Tanner, (our 13 year old Golden who was treated for glaucoma) and he was having difficulties standing and his eyes were moving side-to-side . Having had this happen with another senior Golden, I knew it was Geriatric Vestibular Syndrome. Off to the Animal Emergency Room. But not before I was stopped for speeding by one of Loudoun County's finest police officers...I quickly explained what my day had been and I opened the door to my van and showed him Tanner; I was off with a warning. I will spare you the details of my visit to the animal ER, and just say that Tanner is resting and has been given medications. It's hard to trust a vet that you've never met, but I am hoping and praying that we are on the right track and Tanner will be okay. How much more can my old and broken heart take?Godspeed Maguire, my big handsome boy..."},
{"title": "Maguire & Making Up My Mind...", "date": "Thursday, May 20, 2010", "text": "I don't know exactly where to start with my update on Maguire. I think the best place is with a thank-you to everyone because I have really felt peace from what I know are prayers being said in our behalf.Last Saturday I really felt like it was okay to let Maguire go. When we took him out of the wheelchair and I saw his swollen leg, and he had a loss of appetite, I felt like that was the sign I was looking for and there seemed to be a feeling of peace about it all. I had previously made a \"tentative\" appointment with the vet to bring him in on Monday. But on Sunday afternoon, Maguire's demeanor changed and a spark returned. The swelling in his leg had gone down, he had an appetite, he also started wagging his tail, and even catching treats that were thrown in his direction. He was doing everything but standing up, which he was and is trying to do. I canceled Monday's appointment to give it a few more days. Because my vet doesn't work everyday at this particular office, I made another tentative appointment for Wednesday evening that I canceled for the same reasons and have made another one for this Saturday morning...Maguire is still unable to stand on his own--Believe me, we have tried many, many times to get him to walk on his own. We are carrying him outside for everything, and he's spending the rest of the time on an orthopedic dog bed. I'm waking about every 2 hours during the night to change his position because he starts to whine. I know very well that this isn't a good quality of life; it's actually not much of a life at all. I am by no means an expert on when to put a dog down. However, with all but one of the Goldens we have lost, I have seen the look in their eyes or felt a tired spirit that told me without a doubt that their time on this earth was over and it was time to let go. I don't see that in Maguire's eyes or feel that he's tired. All I see is the brightness and spark that's always been there.However, the last few days I keep remembering one of our first senior Goldens that we had named Cougar. We had him just about a year when we had to put him down. He'd been diagnosed with bone cancer a few months after he came to us--It was too late to do anything about it by the time it was discovered. But I remember when the cancer was at its height and he was in so much pain, Cougar still ate all of his meals, wagged his tail, and he held a tennis ball in his mouth, and above all, he had a spark in his eyes. We had the choice then to let him stay, or let him go. I decided to make the choice and let Cougar go, even though I thought he wasn't ready. But looking back at it, I think that spark and light in Cougar's eyes was his way of showing me that he trusted me, and he was giving me the reassurance that it was \"okay.\" In my heart I feel that Maguire may be telling me the same thing. I just hope I can let go of the new doubts I have and find the needed strength and courage to do what's best...HAPPY THURSDAY EVERYONE!! Very shortly I will post an update on Maguire. But I thought I would lighten things up by posting an award that I've received from Amy at At Home With Amy, and Randy at Chicken Boys I enjoy both of these blogs and for those of you who aren't acquainted with them, I hope you'll stop by their blogs for a visit.For the award I'm supposed to post 10 things about me, and 5 things I don't like and pass it onto 10 bloggers...So here goes...Ten things about me... 1. I am six feet tall (that was an easy one!!)2. From the time I was a young girl, I have always loved to make people laugh.3. I lived in Anchorage Alaska for 10 years when my husband was in the army and we stayed after he got out.4. I don't like to go barefoot, not even inside. I almost always have socks on. The only time I ever take them off is when it's really, really hot! 5. I can’t swim and am afraid of deep water. However, I taught swimming through the Red Cross for 2 summers in college.6. Within my family I'm known as \"The Informant\" because I have a hard time keeping a secret, and because I used to tell on my siblings when we were growing up. 7. Dogs were not the animal I loved first. Cats were my favorites growing up.8. I am terrible at being organized, but I like things to be that way.9. I have never broken a bone. (Knock on wood!)10. I have a really difficult time remembering names and people--I'm hoping it's an age thing (I'm 48)And now, five things I don't like...1. People coming by without calling first.2. Having my picture taken (But I've included one at the bottom of this post so you can put a face to all of this).3. Not being able to find things. Isn't that frustrating??4. Being late--even though I'm so good at it!5. I don't like most seafood...I'm supposed to give this award to 10 bloggers. But because some of us are traveling in the same blogging circle, you have either been, or already are recipients of this award. However, I think there are a couple that are not, so I've chosen 3 blogs that you may not know about and I'd like to pass this award onto...I hope you'll take a moment to stop by their blogs too.Sharon: Life with Jack n Jill Lori: Woodbury WorldMimi: Dandelion WishesOh, finally here's the picture of lil' ole me that I took today..."},
{"title": "Feel Good Moments from Saturday", "date": "Sunday, May 16, 2010", "text": "More than anything, I wish the news for Maguire was better. There's not been any improvement. I think we've even lost a little bit of ground. I can tell that the dogs are also feeling our stress too. Yesterday there was an unusual fight between CarrieAnne and Sheba over who knows what. We never have dog-fights; the two of them are pals and have great fun and adventures together. They are also the most \"high spirited and high strung\" in the group, next to Charlie of course. I just think they were feeling the tension. On Saturday I tried to look for and found some \"feel good moments for the day.\" I did find some, and here are a few of them...To start, I went to a shop and found this little character for my garden. Something about him appealed to me. I think because it made me think of a saying that I love, \"It is said it will happen when pigs fly.\" I drove past our old house and took this picture. Ours was the one on the end. It made me feel good that we're no longer living here with all the dogs in a townhouse that we had out grown.  I then drove up the street to what we used to call \"the forbidden field\" because of the sign on the gate. It's a fenced in ball field where we used to love to bring the dogs because they could safely run off lead. We had ten years of fun and good times there! When I got home we found this little fellow in the yard.Later we found this little tike literally on our door. I had to grin because it had dog-hair stuck to it. But then everything around here has dog hair on it. He wasn't really that big...Of course my best \"feel good moment\" is being able to have Maguire with us. Yesterday I used my last bit of hope and we decided to tackle putting him in the wheelchair again. It didn't work. For some reason, he just doesn't want to stand up in it, or hardly at all for that matter. When we were taking him out of it, I noticed that one of his back legs is swollen. I've no idea what that means, but I think it's another indication that he's not going recover. Someone commented and my vet as well \"mentioned quality of life.\" Maguire is a dog that always loves to go for walks and roll in the grass. He's a dog that doesn't give up new stuffed toys to any of the other dogs. He's a dog that at mealtime gets his most excited. He's no longer doing any of that or enjoying any of those simple things. We know the time is very close to let him go to a place where he can enjoy those things again and wait for us. These decisions as you all well know, do not come quickly and are not made easily. But there seems to be a new found peace and calm around us and in my heart. I think it's what I've been looking and waiting for.If you have a moment, and would like to read Maguire's story of rescue, here is the link:http://lifeatgoldenpines.blogspot.com/2010/01/dog-dilemma.html"},
{"title": "Discouragement and Hope", "date": "Thursday, May 13, 2010", "text": "Its been quite a week. While I've tried to maintain the \"positive energy\" around our house, the discouragement and emotions I feel about Maguire are very near the surface and sometimes can't help but come out.There are times when Maguire seems to be happy. I'll look at him and see that spark in his eyes and a smile and feel that he's okay. But then there are other times that I'm looking for something from him, a sign that all is well and from him, I get nothing.Despite this I try very hard to have hope and look for the positive...Maguire is not able to stand or walk on his own...Maybe it will just takes some more time for the medications to work.Despite being such a chow-hound he's not got much of an appetite...Maybe it's just the medications taking away Maguire's love for a meal.Walking him with the rear-end-sling is really difficult and he almost always collapse onto the ground. I even borrowed a wheelchair for him thinking that would help, and he again tumbled into a heap...Maybe walking with the sling is too much weight shifted to his front-legs and maybe he needs time to get used to the wheelchair.So what does all this mean? Am I grasping at straws and not seeing what some of you may see so clearly? Right now there's so much uncertainty and the seeds of doubt easily arise about where our journey together is going and I wonder if we are on the right path. There's a huge part of me that's so desperately hanging onto Maguire and doesn't want to let him go, and I wonder if it's time and I should.But then I remember that when it's time to decide anything the storms of doubt in my heart will be replaced with peace and the answers as to the direction to take will be clear. But for tonight there's no need to think about any of that. Maguire is sleeping near by and we're together; there is calm.A Peony and an Iris bloomed for the first time today...Where flowers bloom so does hope."},

{"title": "A Manic Monday!", "date": "Monday, May 10, 2010", "text": "I don't know where to start with the events of my day. I took the day off work and got Maguire to the vet (where this photo was taken). After an extensive exam I was given several scenarios of what could be causing his almost complete loss of the use of his back legs. It included several options to pin point exactly what it is could be which range all the way to seeing a neurologist for a possible MRI. There's the thought that it could be a slipped disc in his back, degenerative myelopathy, or even recurrence of lyme disease that he was treated for when he came into the rescue last year. It was a lot to think about, but for now I've opted for a conservative approach with medications and hope (and pray) that this direction will be effective enough to get him back on his feet.When I got home I managed to get Maguire inside and let the other dogs out. I was a bit preoccupied and didn't watch which dogs I allowed to be outside the fence off lead--The next thing I saw was Sam rounding the corner and out of sight. I ran after him (interestingly enough Hamlet was behind me) but Sam was too fast and was quickly gaining distance from me. My calling to him with words like \"wait, stay, come here, lets get a cookie\" all fell on the deaf ears of a renegade that only looked over his shoulder and kept going towards the road. I quickly got the other dogs inside and got my keys to chase him down in my van. I have to mention that during this time Rudi was with Sam. I backed out of the garage almost hitting Wendy (YIKES!) and once down on the road I could see Rudi down the road on the shoulder. When I drove towards her I noticed that she would disappear for a moment and reappear again. I quickly realized what she was doing was telling me where Sam was. Out of breath and nearly hoarse I managed to get his attention by shaking the treat jar that I'd grabbed, he came over to get one and I grabbed him!! YAY!!! I loaded both dogs into my van and returned home, praising Rudi and letting her help herself to as many treats as she wanted!I would have liked this whole episode to end at that but....When I got back home with Rudi & Sam, I left my van parked outside and got the two inside. I was having problems breathing (I have asthma) and it took several minutes for me to stop coughing and catch my breath. About a half-hour later I heard barking outside and realized it was Carrie Anne, she was inside the van with the windows up!!! In my rush I remembered seeing her in the van sitting on the backseat and have to admit that in trying to hold onto Sam, I totally forgot about her and shut her inside. I'm so thankful that it was not a terribly hot day; I would have had an awful disaster!!I counted the dogs several times, said many prayers of thanks, officially bestowed the honor of \"Hero!!\" on Rudi gave out more treats and we all took a nap.I don't know what the days ahead will bring for Maguire. But for now I'm thankful that he's sleeping peacefully and all is quiet at Golden Pines. Thank-you all for your concern and well wishes Maguire; he and I are both very grateful for them!  Fragile Circle\"We who choose to surround ourselves with lives even more temporary than our own, live within a fragile circle, easily and often breached. Unable to accept its awful gaps, we still would live no other way.

He's not able to stand up. When I get him to his feet, his back toes are curling under, not allowing him to stand. With Carl working until late tonight I've managed to get him outside, but it's not been easy because he's a big, stocky Golden weighing over 80 pounds. I can tell that Maguire is in pain. But I'm hoping that the return of cold weather has just caused a flare up of arthritis in his hips and with some medications by morning maybe he'll feel better, and I will too. Our sweet senior Golden Cowboy just left us in March and I'm not ready to have my heart torn and broken again."},
{"title": "If I Didn't Have Dogs...", "date": "Thursday, May 6, 2010", "text": "I've been thinking that...If I didn't have dogs, my furniture wouldn't need to be covered to protect it. I could sleep in until I wanted to get up, there would be no wet noses in my face telling me when it's time. If I didn't have dogs, the windows in my car and house would be clean...Well, maybe not... If I didn't have dogs, I wouldn't be buying so many \"odor eliminator\" candles. I could eat dinner sitting on the floor and not have eyes watching me take each bite. There would be no one by my side, always following me around. But living in the country with no nearby neighbors, if I didn't have dogs I might need to invest in a \"different kind\" of an alarm system. But I would be able to walk in a straight line through my house.But then again, with Carl now working nights sometimes, if I didn't have dogs what would protect me from those things that go bump in the night? And if I didn't have dogs, I wouldn't have anyone to tell and share my secrets with.  I wouldn't get to enjoy the outdoors as much.Enjoying all the simple things in life, like a game of frisbee might not be so apparent to me anymore.The truth is, I wouldn't trade life as a pet owner for anything. I wouldn't want to experience a life without our crew. While they have broken my heart when they left, they have provided so much joy and everlasting friendship. My dogs have reminded me to live in the now and not so much in the past or the future. I think that our lives would be empty without them and I'm thankful that \"they\" are a part of my life!"},

{"title": "Just Can't Say \"NO!\"", "date": "Tuesday, April 27, 2010", "text": "The word \"no\" might be a small word, but for me, it's not always been an easy one to say. For example, I have been asked on more than one occasion if I could help organize a dinner for our church--Of course I said \"yes.\" Then there are the times when I'm asked if I can work an extra day at work, even though I have made plans for my day off and I'm exhausted, I almost always say \"yes\" to that as well.I have found that saying \"yes\" might be the automatic, simplest response for me, even when I truly want to say no. But there is a price, at least for me, for not being able to say \"no,\" because there are times that I know that it will inevitably lead to some stress and my blood pressure being raised a few points.On the flip side of that, I have some \"guilty pleasures\" that I (typically) never say \"no\" to...Like lunch with my friends--My hands-down favorite has been and is still a cheeseburger and fries, I really have problems saying \"NO!\" to one... A visit to a greenhouse! I love to just walk around and look at all the plants!A good yard sale! I can never say \"no!\" to a good deal!This is our CarrieAnne on Saturday--She couldn't say \"no\" to rolling in something that smelled so good--I did say \"no!\" to her coming in the house until she had a bath!!Finally, there's something else I just can't and have never been able to say no to...A senior Golden that needs a place to go--Meet our new foster dog \"Patch\" who came to us late last week. He's an active and bouncy, ball obsessed 12 year old boy whose owner left him outside for 14 hours a day and the neighbors complaints were finally heard...  Yes, I know, I know, I said I was done taking dogs in from the rescue. But I think the rescue knows that I'll never say \"NO!\" to a dog in need... \"No\" he won't be staying permanently, I'll be putting him up for adoption...Wait, haven't I said \"no\" to that before too?

These issues vary from year to year—air pollution, water pollution, habitat destruction, sustainable energy, climate change, species losses, and environmental policies. The list really is a broad one with complex solutions...On the flip-side, for most of us, if Earth Day is acknowledged, it's done so on a smaller scale, by acting on behalf of a single issue such as working to save an endangered species in your region or helping to discourage the use of pesticides in your neighborhood.  For me, I acknowledged the day by \"celebrating nature\" and all that was around me today...Here are a few pictures... Our day started with a foggy sunrise...And an interesting and complex looking spider web... Then I admired how fast my flowers are growing in such a short time. Of course the dandelions are coming up too, and I think this little butterfly is just fine with it!! Since it's Earth Day it was pretty appropriate that we had a bird come to the feeder that I've never seen before, and I was able to get a picture of. I found out from a friend that it is a \"Rufous-Sided-Towhee.\" well, okay... Of course the dogs also enjoyed \"Earth Day.\"By digging a hole...again...  And eating grass...And rolling in the grass... And running through the grass...And refusing to walk on the grass...Gotta love cats...Happy Earth Day! What does it mean to you? Today marks exactly two weeks since Hamlet had his surgery. We are leaving in a few minutes to go to the vet to have the staples removed. As you can see, he's healed quite nicely!! I cannot express how very thankful and grateful I am that he's done so well! I have been telling everyone about a difference in him from before we did the surgery. When we are out he gets a little spunky and breaks into a slow gallop that actually has a little bit of speed behind it--In the short 5 months he's been with us, he's never done that, so as you can imagine, we are excited and thrilled to see this change! Carl and I hope that this is a sign of good days to come with Hamlet!! Thank-you all for your kindness and concern and sending well wishes for Hamlet--They truly did and have made a difference!!"},
{"title": "Whose Afraid of a Little Mouse?", "date": "Saturday, April 17, 2010", "text": "Last fall when Carl and I were putting away the last of lawn equipment we had a bit of a disagreement over what to do about two mice (that we knew of) that had taken up residence inside our barn. Knowing that the barn would be closed up for the winter, I told Carl that I didn't want the mice to be left in there all winter with friends they'd either create or invite during the cold months. Carl on the other hand, felt that it was \"only two\" and they should be allowed to stay, so I conceded.   Last week we opened up the barn and lo and behold, there were a few signs of the mice, but none were visible.  I was very much assured by Carl today that the barn was a mouse free zone!! Feeling that confidence, and having sent a couple of the dogs in ahead of me, I ventured into the barn to get out the rain-barrel that as you can see by the picture below was being stored right by the door.When I moved the hoses that were stored inside the barrel, guess what? Yes, there was a mouse inside!! Okay, I'll admit that I'm not brave and I'm scared of mice and screamed like a little girl which caused our dog Carrie to run back to the house!! I had Carl remove everything, and this is what our little barn resident looked like. Hmmm, he really was much bigger and much more menacing the first time I saw him...  Carl took him over to the edge of the woods to release this little country mouse back into the wild--I sent Rudi with him to make sure it was sent on its way... Carl said the mouse acted like it didn't want to leave the rain-barrel. I came over and took a peek and as I snapped the pictures he looked so scared and unsure. And, for just a moment I wasn't afraid of it and I thought that maybe I should just let him live in our barn and continue to be safe. But the feeling passed and he was evicted from his home--One down, how many more mice and \"I told you so's\" to go??"},

{"title": "Concern + Worry = Hamlet", "date": "Tuesday, April 13, 2010", "text": "I have to admit that the rainy cold weather that we've had today in Virginia matched my mood. What caused the dark cloud? Hamlet...He had such a good weekend where he was up and about a little bit and I was feeling really (!!) optimistic that he was on the mend. So much so that I decreased his pain medication on Sunday evening and Monday morning. However when I came home Monday night from work, Hamlet was still laying in the same place as he was when I'd left in the morning. My dog walker said he wouldn't get up for her to go out. Of course he didn't try to get to his feet for me either, so I ended up carrying him outside--I'll just add that I didn't realize that I could carry 70-ish pounds of dog outside and bring him back inside, but I guess you do what you have too. I did feel better that he was at least eating and drinking normally.However, my anxiety was kicked up a couple of levels when this morning he hadn't moved much during the night and he once again wouldn't stand on his own to go outside. When I fed Hamlet his breakfast, I decided to increase the amount of pain medication to the recommended dose and I added another one, (ok'd by my vet on Saturday if I thought it was needed). I said several prayers and went off to work. From my office I called my vet, and the surgeon. Both felt that he must have some kind of fever which sent me to the next level of worry. I have no doubt that I drove my co-workers crazy today with my concerns--Fortunately a few of them are animal lovers and understand. When I got off work, I couldn't get home fast enough! Why is there always the worst kind of traffic when you're in a hurry? At any rate, when I walked in the door this evening, I was met by our crowd which included Hamlet!! Doesn't he look pretty good? He even took the 2 steps outside into the yard. Needless to say, I'm thrilled!! I said a few prayers of thanks for any divine intervention and there is a break in the clouds this evening!"},
{"title": "Just a Sunday Snippet", "date": "Sunday, April 11, 2010", "text": "Thank-you again for all the good wishes for Hamlet. Of course I am a bit worried about him. However I think it's a good sign that he has a pretty good appetite and he is up and around a bit. Yesterday we had the other dogs outside with us while we worked in the yard. I thought that if I left Hamlet him inside alone he would rest--No, that didn't happen. When I came back inside he was standing by the door which was what he did in the morning when we went out for a walk.I'm hoping with the return to work this week and our regular schedule, Hamlet will get more rest and start to feel more like himself--All paws crossed.While I thought Hamlet was resting inside, I took pictures of spring bursting outside...Our pear tree is covered in blooms. I wonder if we'll have a lot of pears this year? Blooming in several places around our yard are what I call \"wild violets.\" Spring has also brought the return of life everwhere!!! From the small things that are almost missed. To the things you have to look quickly at or you won't get a glimpse of...And spring has brought life that is often heard but not seen.... Life is truly all around...I love spring..."},

The surgeon, Dr. Walker (pictured here) called me last night and said that he had just gotten done with the surgery and that it went pretty well. He said Hamlet was very, very sleepy and stable. I woke up several times during the night thinking about him. I couldn't wait, so I called early this morning (before 5 AM) and talked to the Tech that said Hamlet had just eaten a little and had been taken out, but was of course slow and still a bit groggy.  She told me that if all goes well today, he may be able to come home later this afternoon, but definitely by Saturday morning. All good signs--With the hurdle of the surgery now behind him, I'm hoping that the rest will be downhill!"},
{"title": "Needed: Healing Energy & Positive Thoughts", "date": "Thursday, April 8, 2010", "text": "This week was supposed to be a week where I could relax and do things around the house. I had grandioso plans. I have a few walls that need to be painted, and I have my flower gardens to clean out. Of course Kenzie was a thought as well. All your comments really helped. I decided that I would go ahead and see if we could \"try her\" here at our house. I was going to call Shirley and arrange to get her, but that little nagging voice kept telling me to wait...I stopped listening to that voice and decided to make the phone call, and I'm not kidding, just as I was going to make the call, the phone rang and it was my vet...Hamlet as you may recall is a senior boy that came to us as a foster dog via the rescue last fall and we later adopted. He was left in a garage of a home that had been foreclosed on. You can read his story here: http://lifeatgoldenpines.blogspot.com/2009/11/new-addition.htmlHamlet had a rather large lipoma on his shoulder when he came to us--You can kind of see it on the above picture. For those who may not know, a lipoma is a benign fatty growth. We had it aspirated to see if there was anything suspicious about the lump, and there wasn't, it was just big...However, over the last couple of months its grown and gotten tighter within the tissue of his shoulder; and about 2 weeks ago, it became infected. We hoped that 2 antibiotics would do the trick to get rid of the infection but it hasn't. My vet felt that Hamlet needed to see a surgeon about having it removed. (She wasn't comfortable doing it because of its size and location) I really don't like the idea of putting any dog under anesthesia, let alone one that is 13-14 years old, but there's really not any other choice.I took Hamlet for a consultation on Wednesday. The first surgeon (recommended by my vet) listened to all of my concerns reassured me that it could be done safely, and gave me a quote for a little more than $3000 (£1950) needless to say I was a bit overwhelmed by that amount. I called a 2nd surgeon who happens to be one that I know from my time as president of the rescue. Dr. Walker, did all of our orthopedic surgeries for the rescue, (including my boy Josh and Maguire) and gave a very generous discount. I took Hamlet to see him in hopes that \"maybe\" he would be a little less expensive. We had the same discussion as I did with the first surgeon, and then we discussed the money. I showed him what my quote was from the first office and he told me he would do it for half. Needless to say, I was again overwhelmed, but this time by generosity! He told me that because I'd taken in Hamlet and so many other dogs, he wanted too.Hamlet's surgery is scheduled for this afternoon. It goes without saying that I am really worried about him having such a tricky surgery at his age. So, I hope you'll send healing energy and positive thoughts for him that all will go well.Finally where does this leave us with Kenzie?? Right now in the same place, because Hamlet has to be a priority. But maybe, just maybe I'll make that phone call and that'll change..."},

My friend Sid took me to a little town called \"Bird in Hand\" and we did a little shopping.They had a really good farmers market with just about everything for every taste bud! No matter where I am, I can always spot a Golden, even a chocolate one!! We went across the street to a bakery, but not before I snapped a picture of this sign that gave me a little grin. For those who don't know, \"Intercourse\" is a name of a town east of Lancaster. I read that the signs for the town gets stolen quite a bit...Your own joke can go here...I'm not really one to make \"off-color\" jokes... Back on topic...Everything looked delicious in the bakery!!We also visited nearby nurseries where garden fever really got me! All these plants and all the possibilities!! There were tables with rows and rows of vegetable seedlings. But I resisted, and didn't buy anything even though I really wanted too... At the next green house, the plants were literally talking to me, and I could no longer resist. With really (!!) reasonable prices, I bought several plants that are now residing on my front porch until I can get them planted.After eating and shopping and laughing for two days it was time to come back to Virginia. As I crossed the Susquehanna River, I felt totally refreshed!! My visit to Lancaster gave me some perspective on my troubles and reminded me of the value of a good friend! I can't wait for my next trip! On my way home I go right past Gettysburg, so I took a quick drive through and snapped a few pictures that I will end this post with....

{"title": "Road Trip--Lancaster Pennsylvania!", "date": "Sunday, April 4, 2010", "text": "I had a wonderful visit with my friend Sid who lives in Lancaster Pennsylvania--She is the perfect hostess who drives me around to all the fun places to shop and the best places to fall off my diet! The weather could also not have been better with warm temps and sun!!I realize many of you already know about the Amish who live around Lancaster, but for those who may not, I'll tell you a little about them and share some of the pictures that I took. They are a conservative, reclusive, religious group of people who drive horses and buggies rather than cars.Some 200,000 Amish people live in more than 20 US states and in the Canadian province of Ontario. The oldest group of Old Order Amish, about 16,000-18,000 people, live in Lancaster County, which is a rural, farming area where Amish first settled in the 1720s - many fleeing religious persecution in Europe.Amish women wear modest dresses with long sleeves and a full skirt, a cape and an apron. They never cut their hair, and wear it in a braid or bun on the back of the head concealed with a small white cap or black bonnet. Clothing is fastened with straight pins or snaps, stockings are black cotton and shoes are also black. Men and boys wear dark-colored pants that never have creases or cuffs and are worn with suspenders. Belts are forbidden, as are sweaters, neckties and gloves. Men's shirts fasten with traditional buttons in most orders, while suit coats and vests fasten with hooks and eyes. Young men are clean shaven prior to marriage, while married men are required to let their beards grow. (The picture below is not one that I took). Homes do not have electricity, but do have running water and use gas stoves. There are also no telephones inside their homes. But many farms do have outside phone boxes like this one.  The Amish send their children to private, one-room schoolhouses until the age of 13. Most are trilingual and speak a dialect of German called Pennsylvania Dutch at home, use High German at their worship services, and they learn English at school. My friend Sid said that since a shooting at an Amish school a few years ago, fences have been put up around many of them. While many Amish own firearms, used to hunt, their communities until that time were (and typically are) largely free of violent gun crime.They eschew technology and preach isolation from the modern world. They do not join the military or accept assistance from the government. The Amish experience many of the same problems as other communities, but keep them private. They are divided into dozens of separate fellowships, broken down into districts or congregations. Each district is fully independent and lives by its own set of unwritten rules, or Ordnung. They observe strict regulations on dress, behaviour, and the use of technology, which they believe encourages humility and separation from the world. I really do admire the Amish to be able to be \"in the world but not of the world.\" And I have to admit that there are days when I wouldn't mind trading the chaos and stress of my life for the simplicity of theirs.  THANKS for coming along on this little trip...Tomorrow, what else I saw..."},

I appreciate your honesty and your candid thoughts about our adding another addition to our already bursting house hold. It is a lot to think about.I have taken a week of vacation from work, and originally was going to go to Kentucky to visit my brothers. But I've changed my plans and will be going this afternoon to visit a good friend of ours in Lancaster Pennsylvania for a couple of days. It should be a lot of fun, and I think the distance will provide some much needed perspective.Since today is April Fool's Day, I will end this post by leaving you with a few of the \"April Fool's\" that are here at Golden Pines:Is this an April Fool's joke, and this is actually a bird?  Is this an April Fool's prank and this is a squirrel or a bird incognito?Is this a bovine April Fool's gag and I really do have real cowsgrazing in our yard? Is this the real Easter Bunny paying an early visit to our house? Or is it Charlie's attempt at an April Fool's joke? Terriers do have a sense of humor... Whatever it is, enjoy your Thursday!!

{"title": "Another Dog Dilemma", "date": "Wednesday, March 31, 2010", "text": "When you're involved in rescue, especially in a leadership role, you meet a lot of people. One person I got to know is a very well educated and dog savvy person who is retired from the military. Shirley has been helping many rescues out in the area by working to rehab their dogs recovering from orthopedic surgery. Also because she has many years of training dogs, she has also been taking on their behavior challenged dogs as well. Shirley was living on a very large estate with a kennel where she housed about 20 such dogs and was assisted in this task by 2 people. She took on one of my severely abused foster dogs. Shirley worked with him, and truly made a huge difference for Leon! He is a pretty well adjusted dog because of the year that he lived with her. I visited her at the estate often and got to know some of the other dogs that Shirley had in her care.A year ago this past December, Shirley took in 2 female puppies (some kind of beagle and terrier mixes) from someone who was giving them away on a busy street corner. One of the puppies I was totally taken by. Each time I came to visit, I'd spend some time with the puppy. When Carl would come with me, he'd visit with the puppy too. The puppy named \"Kenzie\" is a very laid back little girl and was really getting picked on by the other dogs. At one time I was supposed to take Kenzie but with the unexpected and unplanned arrival of Hamlet from the rescue, we decided we couldn't take her. My last contact with Shirley was last fall. During this time I've never forgotten this puppy and neither has Carl. By a series of events Shirley has once again crossed my path, and she still has Kenzie, who is now about a year and-a-half old. However Shirley has moved far south from us, and is now living in a place with 21 dogs, has no fenced yard, and no kennel runs. Each dog has an area of the home and barn that they stay in--They don't have much outdoor freedom and are leashed walked and then put back in their crates. Shirley is caring for all the dogs alone. Needless to say, I think Shirley is in over her head, but I won't pass judgment, and would never suggest that. With the passing of Cowboy and no plans on taking any more fosters from the rescue, I feel like we now have a place for Kenzie. However I'm torn. Our crew is in a good place right now. There's a real peace among them. I know that a new young dog (that's never been inside a house) may very well change that. But Carl and I continue to feel sorry for Kenzie and can't stop thinking about her; especially knowing how she is being kept. I know all too well the time it takes to care for our pack, so I am quite sure that Kenzie is not getting the care or the attention she needs and deserves...So, my question I'm putting into the cosmos of cyber-space is, is feeling sorry for Kenzie, wanting to make a difference for her, and not being able to stop thinking about her a good enough reason to take her? I just don't know--My heart says it is, but my head is saying \"What are you doing, are you crazy? I'll admit there are a lot of reasons not to take Kenzie, but is not being able to forget about her a sign that I shouldn't?"},
{"title": "An Owl By Any Other Name...", "date": "Saturday, March 27, 2010", "text": "Since our move to the country 2 years ago many times we've heard owls calling back and forth to one another in the early morning hours. Knowing they're around I will often open a bedroom window at night in hopes of hearing them. I find the owls amazing, and I just feel like we are privileged to something unique in being able to hear them.Virginia is home to four types of owls. And, over the last several weeks we have been hearing and catching glimpses of what Carl and I were totally convinced was a \"Great Horned Owl.\" We had one that took up residence around us last year, so why wouldn't it be the same one this year? Even though the calls we have been hearing were a little different, we were still very sure it was a Horned Owl. My attempts to get a picture of it didn't meet with any success until Thursday when I had the dogs out for a late afternoon walk. I caught a glimpse of it on the edge of the woods, and ran back inside to get my camera. I was so excited by what I was able to get pictures of and a little surprised to find that it is not a Great Horned Owl after all, but a Barred Owl instead. But it doesn't matter, \"an owl by any other name, is still an owl!\" I still love having it around and hope it'll stay.~~Their sound says: \"who cooks for you-who cooks for you?\"~~Here's what they actually sound like: http://pelotes.jea.com/owlbard.wavAnd here is what \"ours\" looks like: Don't ask me how many pictures I took of him, this is where having a digital camera (and a good zoom lens) paid off!!

{"title": "The Healing Story of Josh", "date": "Thursday, March 25, 2010", "text": "With another day off work and a little bit of time, if you'd like to read a story get comfy and I'll continue telling you about our dogs and their story of rescue. The dog that we've had nearly as long as Wendy is Josh who came to us in August of 2002.He was only about 4 months old when he was hit by a car and found on the side of the road. A motorist passing by noticed him and took him to an animal emergency clinic. He was in shock, and x-rays showed that he had a fractured pelvis and his right front leg was broken. Time was critical because his leg needed to be operated on because it was broken near the growth plate. A \"found report\" was posted hoping that someone would come forward to claim this little boy, but no one did. Five days later, Josh was turned over to the Golden Retriever Rescue.Somewhere during this time we were sent this black and white photo and asked by the rescue to foster him. At first I said \"no\" to taking him because about a month before we had the devastating loss of our 5 year old Golden to cancer, and that week we'd had another very difficult and sudden loss of a foster dog. I just felt that I had nothing left to give my own dogs, let alone one that needed extra care and attention. But \"fate\" had another idea, and somehow we ended up agreeing to take him.I first saw \"him\" after the initial surgery on his front leg, and of course was immediately smitten by him! The cast on his leg was practically as big as he was and he had several patches where there was no hair from the tumble on the road when he was hit by the car. I named this \"lost boy\" Josh after the Tom Hanks character in the movie \"Big\" because he was such a young boy that suddenly had to grow up and find his way in the world. Josh had 2 more surgeries on his leg and there was a lot of doubt in the beginning about his being able to keep his leg. But luck remained on Josh's side and he came through it all just fine.But we still had other hurdles to get over. After the recovery of his front leg was complete, we noticed that Josh would often scoot along the floor on his side to retrieve something instead of walking. X-rays were taken and they showed that his pelvis had small multiple fractures, and the larger fracture that we had thought would heal on its own, had not healed properly. Josh would need more surgery that would re-break his pelvis, put a plate in and then bilateral triple pelvic osteotomies would be done. Two surgeries, 3 weeks apart were done. The bottom line was that it was yet another 6 weeks of crate confinement for Josh.The last round of surgeries were very painful for Josh. Any movement and he would yelp in pain. Carl and I found that what seemed to comfort him and lift his spirits the most was being with us. In the evenings we would take him out of his crate, and he would play a little, or just rest quietly next to us as we watched TV. We also took turns at night sleeping with him on a dog bed. He would snuggle up so close to us, and you could hear these little noises as he slept.By the middle of November, Josh had made remarkable progress. He was feeling much better, and was able to stand while eating. However, Josh was still extremely unstable on his feet. He would slip very easily, and each step he took was slow, stiff and methodical. Because of Josh’s extensive time on “crate rest” his muscles had atrophied and he had very little strength and stamina. To improve this, Josh began swim therapy as a rehabilitative exercise that would provide him with the best chance to make a complete recovery. For the next 4 months we drove to an animal swim center about 40 minutes away from us 3 times a week. It was a lot of driving, but I was committed to Josh and his recovery. It all paid off because the differences the swimming made for him, both physically and emotionally, were indescribable! Everyone involved with Josh was thrilled!!!By springtime Josh was fully recovered and was able to run and play and do all the \"normal\" things. But it also brought the job of trying to find a new home for him--That was the whole reason for fostering him, right? I'll spare you those details and just say that I didn't make much of an attempt to find someone for him. Each call I received I found a reason why they weren't the right family. We adopted Josh in April of 2003.Today Josh is about 8 years old. There is still some visible evidence of his injuries. He is a very affectionate and extremely easy going boy that still loves to snuggle up very close to us. And when you ask him to show you his \"owie,\" using his nose, he'll point to his front leg.So much has happened since Josh first came to us and he is of course such an intricate part of our household. During this time the sting of the loss of our precious Golden Tod and Murphy our foster dog has eased. But looking back on it, I think that the noises that I used to hear at night when all was quiet and Josh was sleeping next to me, were the sounds of both of us healing."},

Do you feel the energy it has brought? Are you looking at all the signs of life and the changes that are around you like I am? With spring just getting to Virginia, I have created a list of 10 things that it has brought with it... 10. The Frisbees are back!!For some reason we don't play Frisbee in the winter even though the dogs really enjoy it, and I enjoy watching them have fun too!9. Ice-cubes & Cold Drinks!The dogs love having ice cubes after they've been out playing in the warm weather--For me, there's nothing like a cold Diet Coke on any kind of day!8. Green, Green Grass of Home!About half of the dogs love to eat grass and I think it's simply because they just enjoy it. When we lived in a subdivision the dogs always got sick when they ate it--Now they don't and I wonder if it's because we don't use any pesticides.Whoops, wrong picture--That's one of the cows across the road! 7. Sniffles, sneezing and coughing!With spring comes allergies galore; hay-fever season has officially begun, and I'm not immune to it--But I am not complaining...aahhh-choo...6. Hair, hair and more hair!Lets not forget what brings on some of these allergies--the shedding season!! I usually toss the dog hair into the yard and let the birds grab it to use in their nests--Since the dogs keep me warm, then it should keep the baby birds cozy too! 5. More time outside and more daylight!I really like getting home from work when it's still light and I can walk with the dogs in the evening! This picture was taken at around 7 PM this evening from my front porch. I'm also thrilled that I caught the first glimpse of our resident ground-hog running across the yard as I went out to take this picture.4. No more mostly brown everywhere!I love the color that spring brings!!!3. The Warmth of the Sun!Who doesn't get their inner batteries recharged when it's sunny outside?2. Sitting on the Front Porch!Our favorite past time! For us, it's the perfect setting for some afternoon reading and just hanging out.And the #1 thing that has come at the start of Spring??1. Easter Goodies!!! Who couldn't love a season that involves chocolate bunnies? Whatever Spring has brought to you, I hope you're enjoying it!!"},
{"title": "Peace After the Storm", "date": "Sunday, March 21, 2010", "text": "It's the end of a crazy weekend! The first day of spring brought with it sunshine and continued warm weather! It could not have started out on a better \"note!\" I woke to hear the return of my favorite bird, the Eastern Phoebe! We heard the Phoebe's relentless squeaky toy call of \"phoebe-phoebe-phoebe\" every day until late last summer. I know there are birds with prettier songs that fill the air, and I enjoy them as well but there was something about hearing the simple repertoire of the Phoebe that we became quite attached too. I really missed it when it left. I did have to make a trek to the vet's office with Hamlet who has a small abscess on a lipoma. He's on a couple of medications and I'm quite sure he'll mend just fine. I also picked up Cowboy's ashes. The return of the remains is always very sad for us, but it's a comfort to have them. I usually keep them out on the shelf for several days, then when it's time, I put them away with the others. I got home about mid day and I was just a little put out that Carl hadn't even started any of the planned yard work that we had agreed to getting done. After a little bit of a discussion about which jobs to do, Carl went out started some clean up in the yard. He was out there for a couple of hours when I heard him calling to me--I went out and he was covered in blood. He had fallen and hit his head on the trash-bin that he was using to clean up the yard. I got a towel that was soaked very quickly, it didn't take long for the 2nd one. I called \"911\" and after a barrage of questions, an ambulance was sent. I went out to be with Carl who was sitting on the front porch. Knowing the dogs would go crazy inside when help arrived, even though he was feeling a bit dizzy we moved off the porch to the rocks on the edge of the driveway to wait. Help arrived just as I noticed that where he was sitting, running all over the rocks were these little yellow spiders--They were everywhere!!! They were even on Carl--The \"rescue team\" that was attending to Carl noticed them and ended up with a few on them as well. But they got him all set and transported him to a nearby hospital. I'll spare you the rest of the details of the 4 hours we spent in the emergency room and just say that he ended up with 10 staples to close about a 2-3 inch gash on his head. A little worse for wear when he was finally being released around 10 o'clock, when he got up to leave 2 spiders were left behind.Sunday was a much quieter day! Carl is feeling okay and after a nap I sat on the porch with the dogs looking at my magazines, watching the birds, hearing the Phoebe every now and then and relaxing. Peace has returned to Golden Pines! Thank-goodness!!"},

I've not done a single thing but knock around the house and enjoy the warmth and the sun! We had temperatures that were in the low 70's, (20 degrees Celsius) and the dogs and I took full advantage of it! I wanted the day to just be a relaxing quiet day and that's exactly what it was.The dogs and I went for a morning walk. For some reason, Charlie sitting under our \"Golden Road\" sign gave me a little grin.While it was still chilly I decided that this would be the day that I would get the rocks from the fallen stone wall that I've been eyeing since we moved here. I'm afraid to do it in the summer because of what may be hiding under or around them. My Mom loved rocks and as a result, I love them too--There are lots of these white rocks around, and I think they will be great rocks for my garden, they have such color and character.  After a nap, the dogs and I went out again. You can see it was blue sky and sunshine this afternoon too. It was such a peaceful feeling as I looked back at our house and watched the dogs.There are signs of spring everywhere!! Most of my flowers are coming up and our old Maple tree is budding too. I got so engrossed in taking pictures, I wasn't keeping track of where the dogs were. On the upper left corner of this picture can you can see Hamlet playing the role of \"renegade\" and wandering down the driveway...YIKES!! Once back inside we sat on the porch, relaxed, soaked up more sun and watched the birds come to the feeders.I didn't even pay (much) attention to what I think (???) is a wolf spider that has been hanging out on our porch the last few days. I actually find it to be a pretty spider, and as long as it doesn't come inside or move in my direction, it can stay.I hope you've had a good Thursday too!!"},

But what has made it easier and has provided so much comfort are the heart-felt comments from so many of you. I continue to be deeply touched and humbled by your thoughts and your friendship. Cowboy's loss has left us with aching hearts, but your kindness has helped to ease that. I will always be grateful and thankful to all of you for your support.Our lives do continue and are getting back to normal...The sun and warmth returned yesterday and it was so nice last evening to be outside with the dogs and watch their games and antics. I look forward to being off work on Thursday and catching up on things around the house and with all of you on your blogs too--Just like Cowboy, there are some things that I really do miss. Enjoy your Wednesday!!"},
{"title": "The End of My First Day", "date": "Sunday, March 14, 2010", "text": "As the day comes to a close, I cannot begin to tell you how very humbled I am by the kind messages, poems and even an e-card after the loss of our Golden, Cowboy. These kind gestures and friendship have meant so very much, and have truly lifted my heart and spirit! Saying \"THANK-YOU!!\" somehow doesn't seem like enough for this wonderful gift I have received from so many of you! You have helped me through what has been a difficult day.We did go to church today, but only for me to teach my Sunday school class and then leave. I'm just not been ready to face the world and needed a day at home.As you know, when we lose one of our four-legged family members, you have a day that becomes a day of firsts. It truly is all part of this whole process called grieving, and this is what this post is.For me, it's always hard to look for the first time and see where \"they\" used to always lay. And then there's the first time you realize that you now have an extra bowl that doesn't need to be filled .  It's also sad the first time you don't see them standing in the spot where they used to eat. The first walks for me always take a little getting used to because you're so used to seeing them in their favorite spot in the yard--And you keep looking, expecting to see them there; but the place is empty and oh, so silent. This morning out of habit I kept looking back to see if I was being followed by a dog that for 2 years was my companion on all of our walks. I think that today Cowboy was there in spirit \"bringing in the herd\" as I always used to say to him because he was always the last one to come inside. Another \"first\" was coming home for the first time; the barking from the inside of our house is missing a voice. Yesterday afternoon the dogs kept coming to me and I just felt like I had nothing to give them, and I thought I wanted to be alone. But I let them in and just as I knew they would, the dogs became a source of comfort and strength. I know that life does and needs to continue. But I'm thankful that I've been able to shut the world out today. Tomorrow will come, and I'll once again join the human race. I'm feeling the loss, but thankful for those like you who understand and have provided a cyber-shoulder to cry on. Thank-you so very, very much for that, you made a difference for me on \"my first day!\"~~~~~~~~~~~~Thank-you Tanner for running off and distracting me on the walk this morning. Sammy for reminding me that life does and needs to go on. Maguire for knowing that I needed a dog to hug. Rudi for making me laugh by bringing me that branch this morning... And Joshua for jumping on the bed when I was taking a nap. It helped to have you close. And Charlie for telling me it would be okay.Thank-you Sheba for understanding when I accidentally left you outside in the rain... And Wendy for barking when it was mealtime, you helped to distract me.Hamlet for offering me your paw to hold.  And thank-you Cowboy for being part of our life and our home for 2 years."},
{"title": "The Passing of a Friend & Family Member", "date": "Saturday, March 13, 2010", "text": "I will start by saying THANK YOU to all of you for your thoughts and prayers for Cowboy. I write my second post today with a heavy weight in my heart. I took Cowboy to the vet this morning, thankfully my regular vet was working today. I have to admit that there was a part of me screaming to not call them and keep Cowboy at home. But I knew instinctually or on an intellectual level that he needed to be seen. We started with blood work to see if there were any changes since his 6 month visit in February. While we waited for the results, we spent some time together on the floor. I told him how I felt about everything that was going on and how much I loved our 2 years together. I told him what he meant to our family and how much I wanted him to be okay. When the blood work came back, the results showed that even though he had a slight elevated white blood cell count there were no real changes since his last visit. However, Cowboy was telling us something else. I tried to get Cowboy to take a treat from me, stand, put his head up and I tried to get a small wag of his tail, anything...but I couldn't. As I watched him, I knew in my heart that the kind thing to do was to let him go. We had little time for goodbyes...Cowboy slipped into sleep for the last time and left this life for the next taking a piece of my heart with him. He will be missed and not forgotten. Cowboy joins and meets our other Goldens, Tod, Ben, Cougar, Scout, Tucker, Tosh, Logan, Cubby, and Kasey at the Rainbow Bridge. God speed Cowboy...It's my usual time to get up, but I feel as if I've not had any sleep at all.You may recall back in February I told you about our senior boy, Cowboy who we think is about 13-14 years old. He came to us 2 years ago from a shelter in West Virginia--You can read more about him and his story of rescue here: http://lifeatgoldenpines.blogspot.com/2010/02/our-valentines-day-gift.htmlYesterday morning we noticed that Cowboy was not his usual self. When we were out for our morning walk, he only walked around a little bit. There was none of his continual tail wagging or barking, there was none of his usual rolling in the grass either. When he came back in, he laid down in the kitchen. He didn't get up for his breakfast, so I fed him in that spot. Thinking that the rain and the return of the cold weather was bothering his arthritis Carl and I both went off to work--Of course I worried about him the entire time. When I got home, Cowboy was still in the same place as he was when I left in the morning. When I let the other dogs out, Cowboy tried, but couldn't get up. I stood him up, but he's unable to walk without being steadied on his feet. I made him a dinner of \"chicken-soup\" with rice, which he ate. We then helped him out, and put him on a dog bed where he's stayed. Cowboy sleeps in our room and I got up several times during the night to check on him and anytime there was any noise I woke up. He did get sick once during the night...His feet and ears are nice and warm, his gum color is good, and he's alert... Of course it goes without saying that I really love this goofy old boy and I'm really worried. I don't know what all this means, and my hope is that he'll snap out of it. But of course my head is telling that he is an old dog that's had a long life and his time to leave us may be near--but my heart is not ready to let him go, he practically just got here.I hope you'll keep him in your prayers..."},
{"title": "Blog-Writers Block??!!", "date": "Thursday, March 11, 2010", "text": "It has been over a week since I posted...I have decided that I'm experiencing a bit of writers block. I have never had a shortage of words before. I always joke that I can talk \"for an hour just about the color orange.\" But for some reason, the words are just not coming even though there is a lot of inspiration around me to blog about.We've had warm temps, and I could blog about the \"sunshine on my shoulder making me happy...\" But that would be using words already sung by John Denver.The dogs are certainly a comedic source to tell \"tails\" of! I could write about how they are enjoying the warmer weather... ...and how \"in-sync\" they can be with one another...But I can't find the words to tell about it...Then there's our cat CC. I could blog about how she never walks on the grass to get across the yard, but walks on the top rail of the fence instead, always stopping at the posts--I love how cats keep their balance and never fall. I could blog about how klutzy I was as a kid and never got picked for anything...But no, I'm just not in the mood to talk about it.   Of course there are the signs of spring to tell about--My daffodils are coming up......I could blog about second chances like the one given to me by my Hydrangea. I set it out last year and despite my best effort, it didn't do so well. I was so glad to see that it's coming back this year to give me another chance!I could post about the wild-life I so love seeing. But again the words elude me to even tell about the 2 owls we are hearing in the early morning hours; I even had one swoop just over me on Wednesday. The Red Wing Black-birds and the Canadian Geese have also returned. This past week we found a deer antler. I wonder if its from the beautiful buck we had around in the fall? I did get a new camera yesterday. I've \"semi-retired\" my beloved 35mm camera, and am going towards being all digital. I wanted something to take the close-up pictures that I've been able to take with my \"old\" camera--The digital one I've been using does \"okay,\" and time will tell if the new addition fits my amateur needs.                                                                                                                                           I did a lot of research of cameras that were in the range of what I could spend. After much thought, and reading lots of reviews I decided on the \"Canon PowerShot.\" The reviews that say the \"Canon PowerShot SX20 IS, can produce magnificent HD movies and dazzling photos--It has a high-powered 20x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer, 12.1 Megapixels, a big 2.5-inch Vari-Angle LCD, Blink Detection and more...\"Maybe the \"new toy\" is what I need. I hope you'll stay tuned...I'm hoping inspiration and words return soon, I know I have so much more to say, don't I??"},
{"title": "Finally--Signs of Spring!!!", "date": "Wednesday, March 3, 2010", "text": "I know I'm not the only one who has felt that this winter has been a particularly long and cold one. So, its really been a bit of a relief to say goodbye to February, and \"hello\" to a few little indications of spring...Like the Eastern Bluebird: The (American) Robin: We even saw a weasel, although I think it's still a bit early for this critter to be out and about--I wonder what woke him up? With temps above freezing during the day, I noticed today that the Forsythia is also starting to bud. Another signal of spring is that Charlie, our Wheaten Terrier went today for his \"spring-do.\" I always think I like the shaggy-dog look best, but then he comes back from the groomer and I can see his eyes, and then I think I like that look best! Unfortunately the warmer temps have also brought out of their winter hiding places the \"stink-bugs\" that we were bombarded with last fall. The ones that found their way inside are now appearing on the floor, the counters, the furniture and even on Carl's painting...Bugs make me a bit squeamish; but I am proud to say that I am picking some of them up and putting them outside--They hate the cold but the birds really love them and have been coming onto the front porch looking for ones we have tossed out. By the way, the ones that don't get picked up, vacuumed or tossed out the door sometimes get eaten by our boy Maguire--I guess they are an acquired taste, none of the other dogs seem to want to sample them!  Whatever March brings, I'm glad that at the start of it, there are a few signs of spring!"},
{"title": "A Little Fish Story", "date": "Saturday, February 27, 2010", "text": "It's been a long couple of days. I would really like to thank everyone for your positive thoughts, comments and support on \"Sam's Saga.\" It really means a lot to have your input and insight on this issue. I'm meeting with the family on Sunday, and will let you know what happens.I really needed some \"alone time\" today and with our internet connection having problems I thought I'd just leave Carl to do his own thing and take Rudi for a drive. We drove over to Harpers Ferry West Virginia which is about 40 minutes from where we live and is situated on the banks of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers where Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia meet. Harpers Ferry is best known for John Brown's raid on the Armory in 1859 which brought national attention to the emotional divisions concerning slavery. As you can see, it's really a beautiful place, especially in the summer, we love to spend time there!I remembered that we needed some bird food so I stopped by the \"Petco\" in the next town over called Charles Town. I took Rudi inside with me. She's usually pretty good when I take her places, but Rudi being Rudi, she bores easily and starts to act up--She didn't disappoint. When I was standing in line to check out, I noticed a well dressed older couple standing in back of me with a bag of two goldfish. Rudi was starting to get restless and started playfully barking at the man holding the fish who in return gave me a stern look of disapproval. As I was paying, I felt Rudi jump up and I turned around just in time to see that the bag that held the goldfish had a hole in it and there was water everywhere! I was given a look of disbelief and astonishment that was accompanied by something said by the couple and the cashier that I can't even remember--I quickly finished paying and Rudi and I made a quick retreat over the border and back to Virginia."},
{"title": "What to do About Sam?", "date": "Thursday, February 25, 2010", "text": "I know I've already posted today, but I don't think there's a set rule that I can't post twice in a day, so I'm going to just because I need to unload something that of course it involves one of the dogs.Believe it or not, one of our dogs is not from a rescue...At least not in the sense that our others are. His name is Sam, and we guess he is about 8-9 years old. He came to us last August from a family we know from church. He has a bit of mysterious past, and we call him \"Sam the Spy\" The family that we got him from had only had him two years. His life before that is unknown. The story I was told is that the Husband who works for \"a Government Agency\" came home one day with him. He told his wife that Sam's owner \"was gone\" and Sam needed to disappear. The wife said that she knew better than to ask any more questions -- But she really felt that \"Sam\" was not his name at all because he didn't respond to it. It's anyone's guess what it could be!! I have joked that some night I'll be sitting with him and say something off the wall like \"Kwasimoto\" and he'll go crazy!!Whatever his past was, and whatever Sam is not telling us, he's really a nice dog! The family gave him up for several reasons. One being that they just didn't have time for him. Another was the health of \"the wife.\" She was diagnosed with cancer and just felt that Sam was a bit too much to take care of along with a job and active young children. They also had to move out of the home they were in, into a smaller home in a subdivision that just happens to be around the corner from where we used to live. But they felt that they weren't going to have room inside or out for him. The family had thought about turning him over to the Golden Retriever Rescue. But they were on the fence about giving Sam to rescue and I thought it was only because they wanted to know what happened to him, and wanted to make sure that he had a good home--At least this is what I was told by the wife. But this is how I entered the picture. The wife contacted me, because they knew we had Goldens and asked if we would take him--Of course we said yes, and promised that he'd be loved, well cared for, etc. I know the kids were (naturally) upset about giving him up, but I told them they could come anytime to visit! I've kept up with them via Facebook and sent a few pictures telling them how he was doing. They've never come to visit, or initiated any contact. ...Well, guess what has happened? Yes, they have asked if they could have Sam back. I find myself really torn about it. I have to ask, what has changed that all of the sudden the issues that they said kept them from keeping him 6 months ago are not problems six months later? How do they suddenly have the room for Sam? How does the Mom all of the sudden have time and energy for it all given her health concerns? I also have to ask myself why didn't they love him enough when they had him to try and make it work and keep him? I don't understand--I would do anything for my dogs, and that includes doing what I can to keep them; but that's me. I did hint around about my concerns, but the husband only told me that they felt that they could now make it work with Sam~~Just as a caveat I'll add that a friend of mine told me that we don't \"legally\" own Sam because we never signed a formal agreement. Even though I should know the laws of dog ownership in Virginia because of the rescue, I have to admit that I do not.I know it goes without saying that we do love Sam. He's a terrific dog--Whatever he has been through, it hasn't kept him from being a confident, friendly and outgoing Golden. But it took several weeks for him to get used to living in a \"group home\" and being with other dogs, as well as a whole new routine. But Sam has settled in and does seem happy and of course he seems to have made a connection with Carl and I and has found his place in the pack.I know that we have so many Goldens here, and maybe one leaving us shouldn't be such a big deal and they are a good kind family. But despite knowing his, it doesn't keep me from being torn, and having doubts about them and not knowing what I should do...Is it selfish and wrong to want to keep Sam and know for sure that he is happy and okay? I worry that if something happens and they decide they aren't able to keep him that they may not contact me again even if I made them promise they would. What a dilemma and what's the right thing to do?I mentioned last week that my life \"had returned to boring.\" It really has! Each day pretty much starts out the same.Of course I get up in the morning...Which is a good way to start the day...We feed the dogs...Yes, we cook for them in the morning too--Just steamed green-beans mixed with canned food that we put on top of their kibble.  All the dogs get out for a morning walk. The rule is that all the dogs have to stop barking and settle down before we open the garage door--This morning \"Josh\" burped when everyone was quiet--There's always a comedian in the bunch! This morning CC (our cat) came along--I guess she thought we needed an escort--Or maybe she's just as happy as we are that enough snow has melted that we can now see the entire driveway! We also dodged another snowstorm that was predicted for today.  We get everyone back in, which is sometimes no easy task because we have our renegades running around everywhere, then I get myself together and make the hour drive to work... Because Carl works 10-hour days, I get home first. I get the dogs out for a nightime romp, give them all their needed attention and fix our dinner--Carl gets home around 9 PM and after about an hour or so, it's off to bed for about 7-ish hours of quiet quality time with the dogs...I told you, I was a bit boring right now...Please stay tuned...It has to change...Right? I just hope this isn't the calm before the storm!"},
{"title": "Wendy & The Lost Boys", "date": "Sunday, February 21, 2010", "text": "A few of you asked about the rescue stories of the Goldens that reside at \"Golden Pines.\" Because my life has returned to boring, I will use today to tell you about one member of our crew named Wendy, who is our \"top dog.\"  Get comfy and I will tell you her story...I had heard somewhere that when you get a dog, you should get your first one from a breeder and your second from a rescue--That's exactly what we did. Our first Golden, named Tod, came from a breeder. Because we thought Tod was perfect, it of course made us want another one just like him. But what came to us in the summer of 1999, was our introduction into rescue and a dog that was so unlike our first one.She came to us at almost two years old, and her name was Amber. I didn't think the name fit her, so we changed it to Wendy who is my favorite character in Peter Pan. Little did I know at the time, how perfect and appropriate this name would become. Wendy, a border collie and Golden mix had been given up by her owners because of her exuberance and boldness; qualities of a Border Collie. She had so much energy, and ran everywhere she went. She also got into everything, was independent and jumped up on everyone!! She was so unlike our first Golden, who we thought could do no-wrong! I used to say that if we'd gotten her first, we may not have ever gotten another dog. At first Tod, who was so laid back and reserved was a bit overwhelmed by her antics. Wendy did not score any points with him when she chewed up a favorite bear that he'd treasured for a long time. But eventually everything came together, and we were a pretty happy little family. **This is a photo of Tod & Wendy**Carl and I really wanted to \"make a difference\" so in the spring of 2000, we became a foster home for the Golden Retriever Rescue. For some reason, many of the Goldens coming into rescue at the time were young male strays that had been in a shelter. Because we have no children, these Goldens were placed with us. Wendy became the companion and mentor to what we would eventually call \"the lost boys.\" These young rambunctious Goldens were the perfect outlet for Wendy who loved to run and play games! Her favorite thing was to chase and be chased. Being in touch with her Border Collie genes, a tennis ball was never interesting to Wendy; she adored the Frisbee, and never tired of catching and running after it.I don't know where the time has gone, but it has now been almost 11 years since Wendy came to us. She is our only connection to all of the additions and subtractions in our household. She has been my constant companion on road-trips and walks, and sleeps at the foot of the bed. Wendy's loyalty, love, and dedication has had a deep impact on me. Many times I have sat with her and shared my dreams, secrets, fears and disappointments. Wendy always listens and seems to understand because the look that she gives seems to always find a way to reassure me that everything will be okay.Wendy is no longer able to run and play like she used too; this winter has been a difficult one for her because she has developed arthritis in her hips. I have to admit that I have a hard time thinking of Wendy as anything but that young, crazy-wild-dog we adopted in 1999, especially because that spark, spunk and spirit is still very much there! I never would have thought that \"Wendy\" whose name came from a character that symbolized mothering, caring, loyalty, and undying friendship, would mean the same to our household as it did to Peter Pan and the Lost Boys!"},
{"title": "Our Valentine's Day Gift", "date": "Sunday, February 14, 2010", "text": "Today on Valentine's Day, I pay tribute to one of our dogs, Cowboy. Two years ago on Valentine's Day, I was asked to foster a senior Golden that was picked up as a stray, and was on his \"last day\" in a shelter in West Virginia. Here was fate again....Carl and I just happened to be off work the next day and could meet the transport that was bringing him to our part of Virginia; so that made it easy to say \"yes.\"When we first saw him, he was leashed to a tree in a backyard. He stood up and started happily barking at us, as if to ask where we'd been. With the leash in hand, he walked right to our van and put his front feet up on the open side door, a signal for us to help him in and to get on with his adventure! Of course a couple of people suggested we name him something associated with Valentine's Day. But I named him \"Cowboy\" for a couple of reasons--He had on a rope-like collar, and with bow-legs bent because of age, a few missing teeth, all reminded me of an \"old\" cowboy--The name just seemed to fit him.As we got to know Cowboy, I thought he was sweet old fellow (aren't they all?) and I thought it was a bit endearing that when he wagged his tail, it went in a big circle that never seemed to stop going. We found him to be a happy, big goofy Golden with a little bit of laryngeal paralysis that causes him to have a raspy old dog bark that is always telling you when he wants something--If his barking doesn't get your attention, then he'll grab your hand, your shirt, or whatever he can and pull you to what he wants, which is usually something related to the kitchen.I've no idea what Cowboy's past was like, and of course we have no idea how old he really is. But what I do know, is that we couldn't love him anymore if he'd been with us his entire life. I feel that with Cowboy and all the other senior Goldens, that when I look into their eyes, we have been given an extraordinary gift to love, and to be loved unconditionally in return--For me, it's the perfect Valentine's Day gift!Happy Valentine's Day Everyone!"},
{"title": "A Normal Day?", "date": "Saturday, February 13, 2010", "text": "It's my last day of being snowbound, our driveway is cleared!!I'm not really sure if it's just my state of mind, but today there were a few things that happened that gave me a little bit of a grin....It started first thing this morning when we opened the garage door to let the dogs out. Left by the door were 2 packages that had been delivered by Federal Express yesterday. The delivery person had to walk through our snow-filled-drive way to get to our house--Kudos to him for doing that!! However, the packages that were delivered belong to our neighbors... I must've been on a roll with the mail--This came from my Aunt today--It's a cat toy, that's for cats...What if the dogs want to play with it, I wonder if they would want too?  I've been resisting making brownies--It ended up probably being a good thing, because when I opened the brownie mix to make them today, this was on the inside...I think it's a cake mix... Since the snow started, I've been missing a house-shoe--Today Sheba came to me with it in her mouth. I wish she could tell me where she found it.Having a bit of cabin fever, we spent a little bit of time outside with the dogs. I noticed our rain-gauge has become a snow gauge; I think it's pretty accurate.The drama for the day came when we came back in, I couldn't find our cat, CC. I was pretty sure she'd been outside with us. We looked, and looked for her, and called her as well. Carl had been clearing the snow off the roof, and being a worrier of course I imagined that maybe some snow fell on top of her, or maybe the hawk we've been seeing carried her off...It could happen, right??!! Well, maybe not. Eventually I noticed that CC was napping in a spot that she's not used in quite sometime on top of our kitchen cabinets. Do you think that she heard us calling her and promising her a meal if she came? Of course she did.... I think all this is a sign that life is returning back to normal; whatever that is!"},

The Federal Government has been closed all week, so Carl has been off as a result. My office closed 2 days, but unable to get to work today it seems like I have been home for days and days...  We found (and paid) someone to plow out our driveway on Tuesday. But Murphy's Law being what it is, the Wednesday snowstorm that brought another foot of snow was accompanied by high winds which caused snow to drift across the driveway, snowing us in yet again. Carl is working on shoveling (yes, I said shovel) and we're hoping that by Saturday night we'll be able to get out again. If not, we may have our own episode of \"The Shining\" with me playing the role of Jack Torrance! Thankfully our power has stayed on, and we are well stocked with all that we need. I think that the dogs are getting tired of the snow too. I know they are missing being able to run and play in the woods that they love so much. Rudi (below) was on her way to the bird feeder for her favorite snack--Can't blame her for trying to get there--There's always something on the ground that she thinks she can't live without! Charlie waits patiently by the gate--Is he hoping to make an escape too? I wish it were as easy as opening a gate to leave! Enjoy your weekend!!"},

{"title": "My Grasshopper Ways...", "date": "Sunday, February 7, 2010", "text": "You may remember the story of the “Grasshopper and the Ant.” I remember this story not because I read it in a book, but because I saw the Disney cartoon. In the cartoon, the grasshopper fiddles, sings, and eats the leaves off trees while the queen of the ants warn him that he'd better prepare for winter too. But the grasshopper continues fiddling and singing. When winter finally comes, the grasshopper becomes almost frozen from the cold. He can no longer play his fiddle. In desperation, he knocks at the tree where the ants live and begs them to let him in. The queen ant gives her “I told you so” speech and ends with “Take your fiddle...” and after the long pause she says “and play!” So in the end, the grasshopper earns the warmth and food of the ants by playing his fiddle.I am reminded of this story because Carl and I are like the grasshopper in the story. We are SO unprepared for this winter!! These last 2 snowstorms have really held challenges for us. I had hoped that the lessons learned from the last snowstorm would get us through this one; they really haven't. Our power went out on Saturday afternoon. With almost 3 feet of snow, no firewood and temps below freezing outside, it was getting chilly inside. The dogs however, were great warmers last night--There's nothing like a Golden Retriever or two (or three) to help you to feel cozy!! But with very little food that didn't need to be cooked, no running water, (everything in our house is electric) I have to confess that I was getting a little concerned and we both were a little hungry too. Carl and I worked today and got my van and part of the driveway all shoveled out. About 2 hours later we were wet and pretty cold.

The snow is back, and the prediction for this storm is for 2-3 feet before it all ends on Saturday night. I know this may not sound like much to some of you, but for an area that is only used to getting around 17 inches a year it's a big deal--The bottom line, we are real wimps here in Virginia!!At the start of the winter, I didn't mind the snow because I really enjoy a good snow day and having a good reason to stay home! But I have to admit that with all we've had this year it is starting to lose its novelty because I'm not nearly as excited about this snowfall as I was about the others we've had.I know you're probably tired of looking at my snow pictures, but it seems to be what my life is all about the last couple of weeks...Below is the view of our road as I was coming home from work this afternoon. You can see that the road was starting to get a glaze on it.The 22 inches of snow we had in December really caught us off guard and unprepared with a way to \"get out.\" Because we had no one to plow for us, or a snow-blower, we ended up shoveling the entire driveway. Since we've not been able to get a plow for our \"lawn-tractor\" we decided to park my van close to the bottom of the driveway to make getting out easier--At least that's our hope! This is the \"old road\" in back of our house that leads up to the open field. It certainly looks different in the snow, doen't it? Home snowy-home!!! Which is where we'll be for the next couple of days--If the power stays on and we have an internet connection, it's not such a bad place to be snowbound!!!Hmmmm...There were no pictures of the dogs or mention of them in this post...How'd that happen??"},
{"title": "A Ground-DOG Day Prediction!", "date": "Tuesday, February 2, 2010", "text": "Today was Groundhog Day! The day when thousands of revelers converged on the small Pennsylvania town of Punxsutawney to hear a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predict the weather! Apparently the day grew out of a mainly German superstition that if a hibernating animal casts a shadow February 2--the Christian holiday of Candlemas--winter will last another six weeks. If no shadow is seen, legend says spring will be early.Having a lot of confidence in this scientific method for predicting the weather, but being unable to make it to Punxsutawney, we decided to see for ourselves if spring would come early or late. However, our resident groundhogs are all in hibernation right now. So, we opted to use the next best thing for our own Ground-DOG Day prediction, the dogs. When we had them out this morning, we tried in several different places to see if one of them would cast a shadow. No matter what they did, there was no shadow!! So it was official, spring will come early!!!However, as we looked out our backdoor tonight it was confirmed that our dogs and Punxsutawney Phil are just as good of  weathermen as the ones with two legs--It is definitely NOT looking like an early spring!

Because the parking lot wasn't able to be plowed, church was cancelled.

The snow from yesterday is melting and the sun has been out all day.  The dogs enjoyed being outside. Maguire continues to think that the snow is a meal to be enjoyed! Speaking of meals...The birds have been all around for the last couple of days too. I really enjoy watching them. We have quite a community of birds that include cardinals, blue Jays, chickadees, nut-hatches, and wrens--Even the woodpeckers, crows and a squirrel have come. However an uninvited flock of Starlings has shown up and they really are a nuisance! I don't think they are a particularly pretty bird. Added to that they act like a street gang because they scare away the smaller birds and gobble up all the food I put out, leaving nothing for the other birds. Carl says they're hungry and have to eat too--Of course I realize that, but it doesn't make me sympathetic to them at all. Maybe my dislike for their being here is like the Wolf Spider from last week, I am not seeing their beauty and misunderstand them too."},

Unable to coax him out I left him there. I have to admit that I forgot about him and remembered him about an hour later. He was still sitting in the front seat waiting and hoping for that ride...How could I say no to this face?It was actually a nice little drive around our area. I took a road I'd not taken before and it was pretty scenery and we saw a fox and several deer.Good to see that the mail was being delivered because sometimes in crummy weather it isn't.

{"title": "Tanner's Eye-Opening Visit", "date": "Thursday, January 21, 2010", "text": "Its been about six weeks since our 13 year old Golden named Tanner had an \"Intravitreal Gentamicin Injection\" to treat his glaucoma. He has easily cleared the hurdles that have come afterwards and each of his post-op visits to the ophthalmologist has gone well--Today's visit was no exception. He was taken off another medication; we are now down from 6 meds to only 2!! As you can see by the picture taken today there is a change in the appearance of his eye--I am told that these changes are why some owners opt to have the eye removed. But for Tanner, because of his age and other health concerns, I felt strongly that it wasn't the best option for him. I still think he's still a handsome boy!!Tanner was also a bit of a celebrity today at \"The Life-Centre\" where there were \"visiting vets\" who for some reason were anxious to see Tanner's eye--I don't know if it's because this procedure is (maybe?) not done that often, or because it isn't always successful when it is. But I felt like I was in class as the Ophthalmologist detailed his history to everyone. Each of them got to do a little eye exam and his picture was taken as well. Everyone commented on what a handsome and nice dog he is--Afterwards he signed autographs in the lobby and was the envy of the other patients --Of course I was so proud!"},

{"title": "The Game of Fate", "date": "Saturday, January 16, 2010", "text": "I believe in wishing on a falling star, heaven, dreams, and karma. What some call coincidence, destiny and kismet I really believe is fate when lives \"accidentally\" collide and change forever. I think this is what has happened to me so many times in my life. Over the last several months I've been trying to move in the direction of not being involved in the Golden Retriever Rescue. I've spent 10 years volunteering with them, and 4 of those years were as its president. But my life is changing, the rescue is changing, and I really feel that it's time for me to make my exit. Its truly been a life changing experience for us. I tell everyone that \"rescue has broken my heart and touched my soul.\" Of course we will always support the effort of rescue.  I would never turn my back on a dog (or any other animal) that needed help or needed someone.Having said that, it of course goes without saying that I feel a responsibility to find homes for our two foster boys, Maguire, and Hamlet. Some of you may recall Hamlet's story. Pictured in this paragraph, he is about 12-13 years old, and was left behind in the garage of a home that had been foreclosed on. Left without food or water he was very ill and unable to stand when I first saw him. I was asked if I could \"just\" pick him up and take him to a vets office where he could receive overnight care. This is where fate unexpectedly showed up. I just \"happened\" to be going over to where Hamlet was and where he needed to be taken was on my way home...Even my adamancy or determination to not take another foster dog could trump the card that fate had dealt. I was instantly smitten with Hamlet, and it didn't take long to decide that he had a place as a permanent member of our household.Which brings me to Maguire...For some reason, he has been a bit more complicated. I've appreciated everyone's vote and support for him to remain with us. I've been under pressure lately with the rescue to find a home for him. They have helped in this effort by highlighting him on the website and featured him in the latest issue of the newsletter. Then you'll remember that couple in DC that applied to adopt from the rescue with Maguire specifically in mind. Well, their home-visit was completed this week and they have changed their mind about him because of his age--Fate quietly dealt me another card...Today I had Maguire at the vet for his yearly exam and he didn't want to leave my side to be taken for blood-work. When the vet-tech returned, Maguire couldn't get back to me fast enough. I don't really know \"Tracy\" that well but she joked that he was really attached to me, and asked if I was going to keep him--Was Fate, the dealer, asking me if I needed yet another card?After the vet visit, Maguire and I drove to Wendy's and shared a cheeseburger and fries (I didn't share the Diet Coke!) and as I looked into Maguire's sweet-brown eyes, I told him what you and he have probably known all along, and that's that he would be staying with us. Fate has dealt me enough cards! I know that there are some that say I am \"not playing with a full deck\" and while I don't know if this is true or not, what I do know without a doubt, is that I am holding a full-house!"},

Everything is not that pretty right now, but it'll give you an idea...Lovettsville is not a big town...It's about 2 hours from Washington DC and almost an hour from Dulles Airport--I've no idea how many miles that is. In Northern Virginia everyone measures the distance to everything by how long it takes to get there in traffic. I don't know why, we just do. We're also very close to the Maryland border--This is the Potomac River this morning.  Lovettsville does have a few shops, a few places to eat, but no grocery store, which is what it really needs! The busiest place seems to be the 7-11 (below). A new post office is being built right in back of it. The current one is not open that often, so I wonder if the \"new digs\" will encourage the current postal workers to want to work more? New homes are also being built. They seem a bit close together. I wonder why people would move all the way to Lovettsville and then live so close to their neighbors? That was why we moved here--To get away from all the people...Okay, and to have more room for the dogs.We live just out of town on Mountain Road. Mountain Road does have an old stone Methodist church that was built in the late 1800's. They always have the most interesting \"thoughts\" on their sign....One in the fall said \"Fall Leaves, but Jesus Never Will.\" The one they have now (below) is a bit more direct.  Our road is home to several farms.  We have cows that graze across the road from us and the peacocks and guineas sometimes wander into our yard.This is our part of Mountain Road--You can barely see our driveway entrance on the left by the phone pole. Below is the front and back of our house. We have two large fenced areas for the dogs, but we still take them for walks every day. We have a small two story barn too.  I don't go in there much because it's the home to a couple of mice.  I wanted them evicted and even bought the needed \"items\" to get rid of them, but Carl (husband) insisted that they be able to remain.  We all know that they either invite their friends or make new ones, so when that happens, I will be able to gloat and say \"I told you so.\"        Below is the view today from our front porch.  We have a very laid back life that has given us the space we needed and the privacy I was craving. I love living in the country away from the rush of traffic and crowds of people.

I worked every day, and Carl left early each day because of a class. Today I doubt I'm even going to leave the confines of our property!! It's too cold anyway, and that gives me the perfect excuse to not venture out and maybe take a nap later.I do want to thank those of you who left comments about Maguire; they really were a big help and helped me to see in my heart what is best for both of us. I do think I know what I'll do...However, out of some sense of fairness, and my commitment as a foster home, I feel like I need to see this whole thing through with the couple that are interested in him. If Maguire responds to them, and there is a real connection, I will consider letting him go....Stay tuned...I did have an interesting conversation yesterday with one of the employees in the shop where I buy dog food. About 8 years ago, I committed myself to feeding our dogs a good quality and healthy diet. However, in all my efforts to make sure the dogs are getting a good diet, I've totally neglected our cat, CC. I won't tout any brand names here, but only say that I've been feeding her a very well known and popular brand, which is a food that she loves! \"Jon\" told me that the reason why she probably loves it so much is because it's full of carbohydrates and she's probably addicted to them. What?! My cat a carb-addict? Does she need an intervention and rehab program? He told me \"yes\" that at her age of 8, I should probably switch her to something that's a better quality, with very low carbs--So, yes, it was indeed intervention and rehab time for CC. I was given some samples to start her detox...I filled her bowl with one this morning. When I went back a few minutes later, she was sitting on the counter, (where she's fed) and the food was untouched. Determined to not give in to the very hungry cat that was no doubt planning which chair she was going to shred with her claws if I didn't feed her what she wanted, I didn't give in. Another trip back to the kitchen a bit later I found Rudi (looking a tad-bit guilty) with CC's empty bowl on the floor...Do you think that CC deliberately gave Rudi her food in hopes that I'd and fill it with her usual cuisine and also give me a second chance at not having my drapes shredded? Well, it worked, because that's what I did, and CC was very happy about it.  She is now napping on our bed...I know I have to be strong, so we'll try it again later, yeah later..."},
{"title": "A Dog-Dilemma", "date": "Wednesday, January 6, 2010", "text": "In January of last year I picked up a new foster dog named Maguire, who is about 12 years old. He was an un-neutered boy that came in as a stray to a shelter about 2 hours from where I live. He had a tennis ball size cyst on his neck that had ruptured and it was of course infected. I have to say, I've never seen anything like it, and neither had my vet!! If you are curious and have a strong stomach, and want to see what it looked like, here's a link to the shelter's website that still has pictures of Maguire on it and shows the cyst--scroll down to the bottom of their page for the photos, and you can click on them for a \"better view.\"http://www.humanecampbell.rescuegroups.com/animals/detail?AnimalID=1166033Of course because of the size its removal required extensive and reconstructive surgery of his neck. When it was all done, Maguire had staples from ear to ear and I'm not kidding, it looked like a zipper! After several months of recovery, he was as good as new!Maguire was posted on the rescues website to try and find a new forever home for him. He's a gentle, easy going and quiet Golden, that is a very comforting companion. He's not playful, despite our best efforts to get him interested in a tennis ball, rope, etc.. Maguire really just wants to be by your side. He doesn't bark much (just when we get ready to feed him, he'll woof a time or two) but he quietly, and I mean quietly wags his tail; there's no jumping on you when you come home, or getting crazy and excited. He's just laid back and just takes life very slow and easy. I don't think he'd ever been in a house prior to coming to us, so of course we've taught him everything that he needs to know about treats, and he's learned about warm dog beds, (the down-filled dog bed is his favorite!) and from the other dogs he's learned about ripping up soft-toys and what look to give you when he wants a nibble of what we're eating.It goes without saying that I think Maguire is wonderful and Carl and I both adore him! But I've not had many calls about him--Actually, we've had only 2-3 in the last 9 months that he's been available for adoption. Right now there is a couple in Washington DC that has applied for approval for adoption from the rescue, because they are specifically interested in Maguire. Of course I know they may not be a fit for him, but it does bring up a dilemma and all of my emotions...Right now we are approaching a year that he's been with us. I've been on the fence for a few months about just adopting him and making him a permanent member of our family. I think he's genuinely happy and settled in here. He follows me all over the house, and he gets along very well with the other dogs. However I ask myself if I'm being selfish to want to keep him for myself--Maybe he needs a place where he can be more of a \"star\" and not just part of the whole cast of characters in our household--I am really torn...But this morning before I got up, he was standing by the bed quietly wagging his tail and looking at me with those sweet soulful eyes...As I gave him a hug he gave me a tiny lick on my face--Of course my heart melted and I wondered \"how can I turn Maguire over to another family and walk away from him?\""},

We had one college aged patient come in on Tuesday who was 35 minutes late for a 45 minute appointment. Just before she arrived the next patient came and was taken back a few minutes early. But the \"late patient\" argued with me that she should be seen despite being late--A long story short, I tried to accommodate her,with another appointment, etc., but it wasn't good enough...Then we had 2 college boys named Ryan come into the office to have their teeth cleaned--Not so unusual except one came on the wrong day and he was the one that was accidentally seen--We figured that out too and both patients never knew--I blamed it on 2 substitute hygienist and the office manager on vacation.The dogs had a quiet week too. I think they were glad that we went back to work--However Carl was off on Monday and is feeling pretty crummy with a bad cold (that he got from me!). But I think they like being able to sleep their days away rather than feeling like they have to follow us everywhere.I did take Tanner to the ophthalmologist for his last post-op appointment. There was NO change in his eye pressure and he is now off ALL his glaucoma medications!! Of course we're thrilled!! Because the condition (uveitis) which triggered the glaucoma is chronic, he'll always have to be on eye medications to prevent it from happening to the \"good eye.\" But being down to 3 medications instead of 6, and only having to spend about $35 instead of $240 is good news for our wallet too!! When I got home I left Tanner outside while I went in to let the other dogs out. When I came back, I couldn't find him. He always stays close to the house, but I didn't see him in his usual places. I finally found him tangled in some vines--I've no idea what he was doing or where he thought he was going. But I pulled him loose, and he promptly rolled in the snow--I think he was celebrating being free and the good news from the ophthalmologist!

I lost track of how many rolls (yes rolls) of film I've taken the last several weeks trying to get the \"perfect\" picture. Last Saturday during our big snow fall, with a little bit of film left, I took my 35 mm camera out into the yard and I snapped a few pictures of the dogs enjoying the snow. As I was walking back to the house, the dogs were in a line in front of me and a couple of them had laid down in the snow...I snapped this picture...When I saw this picture, I realized that even though it wasn't \"perfect,\" I loved it, and I knew I had the one I wanted to use for our Christmas card. I also remembered a lesson I'd learned when I started taking \"dog pictures\" 10 years ago; which is that if you want a good picture, just let the subjects be themselves and the camera can and usually does capture that."},

After feeding the birds and taking some pictures I noticed Rudi was jumping and playing in the snow, and I thought to myself how fun it was to watch her enjoying herself and I even took a few pictures of her.

I loved everything about it--The food, playing with the dogs, and just hanging out! It could not have been a nicer day at home!Living in the country has really been a learning experience. I've learned that we need to be self sufficient, because we have no neighbors, and it's \"just us.\" We found this out our first summer here in the country when the lights went out. We had no water, no candles, and no batteries or flashlights, and dead cell phones. That only happened once. The next time the lights went out (and they did!) we had everything and more and it went smoothly.We've had the same sort of thing happen with the snow...On Sunday, we had a big reality check!! This is a picture of the top of our driveway, and our reality was, that we needed to dig ourselves out from under the nearly 2 feet of snow so that we could go to work on Monday. Thinking it wasn't a \"big deal\" we had a plan that at the time, didn't seem like it would be too hard to pull off. The plan was for Carl to shovel out the main part of our drive-way by the garage. We figured we would only need enough space for me to back my van out of the garage, drive over to the top of the driveway and then I'd make my run down to the end, and as simple as that, we'd be out! I wish it had been that easy...I quickly got stuck. Not being deterred by this set back, we dug my van out, and tried it again, and again, and again...At four o'clock in the afternoon we were still trying to shovel our way down to the end of the driveway, and my van continued to get stuck. We had made progress and were about 3/4 of the way down the driveway, but it was getting dark and we had to give up and we came back inside, defeated. I will say that the dogs were a great comfort in my discouragement over not being able to dig ourselves out. A couple of them came to me and quietly wagged their tales and put their head on my leg and just looked at me with their soulful eyes...It was much needed and appreciated.In deciding what our next step would be, it was a big help that the Federal Government was closed today (Monday), and we didn't need to worry about Carl getting to work. However, I needed to be at my office to cover for our office manager who was going to be out. Fortunately, the \"new girl\" in our office (you remember, the one who drives me crazy & talks too much) only lives about 10 minutes from me, and I called and got a ride from her--Funny how her high energy and endless chattering about everything didn't bother me on the ride to work and home this evening...Carl finished the job of shoveling the driveway this morning, and we have learned our lesson, the hard way...We will either be purchasing a snow-blower, or hiring someone to plow our driveway in the big snowfalls. My love of and hope for snow-days isn't going to change--I'm already looking forward to the next one, but I'll also be looking forward to not having a morning-after reality check!"},

I know there are people who are complaining about it, and I feel badly for my friend whose son is a Marine and is trying to get home from Quantico for the holidays--But I couldn't be happier about it!The dogs share my opinion about this cold white stuff!! We've had fun today letting them out to play in it. We did have a little bit of drama when I'd taken 3 of the girls who can be off lead and Josh, (pictured here) who is \"okay\" off lead with me to feed the birds. The girls stayed with me and were munching on bird food (they think it's delicious) and I was dumping snow out of the feeders when I heard Josh howling and barking in the woods--In that moment, I realized that I'd forgotten all about him!! I hollered for him to come back and he didn't--I started to panic and Carl who had heard me calling for Josh (actually I think the whole county heard me!) came out and helped look for him. Thankfully our renegade returned from his adventure!! Feeling relieved and \"thanking God\" I have told Josh that he has blown his chance of being off lead like that again!!We are now all warm and settled in for the rest of the day. I've got an apple pie baking and there is scalloped potatoes and ham in the crock-pot for dinner and we're watching movies and the birds outside...I just love snow-days!!"},
{"title": "Too Much for a Monday!", "date": "Monday, December 14, 2009", "text": "It was a long day today! It started with us getting up late, and my being late for work. Added to that we have a new staff member in the office where I work. She is really very nice, and certainly knows her way around a dental office, but she's driving me and a few others a bit crazy because she's so high energy and very very chatty!So at the end of the day it was nice to have some quiet time on the hour-drive home from work. It was a good thing I rested up because one of our senior boys, Cowboy, wandered off in the dark. Fortunately he is about 14 years old, not very fast and so he hadn't wandered too far! It was easy to find him with the help of a flashlight. ~whew!!~ But Sheba who was also running around in the dark returned full of fox-tails in her coat. They were so tangled in her tail that I decided that it was probably best to cut out the ones I couldn't pull out. As you can see, I had to cut out quite a bit of hair...Her tail certainly isn't as pretty as it was, but it'll grow back...eventually... After that job, and feeding the dogs, I went into the garage to get a \"dog-towel\" out of an old dresser we have. Underneath the towel, the drawer was full of stink-bugs!! We got hit with them late last summer and I'm not exaggerating when I say that they covered the side of our house! Of course they would get inside when you opened the door, it was really awful!!! Pesticides don't kill them, it just makes them fly away, and if you're standing there, they get all over you. As a result you just have to learn to put up with them. I did get better towards the end of fall, and would pick-up one (yes, just one!) and toss it out the door--It doesn't do any good to kill them because it just brings up their odor, which is a musky-rotten smell...I read in the paper that they accidentally came to this country from Asia and don't like the cold weather at all and have a hard time surviving it. So I was really glad when the colder weather came and they started to die off; their little corpses are everywhere, especially in our garage. But I continue to find them inside the house too. They do try to survive the winter and will get into anything to stay warm, and they seem to do it in groups--But even though they are moving a bit slower, I wonder if these unwelcome visitors will ever stop showing up. I can only hope...Remind me why I love the country again?? :-)"},
{"title": "Tanner and a Cliche'", "date": "Saturday, December 12, 2009", "text": "When Tanner started seeing the veterinary ophthalmologist early last summer they kept telling me that dogs who had undergone a permanent treatment for glaucoma felt so much better afterwards! They also told me that owners would comment that \"they'd gotten their dogs back.\" Even in my reading about the procedure, I would see this same remark. I have to admit that I kind of found the comment to be a bit cliche' and corny. Well, its been just over a week since Tanner had his \"Intravitreal Gentamicin Injection\" and each day that has past, Tanner has felt better, and I now find myself saying that \"I've gotten my dog back!\" Funny how it no longer seems corny to say this...But I can't deny that he is interacting more with us, wagging his tail more than he has in a long time, and just seems happier. I finally understand what everyone meant by \"getting their dog back,\" because I really have. I didn't know how much pain the glaucoma was causing him and how much it was taking away from his \"quality of life\" until we did this treatment. So because of how Tanner had been acting, I was feeling totally hopeful and cautiously optimistic for his post-op appointment today. I had to wait nearly an hour to be seen but it was worth the wait--Tanner's eye pressure which was almost 50 two weeks ago (which is the equivalent to a migraine headache) is now to low to measure. Needless to say, I am over the moon with this news!! This is what I hoped and prayed for!! It's a great feeling and a huge relief to be over the first hurdle, and to discontinue the use of one of the glaucoma medications! In 2 weeks for our next appointment we're crossing all paws and fingers that maybe it'll be another! On the flip side, it is feeling like winter with high winds, temps at night in the 20's and 30's during the day; burrrrrr....We even had snow one night, and I did my snow dance to keep it coming down! I must have missed a step or two because it stopped...Rats!! I did however get out my heavier coat, found my gloves and scarf. We're slowly getting ready for Christmas, and I got out my Williraye Nativity. I won it on eBay a couple of months ago, and when I set it out, I realized that it obviously needed the Wise Men too. So, I looked on eBay, found them and bought them. I really think when it's all put together, it'll look great!I'm also trying to get my cards done, or is that started? Each year I take a picture of our dogs for the card, and this year, I just can't seem to get a photo that says \"this is it!\" This is a picture that I was considering...But I've taken some today using my 35mm camera (yes I'm still using film on occasion!) and I will have to wait to get them developed on Monday to see if I got the one I'm looking for!Finally, I wanted to let everyone know how much I've enjoyed reading your blogs!! I love your pictures, reading about your families, your four-legged-family members, your preparation for the holidays and your everyday lives!! Thanks for stopping by for a minute to take a peek into mine!"},

It will be short-lived though because it's supposed to warm up and melt today, and we'll be back to the muddy mess--But we will all enjoy it while it's here.I did get a couple of the bird feeders set up during the snowfall and I thought it would take several days before the birds would find them--I was wrong...This morning as I'm writing this there are Chickadees, Juncos, a Wren, Tufted-Titmouse, and a red-headed-woodpecker enjoying breakfast. I do need to get the platform feeder set up for the Cardinals which are also stopping by too. I really enjoy watching the birds from my desk.The dogs loved (LOVED!!!) the snow yesterday and this morning!! Since we have some newcomers that were not here last year, it's hard to know how they will react to it. Maguire loves to eat it, Cowboy loves to roll in it, and Hamlet, as you can see by the picture just tried to keep his eyes open during it.It was a good day for all of us--I made chili in the crock-pot, had a nap, and we watched the movie \"Twilight\" All is well on Mountain road...I took these this morning--Even Tanner (bottom photo) was feeling up to enjoying the snow!"},
{"title": "A Short Cold Week", "date": "Friday, December 4, 2009", "text": "It's the end of a short work week, but a busy one that I got lost in. The weather has been rainy and cold, and the weathermen are predicting snow for Saturday. I love snow and continue to hope that we can get snowed in for a day or two out here in the country! Despite loving snow, I have to admit that I could do without the cold weather. I bought a new thermometer for our fence post because I finally had to stop believing that the old one was right, and it was really 70 degrees! This weekend I'll try to get the bird feeders set up to start feeding the hungry birds, and whatever else shows up. Last year we had a nice variety of birds from Chickadees to an owl. On the ground we had lots of squirrels, and in the springtime we even had a weasel--But we are a few months from spring!Our 13 year old Golden, Tanner underwent treatment for glaucoma on Thursday. He had what's called an \"Intravitreal Gentamicin Injection.\" This is where the antibiotic Gentamicin is injected into the eye, and kills the cells that produce aqueous humor--By getting rid of the fluid that's produced by the aqueous humor, it is supposed to reduce the eye pressure and (hopefully) get rid of the pain that he's been having for the last several months. The tech said he did \"okay\" on the anesthetic, which was my main concern because he has laryngeal paralysis. Today Tanner remains a bit on the wobbly side, and he's very quiet and sleeping a lot. I hope he'll perk up...In 10 days he goes back to the ophthalmologist to check his eye pressure. Until then, he stays on the same medications, plus one--That's six eye medications that he gets at twice daily, two others, three times. I really hope this worked.Hamlet is doing pretty well. I know I've said this several times, but he really is a sweet, easy going and gentle Golden. He is starting to follow me around the house and interacts more with the other dogs. This week was the first time he seemed happy to see me when I got home from work--He was so cute smiling at me, wagging his tail and offering me his paw. I got an e-mail from the rescue asking me about putting him up on the website for adoption. I told them I didn't think that he was ready and needed some time. They seemed to understand that--However I have to admit that I said it mostly because my heart is telling me he should stay..."},
{"title": "Post Thanksgiving Drama", "date": "Friday, November 27, 2009", "text": "Thanksgiving is my absolute favorite holiday! I think I love Thanksgiving because it comes without the stress, hustle, chaos and presents. But I really do love the turkey dinner; all of the sides, and the pumpkin pie is my very favorite! I could actually eat it throughout the year, and do sometimes buy it when I see it at the store. I mentioned this to my Mom several years ago and she told me that she craved pumpkin-pie when she was pregnant with me--So, my loving pumpkin pie must be something I was born with!! :-)I do enjoy cooking. Thanksgiving dinner is a simple meal to prepare and it’s not hard to roast a turkey...But the mess and work for just two people?? I guess this is why I am always grateful when we get an invitation to someone's home for dinner, which is what we did. Today I'm fixing a turkey breast in the crock-pot for us and a few sides to go along with it. In honor of my Mom, I'll make \"5-Cup Salad.\" My Mom, LOVED this but often she couldn't remember what the 5th cup was, and now I'm finding I can't remember all 5 cups either, and have to look up the recipe. I do have to admit that I never really liked the salad much when she was living, but I made it last year in her memory, and actually enjoyed it. I continue to miss her more than I've ever missed anyone--especially around the holidays because there are so many memories... On the flip side we had a rabbit find its way into the fenced part of our yard. The poor thing had all the dogs descend on it and it was screaming. Of course I was screaming too and had Carl get the dogs away. When he picked it up, it was like a rag-doll and wouldn't move--We were both surprised that it wasn't bleeding. Thinking it was a goner, Carl was just going to put it up in the woods to let it die. But I felt responsible for it, and of course we both didn't want it to suffer, so we wrapped it in a towel and set up a crate so I could take it to the vet later. When I went out to check on it about an hour later, the rabbit was up, alert and moving around inside the crate. A little worse for wear as you can tell by the picture, but it seemed okay, so we said our good-byes and let it go. Just after that on our morning walk CarrieAnne rolled in something delicious (to her anyway) in the woods and needed a bath...Add that to an earlier power outage, cold wind and sleeting rain, I think after we've had our post-Thanksgiving lunch, I'm going back to bed!"},
{"title": "Sunny Days of November", "date": "Saturday, November 21, 2009", "text": "I wanted to start by thanking everyone for your comments about Hamlet. He's doing really well, and is adjusting to life in \"the group home\" with no problems. He's really a very sweet and nice Golden. He seems a bit sad at times and doesn't \"smile\" like the other Goldens do, but I'm hoping that soon he'll once again feel joy and happiness as he settles into his life with us, and knows that he's safe.We have had a couple of sunny days this week in Virginia. When the sun is out, I remember why I love the fall. I love the leaves, and the feeling of cool crisp air, and just the overall feeling of the season. Another reason I love it is that the fall wardrobe is so much more me than any other season. I really look forward to the jackets, sweaters, vests, a long sleeve denim shirt, and getting to wear my flannel pajamas! I love them all, and feel comfortable and cozy wearing the layers of sweaters over long sleeves and of course I love warm socks!!On one of the sunny days the dogs and I got out and enjoyed the sunshine. We took a walk up to the field in back of us. I always like seeing all the little bird nests that were hidden in the branches of the trees. It also reminded me that there are some rather large rocks that I want Carl to get and bring down to our house. The rocks are all part of a stone fence that divided the two properties at one time. The wall has long since fallen over, and in the summer you can barely see them. I'd wanted to get them in the spring, but it warmed up pretty quickly, and I always worry about finding a snake or something else equally terrifying!The leaves are now pretty much off the maple tree, and all the other trees too...It's all time I guess because this week we cruise right to Thanksgiving! Today while I was out running errands, one of the local radio stations is playing nothing but Christmas music...Is it really time for Christmas?"},
{"title": "A New Addition!!", "date": "Friday, November 13, 2009", "text": "I've been saying for months that I was \"done\" being a foster home for the Golden Retriever Rescue. I've given the rescue 10 years which included four of them spent as the president. But because of the issues I was having with a board member over Tanner, it made me pretty determined to find another rescue to support. But I guess that fate had another plan this week...I was called on Tuesday and asked about picking up a dog that was at my vet. I had to go and get dog food anyway, and the vets office is right next to the shop where I buy the food--Added to that, the dog needed to be taken to another vets office for overnight care that was on my way home. I was hardly going to be going out of my way. The dog, Hamlet, has a bit of a sad story. He's about 13 years old, and was left and abandoned by his family when their house was foreclosed on. The story from the neighbors is that they had turned him out and he was wandering the neighborhood. The neighbor knew that the house had been foreclosed on, and thought that the family probably no longer wanted Hamlet, so he called Animal Control to come and pick him up. However, Hamlet still had his original collar on with an ID, and Animal Control contacted them. The owner came and picked him up from the shelter. I've found out that in our county that whenever a dog is picked up and the owner is identified, the county bills the owner for keeping them there and any expense incurred--I think they got him back because they didn't want to pay any of these \"extra\" fees. So when they got him back, instead of letting him outside, or finding someone to take him, they put him in the garage and left the house for good. It was several days before someone found Hamlet. He was left in the dark garage with no water or food...He was pretty ill with pancreatitis because he'd eaten trash left in the garage and was of course dehydrated--He'd thrown up the garbage and even part of a plastic fork! When I met him on Tuesday evening, he was so out of it and couldn't even stand or hold his head up. Needless to say, Hamlet's story got to me, and I agreed to foster him. Prayers were answered and by Wednesday evening Hamlet was ready to come to our house! The intros to our crew have gone well, and he's fitting in nicely. Hamlet is feeling much better! He's a typical senior Golden Retriever, easy going and always on the look out for a tidbit of something to eat--All good signs!! I've told several people about Hamlet this week and we all are a bit angry at this family for what they did to him. I just cannot imagine being so callous and uncaring--How could they just leave Hamlet in the garage with no food or water? Did they think that someone may not find him? I will never understand why or how someone would be able to do this--But I've decided it's best that I'm not able to, because that would put me on their level."},
{"title": "Full Speed through Fall!", "date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2009", "text": "Full speed ahead through the fall! It's been warm the last few days, but the cold days are starting to outnumber the warm ones. I love that we've set the clocks back so we can get the dogs out earlier in the morning, but don't like driving home in dark from in the work. I'm constantly looking for deer to jump out in front of me, and I always am grateful when Carl and I get home safely. The leaves are also falling off the trees and a couple of the dogs have loved playing and rolling in them. We have a beautiful maple tree on the side of the house and this year its colors didn't seem as bright as our last 2 falls we've been here, it still had just as many leaves!We officially adopted Tanner (who is about 13 years old & has glaucoma) at the beginning of November. It was just getting to be too much stress dealing with the rescue and the person who approved medical care. \"She\" was on her own ego trip and because we didn't get along, she always had the opinion that she knew the best treatment for Tanner, which was usually the opposite of what the vet and I felt was best for him. It's a positive move to be able to make the decisions for him that I know are best--An interesting caveat is that she resigned from the board of directors of the rescue last week...Thank-goodness!Charlie was also groomed last week, and I think he looks great! I always think I like the shaggy-dog look best, but when he gets his new \"do\" I think he looks really cute! His coat when it's grown is so thick and I know he's hot under it all, even in the cooler temps. I refer to Charlie as \"my little man.\" He is my defender and protector; I've never had a dog that was as loyal as he is, especially to \"just\" me! He came from Old English Sheepdog rescue about 4 years ago. I pulled him for them from a shelter in Berryville. We thought he was a sheepdog mix, and he turned out to be a Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier. I wasn't really that taken by him at first. Charlie is so different than the Goldens because it's all about him, whereas with Goldens, it's all about you. I worked with Sheepdog rescue to try and place him, and after a couple of people said they thought he looked like he \"belonged\" to me, I finally gave in and took another look at the dog that had one blue eye...I've never looked back. I am crazy about him!"},
{"title": "Reflections of Two Years", "date": "Sunday, November 1, 2009", "text": "As usual, I've lost track of time--I don't know where October went. All I know is that before I turned around it was gone and so was all of its precious time it contained. But what is even more mind-boggling is to think of what's happened to us in the last two years. Two years ago in October, we sold our house in Ashburn, and bought our place here on Mountain Road. One week after that, my Mom passed away. Looking back on the last 2 years, it seems like it flew by in a blink. But I have to admit that it's easy to see missed goals, time wasted, and some of life’s other disappointments. It is however just as easy to choose to see the beauty, the blessings, the gifts and the miracles we’ve had during this same time.We have grown to love living where we do, even though I know some think it's out in the middle of nowhere. I grew up around army posts and in neighborhoods full of kids--But the time spent at my Grandfathers while growing up, gave me my love for the country! Moving away from it all was something Carl & I thought about, dreamed about, and prayed about. We pictured it and it finally became a reality. It's hard to fully explain all the things I've grown to love about living where I do. While I have to admit I could have done without the barage of stink bugs this year, being here has taught me to appreciate and see the world in a much different way. I have learned to see the beauty of the trees in all seasons...The rain, and the changing weather...The stars that seem so close in the night sky...The wonder in nature each time we see the deer, the ground hogs and hearing the birds singing and the owls in the wee hours of the morning...I always watch for and enjoy seeing the rabbits that have grown up this summer and live along our property...Watching and discovering all that is here.Most of all I love that we have so much more room inside and out for our dogs! I love their excitement as they bark and run through the woods exploring and smelling and sometimes rolling in what they find. I love how happy and content they seem to be, and how content I feel in being here! While moving here two years ago came at a time when I had just lost my Mom, being here has helped to heal and ease the pain because there is so much life here on Mountain Road!! We are so blessed!"},
{"title": "A \"???\"  Dog Night!", "date": "Friday, October 16, 2009", "text": "The cold weather came and stayed this week! The weather man said that the temps today were 40 degrees colder than they were exactly a week ago (it was 85!!). I've resisted turning on the heat because it's admitting that the warm days are gone and winter is just around the corner. This is a hard time of the year for me. I think it may be because of our days in Alaska. When the weather was like this there, the clouds kept the mountains hidden from view. Everyone waited for them to clear. When they did, it was like curtains opening on a stage and everyone would see for the first time, the mountains tops with snow on them. In Alaska they call this \"termination dust\" because the first snow meant that the miners would lose their jobs and be \"terminated.\" Seeing this was always a bit depressing for me because it was an unmistakable sign that winter was there...I think this is why I hold it off as long as I can and try not to turn on the heat. Last night the temp in the house was 59. I still didn't want to turn on the heat--We were just going to go to bed, right??!! I figured we could just throw on another blanket, and it would be okay. At around 2 o'clock in the morning, I woke up and there were 3 dogs in bed with us, and the cat--I got comfortable and fell back to sleep. Sleep didn't last long because a little bit later Sheba who never gets on the bed was there trying to find a place next to us. She usually sleeps on the floor next to the wall, so I'm sure she was cold--But I just couldn't agree to one more dog in bed with us, so I let Sheba stay and made someone \"volunteer\" to get off--That was hard to do because it was so very toasty and comfy for all of us! I gave in this morning and turned on the heat and made chili."},

{"title": "I'm sucha Grasshopper!!", "date": "Friday, October 2, 2009", "text": "The last few weeks the story of the “Grasshopper and the Ant” keeps tumbling around in my head. I remember the story not because I read it in a book, but because I saw the Disney cartoon. In the cartoon, the grasshopper fiddles, sings, and eats the leaves off trees while the queen of the ants warn him that he'd better prepare for winter too. But the grasshopper continues fiddling and singing. When winter finally comes, the grasshopper becomes almost frozen from the cold. He can no longer play his fiddle. In desperation, he knocks at the tree where the ants live and begs them to let him in. The queen ant gives her “I told you so” speech and ends with “Take your fiddle...” and after the long pause she says “and play!” So in the end, the grasshopper earns the warmth and food of the ants by playing his fiddle. I am reminded of this story because I am like the grasshopper in the story. I am never prepared for winter. I always put off things until the last minute. And, if things don't get done, it's usually okay; I'll do it another time. Because after all, isn't time what there is so much of? However, the older I get, and living here in \"the country\" I'm finding that there doesn't seem to be the time there once was. And with winter quickly approaching I know I need to focus and get things done in order to be prepared...But my grasshopper ways are really hard to overcome, especially when it's so nice outside and the dogs want me to play!"},

Then Tanner who always stays close to the house, decided he was feeling a bit independent and he took off--Rudi & Sheba found and shared \"rabbit-jellybeans\" and CarrieAnne rolled in something & needed a bath--Should I have been surprised when I turned on the hose there was a new ugly bug on the house that kind of creeped me out--But in the midst of my trying to round up everyone I looked over and standing in the middle of the driveway alone was Cowboy looking totally confused as if he was wondering just what the heck was going on--I decided there was no need to wonder what was happening, it was just another day at our house!"},

We're still working on getting our front porch painted. I'm so glad that Carl managed to get the priming done on Friday & Saturday and I have to say that even that was an improvement! Now we just need to decide on which color to paint it. I heard back from the Sullivan family for our foster dog Maguire. I was thankful when they realized that they were not a fit for him. It's easier to have them realize it, than to have to explain it. As for the rest of our life here on Mountain Road, I'm still \"grossed out\" by the bombardment of stink-bugs! This week I had them in my hair, down my shirt, and in my mouth--It was awful. They are covering the front and back of our house, and are buzzing around everywhere.
